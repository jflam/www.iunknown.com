                    <span>I work in the shipping department for a newer Toyota supplier and was intrigued by the way TMMI pulled orders, so I picked up this book on my own. It is a lot of information to digest, but I thought worth it. A lot of times I was laughing as I read because I remember a couple of years ago when everything at my employer was "5S" this, lean that - only they had it all wrong and management's interest fizzled after a couple of months. In the case of our plant manager, thirty years of manufacturing experience puts him at a disadvantage, especially with the concept of producing in small quantities and doing more version changes. I think management should definitely get with this program, because soon it will be what has to happen to be competitive.</span>

                    <span>I recently had a senior executive in my company send me a template for what was labeled an "A-3 form".  He said he wanted all his managers to use the form to map out their proposed projects and processes.  He suggested that we buy a copy of Jeffrey Liker's book to understand it's basis.  I bought and read the book, and found Chapters 13 & 14 particularly helpful in understanding the need and purpose for such a form.  It provided some detailed insight on how to complete the form in a way that it best serves its purpose.  It explained and illustrated the some of the less intuitive aspects such as the "root cause analysis".  Although the book showed the A-3 document in a format labeled PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) and the Toyota form actually sent from my boss was labeled (Plan-Do-Learn), the contents were essentially the same.  For anyone wanting to better visualize their processes and projects quicker, I highly recommend this book to see how Toyota has successfully applied "a picture is worth a thousand words" to their standardized reporting procedure.</span>

                    <span>The is the pinnacle of literary knowledge of "The Toyota Way."  No other book best illustrates the working principles of Toyota's philisophical foundation.  The knowledge derived from this book goes beyond just manufacturing.  The book is enriched with values and core principles that any "good to great" company should or have employed.  The greatest enjoyment from the book, besides the learning, is being able to actually apply and live the Toyota Way.

                    <span>If you read only one book about the Toyota Production System, make it Dr. Liker's "The Toyota Way".  Well researched and well written, it captures the essence of Toyota's business system- a management philosophy of empowering people to achieve a culture of continuous improvement.  It's required reading for our executive clients, and strongly recommended for all business leaders.  A landmark book.

                    <span>This book puts Toyota back where it belongs: front and center in the world of the lean enterprise. The idea that Toyota just originated lean and that others have since taken it further is a fallacy that has lately been creeping into publications and conference presentations. The reality is that Toyota is still far ahead and that the vast majority of companies that claim to be lean are only "kinda, sorta" lean, with managements that simply have not understood the approach.
<br />
<br />The book has a visible structure that the reader can use to zoom in on topics of interest. Fourteen principles are stated upfront, and then a chapter is devoted to each of these principles. The writing is clear, and many outside sources are acknowledged with a thoroughness that is uncommon in business books. In particular, 28 Toyota executives are acknowledged or quoted, which gives the book the flavor of an authorized rendition of the company's philosophy.
<br />
<br />The book's greatest strength, the closeness of the author to the company's management, is also its main limitation. As an academic, the author could have assumed a less worshipful stance. For example, rather than taking management statements about wanting to do right for society as a whole at face value, he might have pointed out that they sound like obligatory recitations of Confucian values, and that it is arguable that flooding the world with cars is in the best interest of the human race. Also, without attacking the company, he could have made its portrayal more nuanced and vivid by including more points of view, such as those of line workers and former employees who may have a different perspective than current top managers. 
<br />
<br />The executives quoted in the book clearly feel that the philosophy is more important than the technical tools of the production system. This insight, however, has come to them as a result of using the tools intensively for many years, and the reader should not be misled into thinking that it is possible to bypass the tools and go straight to the philosophy. 
<br />
<br />I also have a few minor quibbles with the way the book is produced. The fourteen chapters covering the fourteen principles have numbers that don't match those of the principles, so that, for example, Principle 6 is covered in Chapter 12. This is confusing when looking up cross references. The subject of this book also calls for abundant illustrations, but there is only one for every seven pages, and no photographs. Finally, I think that the use of long words where short ones would do should be identified as the 9th category of waste. We don't need to hear about a "paradigm," As Tom Wolfe's hero in "A man in full" points out, the only thing it ever does is shift. Saying "non-value-added waste" where "waste" would suffice also strangely suggests that there might be an opposite called "value-added waste."
<br />
<br />All this being said, this book is a good read based on intimate knowledge. I recommend it to anyone involved with lean, and particularly to managers and engineers in the auto parts industry who want to sell their products to Toyota.
