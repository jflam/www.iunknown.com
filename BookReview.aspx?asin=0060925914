                <span id="Label1">Former All Star Keith Hernandez teaches even the most learned fan a thing or two about baseball with his unparalleled insight into all aspects of the game, from the action in the bullpen to the positioning on the field to the plays at the plate.<P>Praise for <i>Pure Baseball:</i> <P>"We have never seen the game scrutinised with such care and detail.Hernandez provides commentary on two ball games in the 1993 season : a Philles-Braves match-up and an extra innings battle between the Tigers and the Yankees. [He] examines the overall strategies of the game and offers good analyses of fielding techniques, base stealing, lineups, umpiring etiquette, double-steal rundowns, hit-and-runs, signals, infield shifts and more.  His most intense and incisive analysis, however, is saved for the psychology of the pitcher-hitter duels.  No matter where you are watching, you will never again see the game in the same way."<br>-- <i> Playboy</i><P>"Keith Hernandez, it turns out, is even smarter than we thought he was in the Mets' glory years. All the subtleties of baseball are revealed as the two games unfold.  Mr. Hernandez's  opinions and pet-peeves--intentional walks, early-inning sacrifices, throwing fastballs to prevent stolen bases, large gaps in the outfield, pitchers who 'nibble. nibble, nibble,"--are well thought out and clearly articulated. [He] is particularly strong in analyzing the cat-and-mouse game played between pitchers and hitters as the count shifts the odds back and forth."<br>--  New York Times Book Review</i> <P>"An MVP of a guide to the national pastime from savvy 17-year veteran of the major leagues who remains an ardent fan in retirement.  Hernandez came up with an angle that works to near perfection: tellingly detailed start-to-finish accounts of two games played midway through the 1993 baseball season."<br>-- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>(starred)</span>

                    <span>Easily the best baseball education in print that I've ever seen.  It's like taking a master's course in baseball.  You have an opportunity to almost sit down with a major leaguer and say "Teach Me" and he does.  Keith has a bit of a weakness as far as pitch sequencing and understanding missed spots, but they are not particularly glaring.  His understanding of counts, and situations outside of the count (inning, score, particular players involved etc..) are exemplary.  Any serious ballplayer's dream.</span>

                    <span>It takes time and patience to read this book. The title says "Pitch by Pitch for the Advanced Fan," and it means it literally. Hernandez talks about what goes through a player's mind during a game. His descriptions of how a batter thinks about an at-bat are priceless. It takes a while to plow through all this stuff - there's a *lot* of detail - but if you do you'll have a deeper knowledge of the little in-game strategies and decisions that make baseball so special.</span>

                    <span>If ever there was a necessary baseball book, this is it!!  I reread it every season (as does at least one other reviewer) and always learn something more from doing so.<p>I have taken Mr. Hernandez' advice and always turn off the sound when watching a game on TV.  I find it to be a major improvement and I'm no longer distracted by the content-free, pointless remarks made by most announcers.<p>Frankly, judging from the mental errors common to the game today, it should be required reading for each and every player from the rookie leagues to the bigs.<p>If you're not a serious student of the game, then maybe you should pass on this one!!</span>

                    <span>I'm a huge baseball fanatic and I *love* reading detailed anlaysis of baseball strategy and tactics.  But even this book was too tedious for me.  And I've almost never read a baseball book that I found too tedious.  Hernandez, although very knowledgeable, dwells too much on each pitch.  The reader might think the title is a metaphor for detailed analysis (pitch by pitch).  No, it means *exactly* what it says.  Hernandez discusses EACH pitch.  At first the analysis is interesting.  Then you realize you're a third of the way through the book and he's *still* talking about whether the next pitch will be a curve or a slider, or whether this particular left-handed hitter should be thrown a change-up, or whether the pitcher should challenge the batter with his superior fastball, or whether the pitch should be low, or high, or out of the strikezone.  Enough already!  As far as baseball strategy goes, this book is 90% about pitch selection and batter analysis.  There is not too much discussion of the other elements of baseball.  So if you're looking for a wider variety of baseball discussion, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I never knew how much I was missing during a game.  Even with twenty years of baseball experience, I learned much about the game after reading Pure Baseball.<p>Based on two games played in 1993, one in the American League and one in the National, Pure Baseball is a pitch-by-pitch analysis that scrutinizes every decision made.  This is not just a replay of two games; it's a text on just about every offensive and defensive strategy in baseball.  Known for his insight on and off the field, Keith Hernandez's knowledge of the game flows from the pages.<p>What modern day baseball writer (other than, perhaps, George Will) would devote several pages to the importance of hitting the cutoff man?  The consequences of not executing the proper defense on a long double are detailed.  Many baseball commentators claim that the "little things" win baseball games.  Positioning the infield and outfield, holding runners on first and pickoff moves are more important than one might think.  Mr. Hernandez's attention to the arcane details of the game is what really drives this book. <p>The most interesting part of Pure Baseball is the explanation of the hit-and-run.  The hit-and-run is probably the least understood concept in baseball.  Mr. Hernandez believes that "the in's and out's of the hit-and-run go to the heart of baseball strategy, and you have to understand them to understand the game."  The author got my attention with this sentence.  No fewer than nine pages are devoted to this subject, and I would have liked to see more.  Since I now understand the strategy behind the hit-and-run, it's easier to match wits with the manager when the leadoff runner reaches first base.<p>This is a great book.  If you're an aspiring coach or just want to understand more about baseball, you can't go wrong here.  Save some money when you go to the ballpark, buy a scorecard rather than that third beer.  When you start bringing your own scorebook that counts balls and strikes, Keith Hernandez will say you've really made it to the bigs.  As a fan, of course.</span>
