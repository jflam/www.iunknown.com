                    <span>I first came across "Age Wave' as a footnote in an insurance flyer.  Something made me want to read it.  It had to be ordered it since it was hard to find, but I am so glad that I followed my gut instinct.  I have  read, reread, highligted, bookmarked and folded over corners in my at least  seven times through it.  The reality has become such an integral portion of  my life that I left my position with an insurance agency to do what I  really feel is important -- to educate people and TRY to make them  understand the importance of long term care insurance to protect our  parents, ourselves, and our children.  I have never in my life been an  activist (during Viet Nam I was in a "coma"), but after having  read Age Wave, I have become an activist. I agree that this can be a more  devastating situation than any in our age or any preceeding.  Ken Dychtwald  and his wife are Renaissance people in putting all of the inevitabilities  of the modern technologies that we embrace in perspective.  What they are  trying to tell us, without a doubt, is that we have to cover our butts or  "get out of Dodge."  The wonderful world that our parents and we  as "Boomers" have tried to to build will not last unless we get  rid of the denial that people do age and need care and it is not always  available.  We cannot hide money any longer to qualify for Medicaid. We  cannot expect the government to pay for it.  The governmet has already told  us that. We cannot expect our children and grandchildren to pay 50 to 60 %  of their paychecks for entitlements so that we can ignore needed protection  or hide money.  We need to be responsible once again in our lives and  accept the fact that we will age, and will develop chronic illnesses  because of advanced age and we will need care.  So we must protect our  world and our heirs from the devastating effects.  I can't wait to read the  new book.</span>

                    <span>Age Wave is really a classic, well-written book that covers all kinds of subjects on aging.  The graphics that show the changes in demographics in the U.S. may be worth the book's price alone.  One section that talks about  how we now play and rest more than we used to was clearly written before  the downsizing trend began.  But, for the most part, the comprehensive  coverage of work, play and all the rest expected in retirement is presented  in a consise, easy-to-read style.  It is truly a classic, well-written book  that should be a good read for anyone interested in retirement and aging  issues.</span>
