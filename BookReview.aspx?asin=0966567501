                    <span>I was at the Outdoor Expo and was looking at a much smaller book, for half as much money...It was the only one I saw (and they were very numerous) on the many trails Arizona has to offer.<BR>Well I passed it by, and told myself on the way out I would probably buy it, well I am glad I waited, I stopped by the booth and noticed one large book at the end of the table...it was the last one, and was 3 times as much. After about 4 pages, I shelled out the cash with a smile on my face! This book has it all. Very, very well detailed, with maps, directions, history, flora , fauna, wildlife, stories on ghost towns and past characters of local legend. What I really liked though was all the COLOR pictures...giving me an idea of what I WILL find when I travel these trails. This book also has much information on what kind (s) of 4WD you will need for what trails, levels of difficulty...things to watch for, what depth of water at the crossings to expect....and well organized to boot. The cover is heavy duty , so it will last bouncing around in the back. This book is great and I love it! If you have a 4WD and are looking for a little adventure and fun from easy to difficult and you are doing it in Arizona..........you need this book. See you on the trail!</span>

                    <span>I've taken about a dozen of the trails in this book and not one has been disappointing. The author's credentials speak for themselves. He's logged thousands of miles in Arizona. All the GPS coordinates are accurate and the directions are second to none. I would recommend this book to anyone.</span>

                    <span>I really like the fact that this book differs from so many others in that the directions are easy to follow. It is designed for the average person interested in driving back county trails, not only for the "hard-core" four-wheeler. The book is user-friendly.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book becasue I wanted to use the new Jeep Wrangler I bought to explore areas of Arizona that most other people don't see. This book is tremendous in that it provides great detail in terms of level of difficuly, scenic beauty, history, and wildlife for a wide variety of locations throughout the state. <P>This past weekend, we explored the Parker Canyon Lake and Coronado National Monument areas and the book was invaluable. These locations were just incredible and I suspect that this book will provide a number of other interesting destinations for years to come for me and my family.<P>Thanks for the work done by all the contibutors to this book. Very well done. Look forward to additions to this tome in the future.</span>
