                    <span>This writing was quite interesting.  Dr. King as we all know was a great man and leader.  In this writing he points out a great way to look at the world, and all human beings within this world.  Throughout this writing he speaks of God and how God is the way.  A very enlightening piece of reading.</span>

                    <span>I have used this book in Leadership Training for years.  Recently I used it at Gindiri College of Theology in Nigeria. The huge 250 pound student body president said it caused him to weep, thinking about repentance. This was one of the only books graduating senior received this year, because the cost of books is such a high % of their annual income.<br>In the US, white High School students have returned years later to say this small book changed their thinking and understanding of who Dr. King really was. Mine too. Thanks</span>

                    <span>What an amazing man. King writes with such love for humanity and such  desire for an improved society. Though I am not religious, I am very  engaged by his discussions of faith. It is this thesis of the role of  humanity and the notion of how precious life is that draw me to this book  every few months for inspiration.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great way to get back in touch with youself as a spiritual and meaningful human being. Many of MLK Jr.'s speeches are so popularized that they often leave his other great works in their shadow. This is one of "those other" great works. Definitely worth the cost.</span>
