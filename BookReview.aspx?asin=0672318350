                <span id="Label1">To be an ordinary programmer is one thing: You need only learn how to interact with the computer on its own terms, creating buttons and combo boxes that have no significance away from the screen. To be a game programmer--particularly one that writes games with environments that appear three-dimensional to their players--is something else entirely. Such work requires that the flat screen simulate the real world, complete with light, shading, texture, gravity, and momentum. It's all quite complicated. <I>Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus</I> helps its readers make great progress in creating 3D worlds and the action that goes on in them.<p>  That this large, dense book manages to explain how to design and implement a 3D game while neither glossing over too many details nor swamping the reader with trivia is a credit to author Andr&#233; LaMothe. He opens by showing (and explaining) the C++ source code of a simple but full-fledged 3D spaceflight shooter game--a real boost to the reader's confidence. From there, he explains the complicated geometric concepts and mathematics that underlie realistic games (always with an eye toward software algorithms) and shows how to use the many APIs and libraries (including Microsoft DirectX 9.0) that make the world-builder's job easier. Make no mistake: Designing and building convincing games with 3D visuals and behaviors that convincingly approximate real-world physics is hard work. In this book, LaMothe helps you get it done and enjoy the process. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to design and build 3D worlds and the goings-on within them. Aside from mathematics and geometry, this book focuses on wireframe models, shading, rendering, and animation. Microsoft DirectX 9.0 gets special attention.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book cover to cover and I find it to be LaMothe's best work. The demos alone are amazing, pure software, but yet run in real time. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn the math behind writing 3D engines and anyone that want's to learn from an expert coder of 3D engines the tricks of the trade to make 3D engines without the use of acceleration hardware. Additionally, whomever posted the "nowhere" post is obviously a jealous programmer or competing author. Many of the reviewers have posted their emails, I suggest that anyone that wants to ask other reviewers simply email the people. I hate people that waste time putting up completely useless and obviously vidictive posts without any tangible points to make other than their own obvious attempts at slandering the author. 
<br />
<br />This book rocks, if you don't think so, pick up a copy at the local bookstore and read it there. Also, there are a number of excerpts here that you can review as well.

                    <span>The major majority of the 5 star reviews on this book appear to all be written by people who have only reviewed only this one book on Amazon.com.
<br />
<br />This to me makes it abundently clear that the author, of whom I happen to have read books from before, is clearly getting his "buddies" to write 5 star reviews so he can cash in on what is obviously a thrown together book.
<br />
<br />This sort of behavior of "false" reviews shows poor ethics and business practices and I am now honestly considering to never buy anything with the name "LaMothe" on it ever again.</span>

                    <span>Want to create a cool 3D-based computer game? This book will help you become a great 3D game programmer. This book went to a great length to give you a solid knowledge on 3D game programming. The author of this book puts in great effort and many pages on explaining 3D programming clearly as possible. Because he wants reader to become the next generation professional 3D game programmer. I like his style of writing and its easy to follow and understand. I highly recommend this book on gaining knowledge on 3D game programming. Andre LaMothe is the pro in 3D game programming. </span>

                    <span>Well, let me explain my 3.  The book is great and I love LaMothe's writing style.  I'm also more a mathmatician than I am a programmer so I really enjoyed almost all of it (most 3D Books tell you how to program something without you having a clue what it's doing, very frustrating).  All in all it's a really good book.
<br />
<br />Though it lacks compared to TOTWGPG in that, it skips out completely on implementation in hardware, which was frustrating since finding a good source of cohearsing DirectX to do what you want is hard to come by, especially in this "Managed" day-and-age.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, in short, great for understanding the math for some beginner to advanced techniques, but definetely not the only one to have on your shelf if you actually plan to program anything.</span>

                    <span>This book could be improved by the following:
<br />
<br />use devcpp for win lusers and include it on the book cd - it's free
<br />
<br />make sure code works on gcc in linux 
<br />
<br />use sdl - then the code will work on linux and the other oses 
<br />- sdl is free - why use directdraw54 and directinput90abc? that wont work for linux or mac users.
<br />
<br />assembly code should use nasm instead of vc - nasm is free
<br />
<br />use blender for 3d models - free
<br />
<br />whoaaa - mmx or sse...
<br />where's the 3dnow? maybe the author is getting money from intel below the table but most people i know have amd rigs we want to know about 3dnow - why the intel loving? (update the book to include 3dnow)
<br />
<br />With all of the above changes we would've had a completely stand alone book with fully working compiler, 3d tools, etc.  That would've been awesome.</span>
