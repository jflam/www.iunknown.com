                <span id="Label1">Does your work matter? Do you transform mundane tasks into "WOW Projects!"? And, most important, do you consider projects "dynamic, stimulating, a major bond builder with co-workers, a source of buzz among end-users, and ... inspiring, exhausting, hot, cool, sexy, where everyone else wants to be"? If not, consider reading this enthusiastic project primer, which joins  <I>The Brand You50</I> and <I>The Professional Service Firm50</I> in Tom Peters's list-filled <I>Reinventing Work</I> series.<p>  Stressing the importance of following a project from start to finish, Peters breaks the WOW Project (also known as the "Way Cool" project, by the way) into four stages--create, sell, implement, and exit--and 50 lists. No. 24 (titled "Work on BUZZ ... <I>all</I> the time!")  recommends making a stir about the "WOW-worthy project," showing off your team's success with buttons, mugs, and T-shirts. Shameless?  Perhaps. But if the project is truly worthy, then "parading your team's spunk is a matchless sales/marketing--not to mention morale-building--ploy."<p>  Peters--who communicates in lists, one-word sentences, bold, capitalized, and half-tone text, parenthetical asides with jumpy punctuation, and more than a few interjections of "WOW!" and "Way cool!"--is not for everyone. Mellow readers may want, instead, to check out Eric Verzuh's  <I>The Fast Forward MBA in Project Management</I>. But project managers seeking to shake up mundane assignments will find plenty of original, easy-to-implement ideas in this guide to getting things done. <I>--Rob McDonald</I></span>

                    <span>When you learn to use this little book you can turn nasty little jobs into opportunities that are rewarding. Sounds like the same old words but it sure doesn't feel like "the same old" when you get it to work the first few times. It MAGIC and it makes your project fun, manageable, and they are all set up for further correction and deeper development. <br>I used to hate making some business telephone calls and after I defined the project and found the WOW in it, it became O.K and then went on to be one of my strengths and I'm making friends on the telephone now and have doubeled my income. This is powerful and Tom Peters is to big a part of our business evolution to not have as a traveling companion as we become more and more part of the global brain.</span>

                    <span>Tom Peters is an ex-McKinsey & Co. consultant, who become a management guru by being the co-author of business super-bestseller 'In Search of Excellence' (1982). He has written several books after that huge success, but nothing has come close in quality. This (little) book is part of his 'Reinventing Work' series.<p>The aim of this book is to make us "believe that work can be cool. That the work matters." The reason? "Work - yours and mine - as we know it today will be reinvented in the next ten years." Perhaps you believe this, but I do not. Yes, we can make work and, in this case, projects more interesting. Tom Peters comes up with a list of 50 ways how to do this. The list is split up in four parts: (1) Create; (2) Sell; (3) Implement; and (4) Exit. Each of the 50 ways raised consists of a short introduction, the main point ("the nub"), the impact, and some examples and quotes. Most of the 50 ways are quite interesting, but they could have been cut down to some 25.<p>I always feel disappointed when I have to write a negative review, but this time I have no choice. Tom Peters is a famous management guru and an excellent motivational speaker. I feel that he tries to bring his famous energy from his seminars across by using plenty of capitals, wild colors, abbreviations, and exclamation marks. But it just does not work (for me). There are some interesting points, but he would have been better by producing a video of his seminars or writing a proper book - like 'In Search of Excellence' (1982) - on projects. For people interested in projects and project management there is plenty of choice elsewhere. Although the book is small and consists of only 200 pages, the book is not that simple to read due to its format and structure.</span>

                    <span>We are in the age of manufactured enthusiasm.  How anyone can imagine that regular work in a business should be stimulating to the point of being really really cool is simply beyond me.  Yet year in and year out, Tom Peters (and an immense cohort of lesser talents) continue to tell us that yes, work can be fun and cool, etc etc.  And he continues to make the really really big bucks doing so. <p>Either Peters is onto something, or we are all fools for treating him like he is.  What I believe is that he has inserted himself into business speak as one of our principal formulators of vocabulary to dress up our normal drudgery as something more than it is.  <p>Peters pumps businessmen up, flatters their vanities, and sends them back to the real work with a new vocabulary of "change agents," "WoW projects," and innumerable other expressions of similar banality.  He tells them that what they are doing is significant and interesting, and that they can make every project into a fantiastical thing that will change the workd as well as enhance their careers.  This boggles the mind, particularly if you have read it more than once in such puffed up venues as Fast Company and Wired, which I believe bring the the profession of journalism to the crudest boosterism, akin to the promoters of primitive Western cities in the 19C America.<p>In Project 50, Peters offers "fifty ways to transform every `task' into a project that matters."  They range from "reframing" the task as it was posed (make it revolutionary) to selling it succinctly ("metaphor time!") to implementing it ("celebrate failure"!! as a learning experince and as a useful exercise of thinking "crazy") to Exiting ("Seed your freaks into the mainstream"!).   If this does not want to make you vomit, try reading it straight through.  Doesn't it make you cringe?<p>And yet.  <p>In my education work with managers whom I sincerely admire and who are undoubtedly highly intelligent and savvy, they gobble this stuff up and use it.  While they disdain much of the ridiulous in Peters' vocabulary (the "nub", etc.), they find it profitable to discuss these ideas and it inspires them to change.  Thus, I must conclude that there is something is all this hype, something useful that gets pulled out and applied.  I just wish that it didn't seem so trivial and silly, so over the top for people who consider themselves writers.  I saw a group of extremely bright people wave this book like it was Mao's Red Book durin the cultural revolution.  It was stupefying.<p>So I must say:  this book is useful.  I make money from it too.  And it changes behavior, at least in the activities that I have seen as an education professional.  Thus, I must recommend it with a grain of salt.  Don't get carried away, but don't have too closed a mind either.</span>

                    <span>I must say that this book is packed with insightful tips on how to truly create "WOW!" work.  Peters is truly adapt at bringing successful theories into every day practices that can be implemented to succeed.<p>However, I did feel that this probably could have stopped at 20 or 25?  It seemed that the books was continually stocked full of lists of things to do.  If Peters truly wants to have his practices/theories implemented, he is going to have to break it down to maybe the top 10.  Make one or two TTD at the conclusion of the book.<p>Overall, I feel that the reader will leave with useful information, and with a slight feeling of being overwhelmed.</span>

                    <span>Tom Peters explains how to develop "Wow!" projects - projects that are significant, revolutionary, exciting and dramatic. He claims that all companies are going in the direction of using projects as their fundamental work unit. The key to success is knowing how to create, sell and implement your projects and then how to exit to your next project. The book is devoted to these four steps. Peters offers 50 key tips on how to develop and launch these projects. This idea-packed, easy-to-read book is written in breezy, short, to-the-point sentences. Peters often uses the "!", which he has adopted as his symbol. His jazzy style underlines his message: Throw aside traditional thinking and accept the new. This approach also makes this book, like his other recent books written in this style, fun to read, although the information he presents is quite serious and powerful. We [...] highly recommend this book to everyone in business - from clerks to top executives.<br /></span>
