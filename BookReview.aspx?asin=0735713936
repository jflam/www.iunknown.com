                <span id="Label1">Mac OS X is quickly winning back the ground Apple lost in the 1990s, with its Unix underpinnings (bulletproof and versatile) and its graphical user interface (the best on the market by far). <I>Mac OS X Killer Tips</I> is like its subject in that it's both stylish and rich in features. In fact, almost all the fat that typically pads books about software has been pared away, leaving only the material that would populate the sidebars and icon-tagged tips in a traditional book. The tips, carefully laid out with full-color illustrations, make interesting reading regardless of whether you're skimming, reading straight through, or using the index to locate tips that are relevant to a particular part of Mac OS X.<p>  A typical tip is about 200 words in length--about as long as this capsule review--and gets straight to the point about some detail of Mac OS X (some tips document features that are less well known than others). Sometimes, the fact being revealed is nothing more than a keyboard shortcut (such as the one for putting a machine to sleep quickly). Other tips cover more involved procedures (the one for bringing back the Trash can--missing by default from the Mac OS X desktop--is an example). Scott Kelby knows his Mac--he edits a Mac magazine--and though there could be more about the Unix side of things, you're sure to learn a new trick from the several hundred nuggets of knowledge he's packed into this book. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to get the most out of Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). Tips explain little-known features of iLife, iTunes, Sherlock, and the Mac OS X core software.</span>

                    <span>I have used a Mac since 1984 and Mac OS X since it was public beta. However, I don't always have the time to figure out all the little time saving tips on my own. I learned several tips from this book that I now use on a daily basis. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be more productive with Panther!</span>

                    <span>This book is not on the same level as the Visual Quickstart Guides that come from Peach Pit Press, but in some ways it is better. This title from New Riders Publishers (but still distributed through Peach Pit Press) is MUCH smaller at only 300 pages, but it also has less information in it because much of the interface it dedicated to graphics showing pictures of the various apps and utilities discussed in the book.<P>Having said that, this book is extremely well laid-out and written. It IS the kind of book that you can curl up with in front of the fireplace with. No, seriously. There are just so many cool tidbits in this thing that it becomes difficult to put down. If you pick it up at all, you can't simply look up the one question you were thinking about because you immediately get distracted by the other things you see while trying to find your answer. More than once, after spending 10 minutes looking at tips, I have ended up closing the book only to realize that I never actually got around to looking up my original question, and so I go back, promising myself to only focus on the one thing I need to learn.<P>However, for a geek like me, it doesn't take long to get through it all. Now when I grab it, it's more like "Oh, ya, I remember that one." ...and so, it now spends most of it's time just sitting on my shelf. Ah, well, maybe it is time to pass this one on to someone else... oh, wait! I just found something new. Nevermind!</span>

                    <span>I just purchased this book after reading the other review for this book. I expected that I'd learn at least something from it, but found that the Killer Tips were actaully largely straight-forward configuration options (that you can find out by just clicking on Preferences for the various apps).<P>If you're a brand new Mac user or really don't like to spend at least a little time getting familiar with the new OS on your own, maybe the book would help. But I couldn't pawn this book off on a friend who's had his Mac for 3 days, so I suppose it depends. Killer Tips, they are not.<P>I wish they had that "Look Inside" option for this book because you could then get an idea of whether the book would help you out. For me, it's a quick return.</span>

                    <span>I purchased (and devoured with enthusiasm) Scott Kelby's previous iteration of Killer Tips (version 10.2 Jaguar). I was not familiar with OS X (or 10.2 for that matter) when I got it and it proved to be a terrific way for me to get immediately up and running. And reading it a second time gave me Mac skills that amazed my fellow Apple aficionados.<BR>When I upgraded to OS 10.3 Panther I didn't really think that I needed this new Killer Tips... imagining that Kelby only added a few items to bring it up to date for Panther. So, I was browsing the Mac shelves for something different on Panther this time. But, when I took a curious look through Kelby's new book I was totally surprised. It wasn't a mere update... it featured hundreds of new tips. And some interesting twists to previous tips, too. So I bought it and read it and am just as impressed with this one as the last. Excellent sequel, Mr. Kelby!<BR>P.S. Please take this as an endoresement of his tips only. I wouldn't want to be accused of endorsing his sense of humor! (Beware, groans are guaranteed.)</span>
