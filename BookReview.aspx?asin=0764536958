                    <span>With this latest edition of Professional Photoshop, Dan Margulis has finally become user-friendly. This book is for anyone, amateur or pro, who has already gained a basic fluency with the Photoshop interface, but wants to understand HOW to make decisions about color correcting. Many authors give us the step-by-step technique for a particular image problem. Margulis teaches us what questions to ask about any image we have in front of us before we start yanking on curves, or calling up Auto Color in desperation. He goes on to provide many alternative answers, teaching us why one method might work with one image, while another method might be better for a different situation. <P>From plate blending, as old as channels, to rescuing images using false profiles, something quite new, anyone willing to take the time to read Margulis' book carefully will find their frustration level dropping as they go on to restore and enhance their photos with greater success than ever before. By adding the "why" to the "how-to," Margulis gives us the concepts that are the foundation for image editing.</span>

                    <span>Ignore the 1-star reviews! This book rocks!! This book is truly about professional level Photoshop. That means that it really deals with issues pertinant to the majority of WORK that gets published in print. If you don't do any work that ever gets printed then don't bother with this book. Far from being a dinosaur, Dan is very up-to-date with the latest techniques for dealing with color... just don't expect to see much in the way of color management, spectrophotometers and printing rips. That material is outside of the scope of a Photoshop book as it relies on other software. If you're looking for a book on Color Management get the excellent "Real World Color Managment". However, for a book on creatively manipulating color in Photoshop you can't get a better book than "Professional Photoshop" by Dan Margulis. The other, highly touted book "Photoshop Color Correction" by Michael Kieran is largely a pale copy of Dan's work with some material about ColorSync color managment added for political correctness. This is a decent book but you're better off with the original by Dan. The chapters on Curves, B+W, Luminosity blending and "false profiles" (a technique that Dan invented) are much better in Dan's book and the illustrations show the effects much better. As far as color management goes, Dan's position has softened a bit over the years but the reader should understand that this book is more about creatively manipulating color for the best possible reproduction NOT tracking a fixed color rendering from input to output (again, see "Real World Color Managment" for that).</span>

                    <span>This is a great book and would get 5 stars except for the fact that the author basically states, that he is only going to address working in the cmyk field because thats the way its traditionally been done. Get over it, move on, when dealing with digital tradition is dead-RGB is in wide use too. Still for overall theory and heavy duty learning this is still a great book.</span>

                    <span>After a trying a bunch of other books, this was the one that totally changed the way I worked in Photoshop and taught me the most, but it's very difficult and highly technical. If you're the type that can wade through that kind of stuff, the concepts are golden. It isn't a text to learn Photoshop, though--it's written to help only with the very specific narrow area of dealing with color correction.</span>

                    <span>I've been using Photoshop since 1991. It's my bread and butter. I've read through at least 10 Photoshop books and this is by far the best one. I've even worked for one of the major computer book publishers and I have to say that as nice as that companies books were, they still don't even touch Margulis's books on Photoshop. WARNING: this book is NOT for the novice, and it is difficult to read. But it is worth it! I would estimate that 50% of all Photoshop books are crap, another 40% are good for novices, another 9% are good for intermediate users, but Margulis's book is part of that rare 1% of Photoshop books that is good for both Intermediate and uber-pros. This is the one book every professional user of Photoshop should own!</span>
