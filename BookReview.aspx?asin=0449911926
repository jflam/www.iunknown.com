                    <span>Dr. Peale begins with a lesson on listening to God in "creative silence", that in a worship atmosphere, a person can tap into God's thoughts and overcome the challenges of life. Bringing a spirit of expectancy is important if one is to achieve the desired results.<br>"...faith is the contact point with God's power" he tells us on page 12. He says a friend gave him a working definition of a competent church service, "The creation of an atmosphere in which a spiritual miracle can take place" (p. 12).<br>Dr. Peale reminds us of a theme found in a lot of his writings, one worth emphasis. He tell us to "supplant destructive thoughts with good ones, diseased thoughts with healthy ones" (p. 32).<br>Another one of his themes that he includes in this book has to do with the power of the mind to create. "There is a deep tendency in human nature to become like that which you image yourself to be" he quotes a psychologist as saying (p. 47).<br>Faith, confident assurance in God, releases powerful help on your behalf.<br>We're reminded of the power of the unseen in his description on page 82, "your life, or mine, is not determined by outward circumstances, but by the thoughts that habitually engage the mind." As a man thinks so he becomes.<br>He has such a powerful way of expressing truth. Consider the statement he makes on page 84, "A thought, properly employed, possesses a healing property."<br>If a person wants his life to be different, he should think different thoughts.<br>In a couple of places in the book he reminds us that Jesus Christ taught us to humble ourselves as children.<br>Toward the end of the book, a frank discussion of death is given. I strongly encourage you to get this book, if for no other reason to read this portion of it.<br>What you think determines what you become. What you become determines your life's work. Knowing how to live teaches one how to die.</span>
