                    <span>North America, more than 10,000 years ago, was a very interesting place. Gaint ground sloths, dwarf wolly mommoths, Nebrasks camels (weighing about a ton) and saber-toothed cats are just some of the bizarre animals you will find within the covers of this book. Ice Age Mammals of North America tries to give you a very balanced look at not just the big and hairy, but the more common creatures. Lions, wolves, bears, seals, porcupines, goats, beavers and deer to name just a few.<BR>The book begins with what North America was like, why we think ice ages are triggered, goes into detail about the many different animals (which takes up much of the book) and then tells us about the extinction of the megamammals (plus the debates about WHY extinctions happen at all).<BR>There are lots of photos and colorful illustrations, sidebars full of fact, lots of humor, a list of museums, fossil sites and websites you can visit. It also has a detailed glossary, bibliography and index. Great for adults and kids.<BR>Ian M. Lange really enjoyed doing this work, you can tell, and Dorothy S. Norton's work really helped bring many of the animals to life.</span>

                    <span>Ice Age Mammals Of North America by Ian M. Lange informatively presents the latest understanding modern-day science has of the North American mammals that thrived during the Ice Age. Diagrams, color illustrations by Dorothy S. Norton, and a wealth of knowledge of species both extinct and enduring fill the pages of this educational resource, written for young adults, and very highly recommended as a fascinating introduction to wildlife of thousands of years gone by for readers of all ages.</span>

                    <span>This book is the premier introduction to the Ice Age, and its now-extinct animals, for the uninitiated reader. It is also an excellent work for the serious student or teacher. The art work is superb, the photographs and diagrams are well chosen, and have the additional bonus of actually following the well-written, easily readable text. This saves the reader the burden of having to leaf back and forth as the book is studied. In short, whether you want to read about the Ice Age for serious study or just have pleasure learning about fascinating animals and times, this your book.<P>Now to content: Although the book's title and cover seem to indicate it is about animals only, the first half of the book covers, in a lively, interesting fashion, the various ways the Ice Age may have started, what the glaciers did and how they form, move, and melt, what the climate was like, and a hundred other things that are necessary to truly understand what occurred during this significant period of geological time. Well-chosen inserts explain particular matters.<P>The second half of the book covers the mammals of the Ice Age, with particular emphasis on those living in North America. In addition to the inevitable mammoths and saber-toothed cats, such relatively unknown creatures as the giant short-faced bear, scimitar cat, American lion, Florida cave bear, shrub ox, giant camel, and stag-moose, among many others, are each afforded extensive treatment. The section on toothless animals such as the giant armadillo, the various kinds of enormous ground sloth, etc., is simply one of a kind. You will be amazed and thrilled as you read about each creature in turn, especially as to its size, its diet, where it lived, and its appearance.<P>The book closes, somewhat sadly, with a broad, yet concise examination on why many of these creatures went extinct so suddenly, and man appears to be a primary culprit. Other potential causes are addressed as well.<P>A particularly fine feature is a comprehensive list of museums, parks, and sites across the United States where you may go to see the remains of these animals or learn more about them. An excellent bibliography is supplied at the end.<P>I have read about, and been fascinated by, Ice Age animals for many years, and I can assure you this is the most enjoyable book I have ever seen on the matters I have discussed. The information presented incorporates the latest studies, and is painstakingly accurate. Authors Lange and Norton are to be highly commended on a great book. I recommend it highly.</span>
