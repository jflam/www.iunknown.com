                <span id="Label1">Written for the experienced Java developer, <I>The Java Native Interface</I> documents the latest in native code programming for the Java platform using the Java Native Interface (JNI) with C/C++. Author Sheng Liang built the book around "dos and don'ts," even specifying within the introduction when you should and when you should not use JNI. Though sometimes densely written, this title certainly conveys a good deal of technical information on using native code with Java.<p> After a simple JNI "Hello World" code example, this book explores multiple aspects of the JNI API, starting with the use of Java strings and arrays within native code. Liang follows by transitioning into calling Java members and methods in C/C++. Here the author presents caching strategies for improving the performance of native code that interacts with or executes Java programs, including a discussion of local and global references that incorporates global weak references in Java 2.<p> The book also looks at handling exceptions within C/C++ code, as well as tips for working with Java threads. The author shows how to simplify access to C/C++ code through shared stubs and how to use peer classes to encapsulate native code from within Java. A section on common traps and pitfalls lists some common pitfalls to avoid when working with the JNI. After presenting the JNI specification, the author provides the most immediately useful text in the book--over 100 pages of reference material listing JNI data types and methods.<p> As a reference and programming guide, <I>The Java Native Interface</I> provides concise and timely technical details on getting Java and C/C++ code to coexist within your projects. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>This is one of the best Java programming books around. Not only are all the major issues surrounding JNI programming addressed, but the author also presents a great disussion on the organization of JNI.<p>My only complaint is that embedding JNI in native apps is barely touched. However, this is a complicated subject, and the information shared is enough to get started.<p>This book is definitely required reading for those interested in bringing legacy code into a Java framework. Also, its a good read, and a great example of nonfiction writing.</span>

                    <span>This is book is very handy if you are programming for JNI. I went and bought this book but later found that is free on the Sun's Java site.... So buy it only if you need a paper copy. If you are ok with a PDF or html  copy goto sun's website to get it.</span>

                    <span>I have a feeling Sun Micro had more to do with why there's not enough examples of how to do advanced features of JNI.  Afterall, using JNI essentially breaks the philosophy of compile once, run everywhere.  Some simple, so you think, things like moving a string array from Native-C to Java is not described at all.  Nor is moving a float array from Native-C to Java.  What this book does well is describe for the beginner how to get started with simple examples. Essentially to learn the core JNI concepts. But after that, trying to apply the more advanced JNI functions and classes, there's really no ample examples.  You have to rely on the Newsgroups essentially.  Forget about java.sun.com, they don't go that deep into it either.  Good book but be aware of its limitations.</span>

                    <span>While I have enjoyed many of Sun's books, this one is simply inadequate.  The organization of topics was mediocre, but, in my opinion, the book is a disappointment because of its sheer lack of depth (just 300 pages).  What few examples that were provided are typically discussed in two or three sentence paragraphs, often leaving out several key concepts contained in the example.  In addition, many more subtle patterns/topics seem to be left as an excerise for the reader.  Unfortunately, this probably _is_ the most complete JNI book to date.</span>
