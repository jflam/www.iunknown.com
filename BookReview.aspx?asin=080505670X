                <span id="Label1">Do animals think? Can they count? Do they have emotions? Do they feel anger, frustration, hurt, or sorrow? At last, here is a book that provides authoritative answers to these long-standing questions. Most popular science books t to misrepresent animals, presenting them either as furry little humans or as creatures that cannot feel at all. Marc D. Hauser, an acclaimed scientist in the field of animal cognition, uses insights from evolutionary theory and cognitive science to examine animal thought without such biases or preconceptions. Hauser treats animals neither as machines devoid of feeling nor as extensions of humans, but as independent beings driven by their own complex impulses. In prose that is both elegant and edifying, Hauser describes his groundbreaking research in the field, leading his readers on what David Premack, author of The Mind of an Ape, calls "a masterful tour of the animal mind."<br></span>

                    <span>This book, written by a scientist, is readily accessible to the general public. What Hauser has done for the field of animal cognition, Steven Pinker has done for the field of human cognition. Hauser brings to this problem the great advantage of having studied animals in the wild and in the lab. However, rather than dismiss anecdotes, he embraces them, and then argues that we should take such observations as starting points for further investigation. His theory about animal minds, and in particular, the idea that all animals are equipped with a toolkit for survival, is fascinating, and should have profound implications for how we think about both human animal thought. I particularly liked how he leads the reader down a path of discovery without being condescending or pedantic.</span>

                    <span>As George Page pointed out in his New York Times review,most scientists fail when they try to write a popular account of the science they practice. Marc Hauser's book "Wild Minds" does not fail. It is not, unlike most books, filled with jargon. Nor is it condescending. It is a non-technical, but intelligent treatment of an important problem: what animals think and how they think. In the first part of the book, Hauser shows that all animals have brains with three distinctive capacities or what he calls "tools". these are the capacity to recognize objects, count how many there are, and navigate through space. In part two he describes several specialized tools that only some animals have. Specifically, the ability to learn from others,recognize themselves(i.e., a sense of self), and deceive others. In part three, he takes these tools explores how they play a role in systems of communication and possibly, developing a moral society. The examples are well chosen, and vivid. This is a book of passion, and a more than welcome addition to the field.</span>

                    <span>His style is a little flat: a scientist writing for popular audience and trying really hard not to talk down. But he organizes the subject really well and clearly, with chapters on tools, numbers, spatial navegation, sense of self, language, moral reasoning. Each one synthesizes a large amount of scientific research on both animals and children, with interesting anecdotes.<P>The preface makes it clear he's writing against sentimental popular books on the subject that treat animal as being like humans inside, and themselves attack "the scientists." But this book gives a dreary image of the scientists. Each chapter describes some amazing abilities of different animals, describes some exhausting, repetitive experiments to document (it often seems) a small part of what was already suspected, and then concludes that as to the most important part -- "what animals really think" -- science doesn't know. But (drearily), they probably aren't conscious.<P>He should be clearer than he is in summarizing what the experiments have shown, and in particular about the differences in cognitive performance (not "real thought") btw adult and infant humans, primates (his main interest), birds (who get less attention), rats (still less), and social insects (who make a few star turns).</span>

                    <span>Hauser has written a remarkably accessible introduction to comparative psychology. While containing the main points one might expect in a textbook outline, he does an excellent job of presenting this information in an interesting narrative form. <P>Hauser begins with an introductory chapter that presents his basic approach and cautions against anthropomorphisms.<P>Chapters two through four comprise a unit that focuses on those mental capacities shared by animals and human beings. Both can identify objects and predict their movement. Both can distinguish quantity. Both can navigate through space. Perhaps it takes a course in cognitive psychology to appreciate these commonalities, but I believe that Hauser does an excellent job of presenting research results for lay consumption. His presentation of animal and human infant studies of the expectancy-violation principle is alone worth the cost of the book. <P>The second section, chapters five through seven, focus on mental capacities which seem to be qualitatively common in animals and humans, but quantitatively distinct. Hauser presents a well-balanced account of the evidence for self-awareness, teaching, and deception among animals.<P>The final section contains two chapters on mental capacities that appear to be almost unique to human beings - language and morality. Hauser's careful review of animal communication is amazing, as is his locus of morality in the ability to inhibit selfish tendencies to maintain social conventions. <P>I recommend this book without reservation. No reader will regret spending time with this book. It is quite stimulating.</span>

                    <span>As another reader has pointed out, Hauser's subtitle is misleading. He readily admits that scientific studies on the nonhuman animal mind are very incomplete, but based on the limited evidence to this point, rather rashly concludes that they are not on a par with human animal minds (according to him, nonhuman animals are not self-aware and do not feel embarrassment or shame, but like humans three years old or younger, deserve good treatment from us.) In other words, he comes across, like the more enlightened scientists, as a welfarist--treat 'em right, but keep 'em in their place (so we can keep experimenting on them). <P>Hauser is careful not to be condescending to those who may suspect that their dogs or cats or any other animals have more between their ears than we currently understand. In the first chapter he states his case against popular writers like Jeffrey Masson and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, whom he claims commit the "sin" of anthropomorphosis--but it's not a diatribe. If you can get past that clearly stated bias, Hauser's book is an informative if unsatisfying read, because the findings he presents ultimately leave you up in the air about what animals really think.</span>
