                <span id="Label1">Told in riveting, novelistic detail by the author of the best-seller Black Hawk Down, Finders Keepers is the widely acclaimed true story of an incredible week in the life of Joey Coyle, a down-and-out longshoreman from working-class South Philadelphia. One afternoon, just blocks from his home, Coyle found two curious yellow containers containing $1.2 million in unmarked money from a casino. They had just fallen off the back of an armored truck. Even before news of the missing money exploded across the headlines, Detective Pat Laurenzi was working around the clock to track it down. Joey Coyle, meanwhile, was off on a bungling misadventure, sharing his windfall with everyone from his girlfriend to total strangers to the two neighborhood kids who were with him when he found it. Loaded with intrigue and suspense, Finders Keepers is the remarkable tale of an ordinary man faced with an extraordinary moral dilemma, and the fascinating reactions of the family, friends, and neighbors to whom he turns.</span>

                    <span>This a true story about one of those weird occurences in life that everyone hopes for in the back of their minds: A million dollars falls out of an armored car and some lucky stiff find it, grabs it, and takes it home. Unmarked bills! Untraceable bills! You could hide it for a long while, couldn't you? You could find a way to bank it, spend it, whatever, without anyone else knowing a thing, couldn't you? And, of course, you could give it back. Well, that's you. The drug addicted fool who actually found the money did none of these things. He created a bizarre whirwind of motion, but, in the end, he lost it all.<BR>Mark Bowden tells this story fast and he tells it very well. You can rip through it in a night or two. It will be time well used.</span>

                    <span>This is a true story about something that lurks in everyone's daydreams: What if I found a million dollars? What would I do with it? The man in this book DID find a million, in untraceable bills. <BR>What would you do with that kind of money? Hide it for a long, long while, then carefully spend it? Find a way to sneak it into various bank accounts? Give it back to the armored car company that lost it? You would do something with it, right? Well, that's you. The fool who found it in real life created a whirlwind of motion, plotting, and bragging that resulted in virtually nothing. Yeah, he lost the money.<BR>Mark Bowden tells this story fast and he tells it very well. You can rip through it in a night or two. It will be time well spent.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Written like a fiction novel, Bowden tells the true story of an instant financial windfall of $1.2 million for Joey Coyle an unemployed, drug dependant, loser with nothing going for him and the IQ of a rock. Joey, depressed after his drug dealer wasn't home spots a yellow container on the side of the road which he thinks would make a good tool box. Looking inside he discovers two bags with reserve bank written on them. Not really caring that this money obviously belongs to someone he quickly puts the bags in his friend's car and they drive away. <P>This book tells what Joey does with the money in the seven days it takes the authorities to work out he took it and capture him. It is a crime in Philadelphia not to try and return something found with a value over $250. His big plans and how absolutely terrified he gets when he realises the mob is not around just to help you change hundred dollar notes into smaller currency are examined in detail. You'll be amazed at just how stupid this guy is. Also the stupidity of Purolator Armored Car Company and their drivers who lost the money of the back of the truck in the first place. <P>What would you do if you found 1.2 million? To be honest I would keep it but I sure wouldn't be as stupid as Joey. This is an extremely interesting book. I never heard of the actual story before so I have no idea how accurate this book portrays events but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It does drag on a bit with the trial and epilogue at the end which could have been summed up with a lot less paragraphs. Apart from that though, I was addicted and wanted to know the outcome. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after reading a complimentary review online. Unfortunately, this book proved to be a very bland, unentertaining read about an unintelligent, vanilla main character who doesn't even give himself a chance to keep the money that he found.<P>Nothing spectacular really happens in the book; in fact, this probably would have been a better feature article for a second-tier major newspaper.<P> I found the characters very difficult to follow, much less get interested in. I do not recommend this book at all.</span>

                    <span>This book is the worst of the 4 Bowden books I've read. It's mildly entertaining and much too short. It seems like there really wasn't enough of a story to turn it into a book. If you want something short to read it's alright I guess.</span>
