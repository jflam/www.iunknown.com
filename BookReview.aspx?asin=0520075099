                <span id="Label1">From the informal games of Homer's time to the highly organized contests of the Roman world, Miller has compileda trove of ancient sources: Plutarch on boxing, Aristotle on the pentathlon, Philostratos on the buying and selling of victories, Vitruvius on literary competitions, and Xenophon on female body building. With nearly 50 percent more texts than the highly successful second edition, this new version of <I>Arete </I>offers readers an absorbing lesson in the culture of Greek athletics from the greatest of teachers, the ancients themselves, and demonstrates that the concepts of virtue, skill, pride, valor, and nobility embedded in the word <I>arete </I>are only part of the story from antiquity. </span>

                    <span>This collection of excerpts from ancient sources concerning<BR> athletes, athletic contests, skills, prizes, and the<BR> athletic "mystique" is excellent. For it gives a<BR>generous overview from different sources, from different<BR>ancient venues, and from different time periods. The<BR>reader gains a growing sense of the awe and reverence<BR>in which skilled as well as beautiful athletes were<BR>held, both by spectators at the events as well as<BR>through the fame which they gained that was passed<BR>down in inscriptions, statues, poetry, and the<BR>memories of those who heard of their skills and<BR>victories even in distant places.<BR> The excerpts are not excessively long, but they are<BR>highy interesting and instructive. The topics covered<BR>by chapters are: the Earliest Days of Greek Athletics/<BR>Nudity and Equipment/ The Events at a Competition <BR>(Running, Wrestling, Boxing, Pankration, Pentathlon, <BR>Equestrian, Music, Poetry and Prose Composition, Acting,<BR>Painting)/ Organization of a Panhellenic Festival/ Local<BR>Festivals/ Role of the Games in Society/ Women in<BR>Athletics/ Athletes and Heroes/ Ball Playing/ Gymnasion,<BR>Athletics, and Education/ Spread of Greek Athletics in<BR>the Hellenistic Period/ Greek Athletics in the Roman<BR>Period/ Amateurism and Professionalism/ Nationalism<BR>and Internationalism/ Our Ideal and the Reality.<BR> As the author, Stephen Miller, explains in the<BR>"Introduction": "A definition of -arete- would <BR>include virtue, skill, prowess, pride, excellence, <BR>valor, and nobility, but these words, whether taken<BR>individually or collectively, do not [completely]<BR>fulfill the meaning of -arete-." *** "...the word<BR>-arete- still carries with it a notion of ephemeral<BR>excellence and of transient triumph that make its<BR>translation an exceedingly risky business."<BR> In any particular chapter, the sources cited<BR>may include: Pausanias (author of the famous Guide<BR>Book to Greece), statue inscriptions, Athenaeus<BR>(author of the multi-volume -Deipnosophists-,<BR> Scholars at Dinner), Diodorus Siculus, poetic<BR>excerpts from the -Greek Anthology-, Plutarch,<BR>the ancient poet Pindar, Plato's dialogues, Aristotle's<BR>treatises, as well as many other Greek and Roman<BR>sources.<BR> The title which I chose for this review comes from<BR>the chapter titled "The Events at a Competition"<BR>and shows both the striving for excellence,<BR>and the transience of the accomplishment (if<BR>not the fame). The 3 excerpts concern the<BR>athlete Phayllos of Kroton, who was a pentahlete.<BR>Some of the ancient writers thought the pentathlete<BR>was the physically most perfect and beautiful<BR>of the athletic competitors. The excerpts come<BR>from "The Suda", "a lexicon compiled toward the end<BR>of the 10th century after Christ and based upon a<BR>variety of earlier material" [Miller]. As "The<BR>Suda" says: "Beyond the dug-up area": beyond<BR>measure. A metaphor from the pentathlon [jumping<BR>pit]. It is said to come from the pentathlete Phayllos<BR>of Kroton who, when the skammata used to be 50 feet,<BR>first exceeded them with his jumps, as the epigram<BR>on his statue says: 'Five and fifty feet flew Phayllos'."<BR>The transience and the agony of ancient competitions,<BR>for they were even more brutal in some physical<BR>aspects than any modern events, come in the 3rd<BR>excerpt: "'To jump beyond the dug-up area': with<BR>reference to doing something hyperbolically, because<BR>Phayllos jumped more than 50 feet and tore up his<BR>leg."<BR> -- Robert Kilgore.</span>
