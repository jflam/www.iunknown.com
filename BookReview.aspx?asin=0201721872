                    <span>Apparently there's considerable demand on this book in many countries, given the waiting lists and the ridiculous prices people are asking for worn-out copies at Amazon and other international stores.
<br />
<br />Addison-Wesley simply stopped printing the book because it has "2000" in its title, while in fact its content will be useful and relevant for many years to come. Even if you don't write programs that exploit undocumented features, it still has great value for those curious to know the inner plumbings of the OS.
<br />
<br />I contacted the author and he doesn't have any extra copies. So please contact Addison-Wesley and let them know that you want the book reprinted, or at least offered online at Safari Bookshelf.
<br />
<br />This way we can all buy spanky new copies for a fair price instead of paying three to five times as much for beaten-up copies.
<br />
<br />I have contacted Addison-Wesley in this regard but haven't heard anything back. May be if more than a few people did so, they'll listen.

                    <span>This book is highly recommended to device driver writers and kernel hackers. This book revolves around the tools presented on the companion cd, an excellent kernel spy (with working source code and tools. Nowadays, so many books have source codes on their CD that just flat out don't work). The author of this book has carefully prepared the source code and made sure it works on both NT4 and w2k. My only complaint about building the source code is it requires windows 2000 DDK which is no longer available from msdn as free download. It'd been much more convenient if the author had actually provided some of the header files and libraries to build the tools without having to get the entire DDK library. 
<br />
<br />The author explains why/how the tools/source code on the companion CD works. These explanations bring you through some of the most exciting aspects of w2k hacking such as direct kernel call linking in userland app, hooking kernel native APIs. The assembly code demonstrates some very useful hacking tricks.
<br />
<br />Appendix A is a summary of microsoft kernel debugger commands, which is extremely useful in itself!
<br />
<br />This is a quality book for serious kernel hackers.</span>

                    <span>Wow! This is a really good book if you plan to move from user mode to kernel mode. I bought this book because it was recommended by an author I really respect. It actually makes kernel mode application development look easy. I know that's a wild claim to make but its my honest opinion.The CD actually has a wizard for generating VS projects for kernel mode applications in addition to some really cool tools! The author also explains the skeleton code so a reader can easily build their apps on the foundation. The only problem I have with this book is the fact that its account on memory management is rather difficult to comprehend. I'm sure I would have been totally lost if I didn't already have this knowlegde. Readers who don't already understand this can consult volume 3 of the intel x86 manual or the book: "Memory Management" by Bill Blunden. <p>It should be noted that this book has very little to do with the win32 api. It is strictly a kernel mode/native API book so readers who have no interest in the kernel should not consider buying this book. I highly recommend it for system programmers who like me keep asking:"How does it work?"</span>
