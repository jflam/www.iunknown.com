                    <span>I have only recently made the move to large format photography and welcomed the publication of Jack's book. Not only are the photographs inspiring but there is a great weath of technical information to help with composition, exposure and camera movements. It is always interesting to learn how photographers work and this book gives insights into how Jack works a situation to get the photograph.<br>      The section on camera movements is particularly helpful. Jack has created excellent pictorial diagrams to show the effects of camera movements on the focusing plane. In addition there are chapters on film exposure, reading the light and filters.<br>      Making the commitment to large format photography can be a very daunting experience. This book helps. It is an excellent reference tool. One that I would not be without.</span>

                    <span>A solid read from one of the premier colour landscape photographers in North America today.  The author provides good insight to the techniques used to create each photograph, and contrary to one of the other reviews here I find the detailed information provided on each shot reflects the professional attitude of the photographer.  If you know Jack's other printed works, his mission is to help protect the ever diminishing wild spaces on the planet, and he is careful to document exactly what he has photographed, indicating his intense involvement with the subject.  His tips on how to prepare your equipment to be ready for the fastest set-up for when the decisive moment of lighting suddenly appears (based I am sure on years of being out in the field and probably missing his fair share of shots in his early days) is worth the price of admission all by itself.</span>

                    <span>The Art of Large Format Photography is carefully discussed in Jack Dykinga's Large Format Nature Photography.  The book  reveals the thought and technique behind the creation of Jack's signature images.<p>For those photographers willing to devote the time and effort needed for successful large format photography this book is a must.  The reader will learn a great deal about the how and why of equipment selection (even how to carry it), several techniques for focusing the camera, life as a photographer, and most importantly developing a personal vision.</span>
