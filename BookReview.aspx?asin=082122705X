                <span id="Label1">The English Room takes you on a room-by-room exploration of the English home, contrasting town with country life, rooms designed for pleasure with those for more practical needs, and rooms meant to receive visitors with those that are private retreats. Country cottages and London flats, high ceilinged drawing rooms and farmhouse kitchens all conjure up the essence of English life. Chippy and Keith Irvine cover the history and changes in customs that have contributed to the creation of the English home, providing inspiration for today's interior decorator.</span>

                    <span>This book has nothing common with the classical English style if you are looking for it. It has dark, gloomy and boring room photographs. But, it has a useful information in the introduction part as it explains the history and challenges in English decoration style from early periods until now.</span>

                    <span>As a designer specializing in Anglo-American country, and as a long-time fan of Ms. Irving's husband, Keith Irvine's, work, I was disappointed in both the text--while well written it serves more as a history lesson I had in Grad. school about English style--and the color photos, which many have been re-hashed photos from Mr. Simon-Sikes out-dated drawer of negatives. The places explored and photographed are a narrow representation. More should and could have been done. The spectacular cover shot of the library, I wrongly assumed, was a hint of the special interiors inside. However, inside is a mixture of some good but mainly mediocre design ideas, albeit all English, with differeing interpretations. A better book overall is Colefax and Fowler's, which acts as a "bible" of the English Room design, much like I had hoped this book by Chippy Irvine might have been.</span>
