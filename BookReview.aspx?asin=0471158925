                    <span>I have not finished this book yet;  I will.  And I am enjoying much of the historical and social background -- but Bryan's need to repeat certain 'facts' verges on perseverism. Sometimes, she even acknowledges that she has said the same thing before.  Then why say it?  Do we not have memories when we read?<p>The 'scholarship' is quite specious -- undocumented 'facts,' episodes and experiences of Martha Washington that are pure supposition.  <p>The book starts as an interesting concept but is becoming an annoying and repetitive hypothesis.</span>

                    <span>This book was a wonderful insight into America's "first" First Lady. Not only did the book delve into Martha's life, it painted a picture of the times in which she lived. I learned more about the period and slavery than I thought I would ~ very well written. My favorite part was learning more about her first marriage to Daniel Parke Custis. Background is everything and most biographies lack it ~ this book doesn't. Read it and learn.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Bryan does for Martha Washington what David McCullogh did for John Adams. This compelling and thoroughly researched account brings Mrs. Washington to life and paints the social forces in operation during her time. It is only once we understand the context in which important historical figures exist that we can understand those figures as people.</span>

                    <span>This thing reads like a college dissertation.  And calling George Washington a "good old boy"?  Horrors.  If you can fight your way to the end of this one, you've got more patience than me.  And people who know me say I am VERY patient.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a very depressing book.  Ms. Bryan has done a commendable job of research, but the sum total falls way short of its goal. As someone once wrote, "History is a foreign country.  They do things differently there."  This author plows diligently ahead, ignoring the fact that moral or ethical comparisons with persons who lived centuries ago with the mores of modern times makes a rather uncomfortable fit. Calling George Washington "a good ole boy" may be a clever way of saying he was an ignorant bumpkin, but not too many educated people are willing to view Washington's complex character through such a narrow prism. And why the almost pathological focus on slavery? Does Ms. Bryan, born a Virginian, suffer some type of guilt complex?  The 18th century was different from modern times in so many ways, you easily could write a book on that subject alone.  I just don't see the point in trying to assassinate history while attempting to write about figures who dwell there.  The truly great history writers have all had a certain reverence for history itself and a sympathy for the heroes and villains who occupy it. Ms. Bryan seems only to have a single minded politically correct version which she has written with the coldly calculating mind which only a lawyer could bring to bear.</span>
