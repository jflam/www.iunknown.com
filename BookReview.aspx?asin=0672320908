                    <span>I am new to Crystal reports but have advanced skills with computers. I have mastered Autocad and program in 3 languages. I tried to use Crytal reports as a free evaulation program because I use Peachtree Accounting. I thought it was ridiculous how the program had very little intuitive structure, so I thought I would get try a supposed "quick easy" book to learn the basic skills. This book spent the  1st several chapters trying to sell you on why Crystal reports is so great. By the time it got to a so called "tutorial" it was no better than the "help" section that comes with Crystal Reports. Its amazing how people can not simplify certain subjects. Crystal Reports is BEGGING another software company to invent a competitive product that is user friendly because theirs is just the opposite!</span>

                    <span>I wasn't knowing anything about Crystal Reports, then it was needed that I design critical reports about some data, the project system engineers decided that Crystal Reports is the solution.<br>I bought the book, and it really helped me to do the required job, it took me less than 2 weeks to read it all, and it was really ver helpful.</span>

                    <span>Lets be honest, any book that says Teach Yourself ... in 24 Hours is a beginner book.  And as such, this book is great.  I am a application programmer and needed a PRIMER to get started and this book not only allowed me to do that, but allowed me to meet my business critical deadlines on time.  Although I may need another book for advanced topics in the future.  I find that I can write most of the reports requested of me with this handy book.  I even told Crystal Decisions that they should contact the author to have him write their manuals, which are inadequate and hard to follow.</span>

                    <span>Like someone else said in his review, this book is good for beginners.  I'd like to confirm that, and maintain that's its ONLY good for beginners.  The book glazes over much of the material and never goes in depth for any of it.  If you've already had just a little experience with crystal reports already, this book won't help you much at all.  It can hardly be used as a good reference.</span>

                    <span>I have used many SAMS books in the past and have been VERY happy with their books. Normally they are very to the point and allow you to quickly get to the "meat and potatoes" of how to get things done. Based on that history I chose the SAMS book when I needed to learn Crystal Reports. This book is nothing more than an overpriced "marketing tool" for Crystal Reports. This book did not deliver the "caliber of substance" I have come to expect from SAMS.</span>
