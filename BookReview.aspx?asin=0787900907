                <span id="Label1">Streamline the processes vital to optimum performance<br>    <br>    With over 100,000 copies sold worldwide, Improving Performance is recognized as the book that launched the Process Improvement revolution. It was the first such approach to bridge the gap between organization strategy and the individual. Now, in this revised and expanded new edition, Rummler and Brache reflect on the key needs of organizations faced with today's challenge of managing change. With multiple charts, checklists, hands-on tools and case studies, the authors show how they implemented their Performance Improvement methodology in over 250 successful projects with clients such as Hewlett-Packard, 3M, Shell Oil, and Citibank.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the first book that dealt with process improvement and change from all angles.  This book provides examples that will help the novice in preparing and implementing change.  Packed with examples and worksheets to guide the reader thru the whole process.  However, since it was written in 1995, this book does not cover prevailing technologies but is still useful in understanding the foundations for change.  If you are looking to implement business process change/improvement, read this book in conjunction with a more recent book by Paul Harmon "Business Process Change" who happens to be a student of Mr. Rummler.  Paul Harmon's book cover such topics as CMM and Six Sigma when implementing process change.</span>

                    <span>Long before James Champy made "Reengineering" a buzz-word, then a management fad, then finally a tired cliche, Rummler & Brache broke the code on how businesses can do work better. Instead of looking at the jobs people do, they focused their attention on the work being done, and how those work objects meander through different departments and functional organizations in most companies.<p>What Rummler & Brache might have lacked in marketing prowess, they more than made up for in insight.  "Improving Performance" is short on jargon and the evangelical fervor many other works on Reengineering, Business Process Management, and Third Wave(or fourth wave or whatever wave we're up to) seem to revel in.  It is focused and pragmatic, giving both the theory of process management and how to apply it.  Very basic and very useful diagrams help illustrate their concepts throughout, making this a field guide for anyone involved in process management in the real world, be they consultants or internal change agents.  <p>After 15 years in the space, it's still one of the best I've found.  Could not recommend more highly.</span>

                    <span>Not very well written, but the concepts come across nicely and the reader is able to put the book down and start where they left off a day or two later.  Slow reading, but quite interesting stuff.</span>

                    <span>People had been telling me to read this book for over two years and I always put it off.  First it was the Internet and eCommerce.  Then it was Six Sigma.  Now I have had a chance to read this book and regret my delay.  This book is a gem of factual, example filled, and focused insight and understanding.  This is a true manual for changing processes and <p>First the book provides a clear roadmap for process change.  It defines the individual steps necessary as well as the interconnection points between the organization, its processes, measurements and other elements.  While you may not agree with all of the points -- the completeness will give you more than enough ideas to be of value.  <p>Second, the book is well populated with detailed graphical examples that illustrate the concepts and thier intent.  The level of detail, the practicality and the realism of the examples allows you to study the issue, understand it and find parallels in your own business.<p>Lastly, the book is complete it covers issues related to process design, implementation, process owners, measurement and management.  Many people write whole books on one of these aspects however Rummler and Brache have covered them all in a focused and informative text.<p>I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to implement process management, six sigma, or other related changes.  The book provides the details often left out of texts associated with six sigma.  It provides a completeness often missing from process management and design texts. <p>The only drawback to the book is that its writing style is a bit dry and the book, written in 1995 does not cover many of the process innovations enabled through the Internet.  Otherwise this book is a real winner and well worth your attention.</span>
