                <span id="Label1">At last! A programmer's guide to what goes on in the making of a robust and professional Service.  With this book, Kevin teaches the developer how to design, implement and configure good NT services using C++ and COM (using ATL).  It also sets a firm grounding for the configuration and security issues needed to develop a system service.  By the end it will have presented several real-world, power examples that demonstrate important design principles. The book's development of usage patterns will be invaluable to client-server developers who want to include services as part of a multi-tiered system, for example, with IIS, as a business object broker, or as a backend to lightweight client development using DCOM.  </span>

                    <span>Mr. Miller wrote a handy class for event logging called CEventLog, but he chose to use overloaded names for the methods to handle all sorts of different types of events.  If I were you, I would NOT do this.<p>Instead:<p>I would give each LogEvent() method in that class an explicit name, because it makes it more clear which method will be invoked.  In my particular case, I sort of assumed his class was good until I noticed that a bunch of my custom messages weren't printing to the event log.  Because it was 2:00 AM when I found this, it took me a long time to figure out the problem.<p>Anyway, the rest of the book is pretty great, a must-have if you're going to be writing a service.</span>

                    <span>The book is comprehensive, clear, and easy to read.  The source code works and it is easy to follow (the code is available on-line.)  The discussion on ATL COM servers is truly enlightening and by itself worth the price of the book.  If you are writing an ATL COM server this book is a must, especially if it will be a multi-threaded server.<p>From the beginning the author has the attitude that NT services are easy to understand and his "prophecy" becomes self-fulfilling throughout the book.  The book is well organized and it pays special attention to service design and usage patterns.  <p>Also notice that the book does not cover hardware drivers.  By the way, do read the previous review titled "One of a kind" as it gives very useful tips on installing ATL services (using "myservice.exe -Service") and housing COM objects in a service; I have not found that information in the book.</span>

                    <span>No other source compares to the quality and convenience of Professional NT Services, either in book form or on the Internet.  The only other way to get this information is to read sample code on MSDN, which is a less-than-optimal way to learn the subject.<p>Professional NT Services describes the issues involved in writing services, such as security and threading, and provides sample code every step of the way.  The book also details how to build a service with ATL and even tells you how to improve ATL's implementation.  It even talks a bit about Microsoft Transaction Server (now part of COM+).<p>Here are three bits of information that I discovered elsewhere that I wish were more evident in the book -<p>1. If you create an ATL service, the default registation code registers the EXE as a COM server instead of a service -- run "myservice.exe -Service" to register the service.<p>2. The easiest way for multiple clients to be able to use a single COM instance that's housed in the service is to implement the COM class using DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_SINGLETON.  This is your typical "server" pattern.<p>3. Clients that want to connect to COM objects housed in the ervice should use CLSCTX_SERVER in CoCreateInstance<p>Perhaps this information is buried in the book somewhere, but I didn't find it.  At any rate, without this book, I wouldn't have known where to start.<p>Finally, for all its great qualities, the book needs to be revised for Windows 2000.  It mentions some new features of "NT5" but I wonder how accurate this information really is.</span>

                    <span>This book addresses all the issues related to such complex problems as NT Services. The author explains them in very great details, and makes you understand how all this works. The sample code works and you can use the  classes from the book to start coding NT Services very fast.  The author is  very talented in explaining difficult concepts. Funny enough, this book has  the best explanation on MSMQ, as well as apartments. As an alternative to  the classes provided in this book, I  recommend the CodeGuru NT Service C++  wizard written by Joerg Koenig. But even with a wizard, it is good to know  how all this works.</span>

The author has presented the various topics clearly and I like the style of writing.  This  book has been a great help.  If you need to understand NT Services and how  to program something decent; this is the book.  Not for someone new to  Windows programming.  Just hope he comes out with another book soon.</span>
