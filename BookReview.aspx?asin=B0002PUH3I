                    <span>"Al Franken should be put in jail for hating America. After 9/11, this moron still thinks it is okay to criticize our government and president. The guys who wrote the PATRIOT ACT (GO USA!) should kick in his front door, and drag him away to prison forever. No trial for traitors!" - from a reviewer
<br />
<br />So, apparently, this guy likes a Saddam-like government, where opposition to the ruler is punishable by jail or death.  That's a fairly UN-American sentiment.  That individual is in the wrong country and has the wrong concept of democracy.  
<br />
<br />This show answers to the liar Limbaugh who only robotically repeats talking points from Rove.  Independent thinking is what made this country great, and what makes the country strong.  Being obedient to one ideology weakens a democracy.  This is funny, supported by government documentation, and O'Franken isn't an oxycoton junkie.

                    <span>I make it my business to get all comedy cds that come through the cd store in which I work.  I was very excited when the Al Franken cd came through.  I never listen to the radio, but was aware of Air America.  Maybe it's because I listened to this post-re-election, but it just doesn't seem inventive.  Since I don't listen to Air America, I can't honestly say whether it accurately reflects the show.  I can only judge it as a stand-alone disc.  It is tired and predictable.  I can see bits and punchlines coming from a mile away.  It's really unfortunate- I voted for Kerry, and can't see how ANYONE could vote for Bush, but this cd doesn't help in the least.  It probably wasn't intended to sway people for the election ('cause if it was, it failed miserably).  We don't need an "answer" to right-wing media.  A far-left skewering of the right doesn't do anything- it's preaching to the converted.  The only way you get through to people who have any doubts is through original, clever humor.  This cd does not have that.  I have been a big fan of Al Franken for quite a long time, and this is definitely the most trite output of his I've ever witnessed.  If you're a lefty looking for a reiteration of what you believe, you might enjoy this cd.  If you're a free-thinker, I think you will be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>Like M.E. Reeves said, the slow pacing of these bits ruin whatever comedic impact they might have had.  Like most reviewers, I agree that "Flippity-Floppity" and Bebe Neurwith as Ann Coulter are the disc's highlights.
<br />
<br />But I'll go a step further -- and get LOTS OF "UNHELPFUL" VOTES ON MY REVIEW BY ANGRY FANS -- and add that these comedy bits could only be moderately funny in the first place.  GO AHEAD, ASSUME I'M A CONSERVATIVE AND HIT THAT "NO" BUTTON NOW.  You'll feel better.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm calling "BS" on this compilation.  Now, Franken is funny.  "LateLine" and "Stuart Saves His Family" and ALL his books are funny and brilliant.  But in many ways, this CD misses the mark.  I suspect I'm missing out on much better moments during the broadcast, and that I'll appreciate the show when I get satellite radio -- oh, but you don't really believe me, do you?

                    <span>Well, right wing radio has certainly dominated the airwaves for some time now. Morons like Limbaugh; stalinist thugs like O'Reilly; neonazis like Coulter. So those of us who'd rather be informed and/or entertained by someone from the planet earth deserve all that is Franken.
<br />
<br />So I got this CD. It starts with a mimic or George Bush--indicating what we all know (thought, it seems, only half of us acknowledge, that Bush's "military" career was so distinguished that, if I were to have done the same thing, I'd be eating three squares a day in Leavenworth!)
<br />
<br />The occasional "right wing non-lies of the week" make the CD worth it. 
<br />
<br />Then there's the piece on Accountants Without Borders. How could one argue that the Third World would be so much better with their books balanced??
<br />
<br />Some of the most amusing portions are those of Ann Coulter in the background complaining of how the show's staff and hosts aren't up to her mighty social stands. I don't know that she could have done a better job on herself than that!
<br />
<br />And "outsourced Al" is another good one.
<br />
<br />The whole CD is amusing. No, it's not the funniest I've ever heard. In fact, I encourage people to tune into Al on Air America and enjoy that. But this will certainly tide you over if you're sick of the "conservative" hogwash we've been hearing on the radio for too many years now. </span>

                    <span>I love Al Franken.  I highly recommend any of his books - especially the audio editions, read by Franken himself.  I listen to them a couple of times a year.
<br />
<br />This CD, however, is just not funny.  You win some, you lose some.  Lies/Liars - that's funny!  This - no.</span>
