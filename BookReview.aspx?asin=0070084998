                    <span>This book shows how a number of relatively minor miscalculations can add up to big trouble.  Kayaks are little boats in a big sea, and learning to read the ocean, file a float plan, study or take the time to learn about the area tides, currents, etc. is critical, especially when traveling solo.  I learned a lot about what NOT to do when kayaking.  I have been sea kayaking for a number of years and have recommended this book to many people starting out in the sport.</span>

                    <span>I'm a new kayaker and this book was recommended to me by my instructor.  Kayaking, I have learned, is a lot more than just getting into a kayak and paddling off.  Believe me, this book has guaranteed that I will never be anything less than the most prepared when I get in my boat.  Whether it is just a paddle across a small lake or a trip across Lake Superior, YOU CAN'T CUT CORNERS!  Even small mistakes (cotton clothing instead of synthetic) can have dire consequences.  A must read for anyone planning to paddle.</span>

                    <span>I recommend this book to anyone who is active in watersports. It made me aware of the seriousness of some dangers I didn't think much about before (like hypothermia). Some stories have happy endings and some don't. Every story is analyzed to determine what the participants did right and what they might have done differently.<br>My only criticism is that most of the stories are centered around one particular geographical area (Pacific northwest).  I wish there were more stories having to do with different conditions (whitewater rivers, flatwater, etc.) and in other parts of the country so that we non-coastal people could relate more. Still, a fine book.</span>

                    <span>This book is fascinating.  It covers a range of mishaps experienced by kayakers of all skill levels from novice to expert.  Several themes run through the book: disregard for water temperatures, unexpected changes in weather and seas, kayaking in conditions beyond the paddler's skill level, failure to consider all available information about the planned route. Some of the stories turn out well, others turn out tragic.  Sidebars in the text offer valuable insight into various safety topics.  This book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to paddle in open or tidal water.<p>Know that most, but not all, of the incidents reviewed oiccur in the San Juan Islands or nearby locales, and that many of the stories are from the mid 80's.  However, the authors write in a manner that makes it easy to see yourself in the difficult situations discribed.  I wonder whether, with the rise in popularity of kayaking in recent years, if this book could be easily updated with more recent events.  The authors would do well to continue their efforts on a regualr basis to promote safe kayaking practices.</span>
