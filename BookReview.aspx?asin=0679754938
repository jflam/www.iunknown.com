                    <span>Nothing here that is implementable.  This tape contains one message: CHANGE EVERYTHING.  The entire book and tape revolve around this single message.  Mr. Peters provides no implementable plan or suggestions on how to adapt this message to you, your department, or company.  In fact, you have to ask yourself, "Is it truly necessary to change everything?"  Most of us would have to say "No."  In fact, this is more often than not a recipe for f-a-i-l-u-r-e.  Instead, A RETURN TO BASICS is what is needed in 90-95.0% of the cases.   However, my biggest complaint isn't that I believe Mr. Peters is wrong, it is that his recent books and tapes are filled with superfluous and outragious statements that fail to advance the listener's or reader's understanding of the concept.  When I buy a management book or tape, I want information and concepts that I can quickly take to my company and implement to our mutual benefit.  Unfortunately, Mr. Peters' recent works appear to be nothing more than pep-talks and cheerleading sessions.  You have to ask yourself: "Where's the beef?"</span>

                    <span>With a Copyright of 1994, its a little dated, but the basic message remains clear.  Innovate or become extinct.  Tom's enthusiam is apparent with each chapter.<p>If you can overlook the examples of corporations that are no longer around, and listen to the concepts, ( refer of course to the audio version) its a great program. <p>For true members of Tom's movement, this book remains a variation on a theme.  A must have for the "Work Matters crowd" a cheap substitute for his live programs.  Or a great refresher course for someone that has been to one.</span>

                    <span>Beyond review,

I read this book first in 94 and just re-read it again in july 97, It is still wonderfull and give a lot of insight to business.
 
 I wish I can see him LIVE in THE SEMINAR someday, most of Tom books are good and worth reading.

                    <span>Since the publication of In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters' books have consistently provided a much needed kick in the seat of the pants to would be entrepreneurs and corporate leaders. His messages related to the need for innovation and a focus on excellence provide a refreshing challenge to the "business as usual" school and to those with a typical short term survival management philosophy. In The Tom Peters Seminar (subtitled "Crazy Times Call for Crazy Organizations") Peters uses his $1,500 a day seminars as the basis for a quick, concise analysis of the problems and solutions associated with the new, scary, and impossible to stop information economy. As Peters relates in the book, "Do something. Make things happen. It's inaction that kills you." This book is the place to start</span>
