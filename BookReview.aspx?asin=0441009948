                    <span>This is a well-written story of a young girl trying to learn of her roots.  At nine years old she knows little about her mother or father.  She lives with an old fisherman.  The old man has told her he found her in the woods, but warns her to stay away, or the ghouls in the forest will get her.  
<br />
<br />Young children, especially girls, will enjoy this story.

                    <span>A sweet story of a young girl's search for self. If you've ever stood in a sun-dappled forest and felt that it had a soul, or if you've ever wanted to, this book will speak to you. I can't say that I didn't see the end coming, but I truly enjoyed getting there.</span>

                    <span>Rescued as a baby by a crusty old curmudgeon of a fisherman, Anna still feels the ache of wanting to know who are her parents, and what happened to them. Her answers lie within the forest, but her mentor has warned her to stay away from it. It is a dark, dangerous place, haunted by spirits who could destroy her, as they did her parents.<p>Yet, this gentle soul is also brave, and she must learn the truth. What lies ahead will amaze her, for her quest will give her more answers than she was looking for, ones about not only her parents, but about who she is herself.<p>***** With this book, Mr. Barron reaches out to a younger audience than many of his books appeal to. It is, as are his other works, heart warming and insightful. What struck me most is the affirmation of the importance of one's heritage and parents in a time when young people learn earlier and earlier to rebel. If you loved the story ANIMAL FAMILY by Randall Jarrett, this book will speak to the same place in your soul.</span>
