                <span id="Label1">David Attenborough and the BBC have a well-earned reputation for producing some of the greatest nature programs, but <I>The Life of Mammals</I> could well be Attenborough's magnum opus. Much of the footage shot for this series had never been seen before, and is presented with the respect and reverence for the natural world that Attenborough has made his trademark. It never ceases to surprise: the sight of a lion taking down a wildebeest on the African savannah has almost become a clich&#233; of nature programs, yet in <I>The Life of Mammals</I> the cameras keep rolling and the viewer witnesses the fallen animal's herd coming to its rescue and driving off the lion. It's a moving sight and just one of many remarkable scenes. <p>  A thorough and entertaining overview of one of evolution's greatest success stories, the series is loosely structured to follow the development of mammals, beginning with the basics in "A Winning Design," which clarifies what makes a mammal different from reptiles and birds--no, it isn't egg-laying: both the platypus and the echidna are egg-laying mammals; it's their ability to adapt. And it's this adaptability that becomes the crux of the remainder of the series. "Insect Hunters" focuses on mammals who have specifically adapted to eating insects, from the giant anteater and the armored armadillo to bats, which have evolved into complex and effective hunters. "Plant Predators" demonstrates the particular (and often peculiar) adaptations of herbivores, while "Chisellers" is about those mammals who feed primarily on roots and seeds, ranging from tree-dwelling squirrels to opportunistic mice and rats. "Meat Eaters" talks about the evolutionary arms race that exists between predators and prey, and the unique adaptations of both individual and pack hunters. Omnivores are explored in "Opportunists"--mammals like bears and raccoons, whose varied diet allows them to occupy nearly any environment. "Return to the Water" discusses those mammals such as whales, seals, and dolphins that have left behind life on dry land and adapted completely to life in the sea, existing at the top of the food chain. The last three episodes--"Life in the Trees," "Social Climbers," and "Food for Thought"--take the viewer through the development of primates, eventually culminating in that most successful mammal: man. <I>--Robert Burrow</I></span>

                    <span>This four disc, ten-episode series is probably the best nature documentary ever produced in DVD format. In fact, Life of Mammals is reason alone to buy a DVD player if you don't have one. <P>Here are a few reasons why I think people should shell out the money for this set:<P>- David Attenborough's enthusiasm for his work. Watching him respectfully approach a poor-sighted anteater from downwind or barely able to contain his delight when floating a few meters away from a blue whale, Attenborough's love for the animal world is totally infectious.<P>- The images are of IMAX quality. This is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen.<P>- The soundtrack is top notch.<P>- The Buffalo versus the Lions. This brief segment is mentioned in the Amazon reviewer's description - it has all the emotion and energy of the Cavalry Charge in 'The Return of the King.' It literally brought tears to my eyes.<P>- Swimming Elephants. 'nuff said.<P>- Kids love it. These films will keep kids (even as young as 2) quiet and totally absorbed in ways that no Blue or Builder Bob video can approach. <P>- David keeps it light and entertaining. Each segment is short enough (40 minutes) and has plenty of amazing footage and humorous anecdotes so that it is nearly impossible to get bored of it all. Just don't watch more than one per day or you will spoil yourself.<P>I give this series the highest recommendation. Even if you are not a nature buff (and chances are you will be after seeing this), it is certainly worth bringing into your home.</span>

                    <span>The Life of Mammals is a stunning work of incredible range and scope, taking us from the frozen wastes of the arctic to searing deserts to lush rain forests. The film highlights the range of behaviors among mammals, illustrating the remarkable ways in which they have solved the problems created by the escalating evolutionary battle for food, for a mate, for a place to live. Some of the more wonderful images include bats delicately plucking spiders from their webs, elephants trooping into an African cave in the middle of the night, and remarkable predatory dramas on the savannah.<P>As with all David Attenborough films, this one is dense with interesting facts. Each segment provides new insights into the behavior of animals, even for such prosaic beasts as wildebeasts and gazelles. The Life of Mammals appears to me different from Attenborough's previous works in its aggressive use of novel camera techniques, which is very successful, taking us for instance inside the egg of a platypus. <P>This film also combines the superb visuals with a brilliant score. The music, which is at times mournful, at times crackling with tension, and at times positively soaring, adds an inspiring sense of drama. This is justified not only by the subject matter, which is indeed sublime, but by David Attenborough himself, who as far as I am concerned is an absolutely unparalleled genius. <P>If I haven't yet sold you, consider the price of this work, which at $... constitutes remarkable value for the 500 minutes you get. Just a year or so ago, The Trials of Life series on VHS (which is of comparable length, but without the whistles and bells that this DVD gives you) cost $...</span>

                    <span>In my home, we're all big fans of nature documentaries, Discovery Channel, National Geographic, etc. We bought The Life of Mammals sight unseen after having enjoyed the entire Blue Planet series. My two year old loved Blue Planet so much that, while I hate to admit it, my wife and I were looking for something else for him to watch. By looking at Amazon's "customers who bought this also bought" area on Blue Planet, we've since acquired other BBC documentaries for the kids to watch - The Life of Birds and Walking with Dinosaurs.<P>The Life of Mammals is a series of episodes, similar to Blue Planet. However, I will say that the footage, while excellent, is not nearly as spectacular as I found Blue Planet to be. I think that's the only reason The Life of Mammals gets 4 stars from me and not 5. Our son loves it just as much, so who am I to complain?<P>The episodes in this series are as follows:<P>A WINNING DESIGN - sort of an overview on mammals, their variety and why they thrive; features echidna, platypus (a favorite of our little boy), possum, kangaroos, and yapoks.<P>INSECT HUNTERS - features some unbelievable aerial footage of bats catching bugs; the anteater and pangolin are also excellent.<P>PLANT PREDATORS - our son's favorite episode largely due to giraffes and elephants; the picas and bison are also favorites, as well as a sequence about how African plant eaters deal with predators that consists mostly of running<P>CHISELLERS - mostly deals with rodents and other...well...vermin, including beavers, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, marmots, etc.<P>MEAT EATERS - another favorite of my sons, mostly because of the lions and other cats - we were concerned that some of the predation scenes might be a little bloody for him, but that wasn't the case at all; the tiger footage is spectacular<P>OPPORTUNISTS - can't say I enjoyed this one that much, as it features a lot of animals I consider to be pests; I will say that it gave me new insights into racoons and the rat scenes were incredible (although disgusting)<P>RETURN TO THE WATER - featuring sea otters, seals, dolphins and whales, this episode is most similar in footage to Blue Planet<P>LIFE IN THE TREES - deals with the tree canopy as a distinct ecosystem, requiring specific skills to survive; features meercats, sun bears (the best climbing bear), fruit bats, loris, lemurs and gibbons<P>SOCIAL CLIMBERS - largely about primates, and how monkeys and apes have complex social structures; features uakaris, tamarin, guenons, macaques, and geladas.<P>FOOD FOR THOUGHT - I hate to say it, but I think this is my least favorite episode because it seems to deal as much with people as it does with mammals. It is interesting, but I can't say that it has the same replay value as the rest of the series, particularly for our son.<P>Throughout the series, David Attenborough is his stately, understated self. Unlike in Blue Planet, where he simply narrates, Attenborough makes appearances in this series. He's so scientific that sometimes, it's kind of funny - like when he narrates hedgehogs trying to mate in his back yard. Anyway, we found this entire series to be thoroughly enjoyable, educational and a treat for our son as well.</span>

                    <span>I have not yet watched Attenborough's other series, but the 9th movie in this series (_The Social Climbers_) was so outstanding it made me beg for the others. I was not disappointed, although _The Social Climbers_ (monkeys) is my favorite. _The Insect Hunters_ (insectivores) and _Chisellers_ (rodents) are almost as good. All the episodes are densely packed with wonderful information and footage. Since Attenborough's strength is pointing out the wonders of the ordinary and overlooked, he is at his best when filming small animals. (When filming large animals, he is too preoccupied with their size.) I also liked that the series revealed the filming technologies without becoming too overwhelmed with them, except in the leopard scene of _Meat Eaters_.<P>There is at least one glaring inaccuracy, in _Meat Eaters_: Hyenas are NOT dogs. They are in their own family, which is more closely related to the cat and mongoose families. Fortunately this is correct in the book. Overall, I highly recommend _The Life of Mammals._</span>

                    <span>Charming, enduring, creative, pretty good for a goverment susidized publication. What everyone says about Sir Attenborough is true, he is great to watch and listen to, his presenatations have a way of sucking you in, making you feel apart every moment. Beyond Attenborough's inviting personality there are a plethora genuinely fascinating moments that were achieved thourgh the use of cunning and cutting edge photography. What's really neat is that Sir Attenborough fills you in on some of those photography secrets while leaving you scratching your head wondering "how did they shoot that" on others. In this case, the DVD is worth having, there are a few featurets that made you appreciate the work and research that went into this production, not mention interesting fact filies, a series of intriguing and ocassionaly humourous video clips done to the excellent sound tract. Also this BBC production used more high resolution cameras than some of the other series like "life of birds" did. Even apart from clips shot with a starlight camera (those you expect to be a little grainy), there are a small handful of images that were obviously shot with lesser equipment but ,hey, if you can't forgive those than don't buy anything BBC and stick to recent PBS and Nature presentations. As form follows function, so price follows quality, that's true with the BBC, they've made several 10 epeisode nature series and The Life of Mammals is a little more expensive than most, but rightly so. It was better written, produced, and shot with better equipment (for the most part) than the others.</span>
