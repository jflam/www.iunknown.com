                <span id="Label1"><div><b>As the climbers of the 1996 Mt. Everest disaster vanished into thin air, one man had the courage to bring them down alive...</b><br><br>On May 10, 1996, two commercial expeditions headed by expert leaders attempted to scale the world's largest peak. But things went terribly wrong. Crowded conditions, bad judgement, and a bitter storm stopped many climbers in their tracks. Others were left for dead, or stranded on the frigid mountain. Anatoli Boukreev, head climbing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition, stepped into the heart of the storm and brought three of his clients down alive. Here is his amazing story-of an expedition fated for disaster, of the blind ambition that drives people to attempt such dangerous ventures, and of a modern-day hero, who risked his own life to save others..<br></div></span>

                    <span>This is a quick read, one or two days maximum, and worth the time even though the book is not especially well written. "The Climb" is another account ("Into Thin Air," by Jon Krakauer, is the first) of the events of a 1996 expedition to summit Mt. Everest. The Climb was co-authored by Anatoli Boukreev, a guide on the Mountain Madness expedition that was, some feel, treated unfairly in Krakauer's account of the disaster (this is arguable - Krakauer did question some of Anatoli's actions, but he was much more severe in his criticism of Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, the principal guides on the Mountain Madness (Fischer) and Adventure Consultants (Hall) expedition teams. Thus, most of the book is presented as a defense of the actions of Anatoli and the Mountain Madness team, and the reader is poorly served as a result. Krakauer, in particular, seems to have drawn the ire of the co-authors for questioning the decisions made on the fateful summit day.<P>Unfortunately for the reader, however, The Climb does not take the time to step back and view the forest from the trees, so to speak, and one is constantly reminded that the sole object of the book is to hail the efforts of Anatoli at the expense of all others. The result is a rather muddled account of the disaster, without a treatment of what the other climbers and expeditions were doing while the disaster was playing out. Into Thin Air presents a much more comprehensive, thorough approach, and in this respect far outclasses The Climb in terms of readability. <P>Despite these shortcomings and the author's less than balanced approach to his subject, the book does shed considerable light on Anatoli's decisions, and one comes away with a better appreciation for his actions. Whether or not Anatoli's actions were correct, I am certainly not qualified to judge, but his bravery is above reproach, and the book did a credible job of restoring Anatoli's reputation as an heroic and dedicated climber. <P>Although countless mistakes were made on Everest in 1996, all present seemed to have done everything in their power to save lives once the disaster was in full bloom. Rob Hall and Scott Fischer obviously paid for their mistakes not only with their lives, but those of their clients, and I am sure that both men, were they alive today, would be the first to censure themselves. But all climbers who sign on for such an expedition knew full well the risks they took, as well as the risks they could not plan for. All who died will be remembered as intrepid souls who risked their lives in search of a more fulfilling existence, and for that they should be commended. Deplore the mistakes, but not the people who made them. We can only hope that future expeditions will learn from the accounts presented here and in Into Thin Air.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed "The Climb." I do think that the book would be more convincing if not a direct rebuttal to "Into Thin Air." I would rather hear Boukreev's side of the story unfettered from contensting the other book. It would have made for stronger tale. In both of these books, the authors focus on every little contributing factor that led to the incident. Boukreev's Indonesian ascent in '97 had similar hangups, which leads me to belive that the biggest cause to the carnage on the mountain was the number of climbers on the mountain in one day, not the experience level, etc. That aside I enjoyed a different perspective on the '96 Everest disaster.</span>

                    <span>I found The Climb to be a good companion to Krakauer's Into Thin Air. While I don't believe Krakauer singled out Boukreev (he cast a pretty wide net including himself), I can understand the defensive posture taken in The Climb. After all, Boukreev didn't make his living by pointing fingers. Guiding was his livelyhood.<P>I think that in the final analysis, Boukreev didn't leave the summit too early; everyone but Krakauer left too late. Had he known the clients were gonna dilly-dally on their way to the summit, perhaps he would've used supplemental oxygen. Since he didn't and they did, I suspect he had little choice but to go down 'early.'<P>I'm glad Boukreev took the time to defend himself. I found many of the details he provides fascinating. I found him fascinating. I'm sorry that he's gone, and I'm sorry he felt it necessary to co-author this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book seems to be an attempt to defend the indefensible. Boukreev is an incredible mountaineer but an incompetent guide. He obviously had no concept of what Scott Fisher meant by being a responsible guide, and had Fisher lived, I'm sure Boukreev would never have been asked to work for him again, particularly considering the enormous sum of money he was paid to be a guide. Having neglected his duties repeatedly, and ensured he was in safe quarters while others were in danger of dying on the mountain, this book is an attempt to explain away his lack of understanding of what a guide is supposed to do when on a commercial expedition. Despite his supposed ability to operate without supplemental oxygen, he doesn't explain why he didn't co-ordinate rescue attempts with the doctor who was on Hall's team when he had been told where the people who were in trouble were located. The doctor was clearly hypoxic, but so was Boukreev; that's the only reasonable excuse which can be offered for this failure. A certain arrogance comes through in the book, which is probably his personality anyway and I'm sure why some clients just didn't trust Boukreev. The book is a well written novel and worth reading, but don't take him too seriously.</span>

                    <span>Marvellous, gripping, breathtaking, dramatic, suspenseful, and above all very well written. The kind of book that you read in one single breath without putting it down before reaching the very last page.<P>Whether one is sympathetic to Boukreev's or Krakauer's claims is less relevant. It is a superb book on one of the most dramatic events in high-altitude mountaineering.</span>
