                    <span>Reading this book, I got the impression that the author buys into the impression most people have of pre-war Southern women - the vapid Southern belle who basically did nothing until the war began, then suddenly she had to run the plantation. Not true! If one reads diaries and letters of the period, the daily running of the home was left to the women - managing the slaves (if the family owned any). Women handled a good deal more of the marketing and financial running of farms, especially, than is generally believed. Perhaps women weren't involved in politics, but the backbone of southern life was the home and that was the woman's province. Women proved their capability before and during the war by managing the homefront. As for refugees - the tales told by thousands of women who were forced to flee their homes are far in excess of the numbers suggested by the author. The worst atrocity of the war - the hundreds of women captured by the Union in Roswell, Georgia - is ignored. The author also suggests that support for the war by southern women waned as it went on, another questionable fact in light of the many diaries of the period and the tremendous outpouring of grief at the surrender. Most women couldn't bear to record the end of the Confederacy in their diaries and surviving letters are filled with bitterness. Still, this book is an excellent researcher. Also recommend Juanita Leisch's books on "Civil War Civilians" and "Who Wore What" although her fashion research should be taken with a grain of salt as it is theory only based on a sampling of period photos.</span>

                    <span>In "Mothers of Invention," Drew Gilpin Faust explores the ways in which the Civil War transformed traditional gender roles among middle- and upper-class southern women.  Gilpin theorizes that Confederate women certainly were aware of the effect that government policies had on their lives-even if the leaders, at times, were not-and that women's views conscription, home defense, economic production and slavery influenced and, ultimately, undermined their support for the war.<p>Her key point seems to be that the war overturned the "social contract" in which elite women accepted subordination and dependence for male protection and privilege.  Although men were off protecting their homes in the abstract sense, women were left to deal with the day-to-day realities of food shortages and an invading army occupying their homes.  <p>Narrowing exceptions to the draft, the military's refusals to grant furloughs in times of great family need, and government policies regarding food requisitions especially galled women.  Faust puts a particularly interesting gender perspective on the draft exemption for those owning 20+ slaves.  Normally, this exemption is viewed solely in class terms: "Rich man's war, poor man's fight."  Faust, however, brings attention to the fear that white women experienced being left alone to manage large slave populations without a man's help.  Women feared murder and uprisings from a slave population that was growing increasingly rebellious.  The priority ultimately given to equitably treating draft-age white men and the burden of managing slaves led to a decline in women's support for the slave system and for the Confederacy, she argues.    <p>In addition to slave management, Faust explores other ways in which the war caused elite white women to step into traditional male roles.  From the very beginning, secession and the war led to much greater involvement by women in the public sphere.  Although politics had been considered the province of men, secession was a topic that no one could stop discussing-women included.  The banding together of women to support the war effort also proved a new experience for southern women.  Unlike their northern sisters, southern women typically had not been involved in social organizations before the war.  <p>Faust's book includes a fascinating discussion about attitudes toward the refugee experience.  In particular, she notes that becoming a refugee was the civilian equivalent of buying a substitute for the draft.  A refugee, the term implied, had the money and connections to make a planned departure from home-often to protect property.  In support of this view, she cites the diary of Mary Lee of Winchester, who disdained the term refugee in favor of "displaced person" to describe those fleeing with little in the face of the enemy.	<p>"Mothers of Invention" contains one of the most interesting analyses of the hoop skirt that I have seen.  Faust notes that the trend for full skirts, ultimately supported by hoops, coincided with the Victorian ideals of domesticity and women's separate sphere.  The caged crinoline or hoop offered women a portable enclosed private space and the wide skirts symbolized a circle in which women were protected.  In an era where upper-class women's sexuality was repressed, the style also hid and reformed female anatomy.  The conspicuous consumption of fabric and the difficulty performing physical labor in these skirts made a class statement as well.  <p>"Mothers of Invention" provides a good overview of the different ways that the war affected southern women's lives, including changes within the household, relations between husbands and wives, paid employment outside the home, the likelihood that young women would remain single due to the deaths of so many young men, religious views on the war, increased educational opportunities for women, dealing with Yankee men, etc.  Her accessible writing style and use of interesting quotes and numerous pictures make this a relatively quick read.  The book is well-organized with subheadings that make locating important points quite easy.  <p>For those interested in exploring the southern woman's war experience, this book would be a good starting point for gaining some good general knowledge.  Readers should keep in mind, however, that Faust is focusing on elite and middle-class women, and that the experiences and attitudes she describes do not reflect the lives of lower-class women.</span>

                    <span>The subject matter is hard to find a book on, much less a good read, thus this book is a rarity, and it is very very well done.<p>It's a very trustworthy read with no opinionated ego trips and an amazing amount of information. Drew Faust is the queen of primary sources. Everything you read by her is straight from an original. She truly does her research, then puts it in a form that is a delightful and captivating read. I found "Mother of Invention" to not only be incredibly informative (you'll learn quite a bit in one sentence) but and outstanding book that I vied to pick up even more than a novel.<p>There's something incredibly satisfying in reading a research book and actually really remembering it because you liked it.</span>

                    <span>Historically, Southern women have been type-case as fragile, codependent, incapable, overgrown children.  Growing up in the South, it was always difficult to find role models from local history, or in the mass media.  <p>"Mothers of Invention" shows us otherwise.  It was amazing and inspiring to read about the struggles and revelations of these women.  It touched me deeply, to think about the courage and strength it took for a previously sheltered woman to learn to take on more responsibility in a society that told her that her place was at home.  <p>This book shows Southern women as gutsy and brave, a little like Scarlett O'Hara's spirit when she vowed, "I'll never be hungry again!"</span>

                    <span>I had the option of reading this book for a advanced history class, and I am very glad I did.  Faust takes the most hidden people in the slave holding south, women, and brings them to life.  With rich text flowing beside diary entrys I was highly amazed at the ability of women to overcome anything that is put in their path.  And to become, through neccessity, the mothers of invention.</span>
