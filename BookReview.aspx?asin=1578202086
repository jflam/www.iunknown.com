                    <span>Jay Rose has put together an excellent resource for anyone working with audio, espcecially for those who are working with video or editing. Great audio is extremely important for the success of any production and can do more to set your work apart from the crowd, more so than video technique or any special effects. With that being said, audio is a tricky science unto itself (a technical and touchy science it seems to me, at least). This book will help, it is a terrific reference for those who are accomplished with audio production as well as an invaluable tool for those who may be skilled in other areas of video production, but may be new to audio production. This book explains all the terms and jargon, expains sound theory and digital audio theory, answers questions about common problems (the ones all of us have encountered on shoots), how to avoid them on future shoots and provides specific technical assistance with cleaning up bad audio, fixing problems, selecting and setting up mics, planning, getting good sound from the start, editing and sweetening audio on the computer, mixing, effects, etc... Lots of tips, techniques, finishing touches and other good stuff. You will gain a better understanding of all aspects of audio. This is a complete course! Better than the college course I took 20 years ago. You will learn a lot here and it will show in your work. This is a great book from an experienced working professional. You won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I am convinced that audio is the biggest diference between professional productions and home video. People will "watch" anything, but if the audio is bad the whole project is bad. Jay Rose makes it clear how to get the best sound tracks you can get on video and how to make them better in post production. This book covers everything needed, and the CD is actually filled with useful sound clips. In just a few days I learned what I was doing wrong and how my projects could be much better. I found the book very well written as well. If you produce digital vidio, this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>Jay Rose is an excellent audio engineer and in this book shares knowledge that can only come from years of professional experience. He delivers information on a very difficult topic in an easily accessible manner.<P>This book is a great resource. As an engineer with years of experience, I can honestly recommend this book to beginners and pros as well. There's a wealth of practical information. I reviewed this book for creative cow (production website) and gave it five stars.</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in using audio for anything from location sound to post, this book is a must read. Even if think you know enough already, Jay will teach some fun tricks, time savers, and just plain great techniques for gathering and editing sound. <P>Sound gathering is far from simple but Jay lays it all out for you in an easy to refer to manual.</span>

                    <span>A disappointment. It is well written, very introductory, and not at all geared to those of us trying to get the best digital sound out of our MiniDV camcorders, which is what I was hoping for. My problems include mic questions, in-line mixers, return loops for headphone monitoring, in brief: how to bypass the internal preamps in the camera to get the best sound out of a MiniDV camcorder. I need practical examples. This is not in this book. I am not sending it back, but it goes on the shelf with the other not-enough-hands-on-examples books.</span>
