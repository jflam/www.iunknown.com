                    <span>The photos are beautiful as promised.  But if you're really looking for a  sourcebook of ideas for your home, as this one claims to be, you may be  disappointed.  This book treats stone and tile with nearly religious  reverence; all I wanted was something nice for the kitchen!  Some of the  treatments are absurdly elaborate, and the text even analyzes the  provenance of many of the stones.  More creative people might find  inspiration here, but for me it was much ado about nothing.</span>

                    <span>The pictures and ideas are amazing. I didn't know such things could be done with tile. The book saved me from running from retail store to store to get ideas. I almost didn't buy the book because of another reviewer  saying it only has pictures of product from Ann Sacks stores. I personally  don't care where the product came from, the pictures and ideas were great  all by themselves!</span>

                    <span>This is not a how-to-do-it book. It is a book rich with photos of installations and details of tile and stone that will suggest to the reader (and viewer) many possibilities for the functional and decorative use of  these materials.<p>Contrary to what another reviewer of this book says, it  contains far more information than a brochure of the Ann Sacks line of  products would. (In fact, many of the materials and tiles illustrated are  *not* from the Ann Sacks line at all?unless Ann Sacks somehow managed to  install her work in ancient French farmhouses, at Middle Eastern religious  sites, and in Roman baths!)<p>This well-produced book is a visual feast,  and an inspiration for designers, decorators, and homeowners. It's well  worth the price and the graphics are splendid. Anyone who works with, or  who is thinking of working with tile and stone will want to own it.</span>
