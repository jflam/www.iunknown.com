                <span id="Label1">David Buss updates his classic study of the origin of human mating behavior with fascinating new research.  <P> If we all want love, why is there so much conflict in our most cherished relationships? To answer this question, says noted psychologist David Buss, we must look into our evolutionary past. Based on the most massive study of human mating ever undertaken, encompassing more than ten thousand people of all ages from thirty-seven cultures worldwide, <I>The Evolution of Desire</I> is the first book to present a unified theory of human mating behavior. <P>Now in a revised and updated edition, Buss's classic presents the latest research in the field, including startling new discoveries about the evolutionary advantages of infidelity, orgasm, and physical attractiveness. </span>

                    <span>I've been tearing through books about genes and behavior. Matt Ridley's _The Red Queen_ and _Genome_ are particularly interesting. This one is not. While data sources are widely cited, a large fraction of the data for universal human behavior comes from surveys conducted among American college students in singles bars. This is supplemented by scoring personals ads for content.<P>The results are unsurprising--women pursue men somewhat older who are better off than they are. Men pursue women for youth and attractiveness. The evopsych underpinnings are asserted without qualification or any indication that the assertions are in the least bit contoversial.<P>For example, in discussion about the role of concealed ovulation, the author tells one common evopsych story--that women don't go into heat because it means men will hang around more to keep other men away.<P>In Jared Diamond's _The Third Chimpanzee_, he cites and attributes six stories that purport to explain why people don't know when women are fertile.<P>When you're writing about controversial science, it's important to let your readers know when you are speculating. This book fails to do so.</span>

                    <span>Through his analysis of 37 cultures across all economic and geographic boundaries, Dr. David Buss has produced a masterpiece that provides extensive rationale for why we as humans act as we do. Buss uses reams of research (and also, obviously his own) to showcase what men want from women and what women want from men. They are certainly not the same thing, and the denial of this actuality has caused considerable friction between the sexes. I've found that when most people are exposed to the arguments of evolutionary psychology they immediately recognize it...as the truth. Read away, you'll never deny anything again.</span>

                    <span>The other reviewers have pretty much said it--this is a good book with some problems, and the rest--so I will confine myself to some things they don't mention.<BR> First, Buss continues his long campaign of featuring women's desire for wealth and men's desire for beauty, in spite of the fact that his own data show wealth is far behind love, reliability, caring, intelligence, and other goods in women's esteem, and (to a lesser extent) the same for men and beauty. Moreover, wealth and beauty matter much more for dates and one-night stands than for real relationships, where love, commitment, sympathy, and compatibility are most of the picture. Buss' exaggeration of the role of wealth and beauty has led to some real errors in the popular press.<BR> Among mysteries yet unexplained, he lists homosexuality--certainly hard to explain by Darwinian factors. He does not mention the theory that it may stem from a hormonal glitch in fetal development. He also does not deal with the fact that in some societies--ancient Greece and parts of the Middle East and New Guinea--homoerotic behavior is essentially universal among men, at least at some time in life. <BR> Another mystery is rape. Buss does not emphasize enough that rape is a crime of violence, almost always intended to hurt and harm and/or to assert dominance. It is not primarily sexual or about sex or reproduction. Hence its universality in war (including gang rumbles) and its rarity elsewhere; otherwise, thugs and very disturbed people are the usual perpetrators. There are always frat rats counting coup, but they aren't much of the story. Evolutionary psychologists make much of the fact that women of reproductive age are the usual victims, but forget that those are the women who are out and about, and the ones whose rape is most humiliating to their menfolk and their people (remember Bosnia). The surprising thing is that so many little girls and elder women get raped.</span>

                    <span>This is an exception work on a worthy subject. It addresses a fundamental aspect of human behavior from a scientific point of view, but the author is thoroughly readable and entertaining. A while ago I became interested in the subject throught the route of artificial intelligence, then real intelligence, then real cognition, then real perception. At the end of this chain, I found this goldmine. Since then, I have bought several copies to loan to friends. I'm sure that the author would be amused to note that most of them were women. (To know me is to love me.) Highly recommended. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>This book is a decent survey of evolutionary psychological theories of human nature, some quite well-supported and others needing quite a bit more testing. Its greatest flaw is the writing: it is not a pleasure to read.<P>I'd already read Matt Ridley's The Red Queen, and it is at once more well-written and more thoughtful and it has a lot more information. So if you're only going to read one book, or if you're wondering which to read first, I recommend Ridley's.<P>I haven't read "The Mating Mind," but it looks better than this one too.<P>However, despite recommending those other books, I want to emphasize that this one is not that bad. It's just that Ridley's book is so much better.</span>
