                <span id="Label1"><p>The husband of <i>The Bitch in the House</i> responds with a collection of original pieces by male writers about what men desire, need, love, and loathe in their relationships today ...</p> <p>Cathi Hanauer's bestselling <i>The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth about Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage</i> spurred a national conversation about the level of friction in contemporary marriages and relationships. Now her husband, Daniel Jones, has rallied the men for the "literary equivalent of <i>The Full Monty</i>," in which twenty-seven thoughtful, passionate, and often hilarious men lay it bare when it comes to their wives and girlfriends, their hopes and fears. Enough with pop psychiatrists telling us why men lie, cheat, and want nothing more than to laze around the house in front of the TV. Enough with women wondering aloud -- at increasing volume -- why the men in their lives behave the way they do. The time has come for men to speak for themselves.</p> <p>Many of the husbands and fathers in these pages contemplate aspects of their personal lives they've never before revealed in print -- they kick open the door on their marriages and sex lives, their fathering and domestic conflicts, their most intimate relationships and situations. Yet unlike the average meat-and-potatoes father who still rules the roost, these men are grappling with new ideas of manhood -- some that they are going after and grabbing, and others that are being thrust upon them by a changing world.</p> <p>Powerful, heartfelt, and irreverent, <i>The Bastard on the Couch</i> is a bold, unprecedented glimpse into the dark corners and glaring truths of modern relationships that is guaranteed to amuse, entertain, enrich, and provoke.</p></span>

                    <span>I'm sorry for the woman below who prefers cats (I wasn't even going to write a review until I read that!)...I'll take these guys any day! They're funny, sad, infuriating, evasive, charming, smart, smart, smart, and honest--they're even honest about being dishonest!!<P>This book is like a primer for life with men--although not polite goody two shoes men, and who wants them anyway. These are a range of men in all their glory and warts. I read the bitch in the house, which, by the way, infuriated people all over the planet. And this is a rocking sequel...just what I was hoping for, and just as in your face. The main thing is, you can't really put it down. Some of the stories are better than others, but they're all compelling. Love these guys or hate them...they've got stories to tell, and they tell them incredibly well.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This isn't my usual type of book but when I read the blurb on the back cover about why men lie and aways will, I just had to sit down and read it. The facts are familiar so I won't review how this collection came into being. I will say that the authors are uniformly excellent writers, each with a distinctive voice that makes reading these bland, exciting, informative, funny, pitiful, infuriating essays worth my time. Vince Passaro, author of the essay which hooked me, sounds just like what he is, a writer for Esquire and GQ. HIs essay, as well as those by Hank Pine [My Marriage, My Affairs - His Story], Trey Ellis [Father of the Year], Robert Skates [The Hole in the Window: A View of Divorce], and Toure [An Invitation to Carnal Russian Roulette] all kept me turning pages until I had consumed the entire volume. And consume it I did, in one sitting, with a tall cold glass of something brown and sparkling, and no shoes anywhere nearby.<BR> What didn't I like? Well, the writers are all clearly educated, from a certain mental socio-economic class which does slant these essays in a particular direction. The writing is so glittering, a kind of polish that even editing can't provide to the struggling writer. So the perspectives are tinged with wealth, education, culture, exposure, ability - money. Which is fine, but it leaves out the other male perspectives, like guys who ae as poor as hell. Although Toure describes himself as poor in his essay, he is only poor financially. I would have enjoyed reading essays by some different kinds of men. Or perhaps that is the lesson of this book, that men are men with the same issues regardless of income or social class. Cow patties! <BR> Not bad, and certainly light enough reading for a summer afternoon.</span>

                    <span>The men in this book range from happily married to unhappily divorced. They talk about trying to be a "modern male," trying to share everything 50/50, trying to face their situation in a variety of roles. There is the man who has been homemaker/stay-at-home dad for the last two decades while his wife works. There is the man complaining about his wife not wanting to have sex (and seemingly performing it as just another household chore when she does). There are several tales of psycho ex-girlfriends, and quite a bit of boasting (if you read between the lines) by the authors about sowing wild oats in their younger years.<P>Some stories really resonate, but even though there is some griping about wives or ex-wives or ex-girlfriends, this isn't a female-bashing book, and it is rather orthodox in its feminist assumptions; some authors deride the "Sensitive New Age Guy" and some clearly want to get on a big Harley and go sow some more wild oats, but no one comes out and challenges modern "progressive" married life.<P>Which is why I found it disappointing, despite a few amusing and even poignant gems. The tone, like the authors, is fairly homogeneous. Almost all of them are writers living in or around Manhattan, most of them are married to women who are NYC magazine writers, editors, or publishers. So unless you fall into that demographic (white, middle-to-upper class white-collar professional with a liberal arts background), most of these stories aren't about your life. The few exceptions (like the essay by a prison inmate) do not stand out because they barely fit in (the prison inmate's essay barely even mentioned women and said nothing about relationships... I was left wondering why it was included in this book). Likewise, there are a few African-American authors, but they're also Manhattan magazine writers married to other writers.<P>Contrary to the revelations and deep insights promised in the introduction, these men really don't voice anything profound, they don't say things that "men just don't talk about." They say pretty much what every self-indulgent lifestyle writer will talk about. The book felt like a collection of magazine articles the editor asked all his writer buddies to send him, and then he collected them into a book instead of publishing them in a magazine.</span>

                    <span>Was given this book by 'the woman in my life,' who'd already read it the second it came out (I had to hear her commentary every night as she read it in bed) and thought I'd read an essay or two, but then I found I plowed through the whole thing in a few days. And I admit I enjoyed it, but the funny thing is how much I've thought about it afterward. Some essays, like the one "Why Men Lie (and always will)" and "My Problem with her Anger" I think of EVERY DAY! And also, sorry dear, "The Lock Box," about the hubby who never gets much because his wife is always either at work or, when at home and actually in bed, chooses reading above all else (sound familiar, anyone?). <P>So now that my wife has won me over with this one, she's going to try to get me to read her dog-eared, bedside copy of The Bitch in the House. We'll see. I just might!</span>
