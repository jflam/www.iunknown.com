                    <span>The premise and content of this book is what to do in the critical first 90 days in a new assignment or a new position.  While the book covers a wide variety of concepts, there are few which go into great detail.  However, those that are covered are done so in manner that still is a valuable read for anyone changing jobs or roles.
<br />
<br />In my opinion one of the richest subjects to address, is also the one covered in the least detail here - culture.  One of the most challenging and difficult issues to understand and respond to are the unstated, yet very powerful, forces at work which enable or hinder a new employee's organizational success.  Any manager in a new role needs to quickly understand the do's and don'ts so they can be more effective.  I wish the book had gone into far more detail on this subject.
<br />
<br />That said, the sections on how to ask the right questions, assess your new team, and negotiate success with your boss are all great.  The author depicts a STaRS model for determining the situation a new leader may face.  The four types of business situations are "Sustaining Success", "Turnaround", "Realignment" and "Start-Up".   The book goes into each situation and the different approaches required in each setting. (Page 63)
<br />
<br />I found the section on "Build Your Team" to be quite insightful.  Several tips are included that will be very useful for anyone in the position of assessing their new team. In particular are several questions that can be asked, and some great insights into non-verbal behaviors and other clues that will provide much needed information to lead and coach through the transition.  (Page 167).
<br />
<br />I recommend this book for anyone looking to put together a quick on-boarding program for new managers, or who is going through a transition themselves.  Many good ideas and a great overview of the areas a new leader needs to be aware of to make a successful transition.

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fine book with a lot of substance, and I place it slightly second to Thomas Neff and James Citrin's "You're in Charge--NOW WHAT?."
<br />
<br />From my point of view as the reader, Neff & Citrin actually catalyzed me and inspired me into preparing a 100 day plan broken into 10 ten-day blocks, while Watkins is more of a manual with lots of useful checklists and suggested questions and so on, but between the two, Neff & Citrin actually drove me to the needed outcome: my own 100 day plan.
<br />
<br />Both are good.  If you buy only one, buy Neff & Citrin, but I do recommend that you buy both, read Neff & Citrin first, and then cherry pick from Watkins--the cost of these books is trivial in comparison to the return on investment.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. I was recently promoted from manageing one department to managing most of the company including a multi-media design department, a programming department, the Project Management Office, and reporting directly to the CEO. 
<br />
<br />This book was very helpful in terms of keeping me focused on my strategic priorities while at the same time providing lots of tactical advice. I am a student of US Army doctrine (my hobby) because I am always looking for simple but effective tools, and this book will fit well with those of you familiar with that kind of thinking. The ideas in this book are easy to implement yet provide a lot of leverage. That's the hallmark of a good tool in my books. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend a companion book which is John P. Kotter's "What Leaders Really Do".

                    <span>What's with the next review? A 1-star rant from a reviewer whose other reviews are for yoga books?  This book has sold over 100K copies in just over a year on the market, was on the BusinessWeek bestseller list for 7 months in 2004, and is one of Harvard Business School Press' best selling books. It opened up a whole new area in leadership thinking and spawned a bunch of imitiators. So what's the story? Someone with a particularly dull axe to grind?</span>

                    <span>Did Mr. Watkins write this book because he had something to say or he just had to say something?
<br />
<br />Lots of words compressed in very little thought that offers any value...  I wonder who these folks are giving this book a rating of higher than a star.  If Amazon allowed negative ranking I would have done that as I feel I wasted my money and time reading pure garbage.. Harvard Press needs to be a little more picky in terms of what it publishes associations with books like these will diminish the message of any good ones they come out.
<br />The following is culled out from the book; 
<br />"The root causes of transition failure always lie in the pernicious interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strength and vulnerabilities" 
<br />
<br />Please draw your own conclusions.
