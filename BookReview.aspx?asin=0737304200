                    <span>This is a much more practical book than some of the "100 things you can do when retired" books that suggest babysitting, dogwalking or other simplistic ideas. Mary Helen Smith lists 101 things you should think about or do, like consider what is "quality of life"--for example, downsizing your house versus staying in an expensive piece of real estate, and listing government programs for retirees, something you may not know about. In addition, she stresses understanding about money. Once you are on a fixed income, and one that is possibly lower than your salary, you must deal with money in a different manner. Now is the time to learn about finances and money, not after you've gotten your first social security check. With many millions of people hitting retirement or near-retirement age from the Baby Boom, this is a really good starting-off point to plan out your coming retirement years. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I'm impressed by how much information is packed into the conversational style of this book.  An abundance of practical information is available without it feeling tedious.  Your approach is positive, encouraging, and realistic.  Maslow and intuition are acknowledged.  Caring ways to honor yourself and others are gently and directly suggested.    Thank you for writing a helpful book that will positively affect the lives of those who read it.</span>
