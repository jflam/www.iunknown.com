                <span id="Label1">While Adobe Illustrator has traditionally been reserved for the print  and prepress marketplace, recent versions have targeted a broader audience,  including a growing contingent of new-school Web designers. With the latest  incarnation of Illustrator, Adobe aims to please both print and prepress  designers, as well as cutting-edge Web designer communities. If you're looking  for a greater Web focus from your vector graphics program, look no further than  Illustrator 10. <p>  For those concerned about Illustrator becoming too Web focused, don't fret. All  of Illustrator's previously existing drawing and text tools remain intact.  Version 10 also introduces improved tools for drawing lines, arcs, and grids.  These new drawing tools will maximize your productivity and provide an easy way  to create the shapes you want. <p>  In addition to the new drawing tools, Adobe has jumped on the graphics symbol  bandwagon by allowing users to save any text object or graphic object as a  symbol. Once objects are saved in the Symbol palette, they can be reused  infinitely, thus providing easier management of files and decreased file size.  Users will fall in love with the simple drag-and-drop usability of the symbols,  while the newly added Symbol Sprayer lets you easily add multiple instances of a  symbol directly into the document. <p>  Adobe has also undertaken the task of minimizing the monotony of tedious and  repetitive design tasks. By taking advantage of Illustrator-supported scripting  languages, users can easily automate repetitive tasks by writing scripts  directly in Illustrator. Any of the three popular scripting languages--Visual  Basic Script, JavaScript, or AppleScript--can be used. When creating a design,  users can assign a text object or graphic object to a variable. These variables  can then pull information from any ODBC-compliant database. With this type of  power, users can easily create templates for documents such as Web pages or  product catalogs. <p>  In this latest version of Illustrator 10, Adobe has managed to enhance its  existing drawing tools with powerful productivity aids. By focusing on important  workflow, productivity, and database-connectivity features, Adobe has given the  user more time to explore new creative possibilities. <I>--Rich Ting</I></span>

                    <span>The composer Federico Busoni had a habit of writing music that was difficult to execute, technically. He didn't do so because particular musical ideas demanded it; his aim was merely to prevent amateurs from playing his works. I was somewhat reminded of him coming to Adobe Illustrator 10 after the intuitive logic of Xara X. Even though I am acquainted with the complex Adobe-style interface through Photoshop 7, Illustrator again has me convinced that Adobe program-designers go out of their way to make things deliberately esoteric. Now, that would be understandable and forgivable if the complex interface were necessitated by a wealth of options not offered by other vector programs. But though Illustrator 10 does offer a few extra's not available in Xara X (and no doubt the new Illustrator CS has yet a few more), none of these are essential and some are no more than fairly lame gimmicks ('lens flare', for instance). Other tools such as the scissors, the knife, or the magic wand may seem handy at first, but soon they reveal themselves to be just extra buttons for functions that Xara performs equally well simply using the line or shape tools. Of course, Illustrator being touted as the 'industry standard' for vector editing, you may want to pay the exorbitant price of this program merely to boost your self-confidence and credibility as a graphic artist. Some peer pressure may do the rest - according to some, if you don't use Illustrator, you're no more than a wannabee... But don't you believe them! I have yet to come across the first piece of vector art that was done in Illustrator and would be impossible to do in Xara. In fact, Xara is every bit as powerful as Illustrator, yet is generally faster, much easier to use, very visually oriented, with an uncluttered, cleverly thought out interface and lots of straightforward drag-and-drop functions. So if you define yourself as a graphic artist through your work rather than through your 'professional' (i.e. expensive) tools, I would advise you to save yourself a lot of money, a lot of time learning a needlessly complicated interface, and go for Xara X. After all, who ever heard of Busoni?</span>

                    <span>I have been a Graphic Designer for 6 years and I have been using Illustrator the whole time. The program has been upgraded with some good new features, although Corel (which is evil) has Illustrator beat with the Envelope feature. Illustrator is EXTREMELY glitchy with XP. I find that it works well with 2000 and even 98. This is the program to get if you are in the field of Graphic Art, I have been teaching it for 3 years as well and new users really enjoy this Program. Once you get the basics down you can go many places with Illustrator.</span>

                    <span>Many people struggle when it comes to which software draw application to buy. Should it be Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDRAW, Expression,Deneba, etc. Well, they are ALL GOOD. Its up to you you to be GOOD. With each one of them you can create basically almost anything you want if you have creativity. Each one of them has some advantages over each (its up to you to research on the product own web site what it does..compatibility with other applications, etc..). For example, currently Illustrator is probably most widely used in USA because ot its ease and compactness with Photoshop. But, macromedia has recently released Freehand MX which also is smooth with photoshop, if not better than illustrator (Currently Adobe just released Illustrator CS [nov 2003]. My suggestion is that if you are mainly thinking of web than buy Frehand MX (best if you buy it included in the whole Macromedia package) and if you are mainly into print than buy Illustrator CS (you save if you buy it in Adobe suite CS which includes Photoshop CS, Indesign..). Also, I have found some other drawing programs from Europe that are in my opinion better for my taste, but remember also that most people dont need these expensive programs and much cheaper drawing programs can suffice most individuals (except pros; even pros can make great stuf with cheaper programs). Hopefully I did not create more confusion in deciding which software to buy. OK, if you want to be in a "click" buy Illustrator CS, but if you want to be "cool" buy Freehand MX or any other similar quality digi drawing program such as CorelDRAW or Sarajevo L'Express.</span>

                    <span>If you are thinking of using this program without having any art ability, I have one word for you: DON'T. Unlike Photoshop, which can be used by people with a variety of image needs, with Illustrator you better already be an artist. I am an artist and this program is taking everything I've got. I find it extremely difficult. This is not to say that it is more or less difficult than any other drawing based art program, just that it is hard. I've always been a better painter than a drawer so that could well be bedeviling me in learning it too. What lowers the grade to a 4 though is that Illustrator 10 seems to have a lot of bugs when you use it on Windows XP, which is what I'm using. I notice another reviewer here catalogs all the problems it presents on a Mac so I caution you that installing it on Windows may not solve those problems. Perhaps Adobe just rushed it a bit prematurely into production. If you go to the Adobe website and then to the Illustrator User Forums, you can see all the computer bugs that users are running into with Illustrator 10. That can give you a better idea than I ever could about some of the problems you will need to work around after installation... The reason I went with this program is that it is the one that is the industry standard. It is also the drawing program taught in most colleges' commercial art departments. Apparently some advanced drawers also use a program called Freehand so you might want to read about that one as well before taking the plunge with Illustrator 10.</span>
