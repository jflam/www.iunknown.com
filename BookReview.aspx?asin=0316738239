                    <span>I am not a big fan of basketball, but I do remember Red Auerbach when he coached the Boston Celtics.  Red and many of his friends have weekly Tuesday get-togethers at the China Doll Restaurant in Washington, D.C. where they swap stories with one another.  Red gives his opinions on coaches today who he feels overcoach their team and often play to the cameras and fans by jumping up and down and screaming with their team up by 20 or 30 points with a minute or two in the game.  Red's rule for winning is simple: Get good players who are good people and you will have a winning team.  People say Red was a great coach because he had great players.  But, the author adds, "Who do you think chose the players?"  Red always has had a good relationship with Bobby Knight.  Knight said, "He (Red) was nice to me for no reason years ago and he never stopped."   A pet peeve of his is P.A. announcers who mumble the names of the visiting players during introductions and then boost up the P.A. system when the home team is introduced "as if they just saved the planet."  Red finally gave up coaching at the age of forty eight due to exhaustion.  Dealing with having to scout and being a general manager and keeping the team's talent pool coming had worn him out.  Reading this book is a learning experience for coaches on all levels, and I am proof you don't have to be a basketball fan to enjoy the book.  </span>

                    <span>Since John Feinstein's debut book, 1987's unexpected breakout smash-hit "A Season on the Brink", he has been cranking out about one book a year, a veritable franchise! "Let Me Tell You a Story" is his 16th book, albeit credited to co-writer Red Auerbach. I am neither a Celtic fanatic, or even a big NBA fan for that matter, but I am a sucker for a good story teller, and boy, I was not disappointed.
<br />
<br />"Let Me Tell You a Story" (346 pages) grew from Feinstein attencing the weekly luncheon get-togethers that Auerbach holds every Tuesday in a Chinese restaurant in Washington DC. One thing lead to another, and before we know it, we have a book containing many of those fun and entertaining stories of hoe Auerbach broke into basketball, got into coaching at the NBA when the league was started, and eventually coached and later general-managed the Celtics into the league's powerhouse. I didn't know that Auerbach's life was centered in Washington,  even when he coached the Celtics. As a George Washington U. graduate myself, it was fun to find out how big a supporter Auerbach is of the GW basketball program (Auerbach is an GW alum himself, class of 1940). The story about how he had GW finally get some really good hot dogs at the games nowadays, is hilarious.
<br />
<br />Auerbach is an impressive person, with a  memory of steel. His recollections of the early days are priceless, and Feinstein writes them up in an effortless and entertaining way. Is this a "deep" book? Of course not, but it sure makes for a great read.</span>

                    <span>This is one of two books which I have recently read, the other being Jeff Davis' Papa Bear: The Life and Legacy of George Halas. Both Auerbach and Halas were obviously great coaches but also outstanding CEOs, each building a successful and profitable franchise while playing a key role in a multi-billion dollar professional organization. In this instance, the National Basketball Association. 
<br />
<br />Although generally viewed as a sportswriter, Feinstein has always seemed (to me, at least) to be a cultural anthropologist who works very hard to understand not only major sports figures and events but also their social context. This is especially true of A March to Madness: A View from the Floor in the Atlantic Coast Conference, The Last Amateurs: Playing for Glory and Honor in Division I College Basketball, A Civil War: Army Vs. Navy (A Year Inside College Football's Purest Rivalry), and A Season on the Brink, a detailed account of the Indiana University men's basketball team's 1985-1986 season. 
<br />
<br />What we have in this volume is Feinstein's account of his close association with Arnold ("Red") Auerbach over a four-year period during which Feinstein was included among a select few who regularly met with Auerbach for lunch almost every week at the China Doll restaurant in Washington (DC). What emerges is a multi-dimensional portrait of Auerbach as revealed by his and others' reminiscences and observations. Feinstein also includes relevant information from his extensive research on Auerbach, the N.B.A., the Boston Celtics teams Auerbach coached, and their opponents. 
<br />
<br />By all accounts, he was a ferocious but highly-principled competitor. Agreeing with Sun Tzu that every battle is won or lost before it is fought, Auerbach drove his carefully selected players hard during the pre-season (and whenever the N.B.A. schedule allowed a practice) but then allowed them to play to their individual talents while insisting that they do so as a team. He expresses contempt for coaches who draw attention to themselves during a game in progress as well as for selfish or lazy players. All of his favorite coaches (notably Dean Smith, Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski, and Morgan Wootten) were/are dedicated teachers as well as strict disciplinarians and relentless taskmasters, renowned for developing individual talent while never allowing team integrity to be compromised. It is no coincidence that these same coaches are also among those whose teams have won the most games as well as numerous conference and national championships.
<br />
<br />Of greatest interest to me are Auerbach's self-revelations, most of which preceded by "Did I ever tell you about....?" or "Let me tell you about...." He seems eager to share stories about everyone he has known, with two exceptions: Len Bias, the University of Maryland All-American who died of a drug overdose immediately after being drafted #1 by the Celtics, and, Reggie Smith who was the Celtics captain when dying of a massive heart attack during a pickup game. "Both names bring a cloud to his face, a look of sadness. They are, without question, the two most tragic figures in the history of the Celtics." Feinstein provides a wealth of information about the sad circumstances in Chapter 8, "Dark Days." 
<br />
<br />Auerbach continues to have many close friends and countless admirers, not only in basketball or even in the sports world but throughout almost all elements of American society. For whatever reasons (Feinstein suggests several), he retains a certain mystique...especially for those who recall all the great Celtics teams and their N.B.A. Hall of Famers which include Auerbach; also Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Frank Ramsey, Bill Russell, and Bill Sharman.
<br />
<br />Perhaps Auerbauch's closest personal friend in the media, the Boston Globe's Will McDonough offers these comments about him. "First, he's smarter than you, he's smarter than me, he's smarter than just about all of us. He's got an amazing feel for people. That's what made him a great coach. People say he had great players. Who do you think chose those players? [Auerbach's Celtic teams won nine league championships in ten years with talent which he fully developed.] Every one of those guys is in the Hall of Fame. But every one of them listened to Red and did whatever he told them they had to do in order to win. That's why he always said that he never `handled' players. He never tried to handle anyone. He was completely honest with them, told them what was expected of them, and gave them a choice: my way or the highway. There was never any ambiguity." 
<br />
<br />Many of us who read this book will be somewhat envious of Feinstein because he was able to have lunch almost every Tuesday with Auerbach and his cronies, privy to what must have been exceptionally lively, often confrontational conversations. But we are also grateful that he shares so much of those conversations as well as much of what was revealed to him during interviews of hundreds of others who also had a close association with Arnold ("Red") Auerbach, arguably the greatest basketball coach ever and without doubt one of the most interesting human beings I have as yet encountered. </span>
