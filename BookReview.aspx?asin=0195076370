                    <span>This book was not what I thought it would be. Its part stat book, part biography, part history of the leagues. It is not as story-like as I expected and seems a bit fractured in places. Having said that, its a wonderful book that conveys a lot of the zeitgeist of the time. For a book with so many facts, it is surprisingly easy to read. Though, at times it seems to repeat itself, it still conjures up an age when African American players wore their caps sideways, introduced stealing bases on a regular basis etc... It is a shame that so many sad periods in world history become fascinating periods to read about for generations that follow after. Educational, entertaining and solidly researhed, bravo!</span>

                    <span>Most baseball fans are familiar with the great names and stories that  emanated from the Negro Leagues. Satchel Paige, ever the showman, often  asked his fielders to sit down while he struck out a dangerous hitter; Cool  Papa Bell was so fast that he could blow out a candle and be in bed before  the room got dark; and Josh Gibson may or may not have hit a ball  completely out of Yankee Stadium. Peterson includes these gems and much  more in this incredibly in depth history of the Negro Leagues. He  chronicles the history of the black ballplayer, beginning with those few  who actually played in the major leagues during the tail end of the  nineteenth century, before the doors were closed, and continuing into the  40's and 50's, when Jackie Robinson's arrival in Brooklyn led to the demise  of the Negro Leagues. Peterson relies almost exclusively on first-hand  accounts culled from the black press of the day and extensive interviews  from players and coaches. Also included is an appendix filled with year by  year standings and an alphabetical listing of Negro League players.  Certainly, this book is invalueable to anyone interested in learning about  the unknown greats from the Negro Leagues.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book to read. The title of the book tell a whole lot about the book. Stories told through the book tells about the hard times African Americans faced in the earlier years of baseball. The book also  tells how African Americans overcame the adversity that their skin color  put them in. The book also makes you wonder were would baseball be if  African Americans had the same chances as white people.</span>

                    <span>This book beautifully captures the heart and soul of what Negro League baseball was. Not only does this book give real insight into what the game meant to black players and fans, but helps one understand how the  alienation of blacks from big-league play was a great tragedy to the game.  This book makes me wonder how great the game could be today, if this  tragedy had not occurred.</span>
