                <span id="Label1">Ernest Hemingway famously declared <I>Huckleberry Finn</I> to be the true font of American prose--and in the case of his own stripped-down stories, he was right. But there's another, more rococo strain in our literature, of which fish fancier Herman Melville would be the undisputed king. So who better to chronicle his life in brief than Elizabeth Hardwick? This deliciously acerbic critic and novelist hasn't, of course, attempted to mimic Melville's language, which often sounds like the sort of thing Shakespeare would have written if he'd been an ichthyologist. But she, too, is the possessor of an eccentric, sometimes shaggy style, and has already written about Melville with rare penetration. Even her opening salvo has an appropriately over-the-top ring to it:  <blockquote> Herman Melville: sound the name and it's to be the romance of the sea, the vast, mysterious waters for which a thousand adjectives cannot suffice. Its mystical vibrations, the great oceans "holy" for the Persians, a deity for the Greeks; forbidden seas, passage to barbarous coasts--a scattering of Melville's words for the urge to know the sparkling waters and their roll-on beauty and, when angry, their powerful, treacherous indifference to the floundering boat and the hapless mariners.  </blockquote>  In a study of this length (160 pages), Hardwick doesn't even pretend to compete with such broad-canvas predecessors as Hershel Parker or Laurie Robertson-Lorant. But she hits all the high points (and the numerous low ones) in this all-American life, from Melville's earliest seagoing expeditions to his running aground in middle age. "The cabin boy became a family man," she notes, "or at least a man with a family, one always at home, but hardly the man of the house, with his scullery routine of writing at frightening speed, as if driven by a tyrannical overseer." There was, alas, worse to come: trapped in a dead-end job as a New York customs inspector, Melville retreated into desperate silence. But Hardwick burrows in to disclose new singularities, new complications, and to acknowledge that her subject's life is hardly less ambiguous than his art. "So much about Melville," we are told, "is <I>seems to be, may have been</I> and <I>perhaps</I>." What's certain, however, is that we could hardly find a better narrator than Hardwick herself. <I>--Bob Brandeis</I> </span>

                    <span>I have always been interested in the man behind Moby Dick, one of the great works of literature, but this book gives very little insight into the man and more info about the various books he authored.  If you want to know who Melville really was, skip this very limited biography and move to one that is better written and delves deeper into the life of this great author.</span>

                    <span>Having neither reading anything on or by Herman Melville, I found this book suitably interesting to whet my appitite for more; but overall, the narrative was not that great; Hardwick's writing is somewhat tedious and hampered by her apparent lack of expertise on the subject.</span>

                    <span>Heard the taped version of HERMAN MELVILLE by Karen<br>White and was most disappointed in it . . .

                    <span>A terrible introduction to Melville and his work.  Overwritten, inconsequent, self-indulgent, this is yet another flop from this mediocre series.  As for her readings of the novels, they are nothing but disguised plot summaries.  And her bibliography is scandalous--no Olsen, no CLR James, nothing by any of the major academics who have produced a series of readings of Melville in recent years.  Truly a waste of time.</span>

                    <span>This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.<p>When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding remarks would be appropriate.<p>Those who write reviews such as this one have other writers whom they especially admire. Mine are George Orwell, E.B. White, and Elizabeth Hardwick. You can thus understand my eagerness to read her biography of Melville. Early on, she observes that "....the sea was to give him his art, his occupation, but the actual romance of landscape, the sun on the waves, the stars at night, are nearly always mixed with with the brutality of life on board. And the art that saved him, the discovery of his genius, was a sort of Grub Street, a book a year, sometimes two." As Hardwick carefully explains, there was throughout Melville's life "a forlorn accent shadowing the great energy of his thought and imagination. There is a rueful dignity in his life and personal manner, and sometimes a startling abandonment of propriety on the pages."<p>On Elizabeth Shaw: "The marriage was more prudent for Melville than for his wife. He might long form male companionship, even for love, but marriage changed him from an unanchored wanderer into an obsessive writer, almost if there, in a house, in a neighborhood, there was nothing else for this man to do except to use the capital he had found in himself with the writing of Typee and Omoo [two of his earliest works]." (page 51)<p>On friendship with Hawthorne, to whom Moby Dick was dedicated: "Hawthorne and Melville met in the Berkshires, and a friendship developed unique in Melville's life, unique in inspiration and disappointment....Melville had found in Hawthorne the lone intellectual and creative friendship of his life, had found another struck by the terror and dark indifference of the universe...He would share the fate of being a writer in America, share his ragged banner: Failure is the test of greatness. But there was a disjunction of temperament, an inequality of fervor." (Page 66)<p>On Ishmael: "[He], the young man from Manhattan, is the moral center of [Moby Dick], a work tantalizingly subversive and yet somehow if not affirming at least forgiving of the blind destructiveness of human nature and of nature itself." (Page 84)<p>On Melville's death: "He died at home in his own house with a wife to care for him in his great distress and need. It appears he came to be grateful for her long years as Mrs. Melville, a calling certainly unexpected in her youth. Old age and habit, a settling down, a relief from the active `writhing' D.H. Lawrence named the condition of Herman melville's soul. If so, this ornament and pride of our culture was to end his days with a sigh, a resigned, bearable, pedestrian loneliness."<p>As is also true of the other volumes in the "Penguin Lives" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by Elizabeth Hardwick. I hope these brief excerpts encourage those who read this review to read her biography. It is indeed a brilliant achievement.</span>
