                <span id="Label1">&#8220;This expensive, glossy world is where I&#8217;ve been headed all along. Limos and flowers; waxed eyebrows and designer clothes from Barneys. These are my people; this is where I&#8217;m meant to be.&#8221; <br>&#8211;Becky Bloomwood<br><br>Universally beloved by readers, Sophie Kinsella&#8217;s national bestseller, <b>Confessions of a Shopaholic</b>, introduced the irrepressible one-woman shopping phenomenon, Becky Bloomwood. Now, in this hilarious follow-up, Becky and her credit cards are headed across the Atlantic....<br><br>With her shopping excesses (somewhat) in check and her career as a TV financial guru thriving, Becky&#8217;s biggest problem seems to be tearing her entrepreneur boyfriend, Luke, away from work for a romantic country weekend. And worse, figuring out how to &#8220;pack light.&#8221; But packing takes on a whole new meaning when Luke announces he&#8217;s moving to New York for business&#8211;and he asks Becky to go with him! <br><br>Before you can say &#8220;Prada sample sale,&#8221; Becky has landed in the Big Apple, home of Park Avenue penthouses and luxury department stores. <br><br>Surely it&#8217;s only a matter of time until she becomes an American TV celebrity, and she and Luke are the toast of Gotham society. Nothing can stand in their way, especially with Becky&#8217;s bills miles away in London. <br><br>But then an unexpected disaster threatens her career prospects, her relationship with Luke, and her available credit line! <b>Shopaholic Takes Manhattan</b>&#8211;but will she have to return it?<br></span>

                    <span>Don't worry that this sequel might be a letdown from "Confessions of a Shopaholic". I thought it was even better. Becky Bloomwood is back, this time with her television career going well, her love life in great shape ... but, with those old spending habits as strong as ever. Accompanying her boyfriend to the States, she hits New York City like a whirlwind and injects more than a little money into the NY economy. The plot of this book is, I think, quite a bit stronger than the first book with a little intrigue lurking in the background. If you've ever enjoyed a good shopping spree in New York (or have ever dreamed of having one), you will love her exploits. I read this book in a 24 hour period - I laughed and laughed and just couldn't get enough of it.</span>

                    <span>Shopaholic takes Manhattan<BR>Sophie Kinsella<P>	 Shopaholic Takes Manhattan is written by Sophie Kinsella. This is the second book in the series of Shopaholic books, which follows Confessions of a Shopaholic. The main character, Becky Bloomwood, is a financial expert on London's Morning Coffee. Becky doesn't even take her own financial advice. She is what the book calls her, a shopaholic. Her boyfriend, Luke, is all work no play, they are complete opposites. Luke wants to move his company to New York City and he wants Becky to move with him. They go for a two-week trip and Becky spends more in two weeks than she did in London. Becky goes back to London and loses everything; she moves out of her flat and sells everything at an auction. Luke's friend Michael offers her a job in Washington D.C. and she thinks that she will take it. Luke and Becky got into a fight and when Becky leaves to get on the plane Luke tries to stop her but she leaves anyway.<BR>	I enjoyed this book because it is realistic and far-fetched at the same time. A girl moves to NYC, loses all of her money and has to move back. Becky is a girl that thinks she has it all. She loses everything and learns how hard she has to work to get what she really wants. She tries to make it as a financial expert but realizes she'd rather do something that she likes. So Becky decides to do that, get a job that she enjoys and loves.<BR>	 I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to shop. I also would recommend this book to anybody who just wants a good laugh in a book.<P> BY:<BR> ~Becky K.~</span>

                    <span>If you read and enjoyed the first novel in this series (Confessions of a Shopaholic) then you'll probably enjoy this book too... because it's practically the same story over again. Girl shops compulsively, buries herself in debt, contributes to a blunder that affects nearly everyone she knows within a 50 mile radius, blindly stumbles upon the solution that not only brings her success and recognition, but the affection of the one and only Luke Brandon. Girl gets boy. Girl saves day.<P>The first three chapters of this book were so monotonous I considering chucking the whole thing. Kinsella's over-zealous reintroduction of our friend Becky crossed that gray line where humorous becomes annoying ridiculous. She gives us page after page of Becky's inner ramblings, her shopping philosophies and her self-absorbed outlook on life. I wanted to shout, "OK, I get it!" Then, around the fiftieth page, the story finally takes off with a hilarious account of Becky and Luke's first weekend getaway where certain obstacles present themselves and pave the path for the rest of the book. <P>After its awkward beginning, Kinsella's writing becomes clear, concise and downright funny. While the overall theme of this story clearly mirror's her previous one, I was still able to find myself laughing out loud at many of the scenarios. The creation of such lovable characters should be considered an accomplishment, and I look forward to reading Becky's next adventures in Shopaholic Ties the Knot.</span>

                    <span>I have been wanting to read "Shopaholic Takes Manhattan" ever since I finished reading the first book in this series, "Confessions of a Shopaholic." It took me awhile to get to it, but it was well worth the wait. <P>My favorite out of control shopper, Becky Bloomwood, is at it again and this time she's in New York!<P>She and her boyfriend, Luke, have flown to New York for a two week stay as he stakes the city out due to a job offer. What Becky finds in New York, however, is Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney's and the amazing thing known as sample sales. As far as Becky is concerned, she's in heaven.<P>Only being in heaven has gotten Becky even deeper into debt. In fact, she's in worse shape than she was back home in London! What's a girl to do?<P>I just love the ways that Becky comes up with to rationalize purchasing things (did you know that spending foreign money doesn't count when pinching pennies?). She is so genuine and really tries to be good, only she can't stop shopping.<P>If you loved "Confessions of a Shopaholic," you will love "Shopaholic Takes Manhattan" just as much. It is funny, witty and a must read!</span>
