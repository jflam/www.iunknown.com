                <span id="Label1"><div>Is a career as a professor the right choice for you? If you are a graduate student, how can you clear the hurdles successfully and position yourself for academic employment? What's the best way to prepare for a job interview, and how can you maximize your chances of landing a job that suits you? What happens if you don't receive an offer? How does the tenure process work, and how do faculty members cope with the multiple and conflicting day-to-day demands?<br><br>With a perpetually tight job market in the traditional academic fields, the road to an academic career for many aspiring scholars will often be a rocky and frustrating one. Where can they turn for good, frank answers to their questions? Here, three distinguished scholars--with more than 75 years of combined experience--talk openly about what's good and what's not so good about academia, as a place to work and a way of life. <br><br>Written as an informal conversation among colleagues, the book is packed with inside information--about finding a mentor, avoiding pitfalls when writing a dissertation, negotiating the job listings, and much more. The three authors' distinctive opinions and strategies offer the reader multiple perspectives on typical problems. With rare candor and insight, they talk about such tough issues as departmental politics, dual-career marriages, and sexual harassment. Rounding out the discussion are short essays that offer the "inside track" on financing graduate education, publishing the first book, and leaving academia for the corporate world.<br><br>This helpful guide is for anyone who has ever wondered what the fascinating and challenging world of academia might hold in store.<br><br>Part I - Becoming a Scholar<br>* Deciding on an Academic Career<br>* Entering Graduate School<br>* The Mentor<br>* Writing a Dissertation<br>* Landing an Academic Job<br>Part II - The Academic Profession<br>* The Life of the Assistant Professor<br>* Teaching and Research<br>* Tenure<br>* Competition in the University System and Outside Offers<br>* The Personal Side of Academic Life<br><br><br></div></span>

                    <span>I personally love this book and find it to be much more interesting, and in some ways informative, than a similar book I have which is a bit more clinical in its approach. It's full of personal anecdotes and lots of advice that I enjoyed. And why should anyone get mad just because the two white, male professors said they have not noticed any discrimination against women in their fields? They don't say there isn't any, and indeed, give some statistics and information to say there probably *is* discrimination, but of a more covert manner than in the past. This book has a chapter that my other book doesn't on counteroffers and moving around in academia, how to negotiate family and the 'two-body' problem, and other more intimate advice than some other books give. The authors seem to recognize that academics is not all about publishing, teaching, and service. It involves many other aspects of your life, and they touch on them. That said, a 3-hour chat with 3 of your own professors may be just as informative as this book, but the problem is getting your professors to sit down and have that chat with you! Here you get those 3 hours for a low price and can consult them later. I like the fact that these 3 don't hold themselves up as ultimate authorities, but simply as 3 different viewpoints of an academic life.</span>

                    <span>The format of this book is that the 3 authors - each who have had associations with the University of Chicago - take turns answering questions. Each one gives personal opinions about choosing to pursue graduate studies, the dissertation, the job hunt, aspects of tenure and the academy. Their viewpoints are somewhat narrow and I found the two male academics to be somewhat offensive at times. For example, when asked about the extent of discrimination in academia, both white males say that they have never seen any overt or covert discrimination! <BR>I think that there are more comprehensive and less biased sources of the general information the authors provide.<BR>To begin with, you would do better to sit down with three members of your department and ask the same questions.</span>
