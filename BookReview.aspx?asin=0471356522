                    <span>This book told the story of the great comeback of Continental Airline in an interesting and straight-forward way. We can understand clearly how Continental could do that within 2 years after Gordon Bethune became the Chief Executive Officer. <p>Continental Airline used to be a low-cost, employee-hated, huge leverage company with terrible service and financial situation. The new CEO Gordon Bethune used a ¡¥Go Forward Plan¡¦ which emphasize the product, employees, suppliers and creditor relationship to turnaround this huge but ¡¥horrible¡¦ airline giant.<p>Gordon Bethune put the emphasis on the product itself, making employees as business partners through communication, admitting and apologize for the mistakes, controlling financial situation. This shows that transformation requires a lot more than controlling cost.<p>The structure of the book is clear with key points always showing on the topic. Gordon Bethune used numerous examples and stories to illustrate the strategies he applied and what are the rationales behind. Despite the repetition of some contents, it is full of knowledge!</span>

                    <span>I have read this book over and over again, and it's great everytime. I'm no businessperson, but I understood every word because Bethune's easy to understand anecdotes made the book an enjoyable and understandable experience. I highly recommend this book to any airline enthusiast!</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed the style of writing and the anecdotes. But for someone who was searching for a way on HOW they changed Continental, I was a little disappointed.<br>Some of the explanations are enlightening and many others are standard textbook material.  A crucial message is imparted on the reader, however the great disappointment is that this message is repeated over and over and over.  You understand the point after 20 pages or so.<br>A book for a junior in the airline business or just someone with a particular passion for the airline world.  I don't recommend it to anyone who hopes to find complex explanations or examples in this book.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book, its full of examples, easy to understand, easy to read, great for everyone who is interested in the basics of management, not only of an airline, but any company.<p>I am new to the airline industry, and this book has let me understand a lot about it. Really easy to read, it is written in an easy language.<p>Contiental was the worst airline to fly, the worst airline to work for, and in 1994-1995 when Mr. Bethune rode the cockpit of it, in a year he made it to have its first profit in 10 years. How did he do it? Read this book.<p>This book was written previous to the September 11th 2001, so it has nothing about the recent economic crisis affecting all airlines worldwide, but it explains the plan (the Go Forward Plan) that has kept CO working these last years and how CO is, among major US carriers, one of the ones with less looses and debt in the industry.<p>Definitely a must read!</span>
