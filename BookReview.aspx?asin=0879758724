                    <span>This book is not only an eye opener but it also expresses Kevorkian frustration with the governments control over medicine. It's kind of nice to see that old people have issues they like to fight for as well. At one point talks of his quest to encourage the government to allow peoplle on death row to donate their bodies to science but the government. Kevorkian is a good man and it saddens me to think what the media has done to him.</span>

                    <span>``Dr. Death'' got his start with campaigns to allow death row inmates to donate their organs (currently organ donation is impossible). If you take a heart, a liver, two kidneys, two corneas, and bone marrow from a willing donor with a known execution date, and you can save quite a few lives with his death.<P>It's common-sense arguments like these, not grisly death-obsession, that makes this book worth reading. I expect that some readers will find the sections on euthanasia distasteful, but the subject is handled carefully and smartly. <P>For all his faults, Kevorkian is a strong and articulate voice who is too often written off automatically as a crank and a murderer. Read this book in order to balance your perspective, then judge him if you wish.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book here from Amazon and after reading it I sent it, along with a nice letter in support of Kevorkian to him. Within 2 weeks he personally signed and returned my book to me. <P>I enjoyed this book. It explains how and why he got into assisted suicide. <P>If you are against what Dr. Jack does, be open minded and read this book. He is not a weird old man, he is a humanitarian. He makes no salary, and does this because he doesn't want people to suffer. <P>You will enjoy this book... I couldn't put it down.</span>

                    <span>This is a very boring book about some of Dr. Kevorkian's early years in medicine. His quest to help give death row inmates the chance to volunteer their unconscious body for medical experimentation, or to donate their organs for transplantation before being executed.</span>
