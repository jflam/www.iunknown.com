                    <span>1. The book is about George Washington. The book started at his early childhood and goes to his death. He was a student. He loved arithmetic.  Then he was a surveyer of the Virigina wilderness.He fought in the French and Indian War. He got married to a widow with 2 children. Then he was the leader of the Colonial Army.
<br />2.This book made me feel different about the war because they had to suffer in the cold weather.
<br />3. The setting taks place in a lot of different places. The main place of the is at his home. He rides his horse every were he goes.
<br />4. I recomend thisn book to people who lokes to read Historical Fiction.

                    <span>I am preparing a lesson plan for first graders and this book works great as an anticipatory set.  The pictures are colorful and engaging.  The book also brings simplicity to a biography about Washington, bringing up important facts and dates.</span>

                    <span>The entire "A picture book of..." biography series byDavid Adler is outstanding. Perfect for lower elementary studentsdoing their first real report. Makes a great read-aloud for non-readers as they are easily completed in one sitting. The cute cartoon-like pictures are kid friendly. But most importantly, they are loaded with information including a timeline of important events.</span>
