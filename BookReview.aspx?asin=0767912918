                <span id="Label1"><P>Frances Kuffel had been obese all of her life, coming of age and beyond feeling like a freak. For years, she struggled with her weight until, at forty-two, she lost an incredible 188 pounds. Transformed at last into the &#8220;normal" woman she always dreamed of becoming, Kuffel found herself unprepared for life on the planet of the thin. With unflinching honesty and a wickedly dark sense of humor, <i>Passing for Thin</i> is the first memoir to take readers on the incredible journey from fat to thin, shining a light on the shared human experience of feeling, at times, uncomfortable in our own skin.<br><br>After a life of obesity robbed her of the joys of having lovers, a husband, children&#8212;and even made it impossible to enjoy a movie, when standing in line was too painful, or travel, when airplane seats were too small&#8212;Kuffel was catapulted into a strange new world where she didn&#8217;t speak the language and didn&#8217;t know the rules. While other girls had already learned how to flirt and date, and while other women her age had long-ago lost their teenage self-consciousness, Kuffel became an awkward adolescent in a body she did not know how to use. In<i> Passing for Thin, </i>she shares her clear-eyed account of moving from observer to player, while struggling to enjoy the freedom and pleasure her new shape has given her. <br><br><br>As Kuffelgradually comes to know&#8211;and love&#8211;the stranger in the mirror, she learns that this body does not define her, but now frees her to become the woman she's always wanted to be.</p></span>

                    <span>Note to readers: this is not a how-to! Don't expect a lesson in how to lose 170 pounds.<P>What Frances Kuffel does here is document a lifetime of emotions (and emotional damage) that accompany HER weight (and weight loss). I've struggled with my weight since my early teens (although not to the same extreme as she) and there's a lot of truth in this book. The compulsiveness, the anger, the disappointment, her flip responses when she is excluded from things because of her obesity. I think the prose reads fine: maybe what's more unpalatable to some readers is her me-me-meism. But put it in context: she obviously has more going on in her life than a weight problem (meds for depression, family issues - note the very abrupt reference to her oldest brother's death, ongoing health concerns) and she reads as someone who is emotionally immature and still finding her way. One reviewer complains she isn't always kind to other obese people. Unfortunately, that is sometimes a normal side effect of weight loss. Go on any weight loss message board and you will find people just like her. We want to grab and shake anyone we see who has a weight problem and is eating Ding-Dongs, Fritos and a Coke for lunch. <P>Ms. Kuffel could have chosen to tell a very slick, Disneyfied story about losing an incredible amount of weight (anyone who's never dieted has no IDEA what kind of discipline she had to have to pull that off) but she chose to tell the truth, warts and all. There's a sweetness and humanity here as well as a heaping helping of ugliness. I see a lot of what she says as internal dialogue, so I doubt she was as unpleasant a person as some other reviewers have suggested. True, there are some weird moments (her miscarriage/breakup metaphor and brief reference to 9/11) but the flaws in this book only add to the too-human picture of Francie.<P>If you go in without expectations and do some in-between-the-lines reading, there's a lot here, especially for people who have struggled and continue to struggle with their weight. If you've been there, this book makes some sense. If you haven't, it probably won't touch you.</span>

                    <span>As a person on the path to weight loss, "Passing For Thin" piqued my interest because it told the story of the journey within. This is not a diet book.<P>Kuffel's story begins when she realizes that she is a food addict. She joins O.A. and loses over 150 lbs. She is no longer the Fat Girl, who is insulated by her fat, who is treated differently, who could coast through life insulated from pain. She reveals that she is a beautiful woman with great legs, desirable to men and striking to women. And it scares the heck out of her. She struggles with this new role and is unsure of who she is and how to live. Her journey is facsinating, revealing and at times down-right frightening. <P>Kuffel is a wonderful writer with a gift of storytelling. <P>I recommend this book to those on the weight loss journey because it shows there is more to it besides a thin body. You won't be "instantly" happy. You have to work hard on different fronts: body, mind and spirit. And Kuffel shows it can be done.</span>

                    <span>I know what it is to be like Frances, both ways. I also know that you don't have to shed brain cells with your fat cells. She writes well. Her observations on how fat women are treated and her "fat story" ring painfully true. I freely commend the incredible work she did in weight loss, (all the more impressive since she clearly has multiple addictions to address). These elements simply don't balance, for me, the fact that I am appalled at the person she has revealed by the end of the book. She is only too ready to tell us--endlessly and jocularly--how beautiful she is, an opinion I'm afraid I cannot share. She boasts endlessly of this and her intellect--despite a lackluster career record and occasional startling lapses in her writing--to an extent that can only suggest a virulent self-hatred, and which severed my support of her early in the book. This is never more appallingly clear than when she refers disdainfully to other fat people as "fatties," in particular describing a zealous new O.A. member as "a fatty smug in her chub." A good deal of text is devoted to her quest for A Man (hardly unique), how many men "look" at her and shopping-- "my crowning achievement in being able to wear Dolce & Gabbana." Her narcissism is never clearer than in the statement, "I'm a snob. I don't really like fat people much. I want a pretty sponsee, someone I can be proud of," who had "what I wanted to encourage" rather than a unique self for her to help reveal. For me, she ranks with Carnie Wilson in defining herself by, and embracing, those very values--shallow, cruel, competitive and contemptuous--that have made life in a fat body so painful for her, and for all overweight women. She's the quintessential "upwardly mobile" climber from a second-class status who has kicked the faces below her on the ladder and slammed the door behind her. Her chronicle records such a pattern of increasing recidivism with every "binge," that I think her story is far from over, but I can't wish her luck.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book was fascinating. I'm glad that Frances concentrated on what it's like to live after the weight loss. Losing weight is not the hard part -- every really fat person has done it more than once and can recite four or five comprehensive weight loss plans from memory. I've got about 300 pounds on my 5'4" frame right now, but I've lost and gained more than that over the years. I am a weight loss expert. <P>The really hard part is keeping the weight off -- dealing with what its like to see yourself differently and be seen differently by everyone around you. Sometimes, literally, not recognizing yourself in the mirror or waking up and laying there trying to remember what you look like without looking in the mirror. Having everybody you know feel like they can comment on and openly appraise your changing body. Having people who were never nice to you, mysteriously like you all of a sudden. Having some of your old friends behave badly toward you and just suspecting why. Finding that both your clothes and your psyche no longer fit your body and not being sure how to replace them. Now, that's hard. That's where I, and so many others, fail.<P>If I were to meet Frances Kuffel, I would thank her for writing such an honest book and for helping me imagine what making the transition would really be like. Thank you for sharing the raw truth of your experience, your strength, your faults, and your feelings. Thank you for admiting that both you, and life after weight loss, are not perfect. It made your tale so much more believable. May the blessings of a Higher Power (I vote for God, but willingly accept your preference for Prozac) be upon you.</span>

                    <span>I couldn't put the book down. I read it in two days. Ms. Kuffel is so honest about her body and mindset before, during and after the weight loss that she has offended other readers whose reviews appear here. Ms. Kuffel is no Richard Simmons, thank God. How refreshing to hear from an intelligent, thoughtful person that losing all the weight not isn't an automatic ticket to lifelong bliss, rather an entry into a new life that has its own set of challenges. The weight loss industry has enough smiley-faced spokespeople. I was delighted to hear a rawer, more honest voice.<BR>I am not obese but have two sisters and two close friends with lifetime obesity issues (thus I remain anonymous). Frances' "wearing out" friends who can't take her depression, entropy that keeps her in a rotten job for 12 years, apartment in a state of complete disarray, as well as the litany of day to day humiliations - all of these things are pages from lives I know well. In fact, one of my sisters became gorgeously thin for the first time after college and promptly gained it back when the thin world overwhelmed her with similar challenges to Frances'. <BR>Anyone in Frances' position could write a book about stories of humiliation while fat, a grueling weight loss regimen, and subsequent rise to svelte glory. But thousands of these books have already been written, the authors then catapulting themselves into money making empires of weight loss wisdom. What makes Frances' book special is precisely some of the things that have put off other reviewers (sorry folks, but the prose is a little more uppity than People Magazine). Frances dares to dislike other fat women. She, a New Yorker who eye-witnessed the Trade Center attacks, is thinking about a date on September 12. Jarring, but then I realized that she hadn't dated her whole life - it reminded me of one of my sisters, finally dating for the first time in decades, throwing aside all else for the sake of a crush. It's not pretty but it is very true.<BR>A final comment I had was with her father, who she certainly loves a great deal. I am sorry he was not more sympathetic. Since so many of us look to marry our fathers, I hope that this doesn't attract her to a similarly emotionally stingy man.</span>
