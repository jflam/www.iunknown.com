                    <span>We used this book to plan a two week "tour" of the front range and it was great.  I particularly like the way it is organized by city or region, then by activity (accomodations, dining, attractions etc).<p>After skimming the areas we planned to visit once, I went back and made a list of the things we wanted to see and do.  The book provided hours, prices, phone numbers and directions for each item.  This helped plan the day so we didnt miss something because it was closed.  <p>The descriptions are fairly complete and offer more info than the "hotel tourist stand" brochure from the same place.  This let us decide, in advance, to skip things that were overly expensive or didnt sound appealing, instead of being disappointed for having spent the time and money. <p>The guide also has info for lots of places that the state tourism department packet left out.<p>On the same trip, we used the Insider's Guide to the Bad Lands and Black Hills and, even though it used a similar organization we found it much less useful.</span>

                    <span>This is a well written guide book that is really easy to use. If you want to read all about Colorado before you go it has an easy style and entertaining commentary that makes it an enjoyable and informative read. If, on the other hand, you just want to look up some information about what there is to do or see in a place you have just arrived in, the index and easy to read headings make this a quick and easy guide to use. It also contains some very current information about the area and includes web addresses to look up for further details about specific attractions. Restaurant recommendations are good - I tried out a few!  Like other Frommers guides it has a good pull-out colour map and useful small street plans in the book. All in all I would give this book a thumbs up.</span>
