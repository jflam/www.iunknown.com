                    <span>I purchased this book a while ago, and was disappointed with  it ever since.  Regardless of what Amazon's Editorial says; it is a NEWBIE book.  All of the tips and tricks in this book are common knowledge among the Mac community.  I'd say out of the entire book only 5 of the tips are useful.  The book uses its design and layout to padd out the size so that it looks worth it.  Its not.<p>If you want more knowledge help books look else where.  If you need help with Jaguar or Panther check out sites like <http://www.macosxhints.com> or the others.<p>I'm sorry but this book left me disappointed and wanting my money back.</span>

                    <span>I decided I had to speak out against this book before other unsuspecting geeks were barraged with Scott Kelby's patronizing platitudes. This book *does* have some useful tips -- I will begrudgingly give it that. But at what price!<p>Outside of the very occasional, tiny pearl, this book has little to recommend itself. The author's style is pedantic at best. It would appear that Mr. Kelby wrote the entire book to comment on how clever he is and how useless Apple's Human Interface folks are. <p>All this would certainly be forgiveable, or at least bearable, if only there were sufficient, useful information contained herein. It couldn't be farther from the reality of the situation! Not only is there little in the book that isn't solved by looking at the interface (e.g. using the Dock preference pane to change dock behavior, using the red/x button to close non-active windows, getting "More Info" from the System Profiler by using the "About This Mac..." dialog box), the author will deliberately avoid giving useful information to the reader to impress on us the value of his solution.<p>Take for instance the "problem" addressed at the bottom of page 87, command (apple) + n does not create a new folder (as it did in Mac OS 9). Mr. Kelby does not point out that you now just need to become accustomed to using another finger to hold down the shift key in addition to "command" and "n". No! He suggests instead that you control click in the appropriate place and select "New Folder" from the pop-up contextual menu!<p>I plan to keep this book for reference now that I own it for the occasional interesting tidbit, but unless you enjoy being talked down to as a reader and letting a book get away with assuming it's preaching to an appreciative choir all the while, do not buy this book.</span>

                    <span>If you've used OS X for a little while you'll know most or all of these.  (Unless you're pretty slow to pick things up on computers.)  If the book were marketed that way, I'd give it 5 stars, since it looks great for complete beginners, pointing out little things like "Command-A selects all the files in the folder you have open" I'm not kidding! the things are that obvious.  Anyone who takes the time to look at the keystroke short cuts listed in the menus and play around and hit all the buttons and right-click everywhere will already know 95% of this.  I did learn two things: you can add aliases to your button bars in the Finder, and leaving an app open in OS X barely uses any resources.  Nice but not worth the price of the book.<p>Get Rael Dornfest's OS X Hacks instead if you want to learn something new.</span>

                    <span>This book is pretty good, it provided me with some tips that i had been wondering how to do, but some of the tips were of no use whatsoever. for instance, there was one tip that asked "are you the only user on your computer? then why do you have to log in every single time you turn it on? well, when you set up your computer, don't put a password in, that way you can just click login and you're on your way!" This seems pointless to me, there are also other things in the book that he says are total neusances but don't really bother me at all. So, i think that it is still a useful book, but not worth 5 stars.</span>
