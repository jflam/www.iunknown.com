                <span id="Label1">The next business revolution--using the power of stories as the ultimate source of influence and impact.  <P>What's your story? Who are you? Where do you come from? What do you want? When you seek to influence others, you face these questions and more. Whether you're proposing a risky new venture, trying to close a deal, or leading a charge against injustice, you have a story to tell. Tell it well and you will create a shared experience with your listeners that can have profound results.  <P>In this highly accessible and groundbreaking book, Annette Simmons reminds us that the oldest tool of influence is also the most powerful. Showcasing over a hundred examples of effective storytelling drawn from the front lines of business and government, as well as myths, fables, and parables form around the world, Simmons illustrates how story can be used to persuade, motivate, and inspire in ways that cold facts, bullet points, and directives can't. A great read, <I>The Story Factor</I> will guide and inspire you to become a more effective communicator.</span>

                    <span>I am responsible for leadership development in the largest healthcare system in the country--the Veterans Healthcare Administration. As part of a rigorous two-year leadership development program for mid-management high potentials, we use this book to not only highlight the power of communicating through storytelling, but we give participants experience in finding, constructing and telling their own powerful stories by using the guidelines in the text. <P>We floundered in this part of our curriculum until we found The Story Factor, which combines the "why" and the "how" in a very easy-to-understand fashion. The frequent examples from the business world help to overcome the resistance of the physicians and other "reluctant yarn-spinners" in the room.<P>If you need a "how-to" on storytelling, this is your book. And if you appreciate listening to an author's unique voice as she speaks with passion, it's for you, too. Useful AND enjoyable!</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend Annette Simmons The Story Factor for a new and different look at the way we communicate. I especially found it useful in analyzing how people process information, and then applying that to how to reach people on difficult topics. <BR>Storytelling is a fine art in the entertainment world, and there are many sources to hone your skills on this. But Annette has provided insights and practical tips that have been particularly useful for me using story-telling in the working world. There is nothing more painful than learning that your work or project is ending or not being used. With some of the strategies in this book, I have found ways to help people recognize and be satisfied with what they have done, and continue on to the next project with a shorter "grieving" cycle, so we can all become more productive again quickly. Also, I have found ways to use story to help build our work teams to quickly coalesce around the goal and tasks at hand, when we have incredibly tight deadlines and little time for the usual necessary "bonding" that a team needs to reach optimum productivity. <BR>I highly recommend this book as both useful and an entertaining read at the same time.</span>

                    <span>This book does what any book about applied storytelling should do: it describes how to apply storytelling without compromising storytelling's artistic heart.<P>Annette offers the book as a way to achieve "inspiration, influence and persuasion." By the end of the book, the reader learns that the "secret" of influence is, in fact, what has drawn so many fans to the art of storytelling: stories persuade because they lead us to the common ground of mutual respect - not by giving one party a secret weapon with which to manipulate the other. In Annette's words:<P>"Story doesn't grab power. Story creates power.... As a storyteller you borrow a story's power to connect people to what is important and to help them make sense of their world." (Page 29).<P>"The Story Factor" is my favorite "storytelling in business" book. To be sure, I had the pleasure of writing the forward to it. I did so in part because Annette has been my student in storytelling as well as my mentor in my own work with businesses. But I would never write a forward to any book in which I did not believe as deeply as I believe in my own books. I receive no payment from sales of "The Story Factor."<P>Here are some particular things I liked about "The Story Factor":<P>1. The description of the "Six Stories You Need to Know How to Tell" is worth the price of the book. People want the answers to certain questions before they'll give you a chance to persuade them of anything. These six stories achieve some of your essential interpersonal goals right away, and lay the groundwork for you to achieve the others.<P>2. In the chapter called "What Stories Do That Facts Can't," Annette shows how your stories can de-escalate conflict, side-step traps laid for you, avoid the "because I said so" kind of arguments, broaden a discussion by grounding it in a wider reality, etc.<P>3. One of Annette's chapters takes up one of my least favorite questions: "How do I tell a good story?" Why do I dread being asked that question? Because it seems to pre-suppose that there is a recipe for telling stories that works in all situations. In her characteristic Aikido-like way, however, Annette directs her readers to follow solid, easy-to-use advice that doesn't lock them into a limited formula. She briefly and convincingly outlines nine key points to keep in mind - that will nearly guarantee good telling.<P>4. Annette's tone hits that "sweet spot" between the hype of so many pop business books, on the one hand, and the dense, soggy prose that deadens so many academic-type books on communication, business strategies, etc., on the other. She speaks to her reader with conversational ease - but without "selling" or oversimplifying.<P>5. Annette's book is filled with memorable, well-told stories. Some are brief enough to throw into a conversation; others could be the keystone of a speech. The story about the red and green shoes is now part of my permanent mental landscape, as are the burning piano and the silent door-to-door salesman. With few exceptions, Annette integrates the stories into her chapters, rather than separating them into self-contained boxes. She never says why; I'll bet, though, that it's because she believes that stories persuade best when they aren't self-consciously introduced as "stories," but when they flow out of your very being, your attitude toward your listeners, and your commitment to your message.<P>If you care at all about using storytelling in an organization, for persuasion, or to get across a personal message, you'd be foolish to pass up this book. Beginners in the use of story will be well guided; experts will find great new stories to tell as well as a clear, systematic exposition of how story works in practice - and, underlying it all, a refreshing, inspiring perspective about how humans actually persuade each other. This book is not only about influence; it has already become highly influential. Miss it at you own risk!</span>

                    <span>Since I consider Power Point presentations a notch below prehistoric cave painting as an effective form of communication, I have sought out and read the best books that I could find on the art of storytelling as I am interested in its application in the field of management. The Story Factor is quite simply the best book I have read on the topic. Simmons doesn't bore the reader to death with theory but gives the specifics necessary to make this an essential "how to" book. I recommend it for any manager who wants to incorporate the use of dynamic story in his or her skill set.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book during a recent business trip to the US, hoping that it would "teach" a few tips on how to build your own personal stories, facts and so on.<BR>To my disapointment the author does not do that. She goes on and on preaching the benefits of using stories, how wonderful they are, the impact they can have on peoples life and so on. But she never stops to discuss the structure of a good story, how to identify your own mistakes when constructing one and keep improving your own technics. SO if you are looking for a book that will tell you how important a stoty is and the situations it can be used, perhaps you will benefit from this work. If you are beyond that level, sorry this is not it.<BR>To be honest, after reading all the positives reviews from other readers I was left with a simple question: Did I read the same book they have??</span>
