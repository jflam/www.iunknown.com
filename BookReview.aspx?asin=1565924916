                <span id="Label1">Be more productive and make your life easier. That's what <i>LDAP System Administration</i> is all about.  System administrators often spend a great deal of time managing configuration information located on many different machines: usernames, passwords, printer configurations, email client configurations, and network filesystem configurations, to name a few. LDAPv3 provides tools for centralizing all of the configuration information and placing it under your control. Rather than maintaining several administrative databases (NIS, Active Directory, Samba, and NFS configuration files), you can make changes in only one place and have all your systems immediately "see" the updated information.  If you want to be a master of your domain, <i>LDAP System Administration</i> will help you get up and running quickly regardless of which LDAP version you use. After reading this book, even with no previous LDAP experience, you'll be able to integrate a directory server into essential network services such as mail, DNS, HTTP, and SMB/CIFS.</span>

                    <span>First of all, be advised that this book only covers OpenLDAP. Although this was exactly what I was using, it makes more sense for the book to be retitled so as not to set the wrong expectations. Now, I'll talk about what this book does well.<P>The book does an adequate job of explaining the whole installation process. It actually does miss the fact that when installing LDAP, you need to set two environment variables if your Berkeley DB location is non-standard. After a little searching, I found this on the web. Along these lines, it was good with explaining what your directory structure would look like after your install (which is helpful, as OpenLDAP blasts things all over the place) and how to start and stop the server. It also mentions various ways to set security levels and hashing techniques to make sure that your password is not stored in cleartext. So why only two stars?<P>The overall theme of this book is that it is extremely light on information. If you're the kind of person that likes a little handholding, do NOT get this book! On almost every topic, you'll be left saying, "Okay, where's the next example on this topic?", only to be left hanging. Creating custom schemas was covered in TWO pages (pgs 95-97)! There's no mention of integrating LDAP with the various app servers out there today (Java Servlet/Bean containers, PHP, ASP, etc.). None! Again, I had to search the web to find out how to do this. This led me to binding errors that, once again, the book did not address. Again (this will be a recurring theme), I found the answers on the net. <P>I hate to say it but there is nothing that this book provides that can not be found on the web very easily. It doesn't provide that golden nugget that you couldn't find anywhere else. Within a week, you'll have scrubbed it for all it's worth and will rely 100% on the web for info that the book should provide. Which brings up another point. It's annoying to spend nearly $30 on a book to constantly have the author tell you "For more information on this subject, look at reference..."). On two separate occasions I found myself saying, "Wait a minute! Why should I need another reference book for basic LDAP info? I thought I bought an LDAP book already!"<P>Trust me guys, this book is not worth buying at any price. I'm looking to sell mine now!</span>

                    <span>The book starts with a section on a brief introduction of LDAP before moving in LDAPv3 overview. OpenLDAP takes two chapters, then a section of chapters on Application Integration. Letting LDAP replace NIS, integrating with email, Unix and LDAP, LDAP interoperability and LDAP and Perl finish the chapters off. There are some appendixes that include some of the common Attributes and Objects also.<P>If you are using Windows and some LDAP application this book does not contain a lot of information for you specific to the OS, but is a great reference for LDAP overall. Most of the code examples rely on Unix understandings. The review of access and OpenLDAP applies directly to numerous systems in understanding how rights are applied.<P>Replication and referrals is a great topic that is covered well for the beginner. For someone wanting advanced architecture ideas and designs, this chapter does not go deep enough for you. But I enjoyed it still letting me review and pick up a few items I was unaware of.<P>LDAP administrators that are just starting out, or even ones that have been doing LDAP for some time and need to secure or expand the directory infrastructure could benefit from this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is an awesome reference for someone interested in SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION (hence the title.) If you are a newbie looking for broader, philosophical reasoning or basic directory theory, this is NOT the book for you. If you know why you want a directory and understand the basics, then this book will definitely meet your needs. I was especially pleased with the no-nonsense approach, that got me up and running with a replicated directory, including referrals and references, by page 90. Excellent recommendations with enough detail to get the job done, along with great references to other resources and tools. The only thing that was lacking was the Samba integration chapter, which is 2.2 based, probably due to the book's age. While there are other resources out there, a second edition would still be nice.</span>

                    <span>This book is probably the best book I have ever read on OpenLDAP implimentation. The title is somewhat misleading in that it does not go into LDAP in general, including deep history, heavy schema development, etc. <P>However, it covers the down and dirty of implimenting OpenLDAP in detail. It covers:<P>-detailed slapd.conf configuration<BR>-pam_ldap<BR>-nss specific and pam specific configuration parameters in ldap.conf<BR>-DNS implimentation with LDAP<BR>-conversion tools<P>This book is an excellent guide on actually putting LDAP to work, including design, configuration and implimentation.<P>This book is NOT designed for people looking to impliment other LDAP software (iPlanet, etc). This book does not cover in depth enterprise level roll-out, research, and user feedback. <P>But if you want a great book that covers configuration and usage of OpenLDAP and Linux..this IS the book for you.</span>

If your objective is learning the conceptual aspects of ldap in general, much better books exist. <P>Bottem Line: Weak examples, superficial explanations, outdated material.
