                <span id="Label1">This new collection from cyclist Bob Roll reflects his unique perspective on the professional racing circuit and his own brand of dry humor. Straightforward yet sly, funny but perhaps a little crazy, Roll calls it like he sees it. Here are anecdotes about the Tour de France, international mountain-bike tournaments, training struggles, heart-stopping crashes, and personal vendettas, all of which provide a fascinating inside look at the world of championship cycling.</span>

                    <span>It starts out a little rough with the daily entries of a testosterone-dipped, California-hip, sunshine-drenched-fresh-air-and-dirt 20-something, but feels genuine and possesses occasional lines of brilliance. Once the boy enters his 30s and the book dives into the mountain biking scene, the writing matures into shining brilliance, constricting my pupils to tiny pinholes behind my Oakleys till the very end. And this has to be one of the most hilarious things I've ever read (on par with Thomas Pyncheon's candy-eating scene in Gravity's Rainbow) - causing mio sposo to roll over and grumble in his sleep due to the bed shaking like jello in the back of a pick-up bouncing down a washboard road from my laughing so hard while reading this thing in bed (homage to Bobke - I am not worthy!). As for previous reviewer comment re: needing a cycling pro background to get it - granted I would be a tifosa if I was Italian, but I just came into this whole cycling thing in the last three years or so, and I didn't run into any trouble getting it, especially with the Who's Who Glossary for Dummies -- it ain't the history of the Chinese dynasties. Anyway, the soul of this book is not about the cycling scene - it's about someone who tears into life with intense energy, showing his unbridled love for it with heat-seeking cynicism and humor and more than a touch of insanity.</span>

                    <span>Bobke II is for serious fans of cycling, and probably those that also cycle themselves. There are very few pro riders out there who write about what it's like to live eat and breathe bike racing, especially in the 80's and 9o's -- before Lance made it so big. Yes, it's often Bob's diary entries, and they can be random, but it's better than anything else out there. <P>For some reason Bobke's first book is going for between $300 and $400 on the used books sites. This book contains all the material from his first book -- and the second half is all new.<P>A cyclist who can write, and be funny? That's rare. So is Bobke.</span>

                    <span>As someone who loves cycling but finds most books on the subject more boring than watching paint dry, this book is a refreshing change. Bob Roll takes you riding in the pelaton, on the training rides, and into the heart of a professional cyclist; which after reading this book you will never look at the same again. <P>Part of Roll's charm comes from being exceptionally unexceptional. Though never having any great wins he was able to have a long career, ride in the big tours and experience the sport from the inside; all because of his relentless work ethic which seemed to be fueled by his pure love of cycling.<P>If you've ever watched the Tour De France and scratched your head wondering what it is about this sport that draws hundreds and thousands screaming fans to pack the roadways to see these little skinny shaved legged men wearing garishly colored jerseys race past in a blink of the eye, Bobke will answer this. You will see cycling as this great sport; this drama of man against man, team against team, and man against himself - all played out on this wonderful little machine the bicycle.</span>

                    <span>I got this book as a gift for Father's Day, and after the second page I was hooked. If you are a serious competitive cyclist and have had your head deep into this crazy sport, you won't be able to put it down. Maybe a bit random, but if I want to read Grisham, Koontz, or King, I'll buy one of their books. For a window into the world of professional cycling at its most glamorous and its worst, this is a must read. If I could give it 6 stars I would. But then again, I am a Bobke fan.</span>
