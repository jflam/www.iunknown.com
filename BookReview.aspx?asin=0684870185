                <span id="Label1"><P> More than any other sports figure, Vince Lombardi transformed football into a metaphor of the American experience. The son of an Italian immigrant butcher, Lombardi toiled for twenty frustrating years as a high school coach and then as an assistant at Fordham, West Point, and the New York Giants before his big break came at age forty-six with the chance to coach a struggling team in snowbound Wisconsin. His leadership of the Green Bay Packers to five world championships in nine seasons is the most storied period in NFL history. Lombardi became a living legend, a symbol to many of leadership, discipline, perseverance, and teamwork, and to others of an obsession with winning. In <I>When Pride Still Mattered,</I> Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Maraniss captures the myth and the man, football, God, and country in a thrilling biography destined to become an American classic.</span>

                    <span>David Maraniss has written the story of a champion, Vince Lombardi, covering his life from birth in Brooklyn in 1913 to his untimely death in 1970. The book briefly describes his family background noting that his father with his father's brother owned their own business selling wholesale meat. Family, religion and sports shaped Lombardi's childhood. While sometimes inaccurately portrayed as a martinet, this is misleading, as he was a more complex person. The author traces Lombardi's development as he progressed from playing high school football, to college football at Fordham, to an assistant coach at Army, to finally becoming an outstanding NFL head coach. <P> Many influenced Lombardi's career. On page 245 the author notes "The fundamental principles that he used in coaching-repetition, discipline, clarity, faith, subsuming individual ego to a larger good-were merely extensions of the religious ethic he had learned from the Jesuits." From Army coach Red Blake he learned how to organize a team and prepare it to play its best. <P>Interestingly, his first head-coaching job was as a high school basketball coach. He knew little about basketball but coached his team to a regional championship. He began his football-coaching career at St. Cecilia High School in North Jersey staying eight years and developing there many of the skills that later allowed him to stand apart form the coaching multitudes. The text narrates Lombardi's coaching career from St. Cecilia, to an assistant coach under Red Blake at Army, to his first pro-football coaching job in 1954 as offensive coach for the New York Giants. The author notes that with the Giants "Lombardi began to earn the respect of the pros.. .If he had to adjust, he would find the means; it was a talent that exhibited for the rest of his coaching career, though it often went unrecognized, overshadowed by his public image as the implacable leader who demanded that the world adapt to him." The Giants offense scored 264 points in 1956, the most in the East, and the press began to recognize him. <P>In 1959 Lombardi went to Green Bay Packers as general manager and head coach. Here "He would have no tolerance for the halfhearted, the defeatist, the loser. The goal was to be the New York Yankees of football. World champions, every day, year round. Admired everywhere." The Packers ended their first season with Lombardi with a record of 7 and 5, the first Packer winning season in a dozen year; and Lombardi was named NFL coach of the year in an Associated Press poll of sportswriters and sportscasters. As the old saying goes "From this point on it was all history."<P>The text continues the Lombardi story which is the birth and history of modern NFL football as the game emerged from it one conference to today's era of two conferences and the Super Bowl. Along with the story of Lombardi's coaching career and his outstanding record with the Packers which included two Super Bowl Championships, the author relates the fascinating stories of Packer greats such as Bart Starr, Paul Hornung, Ray Nitschke, Forrest Greg, Willie Wood, etc. Interwoven with the narration, the personality and philosophy of Vince Lombardi is given. It some paragraphs, the story is almost like a motivation lecture given by Lombardi and later by his son Vincent.<P>A very interesting chapter is a discussion of Lombardi's signature phrase "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing." Contrary to popular belief Lombardi did not originate the expression. "Red " Sanders (later UCLA football coach) coined the phrase in the mid-1930s.and the line was later used in a John Wayne movie. Perhaps Lombardi's preferred expression was "Run to win" which emphasized his expectation of maximum effort from all involved.<P>The book notes that in 1968 having chosen to be just general manager and no longer coach, Lombardi was miserable, was faced with a team going downhill and suffered from declining health. In 1969, he accepted a part owner and head coach position with the Washington Redskins. The text recounts Lombardi ending, in 1969, the Redskins twelve year losing streak with a 7-5-2 winning record while the Packers without Lombardi went into a decline that lasted for more than a quarter-century.<P>The story ends with a moving account of Lombardi's terminal illness and his death on September 3, 1970. The author closes the book noting "The remnants of Lombardi's world are fading, yet his legend only grows in memory: the rugged and noble face, commanding voice, flashing teeth, primordial passion, unmatched commitment."<P>This is a book that both fan and non-fan alike will enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Maraniss has done his typical excellent job of bringing a larger-than-life character, in this case legendary coach Vince Lombardi, to life in this engaging biography. The author explores Lombardi's humble beginning, his Catholic upbringing, and his will to win which enabled him to compete as one of the famed "Seven Blocks of Granite" at Fordham despite a lack of both size or exemplary athletic talent.<P>Early in the book, Maraniss provides a fascinating glimpse into the college football programs of former national contenders Fordham and Army, where Lombardi was an assistant under the famed Red Blaik, and where he sometimes sat watching film with huge Army supporter Gen. Douglas MacArthur. At West Point Lombardi learned some of the coaching techniques, including a manic obsession with film study and precise repetition in practice, that served him so well later.<P>For those who know nothing about Lombardi apart from his years with the Green Bay Packers, there is much here to learn and enjoy. Vince was an assistant coach for the NY Giants, coaching the offense while another future hall of famer, Tom Landry, coached the defense, and he gives a stirring account of the famous 1960 championship game, believed by many to be the greatest football game ever played. Maraniss explores Lombardi's frustrating delays in obtaining a head coaching job, which he thought was due to his Italian heritage, and explores his Green Bay days in thorough, skillful fashion. Characters such as Paul Hornung (the coach's "Golden Boy" and favorite player), Bart Starr, Jerry Kramer, Ray Nietzsche, Alex Karras, Willie Wood, Dick Schaap,and countless others were apparently interviewed, and their personal remembrances of the Packer era made this a football fan's dream. <P>But Maraniss does not simply concentrate on x's and o's, as he also explores Lombardi the husband and father, painting a sometimes unflattering picture of Lombardi the reluctant family man with little or no time for quality interaction with his kids. The author even quotes from a devastating letter written by Lombardi's wife Marie to their son, in 1970 as Vince was beginning to get ill and their son was starting his own career and family, expressing frustration at the apparent lack of effort expended by both Lombardi men to cement their father-son relationship. Ultimately Lombardi was a complex man, standing up for his players (he would not tolerate discrimination against players who were black or gay) as he berated them on the practice field. The portrait is especially relevant now, as the country debates the antics of another "tough disciplinarian" coach by the name of Bobby Knight.<P>I would have enjoyed a little more complete picture of Lombardi's one year back on the sidelines coaching the Washington Redskins in 1969. Maraniss skillfully explores Lombardi's hiring and uneasy split with Green Bay, as well as his introduction to D.C. and his power lunches with owner Edward Bennett Williams. However, after some good material regarding his initial reactions and impressions of the team (he thought Sunny Jurgenson was blessed with incredible talent), Maraniss virtually skips the entire season and tells you how the Redskins did in retrospect, without any of the detail or anecdotes that made the Packers years come alive in his retelling. It was as if Maraniss knew it was time to wrap things up, and he had tired of writing about football. However, all in all, this is a fascinating portrait of a man whose impact is still felt on the gridiron, and whose fanatical dedication to team and especially character lately have been sorely missed in the NFL (and in all sports for that matter.)</span>

                    <span>As a long-time Packer fan, about anything substantative would have been an interesting and fun read. But this one surprised me because it eclipsed long-established accounts of the Packers successes and failures and took an especially thorough look at the man who made Green Bay famous.<P>Who would have known, for example, that the Coach's brother was gay. Or that he could relate one-to-one to his team and his players in a way he never could to his family. The book shares more of these insights than it does such strategic things as how Jerry Kramer and Ken Bowman combined to throw "the" block. In fact, the on the field tactics and discussions almost become a distraction in a broader book that emphasizes what made the man tick.<P>Like Wisconsin's other 1960s era sports hero, Al McGuire, everybody thinks they know everything about Coach Lombardi. This book lends an exciting perspective on a man dead now for almost 35 years. It's fascinating and long overdue.</span>

                    <span>First, a few low points... While not written in the jargon of the field, Maraniss clearly approaches the subject of Vince Lombardi from a post-modern point of view. He opens with a contrived and somewhat galling introduction, in which he explains that he has borrowed the title from another author and uses it (of course!) "ironically." At various points throughout the book, Maraniss attempts to "de-construct" Lombardi, which is to some extent the mark of any good biography, but the author takes it too far at times, especially in his frequent references to the "fallacy of the innocent past." Moreover, this is not a political book, but because Lombardi was mildly politically active, politics enters the picture. And a subtle bias pervades Maraniss's discussion of politics. When lifelong Democrat (but always pretty conservative) Lombardi begins drifting toward Nixon and Republicans in the turbulent sixties, Maraniss attributes Lombardi's conservatism not to a heartfelt belief in those principles but to an inability to cope with rapidly changing times. The 60s is a favorite topic for Maraniss, as his latest book indicates, but his digressions into the protests, while tangentially important to Lombardi's story (particularly his philosophy of freedom), are overdone.<BR> <BR>Nevertheless, despite those faults, I still give this book a five. Immediately after that disappointing introduction, Maraniss redeems himself with probably the most stunning first line I have read in any book of nonfiction (and perhaps in fiction, too): "Everything begins with the body of the father." It is a starting point for a discussion of Lombardi's immigrant father, but it brings together elements that appear throughout the book: family (especially Lombardi's relationship with his son); Catholicism; the physical violence of football. From his youthful desire to be a priest and his high school and college football career, Maraniss follows Lombardi to Fordham and beyond to his first coaching job at a small Catholic high school in New Jersey and to an assistant's job at West Point, under Red Blaik. It was then to the Giants, where he was an assistant with Tom Landry, and finally across the country to Green Bay, where the legend was born.<BR> <BR>The book is not just a biography of Vince Lombardi; it is a look at American life and culture and at the history of professional football. It is amazingly written, and the descriptions of football games are wonderful--particularly the Ice Bowl, which another reviewer has mentioned. Flaws and all, this is a fantastic read.</span>

                    <span>_That William Verneli Wood was challengig for a place on the Packers at all was a meaure of his mental strength and perseverance. It also underscored the determination of Lombardi and his personnel man, Jack Vainisi, to ignore the prejudices then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented players...Wood was a black quarterback in an era when black athletes were seldom allowed the opportunity to play that position_ (p237). Willie Wood went on to play 12 seasons for the NFL Green Bay Packers and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989 In this biography WHEN PRIDE STILL MATTERED, David Maraniss identifies _race relations_ as an issue that revealed Coach Vincent Lombardi's character.<P>I understood very little about the American version of football. Part of my confusion was that the foot is seldom used, and the object of the competition resembles a ball like no other. Even so, after reading WPSM, Mr Maraniss has provided me an appreciation for the athletes and the unmatched accomplishments of Coach Lombardi. Mr Maraniss chronicles football's mythical beginnings at US colleges in the first half of the twentieth century culminating in its zenith in the decade of the 1960s. The Packers were the team of that turbulent decade and Coach Lombardi became an icon.<P>I was not surprised by this aspect of the biography. I don't feel I am alone in anticipating a captivating telling of the history and personalities of the NFL. Where Mr Maraniss exceeds my expectations is in his ability to weave disparate details together as they powerfully manifest at a critical time. The Packer Sweep is the most prominent example. So too is the complex and often contradictory character of Coach Lombardi.<P>Mr Maraniss tells us that Vincent Lombardi had a rare quality of leadership that enhances the confidence of those around him. He was able to lift their spirits and they in turn responded with an effort that exceeded even what they themselves thought possible. This is a spiritual gift.<P>Part of this gift found expression when Coach Lombardi was intolerant of racial prejudice. _The Jim Crow discrimination that black Packers faced when the team played exhibition games in the South enraged Lombardi, and at the end of the 1960 preseason he decided that he would never again allow his team to be split by segregation; from then on, he said, any hotel that would not accomodate all Packers would get no Packers_ He applied the same standard to the establishments in hometown Green Bay, Wisconson.<P>Even before Willie Wood came to Green Bay, Lombardi brought Em Tunnell with him from the NY Giants, and paid for his lodgings, _Lombardi respected and needed Tunnell's experience that much_. (p240). Tunnell and Wood returned the respect. Wood said that Lombardi was _perhaps the fairest person I ever met_<P>Coach Lombardi carried this same attitude to the issues of homosexuality and pre-marital pregnancy. These are typically, emotionally laden issues for Christians. Whatever reservations Lombardi may have held personally, he let his team know that a gay player deserved respect, _if I hear one of you people make reference to his manhood you'll be out of here before your ass hits the ground_ (p471). <P>The coach's daughter and her fiance agreed to get married but they did not want her parents to know that she was pregnant. Their parish priest helped the young couple with the details of securing a marriage license and with their permission, contacted Vince and Marie Lombardi who were enjoying the success of a Super Bowl victory in Florida (GB 33 Oakland 14). Lombardi had become a national symbol of old-fashioned discipline and moral rectitude. Upon hearing the news, _at first, Lombardi was 'extremely angry, of course, but then calmed down and began drafting a game plan._ (p430). As soon as Vince and Marie returned to Green Bay, they paid a visit to the newlyweds. Susan remembers, _He stuck out his hand to Paul and said welcome to the family and asked him about his education and his plans_.<P>Mr Maraniss tells us of a complex Coach in this biography of Vincent Lombardi. There is never any doubt about his shortcomings. Through his unique determination Lombardi overcame these shortcomings and applied his will to hold a faith in the positive nature of us all. _Winning is the ony thing_ is the most famous quotation from Coach Lombardi, but winning was not the only thing at which Vincent Lombardi excelled.<P>PEACE</span>
