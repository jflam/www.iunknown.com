                    <span>And one of the ten most impressive people I've ever read about, period. I can't say too much about how awed I am of the life of Ida B. Wells. Had I been her contemporary I would have worn out my knees trying to propose to her until she married me. McMurry's book shows how this woman has been short changed by history due to her uncompromising belief in African American equal rights and self-respect. She and people like another African American who doesn't get his due, Monroe Trotter, have been marginalized merely because in their day they demanded the same degree of self-respect and political and educational rights that Caucasians of every stripe took for granted. They were considered "radical" and "militant" for not compromising the way virtually all other African American leaders did during their era. Their marginalization goes a long way in explaining why the African American persona has never featured the degree of chutzpah and daring it has needed for us to advance farther than we have. Instead, all of us have been too heavily influenced by leaders promoted over Wells-Barnett and Trotter, who instilled caution within us as a people, virtually as second nature. Not even W.E.B. Du Bois conducted himself with the degree of pride and fortitude that people like Wells-Barnett and Trotter did. McMurry's book deserves a place on all reading lists in American history classes so that everyone can truly understand the troubling forces that made this country what it is today, and the manner in which people like Wells-Barnett were purposely silenced as part of a plan to keep African Americans oppressed.</span>

                    <span>This book is interesting and easy to read, but hard to take. Ida B. Wells-Barnett was a complex person: incredibly smart, brave and strong, but at the same time, prickly and ultra sensative.The book also puts America's  current racial and gender problems into perspective, showing us that we  haven't come very far from the late 19th century's attitudes toward and  treatment of African-Americans and women. This book is a must-read for  anyone who cares about a great American or wants to face and learn more  about America's shameful history. That said, the author's style makes it  easy to read. Amazingly enough for a scholarly biography, I would often  find myself reading late into the night because I couldn't put it down.</span>

                    <span>McMurray's biography of Ida B. Wells-Barnett is a rare triumph.  Wells-Barnett was a courageous American whose valor is depicted in full color.  All too frequently, when there is a discussion of the impact of  race, there is a mistaken assumption that black males comprise the affected  population.  Similarly, when gender is raised as an issue, the false  assumption is that white women are the only ones to be affected.   Wells-Barnett was an American woman of African descent who fought the  societally-mandated strictures of race and sex until her death.  I am  emboldened by her deeds since too many of the same strictures still exist.   I applaud McMurray for her scholarship in this biography's portrayal of the  life of Wells-Barnett.  This book is definitely recommended.</span>

                    <span>I came away from this book with new respect for Wells, and her courage.  I was overwhelmed with sadness after reading some of the details of the lynchings and the effect on the survivors.  The book contains an excellent  analysis of the real reason for many lynchings:economic competition.</span>
