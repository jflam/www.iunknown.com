                <span id="Label1">Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology has established itself as the preeminent source of education and information in its field. This much expanded second edition enlists advances in neurobiology, and recent clinical developments, to explain with renewed clarity the concepts underlying drug treatment of psychiatric disorders. New neurotransmitter systems, new theories on schizophrenia, clinical advances in antipsychotic and antidepressant therapy, new coverage of attention deficit disorder, sleep disorders and drug abuse, and a new chapter on gender and sexual psychopharmacology--these are all features of this edition.   The fully revised text is complemented by many new illustrations, instructive and entertaining as before, and enhanced to reflect new knowledge and topics covered for the first time. The illustrations and their captions may be used independently of the main text for a rapid introduction to the field or for review, and self-assessment tests follow each chapter.   Even more, this will be the essential text for students, scientists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, enabling them to master the complexities of psychopharmacology, and plan sound treatment approaches based on current knowledge.   A Teacher's Set of Essential Psychopharmacology, second edition, consists of the hardback book plus a Mac/PC compatible CD-ROM, which contains all the figures from the text in cleverly crafted PowerPoint&#174; presentations in two versions: the complete sequence of more than 500 animated figures from the textbook, and the same images without animation.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for MOST. Whether you are an intern/resident , as I am, in primary care, or in private practice this book is great for not only learning the material for the first time or just refreshing the material while in practice. His recommendation to read the book the first time by just looking at the pictures and reading the captions with them is an excellent start for any physician. Those needing more advanced learning can read the text as well a second time. And for those still wanting to go a step further, stephen stahl has talks around the country to attend; at these he goes into even more detail. <br>This is not for an advanced researcher who has been researching/practicing for many years. But for the other 80-90% of us it is a great book.</span>

                    <span>People love this book because of it's pretty diagrams and the way it presents receptor mechanisms with clarity and certainty. This is very good for the beginner, but those who read primary sources will probably note at least two shortcomings. Firstly the effects of stimulating different receptors and the interactions between them are more complex and apparently contradictory than this book implies. Secondly the author does not comprehensively review clinical trials which again give results that are not as unequivocal as might be predicted from the models put forward. In summary this book is a great achievement but tends to downplay the uncertainties in the field.</span>

                    <span>I found the book to be very helpful and extremely informative.  Dr. Stahl's writing style is concise and interesting.He doesn't try to blow us"non-med students" out of the water with big words.  I attended University of California at San Diego where he does much of his research and I have had a chance to meet with him. He is not only a great author, but a kind, caring, creative and intelligent doctor(believe it or not, he also has a great sense of humor).  I hope you all enjoy this book!</span>

                    <span>Very good illustration. The contents is too basic for a good study.  May be helpful for junior medical students.  About 5-10% of the contents did give me some clearification of knowledge.  In general, I found the book  boring.   Another comment is that the book does not mention the subtypes of  MAO and the role of MAO-A in inhibiting absorption of tyramine.  This is  more important than the work at synaps which clinically does not deserve  the emphasis the book gives.</span>
