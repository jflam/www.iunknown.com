                <span id="Label1"><div>"I first sailed the Yangtze in 1983 on the Kun Lun, a foreign-leased cruise ship that went back and forth in seedy glamour between Shanghai and Chongqing. Over the next years, I made many trips along China's longest river, most often on its upper reaches, the section between western Hubei province and central Sichuan province in which the Three Gorges, a spectacular 120-mile stretch of mountains, ravines, and once deadly currents, are located. On board ship, I lectured to foreign tourists about Chinese history, shepherded them in and out of museums and factories, took them to hospitals, and dispatched them onward when necessary on stretchers and in urns. These long, leisurely, and contradictory trips, full of strange and fleeting intimacies, gave me my first introduction to river life."<br><br>So begins Deirdre Chetham's elegiac book about the towns along the banks of the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River, written on the very eve of their destruction. The Yangtze flows 3,900 miles eastward from its source on the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau, where the Mekong and Salween also make their start, to Shanghai and the East China Sea. After great controversy, the Chinese government has begun construction of the world's largest hydroelectric dam in the Three Gorges section of the Yangtze, a place renowned for its beauty. For over two thousand years, the Yangtze has been the great transport route linking the coast with the west and southwest and providing irrigation for the farms that fed China. Once the dam is completed in 2009, the water level will rise as much as 350 feet in a hundred-mile stretch of the river. The water will submerge over a dozen large cities, almost 1,500 villages and towns, and innumerable historical and cultural sites. Over a million people are being moved, voluntarily or otherwise, altering not only their lives, but the lives of a multitude of others whose existence is intertwined with the river. A region already struggling with the impact of widespread rural migration is confronting the reality of having even fewer incentives to keep its youth in an area many wish to flee. <br><br>Before the Deluge captures a sense of the daily life, traditions, and history of the people who live along the Upper Yangtze's Three Gorges area. It chronicles the region's past and present with an eye on the disruption of an existing way of life. Perhaps most importantly, it captures a world that is rapidly vanishing under the rushing waters of one of the world's largest rivers.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This book encompasses the history of the Yangtze, as a history major I enjoyed learning about the history pertaining the Yangtze. Moreover, it discusses the political motives behind the construction of the dam. Also, this book addresses the social as well as environmental costs of TGD. It is a great book for students, travelers, environmentalists, historians, and those who have an interest in China.</span>

                    <span>A superb book. Drawing from her life experience, the author gives vivid picture of people's life along China's Yangtze River. The construction of the super-dam will greatly alter people's life there. We should thank the author for recording, thus preserving the past that will be gone forever. Scholars, especially scholars of China Studies would get detailed description of the daily life of Chinese people. Travellers would also find the book useful. The author was among the first group of foreigners who worked and travelled in China after 1976. Thus, her story is really invaluable since not many foreigners had the chance to witness China around 1980. Overall, the book is informative and insightful. Wonderful work.</span>

                    <span>December, 2, 2002. I just returned from my first trip to China which included 4 days cruising through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. My good fortune was having this wonderfully and scholarly written book by Ms Chetham.<P>This book was invaluable to me because it gave me a full perspective of China, it's people, it's culture, and it's economic development. With this book as my traveling companion along with 43 good friends from San Francisco our group visited Beijing, Xian, Chongching,350 miles of the Yangtze River, Wuhan, Shanghai, & Souzhou. In each locale we had english speaking guides who were born and raised in the area. The combination of the local input, our observations, and readings from this book created a "trip of a lifetime" for me.<P>If you plan to visit China this book is a must.</span>
