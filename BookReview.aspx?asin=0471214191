                    <span>As a developer I got a little dissapointed. A lot of words, but very little substance that I could use directly. I think the word 'Design' is somewhat misleading and also the subtitle 'A developer's approach to developing innovative mobile and wireless solutions'. The book is just an 'overview' for beginners.</span>

                    <span>I am studying towards a Ph.D. in Information Systems.  I was given an assignment to research wireless technologies.  I decided to read this book to refresh my memory about the topic.  The information in the book is better presented than any journal article on the topic that I have read to date, even articles from world renown researchers from MIT, Stanford, Duke and alike.  The author takes a very difficult topic and presents in a crystal clear manner that can be understood by virtually anyone.  Moreover, the information is not watered-down.  To the contrary, it is the single most valuable resource that I have found on the topic after conducting a thorough literature review.  I would recommend it to anyone who deals with wireless networks or wants to increase their knowledge about the topic.</span>
