                    <span>Security has been high on my list of things to understand and master these past two years. Our company's firewall has been breached numerous times. This has scared the living daylights out of our stakeholders. I have therefore been forced to become an expert. This is one of the books that has helped me attain this level of understanding. It offers insights not available in regular how to guides on security. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First, let me make clear right off the bat, I'm leaving this review as someone who purchased this book expecting information on Windows Networks and was disappointed.  A large part of why this book was a bad experience for me is that, when a book bills itself as covering both Unix and Windows, I assume it gives equal coverage to both.   
<br />
<br />If you are a Unix admin this book might very well be just what you need.
<br />
<br />That said, of its 300 pages, roughly 35 of them are devoted to Windows.  In those 35 pages the author pretty clearly conveys his distaste for Windows even going so far as to misrepresent certain areas of the Windows World (someone should tell the author that Windows does have a fairly powerful scripting engine).  Of the Windows tips that are provided, many of them are dedicated to making Windows work with Unix in a mixed environment. 
<br />
<br />Even without the coverage, it wouldn't take much to figure out the author's bias.  The book is full of quotes such as "I know we're used to a robust, powerful scripting function in Unix but Windows doesn't have this so we have to..."  
<br />
<br />I honestly could have forgiven most of the above if the hacks had been well marked so that I could tell which were Windows related and which were Unix related.  That way I would have, at very least, had a visual way to skim the book and realize how lopsided the coverage was so that I could have been saved from purchasing it.  
<br />
<br />If you're interested in Windows Security advice, I'd suggest picking up Hardening Windows by Roberta Bragg.  It's a much better fit.

                    <span>This book took me a long time to read, but for a good reason, I kept implementing 
<br />the various hacks in the book on a server I had started setting up. 
<br />
<br />The book is mostly Unix related, but there is some Windows related `hacks' as well. 
<br />I think the Windows coverage was lacking a bit though. For Unix, it talks about 
<br />Linux, the BSD's and a bit on Mac OS X and Solaris. Most of the topics are 
<br />general enough to apply to any Unix based Operating System, but some are specific 
<br />to an operating system.
<br />
<br />One of the great things about the Hacks series of books by O'Reilly is that the 
<br />information is presented in nice small chunks that you can read in a few minutes 
<br />if you have some spare time.
<br />
<br />The hacks are all `hyperlinked' to each other, if a hack mentions something that 
<br />relates to another hack, it is highlighted in blue and the hack that it 
<br />references is listed. I did find a few places where this wasn't done 
<br />(#84 Real-Time Monitoring, first mentions Barnyard but doesn't provide any 
<br />information on it or mention that it is one of the later hacks).
<br />
<br />Lots of the hacks in the book could be found by doing some reading on the 
<br />internet, but finding such a variety of topics all in one place, with enough 
<br />information to get you started is really nice. Even though I consider myself to
<br />be fairly security conscious, I still found quite a few things in this book that
<br />I hadn't thought of, or plain didn't realize were possible or even existed. I 
<br />would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in security or anyone 
<br />responsible for maintaining a server (whether or not it is on the internet).</span>

                    <span>Overall, I find this book to be an enjoyable read.  I thumb through it time and time again, and come up with some useful hints and tips (not really necessarily hacks though).  It's more oriented toward BSD Unix and Linux, but I did find some useful hints for Windows (the current topic of my studies).  I really like the plug for ntsyslod (hack 56), which can take binary event logs and route them to syslogd service.  Nice.  Finally, logs in Windows are now open for business.
<br />
<br />I found some material to be trivial, making problems from non-problems, or rather not practical to implement.  For example, one hint advises Windows users to encrypt their temp directory (hack 28).  However, there are easy workarounds to bypass EFS, and the temp directory is within a user's profile, and thus secured from other users anyhow.  So encrypting it is unecessary, and not useful given users can drag a file to a floppy or non-NTFS filesystem to  and bypass the encryption.
<br />
<br />One hack recommended flush the page file as some important application data might be in there (hack 29).  However, this requires delving into the registry, and to implement across all workstations is too taxing.  However, there could be ways to automate this through group policy objects and scripts.  There's no coverage on how to automate some of these chores, which is not always straightforward in Windows.
<br />
<br />One a final note, I wish there was more coverage of Windows.  There's could be equivelent coverage of things like time sychronization (hack 44) for Windows as well.
<br />
<br />Overall though, I think there are enough useful tips to make this book valuable.  I've already wrote my name on this one...</span>

                    <span>It's important to understand who this book is for. It's not for the amateur looking to configure their firewall. The book starts with locking up UNIX filesystems and doesn't turn back the complexity clock as it winds through all the way to advanced topics like Honeypots and various SSH tunneling schemes. I highly recommend this book for network administrators and security professionals looking to make sure they have all of their bases covered. However, for the personal computer user looking to make sure their DSL doesn't get hacked I cannot recommend this book.</span>
