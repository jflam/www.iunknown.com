                    <span>I noticed the review that said this book was worthy of "permanent display on your coffee table."  Well, I don't think that will be possible with my book, as the binding fell apart after 6 months.  The book has gotten a fair amount of use, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I've since seen a similar problem with a couple of the display copies at bookstores (which is why they've been demoted to display copies).  So I don't think this is an isolated problem.  It seems like the book is so big that they didn't make a strong enough binding for it.  So just a warning for this thinking of buying this book.  The good news is that, on the advice of one of the reviews, I bought Colorado: Yesterday & Today to replace my copy of Colorado: 1870-2000.  I agree that it is the better book and now it will be on permanent display on my coffe-table.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent in look, feel, and quality.  It is intriguing to see how much landscape has changed in 130 years.  Many times for the better and many times for the worse.  In every case it is very interesting to see two pictures side by side and compare 1870 with 2000.  The photographer was very meticulous to capture every shot as closely as possible to the original perspective and frame, which really enhances the "then and now" feel of the book.</span>

                    <span>There appears to be some confusion as all of the reviews of the original "Colorado 1870-2000" big book are credited to this, the paperback "Colorado 1870-2000 Revisited: The History Behind the Images".  This book is a companion book to the original.  It takes each photo set from the big book and goes into detail about the location, changes, and how Fielder acquired each photo. These are the things that, being left out of the original, made several people give the big book negative reviews.  While it would have been nice (and certainly less expensive) to have everything in one volume, we now have the information for which those disappointed with the big book were looking.  While the big book is a piece of coffee table art, the Revisited book fits neatly on your bookshelf, ready to be taken down to answer those questions posed by your friends perusing the big book.  I take a bit of offense at having to have paid for two different books, but they belong together and I feel were money well spent; the big book for the beautiful photos and the revisited book for its entertaining and educational material.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>John Fielder is one of America's greatest living photographers, and he brings his love of the Colorado wilderness to this book.  His re-shoots of Jacksons 19th century photographs are both beautiful and thought-provoking.... the photographs make it worthwhile.<p>On the other hand, the text is a different story.  Reading a text-only version of this book, one might conclude that the title is a misprint, and that the book should really be called "Colorado 1970 - 2000."  Fielder roamed across Colorado capturing the changes in places like Kremmling, Denver, and Ouray, but the text never tells us anything about these places, or why they changed, or why we should care.  Instead we get chapters about oil shale and the Forest Service.<p>Ahem.  If I wanted to read about the relationship between Forest Service bureaucrats and small Western towns, I would have bought a book called "The Relationship Between the Forest Service and Small Western Towns."  My book is called "Colorado 1870 - 2000."  That is what I want to read about.<p>It's true that oil shale schemes, government agencies, and others have played a role in shaping Colorado in the past 30 years.  But before that there were events like the Silver Crash of 1893, the City Beautiful movement, the Depression, World War II, and Urban Renewal.  You won't read about those in this book.  <p>The pictures are beautiful, and the text is well-written (if misplaced and unwanted).  Just don't expect to learn much about the places you are looking at- except that they are very pretty.</span>

                    <span>As people may or may not know, there are now two Colorado "then and now" books out: Colorado: 1870-2000 by John Fielder and Colorado: Yesterday & Today by Grant Collier. I am fascinated by these types of books and therefore bought both books.  I have carefully compared the two based on several different aspects and decided that, for the reasons listed below, Colorado: Yesterday & Today is the best overall value.<p>1) Accuracy of Photo Retakes: While Fielder did a rather competent job of matching the historic photos, Collier did a remarkable job.  Unless it was impossible to match them, due to trees blocking the view, etc., most of Collier's photos appear to be taken from nearly the exact location as the historic photos. EDGE: Colorado: Yesterday & Today.<p>2) Originality: Since both of the books were published within a short time span, it seems possible that one photographer copied the other's idea for the book.  Initially, I assumed that Fielder started on his book first.  But, after looking into it, I was surprised to find that Collier started working on his book before Fielder even decided to do his book. EDGE: Colorado: Yesterday & Today<p>3) Reputation: This is Collier's first book, while Fielder has published many other books. EDGE: Colorado: 1870-2000<p>4) Written Text: Colorado: 1870-2000 has some interesting essays written by leading environmentalists, historians, etc.  My one complaint is that the essays do not really provide any information on the photos in the book.  Colorado: Yesterday & Today was written entirely by the photographer, Grant Collier. He did a very competent job writing the histories of the towns in the book, and this text provides the reader with additional information on the photographs in the book. EDGE: EVEN<p>5) Appearance of the book: Colorado: 1870-2000 is a very large book and is perhaps a little bulky.  But the large photos in it are quite nice.  Colorado: Yesterday & Today is more of a standard size book, and it is easier to sit down and look through this book.  But the photos are obviously not quite as large.  Also, both books have VERY NICE leather covers. EDGE: EVEN<p>6) Intangibles:  In Colorado: 1870-2000 Fielder reshot the images of pioneer photographer William Henry Jackson.  In Colorado: Yesterday & Today Collier reshot the images of his great-great-grandfather, and pioneer photographer, Joseph Collier.  This adds a fascinating human-interest aspect to Colorado: Yesterday & Today that is lacking in Colorado: 1870-2000. EDGE: Colorado: Yesterday & Today.<p>OVERALL VALUE: The SRP of Fielder's book is $95, while the SRP of Collier's book is $39.95.  So, given the price and quality of Colorado: Yesterday & Today, I would say that it is certainly the best overall value.<p>To conclude, if you're only going to buy one Colorado "then and now" book, I'd recommend Colorado: Yesterday & Today.  If you're going to buy two, Colorado: 1870-2000 isn't too bad a buy, either.</span>
