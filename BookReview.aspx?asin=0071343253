                <span id="Label1">Boat owners, let us remind you of this simple fact: it's better to be  out on the water than working on your boat at the dock.  Sandy Lindsey  has compiled 1,001 tips to help you keep your boat running--and looking--its  best in <I>Boating Magazine's Quick & Easy Boat Maintenance</I>. From deck to  hull, from paint to the electrical systems, and from winterizing to preparing  for opening day, Lindsey offers up advice to help you maintain your boat in less  time and with less expense. Many of these tips are also happily environmentally  friendly--for example, replacing expensive boat cleaners with cheaper and less  caustic substitutes. With its concise text and clear layout, this guide will  become a welcome addition to your boating library. <I>--M. Stein</I></span>

                    <span>I had high expectations of this book from reading the reviews. Yet, I found that alot of it did not apply to my situation. I own a 19 foot runabout for lake use only, and alot of the information in this book was specifically for larger off-shore boats. Still, some of the informaton will be useful I'm sure. I guess I was hoping for more technical maintenance stuff. If you own a large cuddy or deisel powered boat, this may be for you.</span>

Plus, my boat cleaning chores go quicker now. This book has paid for itself several times over. And I haven't even touched on the excellent engine maintenance tips it contains...</span>

                    <span>I was about to purchase a new boat that I really couldn't afford, when I came across Quick & Easy Boat Maintenance. It helped me restore my boat with minimal pain and suffering. Now I wouldn't sell it for the world, but if I did, I also have the plus of knowing I can get top dollar for my newly restored shining clean vessel. Sandy's tips are clearly and concisely written and VERY easy to use. I keep this book on board with me at all times in case of mechanical problem.</span>
