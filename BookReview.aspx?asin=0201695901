                <span id="Label1"><I>Developing Windows NT Device Drivers</I> is an authoritative and clearly written resource on how to write device drivers for Windows NT. The book begins with an excellent high-level overview of how Windows NT device drivers work and how to create them. The text concentrates on "generic" device drivers written in C and excludes specialized drivers for graphics, file system, and network hardware.<p> Eventually, the book turns to device registers, device memory, and different PC busses (such as PCI). A section on I/O Request Packets (IRPs) and interrupt handling within Windows NT shows how to do asynchronous I/O. The authors offer a simple "Hello World" example for a device driver and present various debugging techniques.<p> Subsequent chapters deepen the reader's knowledge on topics such as device I/O, synchronization (including spin locks), device-driver initialization and cleanup, and direct memory access (DMA). These chapters also instruct you on how to access hardware ports and interrupt processing (a crucial topic) and how to move device memory into system memory (along with a working example). Discussion of more specialized topics--ISA and PCI busses, serialization, driver threads, and the advantages of the new "layered" driver model--follows.<p> Authors Edward Dekker and Joseph M. Newcomer offer plenty of excellent real-world advice. (Material on how to log device-driver events and manage the infamous Windows "Blue Screen of Death" is indispensable.) They present a "hardware simulator" that lets readers develop device drivers without an actual hardware device. The book closes with information on Windows 2000, universal serial bus (USB) devices, the Win32 driver model, and over 300 pages of reference material, including device-driver kernel functions. Overall, this comprehensive text provides a solid introduction to the way Windows NT device drivers interact with hardware; it gives you all you need to start building custom device drivers. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I'm a high school intern and I knew nothing about drivers (other than installing them) 3 months ago.  Now I have completed 2, an ISA and Parallel port driver.  This book is really great for people new to the DDK and need a good foundation.  The examples are clear, and the pace of the book is pretty slow (but steady).  Once you get past the first 9-10 chapters you can pretty much skim for parts you need.  The tips are especially helpful, as to why C++ OOP isn't suitable, to why 2 computers are absolutely necessary.  Even if you plan on making WDM drivers, this book will be helpful.  Oney's WDM book is really useless for beginners, and the DDK almost has no redeeming value, other than being very very heavy (oh, wait thats not good either).  The net is surprisingly lacking of driver programming pages. Get this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a useful reference for the NT/Win2k driver developer, but it has a number of disappointing flaws which make it less practical. <p>The authors attempt to be humorous by making frequent sarcastic remarks and the general tone is very informal--inappropriate for a developer's handbook.  The book also appears to be poorly proofread, as some sentences don't parse and there are typographical errors in printed code.  All these stylistic errors make the book much more difficult to use, as it takes more time and effort to locate and absorb the important content.<p>The book does not include a disk or CD with source code printed in the text, and the authors' web site includes code for only a small minority of the programs mentioned in the book.  If you want to try out the examples, you'll be spending a lot of time typing.<p>On the whole, this book is useful, but I recommended it only until a better-written text is available.</span>

                    <span>I just received the book and I immediately turned to the index to search for NETWORK DRIVERS.  Nope.  Well, the introduction chapter will tell you "what we don't cover" (this important omission should of been  mentioned in the online book excerpts):<p>The book does not cover:  File  Drivers, Network Drivers, Graphic Drivers and User Mode Drivers.  <p>One  would think that in this day of age of Communications, High End Speed  Games, etc, that a rather large book  titled "Developing Windows NT  Device Drivers" would cover these important device drivers.    At a  minimum, its should of covered NDIS Device Drivers.   It does not.</span>

This book really helped me with my project at work, especially, the  chapter on PCI and memory mapping. I am in love with this book. Can't leave  home without it.</span>
