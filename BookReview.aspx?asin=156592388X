                <span id="Label1">If unwanted advertising is filling your e-mail and clogging up your favorite newsgroups, or if you're a system administrator plagued by spammers, you'll love this book. Schwartz and Garfinkel examine the growth of spam and give readers the tools to help end the problem.<p> The authors first explain why spam is more than just a mere annoyance and offer solutions that anyone with a basic knowledge of how the Internet and e-mail work can understand. Readers without such knowledge needn't worry--the chapter on Internet basics can get them up to speed.<p> Schwartz and Garfinkel demonstrate technical, political, and social approaches to keeping spam out of your mailbox and off your system. They discuss the many ways spammers falsify their mail, using fraudulent techniques to disguise where they come from. The authors show you how to avoid being fooled and what you can do to help catch abusers and make them responsible for their misbehavior. <I>--Elizabeth Lewis</I></span>

                    <span>It is an old book so some of the info is rather dated.<p>However, it is good for a historical perspective and it gives an ok overview of the whole concept.<p>It will not give you answers to what you need to do as much of the spamming techniques have changed since it's publishing.<p>For example HTML based spam, spam fighing software, and Baysean formula came after this.<p>It was a book for its time but it has passed.</span>

                    <span>Heavy on pressenting and summarizing issues without many praticalities.  It should be titled - Techniques to use in reducing Spam.

                    <span>Don't let the publication date scare you off. This book is timeless in its applicability. It covers all types of spam very nicely, and is acutely aware of the potential speech-related issues content-based filtering can bring about.<p>This book offers many options for combatting spam on the user and system levels, and makes sure to present the best way to stop spam: by teaching responsible system administration and shutting down open mail relays and public NNTP servers that allow posting. <p>I have had to admin mail and news servers for clients in the past, and I personally receive about 30 pieces of unwanted email daily. I've been particularly interested in the Procmail-based "friendly sender database", and the book presents the solution in a clear, concise fashion.<p>If you're tired of receiving more spam than real email, or having to really look hard for high quality, on topic postings in your newsgroups, then I strongly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>The title of the book, and the introduction make one beleive that you will find all you ever need to know about putting an end to spam.  I work in the Unix environment and its variants.  Looking at the generic title, I expected a very thorough exposition of some popular filters like procmail.  I was appalled to find just two pages devoted to this tool.  <p>The book claims to be of great value to system administrators.  I do not think any sys admin worth his salt would gather any new technical information from this book.  The book liberally recommends URLs which deal with some important issues related to controlling spam.  But then, a sensible search on google would produce - for free.<p>There were some tidbits like the exchange between the Penn state prof and Paul Vixie, and the RFC by Jon Postel predicting the junk mail problem were quite entertaining.<p>All in all, this book is just for people who have no clue about what spam is, and not for the all-encompassing "people who have seen their maiboxes fill up with useless messages and unsolicted advertisements" the book so blatantly claims.</span>
