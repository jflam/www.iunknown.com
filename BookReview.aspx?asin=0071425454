                    <span>I did a lot of research on various books on selling before I finally picked up the audio copy. I was very impressed with the content and delivery: understand and show customer that your solution helps the customer achieve their goal, solves their problem, or staisfy their need.
<br />
<br />The audio reader, Chris Ryan, makes the book much fun to listen to. He is the best audiobook reader that I have listened to.
<br />
<br />I would recommend the CD (audio) edition of the book. I guess the hardcopy would be useful too along with the audio version.</span>

                    <span>This is an interesting, useful guide to selling a non-traditional way. Many companies, especially in high-technology industries, build their sales effort around early adopters. But early adopters are a minority of the market and their needs and preferences are distinct from those of the mainstream. To adjust their sales effort to the mainstream majority of the market, companies must listen to their audience. Instead of building sales messages around products, they need to build their sales communications and their sales process around customer needs and preferences. Customer-centric selling begins in the earliest stages of marketing and proceeds through the final sale. Authors Michael T. Bosworth and John R. Holland clearly set forth the nature of customer-centric selling and provide a comprehensive guide. We recommend this worthwhile addition to any salesperson's bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>The concepts contained in this book are not new.  Their presentation, however, is.<p>The authors outline why people buy -- and when and from whom.  It should be required reading prior to the creation of any business plan.  Although the word "selling" in the title, but this book more of a business manual is a really a business book more than it is a sales manual.<br> <br>There are no clever opening lines, or guaranteed PowerPoint templates.   If you spend time with the book you will gain much more-an understanding of what you sell, to whom you should be selling it and where to go to find them.If your managers read it, they will develop a new a concept of how to message and manage their sales process.  <p>Bosworth and Holland believe customer centric selling contains seven basic concepts:<br>1.	Sales are based on conversations, not presentations.<br>2.	Asking relevant questions versus rendering opinions.<br>3.	Solutions rather than relationships earn buyers' respect.<br>4.	Target businesspeople versus users.<br>5.	Sell usage, not reliance.<br>6.	Salespeople manage managers rather than needing to be managed.<br>7.	Enable buyers rather than selling them.<p>Managers and Salespeople who spent time with this book will add value to their organizations.  If you are responsible for moving product, this book is a must read.</span>
