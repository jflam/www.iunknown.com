                <span id="Label1">As sociologist Elijah Anderson shows in the detailed and devastating <I>Code of the Street</I>, the senseless crime in the inner city represents a complex, though ultimately self-defeating, set of social mores. These mores, called "codes," stress a hyperinflated sense of manhood through verbal boasts, drug selling, sexual prowess, and--ultimately--violence and death. "At the heart of the code is the issue of respect," Anderson writes, "loosely defined as being treated 'right' or being granted one's 'props' (or proper due) or the deference one deserves." Anderson reveals a world where unemployment is rampant, teenage pregnancy is common, and social and educational achievement is viewed as "acting white." Although Anderson states that racism is a major factor for this condition, he notes that this type of behavior is further exacerbated by modern economic and political forces, and that it has existed as far back as ancient Rome.<p>  As an African American himself, Anderson moves through the middle- and lower-class Philadelphia neighborhoods with ease, interviewing a variety of subjects, all of whom deal daily with consequences of urban decay--from the high-achieving young woman who had to reject her poorer relatives to better herself, to the former delinquent who tries to go straight after returning from prison. For Anderson, these are the true heroes of <I>Code of the Street</I>: people who overcome the temptations of the streets to help create a better space for the next generation. <I>--Eugene Holley Jr.</I> </span>

                    <span> This book should be on the required reading list for any practitioner in the system, especially those who work in the fields of criminal justice and social services.
<br /> In this very real, very hard hitting account of what happens to generations of people who feel disconnected from the dominant society in which they live, we are given a view of what motivates some of them to continue their lifestyles.
<br /> Dr.Anderson's account of the code of the street, does not only include teens, but also, everyone in the community.
<br /> I found the concept of "code switching", as well as his personal interviews with both teens and adults, fascinating.
<br /> I especially enjoyed his accounts of the day to day lives of several individuals and how they handled their ever growing problems.
<br /> All in all, I found the book hard to put down, once I began to read it.
<br /> I found that throughout the entire book, Dr. Anderson was always aware that there are no simple answers to the big questions.  However, in spite of how dire the situation appears in the inner cities, he does offer some suggestions and hope.</span>

                    <span>If I had to choose one word in regards to "Code of the Street" it would (without a doubt) be "insightful."  Elijah Anderson did a particularly good job of introducing "characters" found in the inner city.  Though his philosophy focuses primarily on those people from Germantown (in philadelphia), they can be recognized in any American inner city.  Coming from the suburbs of an inner city, the book was particularly eye-opening, allowing me to understand further the class structure of the city.  The detailed descriptions of "decent," "street," and "code-switching"  cultures were extremely valuable.  I also enjoyed reading further about the prominence of "black inner-city grandmothers" and their role in the family.  Knowing a close family friend in such similar circumstances as described in the book made this even more interesting to read about.  Also, because drug abuse has become such a prominent issue in America during recent years, my other favorite section of the book regarded the underground economy of drug dealers.
<br />
<br />Another very wonderful thing about this book are the intimate personal stories placed throughout the book.  Elijah Anderson did a very good job of interviewing people from the streets, and finding those in similar situations to those presented in his book.  These stories made the book all the more understandable and real.
<br />
<br />If there was one problem I could pinpoint, it would definitely be redundance in Elijah Anderson's writing.  The information provided was extremely descriptive, sometimes becoming repetitive or drawn out in several cases.  This, however, did not by any means overshadow the quality of the insight.</span>

                    <span>Code of the Street, by Elijah Anderson, was an extremely well-written book and very detailed. I often found myself saying, "yup, that's right!" I have lived and went to school in the suburbs, and now I live in the innercity. My experiences between the suburbs and in the innercity are TOTALLY different. Anderson just simply summarized everything about my innercity, even though it was focused just on Germantown.  He even explained the types of people I know (even though they are found in all social and economic classes).  The type that are "street" people.  The "decent" people.  Then there are those who are inbetween, like me, the type the "code switch," that can be either "decent" or "street" depending on the situation.  He greatly explained the situations and concerns of the innercity people.  <p>I had the pleasure meeting Elijah Anderson, and he is a completely a very nice person and keeps things "real." He is not some type of "wanna be" researcher who is trying to write a book about the innercity people, and don't have a clue about how people in the innercity lives. He has experience of living in the innercity, and he wrote this book (along with others) to help explain to others how the situation is in the innercity. I totally support his work.</span>

                    <span>I came away from this book with quite a bit. <br>   One of the most important things is the difference between street and decent. It is difficult to figure out who is who.  Its supposed to be that way. Its about survival. <br>  Anderson breaks stereotypes. He gives a thorough description of the oppositional culture.  He discusses sex and children without full responsibility as proof of manhood. He also includes what girls are trying to gain as well.  He points out that by the time that children enter fourth grade they already know that respect in the education system is very different from that on the streets.  Its encredibly difficult for children and it shouldn't be this hard.  <br>  I think that in order to solve a problem you need to know what the problem is.  He lays this out very well. I liked it so much that I have started  to read Streetwise.</span>
