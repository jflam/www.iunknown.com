                    <span>I ordered this one with Brian Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activities for busy Managers (which is excellent).  I was disappointed by this one.  So many of the activities were overly simplistic.  Several werent what I would even call activities, but rather "facilitated discussions."  I only found a few worth trying.  I rely on the other book much more.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book along with Alanna Jones "Team Building for Every Group" and this book is horrible. The Jones book is outstanding. <p>This book is very difficult to follow, it doesnt flow very well and the activities are very weak. It is geared more towards office stuff, but you couldnt even use it for office stuff since the games are very difficult to manage and obvious. I think they are more concerned with The Questions they ask than the activity. These games are some that I could think of on my own... I am returning the book.</span>

                    <span>I can't imagine who might be pleased with this team building book, including the authors.  I can't imagine what group responded positively to a number of the activities.  I typically approach a review looking to describe the assets and liabilities of the selection.  In my opinion, this book has no asset.  The activities of value have been described in many other resource books.  The games and activities you won't find in other publications were wisely left unpublished.  Fortunately, you don't have to trust my opinion.  Read through the sample pages.<br>	I have one condition under which I could recommend this book in good faith.  A facilitator or group leader who has access to a willing group that will remain intact over a period of time might try experimenting with some of the otherwise sure to be skipped over activities.  A lot of trial and error may produce a new keeper or two.<br>	I bought this book to add to an already extensive resource library.  I almost reconsidered my policy of not returning a book.  Those who have taken the book off my shelf have wasted little time replacing it. The price might tempt you to purchase this item.  Resist!  The phrase "you get what you pay for" may be true in many cases.  In this case, you really do get less.   May you benefit from my mistake and look elsewhere for a team building resource.</span>
