                <span id="Label1">Have you ever considered climbing to the top of Africa? Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest point on the continent of Africa at 19,340 feet. But unlike most of the world's highest mountains, Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed by the &#34;average&#34; person. If you want to learn more about cliimbing Mount Kilimanjaro, then this is the book for you! Carmichael and Stoddard describe the process of planning, preparation, and execution of their Mount Kilimanjaro adventure. Their expertise in the biological sciences gives credence to their recommendations for physical training and their precautions taken to prevent altitude sickness. The book is intended to be a step-by-step guide for training, making arrangements, gearing up, and preparing for potential medical problems, time differences and language barriers. They offer hiking guidelines, mental strategies, and even photography techniques. Their diary of the six-day climb gives a vivid description of how they made it up the mountain and back down.</span>

                    <span>I can't wait to go! I read this book on an airplane...unfortunately it was not headed for Africa...and it not only entertained me the entire flight, but it made me want to attempt what had otherwise seemed an impossible dream. <P>I'm glad I own a copy so I can keep it in my library as a reference when the time comes. Carmichael and Stoddard certainly seem to know what they're talking about and present it in a forthright and encouraging fashion.<P>Pick it up today...You'll be hooked, too!</span>

                    <span>I've often thought about writing a book about a trip as a way to deduct the expense from my taxes, but I've refrained for fear that the result would end up like this book. Poorly written with very limited content, this book is of little interest and very limited use to anyone actually planning to climb Kilimanjaro. It's chief value is as personal account of the authors' climb, but you can find many similar accounts for free on personal websites everywhere.</span>

                    <span>It is frequently said of Mt. Kilimanjaro that it's not a "technical" climb; the implication being that it's not so difficult. But people have died trying and only half who make the attempt make the summit.<P>Nonetheless, the process is not complicated; arduous, but not complicated. All you need to start is some idea of what to expect and what to do. This book gives these things to you in a simple format, easily read, with instructions that are straightforward.<P>Kilimanjaro is far away for most of us, in a country we know virtually nothing about, on a continent that is always seen by the Westerner as dark and mysterious. Altitude sickness and its more serious friends, edema, must be confronted (20,000 feet is no joke) and the weather is variable to say the least ... starting in a rain forest and ending on a frozen snowfield four miles up.<P>Diseases must be prepared for, as must travel and physical conditioning and numerous other details. Carmichael does a good job of laying all this out and setting you on your way.<P>The rest is up to you. He does say that his exersize routine involved getting his heart rate to 150 beats per minute for two hours every day; this I find extreme even for me but it gives you a sense of what lies in store for you on the roof of Africa.<P>...</span>

                    <span>I didn't think it was possible to make Kilimanjaro sound dull, but this author has tried very hard to. The Forewords etc are excellent -- but then they are written by other people -- it's just the meat of the book that's at fault. Some more practical advice would have been useful too. I climbed Kili in June this year and while this book came with me to the summit, it remained in my backpack the whole time. Nothing beats a good (human) guide, of course, but even if you do decide you need a guidebook, there are better ones on the market than this.</span>
