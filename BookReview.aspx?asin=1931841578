This comprehensive book contains everything you need to know in order to easily script and control your in-game entities and environments, as well as how to give players the ability to write mods and extensions.

                    <span>I must say I'm not very programming-savvy, but I'm only through the first 1/3 of the book and am very impressed-- the scripting content is so thorough and packed... the author really knows this stuff! There's so much ground covered here I think this is the ultimate game scripting bible and a must have, esp for the beginner. Excellent job!</span>

                    <span>I have been reading internet articles for like 2 months on scripting and none of them are any good. I thought that I could save money and just read articles, but it was a HUGE waste of time then I found Game Scripting Mastery mentioned on Gamedev.net, and I sucked it up and threw down my money, and I have been VERY happy with this book. It's the only book on the subject that actually starts with nothing and ends with an actual scripting system pluged into a C++ game and it all works. Also, the author shows how to integrate other popular scripting languages. This book has everything you need to know to write your own scripting system OR to integrate an already existing scripting language -- very highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This is good will be a good start that give a beginner in the area of building VM, Assembler and Compiler and how things fit together . I would not suggest anyone to stop in this books as it is still rather incomplete .<P>The major flaws in this book is that the compiler, Assembler and VM examples included in this book all have serious bug which would confuse alot of newbies .<P>For example The assembler would not complain if it cannot find a variable and just skip the variable and would not push it to the stack. However, it still generates a pop instruction for the variable causing corruption in the stack.<P>The next serious bug would be in the VM's relative Index access code. It corrupts the stack if you have arrays in your code .<P>I would really appreciate if the author would have tested the code more thoroughly before releasing it in the book especially when the book is taegeted for newbies.</span>

                    <span>I own most of the books in the Permier Press Game Development Series and I have read through most of them, but what I really appreciated about this book was the authors focus on the subject. As much as I enjoy brushing up on windows programming and re-learning a little bit of C/C++, the author wasted no time and got right to the focus of the book; game scripting.</span>

                    <span>you want to use scripting in order to work faster. reading this book takes a lot of time. if you have some knowledge of scripting and compiling it's somehow frustrating. anyway if you dont have any knowledge or want to learn more (and use this knowledge applied to games) this is a great book that will take you to an expert level.</span>
