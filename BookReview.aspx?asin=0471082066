This book has helped me and my parents, and all other relatives and friends enormously. It should be on everyone's bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>I have really enjoyed reading this book. It has given me insight into the aging process from a medical and scientific point of view which very few books do. Armed with this knowledge, I feel more confident about taking care of my parents and of my own health. Thank you Dr. Jeanne Wei and Dr. Sue Levkoff for sharing with us this wealth of information!</span>

                    <span>This book really is an encyclopedia of knowledge about the process of aging as well as the various diseases commonly found in older individuals. It covers every organ system in the body and even provides information on the medications used to treat the age-related disorders. The book also covers the social impact of aging, and gives a list of useful resources for assitance. It promises no magic potions for reversal of the aging process, but provides accurate and scientific information to improve one's health, no matter how frail. Aging is an invetable process, and for those of us who are realistic, this book is superb!</span>
