                <span id="Label1">Barry Sears's 1995-96 bestseller, <b>The Zone</b>, changed the way many people look at nutrition and weight loss. Although his plan advocates eating fewer calories and exercising more, it also stresses getting more of those calories from fat and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. Here, he expands on that theory (which is still not accepted in most scientific circles) and offers recipes to help readers put his principles into practice.</span>

                    <span>This is a 5 star book to be sure; eye-opening information useful for anyone, which is all the more reason to have a professional voice person do the reading for the audio book (Sears reads it himself). I don't know which is worse; the poor articulation, "A nutrishally fayerible issullin resposs iss possble," or the sloberry, amplified sinus and mouth noises. Yuck...<p>Definitely get the book--but pass on the audio version!</span>

                    <span>I understand why it works because I am very familiar with other low carb diets and I understand the insulin and all the other stuff, but what confuses me big time is the thing about zone blocks and measurements. That totally throws it all off for me. If I could only understand it. It sounds like a great diet and I'm sure it is, but it's too complicated to understand for most people...</span>

                    <span>I bought Mastering the Zone and never read Entering the Zone.  I found it completely easy to read and user friendly.  I read it one Friday night and applied it the next day.  It's super simple.  It explains blocks and in the back of the book, shows the quantity you can have of certain foods per block.  It's even talks about adjusting the diet to meet your personal requirements.<p>Here's my sample menu.  This is for 13 blocks of protein:<p>Breakfast:<br>Smoothie<br>1 c. yogurt<br>1 c. milk<br>1 c. strawberries<br>1 c. raspberries<br>2 envelopes of splenda<br>1 oz low fat cheese<br>12 almonds or 24 peanuts<p>Lunch:<br>4 oz Chicken<br>4 c. salad <br>1 T. ranch<br>3 c. mushrooms<br>1/2 c. grapes<br>1/2 c. pineapple<p>Snack<br>1oz cheese<br>1/2 apple<br>3 olives<p>Dinner<br>5oz fish<br>2 c. green beans<br>2 c. salad<br>1 T. ranch<br>1/2 apple<br>1 c. strawberries<p>Snack:<br>1oz beef<br>1/2 c. grapes<br>3 almonds<p>Not too shabby, huh?  The above is only 1600 calories, which is what my hubby is on.  I'm on 9 blocks, which is 1000 calories and still TONS of food, since I have a lot to lose and want to do it quicker.<p>If you want to feel GREAT, eat great and look great, I highly recommend this book and this diet as your lifetime way of eating.</span>

                    <span>The Zone Diet is the first "diet" I've ever tried, and so far--two weeks into it--I'm very happy!  Lost weight, actually don't feel like I'm starving, even though I only eat about 1200 calories a day on my block plan.  Only one downside on this book, the recipes can be pretty bland and sometimes diet-y tasting.  If you try them, you will really want to add more spices to make the food taste good.  HOWEVER, for great Zone recipes, you can go to the official Zone website at Zoneperfect.com, and they have several hundred ones for free that Zone dieters have sent in.  MUCH tastier.</span>
