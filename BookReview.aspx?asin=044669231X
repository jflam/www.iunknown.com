                <span id="Label1">From the Grammy-nominated star of Saturday Night Live and his equally talented sister comes a hysterically cynical look at life through a glass half empty.I HATE THIS PLACE is the book for anyone who's ever tired of crossing to the sunny side of the street, looking for that elusive pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, or reading self-help books that are meant to bring peace and prosperity. Guaranteed to shatter illusions, extinguish all hope, and keep the jaded and the disgruntled laughing all the way, it is filled with such daily "affirmations" as "If you don't have anything nice to say, welcome to the club," and advice like "Knock, and the door shall be slammed in your face." Rife with the wit and wisdom of Jimmy Fallon and his sister Gloria, this book promises to tickle the funny bone of the pessimist in everyone.</span>

                    <span>I Hate This Place is a great book--funny and very clever. It includes all those things we (well, most of us) often think of but can never actually put into words (especially not this witty). I've often thought of myself as an optimist but after reading this book, I have to say that I'm probably not. Jimmy and Gloria Fallon (whom I got to meet at a book signing--very cool) are two ingenious and unique people who aren't afraid to tell it like it is. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>All right, not just you - everyone needs it. Laughing is good and this book had my brother and I laughing to the point of unsightly drool. About 90 percent of our pages are dog-eared. I've personally recited drool-inducing parts to my parents and friends, and find myself constantly struggling not to snap book lines at the many alternative, empowered and positively annoying neighbors I have the pleasure of, like, melding energy with here in NYC's East Village. I'm all for empowerment. And whatever melding is. But I love that, in addition to taking pessimism to its hysterically funny extreme, "I Hate This Place" also satirizes the self-help craze and all of its super-duper-beluper positivity! and can-do affirmations! In fact, the Fallons include their own daily affirmations for the pessimist (personal favorites: "Tomorrow may never come" and "Today is another day, just like yesterday was"), as well as the truth behind such optimistic advice as, "A penny saved is a penny earned." ("Pennies are worthless.") <P>Thanks, Jimmy and Gloria. This book is well-needed, and much appreciated by me.<P>(Group hug?)</span>

                    <span>Jimmy Fallon is a pretty funny guy on SNL I think, even if he laughs in his sketches too much. This book misses the mark though, I hate to say. <P>I suspect most people who enjoy this generic brand of cynicism also found Chandler to be the "deep" one on Friends. In fact, he is a lot like this book. Gets a few laughs at first by mocking some easy targets, but after ten minutes I can call every uninspired line he'll say. <P>If this kind of comedy is your "bag", hop in your Jetta, put in the I Love the 80s CD (for irony of course! only if people ask though, because this isn't clever irony anyway....) and head down to the bookstore.</span>

                    <span>This is an awesome book! A lot of the pages of really funny!! Jimmy and Gloria did an awesome job writing it and I think one of the reasons it's done so well is because people can relate to the things they say in the book. I love Jimmy, he's hilarious on SNL and he continues that comedy into the book. His sister also did a great job writing it. Also, check out Jimmy's CD, The Bathroom Wall. It's awesome, I love it!!!</span>
