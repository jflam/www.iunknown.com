                <span id="Label1">Photographed on seven continents, and nine years in the making, this lush sequel to Art Wolfe's Light on the Land features 150 gorgeous and compelling color images exploring the extraordinary beauty of nature. "I really don't want to dazzle people with detail," Wolfe says "I want to move them by the moment." These "moments" come from the book's five geographic regions &#151; Desert, Ocean, Mountain, Forest, and Polar &#151; and will indeed captivate the reader with their clarity and range. Remarkable for its artistic vision, atmospheric presentation, and powerful but understated environmental message, the book includes an essay by Art Davidson with each section.</span>

                    <span>Edge of the Earth, Corner of the Sky is a beautiful text in every way.  From cover to cover, this is an impressive book that contains truly breathtaking imagery.  The book is broken into five sections: Desert, Ocean, Mountain, Forest, and Polar.  In each section, Art Wolfe successfully captures the light and quality of an immense variety of landscapes.  Some pictures are so breathtaking in their colour and composition that they do not seem real.  The book is beautifully bound and the images are crystal clear.<p>I found the strongest sections to be the Ocean and Mountain chapters, although I was surprised at some of the amazing scenery photographed in the Desert section.  Each image stands alone, with a small caption that describes the location and major features.  At the end of the book lie photo notes that comment in more detail on the terrain, as well as how the image was captured.  These items were very interesting and informative.<p>Although the images are indeed beautiful and the landscapes varied, it should be noted that Art Wolfe captures most of his images in the early morning or late evening.  Therefore most of the photos contain saturated reds and golds on exposed surfaces, and the long blue shadows in those areas that have escaped the sun.  This choice does not detract from the collection, but it should be known that the majority of the photos share this quality.<p>I use this book as a reference for my own photography and painting, especially when focussing on colour and composition in my images.  But aside from being a reference, it is a gorgeous text that can be viewed over and over based simply upon the beauty of its contents.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, the images within this book reflect a perfect combination of light and opportunity and particularly I'm very impressed by the star trails. In general Art Wolfe shows us "through the lens" how beautiful our earth currently is. An important message is that it should be saved so that future generations will be able to live on. The (excellents) forewords in this book underline this approach.<p>At the end of the book Art Wolfe explains his used technique, how to achieve a proper exposure, how to consider the light etc.. This book is brilliant in all aspects!</span>

                    <span>Ansel Adams, who is probably the world's most famous landscape photographer, worked in black and white.  According to Eliot Porter, a color photographer, Adams maintained that color photography had no legitimate place in the art of photography because it was too literal to be an art form and that it was not possible to practice it interpretively.  In this book, Art Wolfe once again proves that Adams was wrong.<p>Wolfe presents us with landscapes from all over the world, from places where few us will ever travel, that are spectacular.  Many of the pictures, particularly those of rugged mountains, will leave the reader in awe of the natural landscape.<p>But Wolfe is not just concerned with the subject matter.  He never forgets the qualities of light and color.  Most of his shots are from the "magic hours" of sunrise and sunset when the sky is diffused with the range of colors from intense blues to bright reds.  Yet,while the mountains that form the backdrop for the lighting effects bask in the red glow, the foregrounds are frequently plunged into darkness, creating feelings of both repose and mystery.<p>The pictures are arranged into five chapters called Desert, Ocean, Mountain, Forest and Polar, but these subjects often creep from one chapter into another.  What is more interesting is when Wolfe presents a series of pictures, often on facing pages, that look at the same subject in different light, or different subjects in the same light.  This allows us to explore the subtle differences between the pictures and come to a deeper understanding of Wolfe?s art and the subject.<p>Technical data and Wolfe's commentary on the circumstances of the taking of each picture are in the back of the book, where they do not detract from the optical feast, but are available to those who may be interested in these details.<p>Beginning each chapter is a short essay by Art Davidson that is well written and has some relationship to the subsequent photographs.  Such essays have become mandatory but, like the ones in this book, they often seem to have a life of their own that does not really illuminate the pictures.  Perhaps I?m asking too much, but I have the example of photographer Galen Rowell?s book "Alaska: Images of the Country" in which Rowell quoted selected passages from author John McPhee?s book "Coming into the Country" to give us a strong but intimate view of that place.<p>Speaking of Rowell, one of his most famous books was "Mountain Light" where he showed photographers how to capture mountains in their distinctive illunination.  I don?t know if Wolfe studied Rowell, but if he did, he has surpassed his teacher.<p>One of the book's strong points may also be its weakness for some readers.  Wolfe often shows a photograph of a mountain backdrop bathed in magic-hours light, with a body of water in the foreground reflecting the mountains and concealed in shadow.  While some viewers will take the opportunity to compare these similar pictures to explore Wolfe's style and subject, others will find them too repetitious.<p>I also have to say a word about environmentalism, and here I know some people may react to my criticism apart from the book.  Wolfe has said that he put this book together to underscore the importance of preserving the wild places he has photographed.  Introductions by Robert Redford and John Adams, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, reemphasize the point.  Then Davidson's strident essays speak almost exclusively of man's efforts to dismember the landscape.  These photographs are so eloquent that I see no necessity for adding a stream of text to distract us from the pictures, each of which is truly worth 10,000 words.<p>Despite these criticisms I do not believe anyone who looks into the book will be unmoved or feel that they could better have spent their time.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best series of landscape photos I have seen. I almost thought I heard angels singing arias in the background while looking at these images. Such is their profound and moving beauty.<p>Besides Steve McCurry's South Southeast, this is the only book I have seen where the publisher did not skimp on the paper and the printing. The colors and the sharpness are perfect. The book is divided into five sections based on the climate. The Arctic and the Rainforest were two of them. Some of the images are surreal (salt flats) while others were poetic (the curves in dunes). All of them made me stare in wonder, and I have made a resolution to see some of these places before they are lost to development. <p>The best part about this book for aspiring photographers is in the back. Here there is a thumbnail of each picture in the book with a note from Art Wolfe explaining the environment and the methods he used to photograph the scene. Included are details such as the camera, lens, film, shutter speed, and aperture settings that were used. I sat mesmerized staring at the photos and then reading the technical details on how he captured the image. <p>If you are an budding landscape photographer, this book is fuel for your aspiration. Or if you just plain love nature scenes, this book will make your love for nature deeper.</span>
