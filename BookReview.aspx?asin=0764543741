                    <span>This book is a not bad introduction to ASP.NET. The reason I purchased it is I really needed to master Web Matrix ASAP and Mr. Sussman's book was quite helpful in accomplishing that goal. Of course, it is better to begin with Visual Studio since Web Matrix is somewhat limited resemblance of Visual Studuo but Web Matrix has something nobody could resist - it is free. <br>Make sure you learn as profoundly as possible chapters about datagrids and reusable content; these two are absolutely irreplaceble components of practically any online database application. Also pay attention to inclusion of namespaces at the very top of your code, it is forgetable. The only thing which was not working for me is Web Services. Other code samples work fine.<br>I would recommend to start with this book to anybody who needs to master ASP.NET.</span>

                    <span>I am new to programming.  <p>This book starts at the beginning: building a graphical web page in Web Matrix.  Following a entertaining blend of practical, funny and insightful steps, in a short period I was using Visual Basic.Net and databases to add dynamic features, controls and web services.  <p>I was amazed at how easy it is to do.  This book provides an enjoyable was to grasp a firm foundation in ASP.NET programming.</span>
