                    <span>I follow this category of projects on the net very closely and even recognizing some of articles in Make #1 as seen before I can say that I didn't enjoy reading magazine like Make in very long time. 
<br />
<br />I'm web developer myself and not particularly crazy about DIY, but I can recognize good magazine when I see it.
<br />
<br />There is only one BAD thing about it is that it's not monthly - I can't wait for next issue.</span>

                    <span>When I was 13 (way too many years ago) I rigged a plastic camera I had received from saving bubble gum comics to a kite I got from saving green giant labels.  The idea was to take a picture of my house and me from the air.  My favorite toys were always built from parts of other toys.
<br />
<br />So I was delighted to see this form of aerial photography as the cover article for the newly launched Make magazine.  There were some really elegant solutions to problems I dealt with at 13. This magazine is filled with cool little projects any geek would want to play with.  Build your own rail gun! That would be way better than the volcano model every other kid is bringing to science fair.  The articles bring the science down to the ground where most of us can "get" it.  Sometimes the underlying science is ignored altogether in favor of the sheer gee whiz of it all.  But everything is fun, even if just to read about.
<br />
<br />This is the kind of magazine you'll want to carry around with you to poke your nose in every time you have to wait in line or kill some time.  I found that everywhere I went, the magazine created conversation from curious bystanders.
<br />
<br />My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that all of the computer projects (only a few) were based on Apple computers.  I'm sure both of the people who own Apples have their projects built now and perhaps the editors can get to the rest of us.

                    <span>While flipping through this "mook" (as it apparently is called), it brought back childhood memories of browsing my Dad's Popular Science (or was it Popular Mechanics?) magazines.  I like the smaller, "bookish" form factor as it makes it feel more - well, uhh - like a book.  Since this is a magazine, I was curious to see how many ads I was going to have to wade through.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover there were hardly any; I hope they keep them to a minimum going forward.
<br />
<br />The "how to" articles are very well done, with a great amount of step-by-step information in both visual and written detail.  My only problem now is time.  Every project looked like so much fun it was disappointing to realize I wouldn't be able to do them all before the next issue would arrive and give me a whole new set of cool projects.  =)  My personal time management issues aside, Make is high-quality publication, top to bottom.</span>

                    <span>I just received the premiere issue of Make Magazine from O'Reilly yesterday. Let me just say this mag is a geek's dream come true. It's not a magazine about coding. Heck, I'm not sure if calling it a magazine is even accurate. It's more of a journal or zine (but with higher production values). A geek quarterly, if you will.
<br />
<br />For example... the premiere issue features an article on aerial photography. Not geeky enough for you? Ok, how about aerial photography accomplished by rigging up a camera to a kite? Still not geeky enough? Throw in a homemade mechanism for triggering the shutter from the ground.  The best part is, this isn't just an article full of theory.  These guys DO this stuff. The article is full of pictures, plans and step by step instructions on how to make it happen.
<br />
<br />That's not all... other How-To articles include: making a 5-in-1 network cable, making a magnetic stripe reader, XM Radio hacks, tips and tricks for your IPOD, gmail hacks, IPAQ hacks and a lot more.  This puppy is just under 200 pages of D-I-Y technology.
<br />
<br />Still not geeky enough?  How about an article on how to make your own railgun, using magnets, a ruler and some steel bearings? There's also an article about hacking robotic dogs to sniff out toxic waste. This is geek goodness in all it's glory.
<br />
<br />If you like reading 2600 (the hacker quarterly), Maximum PC and Scientific American, roll them all into one and you have Make (but without the attitude of Maximum PC and the leetspeak of 2600).  I'm gonna subscribe!</span>

                    <span>Tim O'Reilly has decide to wager a few nickels on this offering. Rather anomalous, though. A magazine masquerading as a book. But leaving that aside, it is a paean to the inventive streak in many. There are actual existing magazines on inventions and technology. What makes Make different from those is its deliberate evocation of an Internet ambience. Not unlike Wired magazine, actually. Many of the inventions or gadgets described in Make are hardware concoctions, each built by one person on a budget. A far cry from a fully funded corporate research lab. There is a conscious harking to the iconic solitary inventor. 
<br />
<br />Make is for a crowd that grew up on techno music and who lives lifestyles enabled by a continual Web interaction. An audience that has never known adult life without the Web. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps Make will encourage you to help bring the future closer. At the very least, the serendipity of perusing its articles might spark new ideas.</span>
