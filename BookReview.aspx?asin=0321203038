                    <span>As a professional computer programmer, I've read tons of self training books. I have never read one as clear, well thought out and laid out as this one. I am half way through the book and will be sorry to see it end. Every time I stop after a technique and fool with it I soon develop a question and sure enough the very next paragraph answers the very question. If I read something in the explanations that stikes me as vague I only have to glance up at the illustration and it reinforces the point perfectly.  The book won't make me a great artist but it definitely helped me kick out the stuff I needed for my web site. Jeff I thank you.  Now on to the next chapter.  </span>

                    <span>I NEEDED to KNOW Illustrator.  Being retentive, I researched on Amazon, googled, and then went to the local library - reviewing all the Illustrator 'how-to' books.  I purchased the 3 with the best reviews, and this one on a whim (it had a pretty cover.)   
<br />
<br />SO.  This is the standout, esp. when linked to the publishers home page.  I am a visual person - this is an honest 'visual' study guide, with excellent Demo quicktime movies to watch, easy to follow exercises (on the accompanying CD) to download and work along with, and a jovial manner that worked for me.  It also works sequentially - moving from excercise 1 onward in a logical, building fashion to excercise 2, and 3, etc.  It is home-study, and you do have to work along, but it works.
<br />Regarding my saying it's  "an HONEST visual study guide."  Considering my pile of 3 top-reviewed books - all are lovely books, but maybe too lovely as the emphasis is the slick production of the book (and illustrations therein), and not on the teaching of sequential skills within the book.  I wanted to learn Illustrator, not marvel at what others have done in Illustrator.  And I wanted the information linear, not hit-and-miss depending on what page you opened the book.  
<br />
<br />I recommend this book highly for a logical, visual introduction to Adobe Illustrator.  With the exception of the cover, it isn't that pretty, but it will teach the skills you need to make your own beautiful illustrations.</span>
