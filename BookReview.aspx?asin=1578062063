                    <span>Ambrose edited the Eisenhower Papers project for many years and finally  turned his talents on writing a military biography of Ike. The Ike opus is  infinitely superior to Ambrose's earlier biography on Henry Halleck and his  research and knowledge about his subject is obvious throughout.<p>The only  "criticism" I have is that Ambrose is blatantly biased in Ike's  favor and makes no bones about it. The first words in his introduction are,  'Dwight Eisenhower was a great and a good man," which is undoubtedly  true, but a biographer should take more pains to disguise their own  feelings. There is very little criticism of Ike in Ambrose's work, which  borders on the hagiography. Perhaps a bit more of Harry Truman's invective  towards Eisenhower could have infused these pages.<p>Still, Ambrose is a  wonderful writer and his works are always fun to read and informative. This  is an excellent look at Eisenhower in World War II, even if it is a  completely uncritical examination.</span>

                    <span>I was not aware of the fine writing of Ambrose until I read "Citizen Soldiers" and in "Supreme Commander" he does yet another job of putting the reader right there besides Ike as he learns, commands and  most importantly earns the trust of all who comes in contact with  him.<p>Many of Ike's compatriots questions his skills as a soldier but all  are certainly of his positive human skills at bonding a diverse group to  attain the goal of defeating the enemy, in this Ambrose describes well.   And from this experience at war time an outstanding president is groomed.   I think Ambroses' "Eisenhower: A soldier and President" will have  to be my next purchase.<p>One point I'm a bit disappointed is the fact that  Ambrose does not spend much time dealing with Ike's rols in the debacle of  Hurtgen Forest, the problems with Repple Depple, and the problems with the  problems caused by Segragation in the Army, several of the areas that  Ambrose had detailed discussions on in "Citizen Soldiers".  But  all in all, an excellent read.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Ambrose skillfully tells how Eisenhower developed into one of the  greatest military leaders in history.  Eisenhower was able to lead the  Allies to victory WWII because of his ablitiy to keep the alliance  together.  Eisenhower understood that the only way to achieve success was  to build a consensus among differing viewpoints on how to conduct the war.   He had to understand British strategies, goals, traditions, and hardships  and meld them together with American objectives.  He realized that the  British have all ready been punished thru years of war, where as the  Americans had justed entered the war and had not endured the hardships in  the degree in which Britain had.  Eisnehower was faced with many  strong-willed military and political figures like Roosevelt, Churchill,  Montgomery, Bradley, de Gaulle, and Patton, each of whom had their own  views on how to conduct the war.  Eisenhower was able to work with this  men, which was no small feat. It is diffcult to see how another person  would be able to lead such a diverse group of people.</span>
