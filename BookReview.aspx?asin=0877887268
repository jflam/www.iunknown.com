                    <span>"The Rock That Is Higher" is an important book that many Christians need to read. It not only asks great questions, but it makes you think in ways that you never have before. Sometimes, you won't agree with Madeleine...but really, I don't think that agreeing with her all the time is really the point. <P>I question myself when I read a book and seem to be agreeing with everything the author is saying. Either they are not challenging me to think hard or I'm not challenging myself to think hard enough about what I've just read. Either way you look at it, reading books like that, is rarely helpful in forming who you are as a person. <P>However, this book is different. It is great and different and challenging and inspiring and odd and unique and indifferent and just plain brilliant. So don't pass this book up. Get hooked on Madeleine.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book talking about how stories can hold little slices of truth. Fiction isn't truly fictitious b/c it has whispers of truth in it--much like the writers of the Bible may have felt. Her attitudes on religion and the Bible are right on imho. She doesn't worship the Bible (written by man) or the religion, but sees the slices of truth that story can hold. She loves God with all her heart, but she's not super-dogmatic and doesn't use overly complicated religious language. She is a breath of fresh air while remaining steadfast in her faith. Anyone interesting in writing or finding sources of inspiration will enjoy this book or especially "Walking on Water". She further proves that real and true people are never dated, but rather timeless b/c of the soul and spirit within them. She is a free spirit and an inspiration.</span>

                    <span>L'Engle's work is a tribute to the senseless attitude many of us have toward the apparent mindlessness offered to us by the world. Story as Truth is her search for meaning in moments of trouble. Not only do the accounts of her soul-searing tribulations mirror the anger and hurt of the reader, the ways in which she seeks the goodness of God during these times bekons us to seek the same. Yet in seeking that, she finds the God of peace sitting behind a veil of experience. We seek passionatly life, truth, and the good in life, yet in reality (as L'Engle points out) we can only come to this through a thoughtful experience of substance; not necessarily a foul experience, just one real enough to weigh upon our own mortality. A thoughtful look at the experiential side of our lives.</span>
