                    <span>I played a lot of basketball before taking on coaching my 6 year olds' team, but I had never coached.  I digested the basics of this book in about an hour and it was a roadmap to get me started.  I keep reading and using it as the season progresses.  Very very good for first-time coaches for kids leagues of about 5-13 years old.</span>

                    <span>I struggled looking for a book written for the experienced youth coach who doesn't know much about basketball.  I coach four youth sports, but I never played organized basketball.  I was at a loss for drills, plays and defensive philosophies.  This book gave me a huge head start and Coach Faucher's style is easy and right for the kids.  I enjoy planning and running my basketball practices far more than any other sport now.  Thanks Coach Faucher.  Do you have one for football, . . baseball, . . soccer??????</span>

                    <span>I read this book because I thought that it would help me coach a group of 5th graders in the fundamentals of basketball.  I did not learn anything new after reading this book, but I also have played basketball for many years.  What was valuable to me was the drills made available.  If you know nothing of basketball you'll appreciate this book.</span>

                    <span>About 4 practices and a game into the season I was totally frustrated.  My practices were disorganized, and the team wasn't responding to any of my "drills".  I found this book at the store and bought it.  It was wonderful! I now had renewed hope, and a plan.  The kids responded quickly, and I enjoyed coaching much more.  <br>The next season I started fresh after reading and re-reading the book.  It was a great season, and many parents told me how much they enjoyed my coaching style, and the kids had fun too.  I owe most of it to the book.  I was more organized and polished.</span>

                    <span>i decided that i wanted to coach basketball at my school,  i wasn't sure what i should do, how to do it, etc.  this book is a real good start.  it talks about what skills kids need to be taught, it gives drills on how to teach those skills, it gives you sample practice plans that show you how to organize the drills, etc.  it even gives you some plays for inbounding the ball, etc.  all in all the book has everything a first year coach would want.  a small warning however, this book is designed for first year coaches.  you are not going to find how to run a triangle offense, or how to beat a pressure defense.  but if you are looking for a book to start you off, then this is the one.</span>
