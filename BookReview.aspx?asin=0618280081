                    <span>This engaging emotionally resonant book is the perfect present for any child getting ready to go to camp!! The second book in Jacobson's fabulous Winnie series takes Winnie and her best friends from home away to summer camp, where they meet the challenges of balancing new friendships with old beautifully. Winnie struggles with how to define herself and how to reveal the things that make her different from other kids. In other words she learns to be herself- Truly Winnie. Jacobson weaves these important emotional themes so perfectly into a fun story line involving all the sparkle and splash of summer. The relaxed charm of Geis' illustrations match the story perfectly. The reader is swept along rooting for Winnie who learns and grows from every experience. I can't wait to see where Jacobson takes Winnie next!</span>

                    <span>This charming sequel to Jacobson's WINNIE DANCING ON HER OWN explores Winnie's personality--and longings--even more deeply. When Winnie, Zoe, and Vanessa take the End of the Alphabet Club on the road to summer camp, Winnie must confront her need to belong while allowing herself to expand her circle. Caught in a lie of her own making, Winnie tackles her ethics along with her expanded definition of self.<P>Perfect for read-alones, read-alouds, and second, third, and fourth grade classrooms! Teachers and parents take note.</span>

                    <span>Jennifer Jacobson has done it again with her second Winnie book. Here's a real girl character - a loyal friend, a feisty personality, and, at times, a girl painfully unsure of herself - who young readers can relate to. In this book, Winnie goes off to camp and gets herself into a real mess. Even as Winnie tell lies upon lie, we're always on her side, just waiting to see how she figures out how to do the right thing and tell the truth.</span>

                    <span>"Winner!" That's Winnie's Dad's nickname for Winnie, and that surely describes this book. My kids and I adored the first Winnie book (WINNIE DANCING ON HER OWN) and now we've loved this second in the series. Winnie is so BELIEVABLE, so engaging, so accessible. My kids kept stopping me during our group reading to say, "The same thing happened to me." That's Winnie, a character every kid can relate to. If you haven't read the first Winnie book, go read it. Then you'll be in great shape to enjoy this book. My kids and I have our fingers crossed that there'll be a third Winnie book before too long!</span>
