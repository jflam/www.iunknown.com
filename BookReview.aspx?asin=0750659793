                    <span>I bought this book a couple of months ago, and put all the advice into practice on my website. The results have been great and my ranking is continuing to grow. The book is well written and contains a great range of practical advice and information on getting your site ranked highly. The Chapter on Link Strategies is particularly good, this is an area that I had not really considered before reading this book, and it now makes up a considerable part of my search engine strategy.
<br />
<br />Buy this book if you want a competitive advantage in your search engine strategy.</span>

                    <span>This book is good for a newcomer to search engine optimization, but anyone who has been working on promoting a website will already know or assume all of the information in this book. If you are brand new to SEO then this book is a good starting point, but otherwise spend your time browsing the web or using SEO descussion forums, because the information will be more current and more in debth.</span>

                    <span>This book helped me to drastically increased my online business! I own an online data backup company called www.remotedatabackups.com and before I read this book, less than 10% of my business came from search engines.  <p>Today, just 4 months after buying Alex and Ben's book, over 50% of my new business comes from search engines...people I've never talked to before who found me simply by typing in key phrases that I incorporated into my website in a specific manner that they clearly outline in their book.  You don't even need to be a web guru to understand what they are saying.<p>I have been so impressed with the results that I decided to go one step farther and I actually hired them to be my "search engine guides" and it has been definately the best money I've ever spent.  They prevented me from spending thousands on a Cold Fusion website that would not have done well AT ALL on the search engines and they recommended a more "search engine friendly" method.  The results were almost immediate.  I would have never known otherwise.  <p>Excellent book!</span>
