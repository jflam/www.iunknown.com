                    <span>Found this title while killing time at a Barnes & Noble. Hooked by the end of the first paragraph. (The author, Hilary "just one 'l'" De Vries, knows how knit words together). Stood there for an hour reading, before I realized that I'd lost all sensation in my right leg. Bought the book. Took it home. Devoured it in one sitting. But enough about me. Hilary (just one "l") De Vries is the new Carrie Fisher. "So Five Minutes Ago" is the most sharply observed cultural dissection since "Postcards from the Edge". I'm not sure I know what "Funny! Funny! Funny!" means (mmmm...perhaps, funny?), but I did curl a lip at least every other page or so and snorted more often than I'll ever care to admit, ok? I'd give this five stars, too, except I believe in grading on a curve.</span>

                    <span>Hilary DeVries did what many of her celeb journalist peers would love to do -- see the truth that surrounds them day-to-day clearly enough to rise above it and write an hilarious and smart novel about what it's like to be a Hollywood striver swimming with sharks. So Five Minutes Ago couldn't be better even if DeVries had written about herself, but aside from some characters who bear a striking resemblence to real show biz denizens, this isn't a roman a clef or DeVries's diary made public. This is real writing.The characters are fully-formed and by turns funny and touching. The prose literally zips and zings. There's a laugh on every page -- and even better an insight about human nature that resonates long after the book in finished. In Hollywood-speak one might call DeVries a new Nora Ephron meets Carrie Fisher meets Helen Fielding, but I think this book is really the beginning of an original career.</span>

                    <span>This book put me to bed early every night. I tried staying awake, but I could only survive a few pages before nodding off. It's just boring... I appreciate the attempt at making a book on such subject matter, but I wasn't intrigued.</span>

                    <span>Ok, I used to work in this business -- i.e., the movie business -- so I know what I'm talking about here. DeVries takes aim at "the biz" and strikes with deadly, hilarious accuracy. Even so, if this were all she accomplished here, it might not be enough. Fortunately -- amazingly -- it's not. DeVries appears to be that rare journalist (she covers Hollywood-types; she's considered a must-read among the cognesceti) who knows how to tell a real story, who knows how to create flesh-and-blood characters you care about, and who can really WRITE. "o 5 Minutes Ago" is a gem. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten mote attention than it has, although it does seem to be building a real fan base. Anyway -- bottom line -- by this book! You'll be glad did!</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this dip into the inner workings of the Hollywood PR and celebrity machine. Our heroine, a publicist, is delightfully wry as she struggles through her crazy days dealing with self-involved lunatics-most of them not so heavily disguised portraits of recognizable stars. I particularly enjoyed our heroine's visit to the home of two wacko lesbian lovers; hilarious. It's not Middlemarch, but in an entertaining, breezy way, De Vries paints a detailed portrait of a warped universe she obviously knows all too well. So 5 Minutes Ago serves as a welcome escape from the real world.</span>
