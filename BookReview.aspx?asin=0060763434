                    <span>Ms Le Guin is a renowned sci-fi and fantasy writer, winner of several Hugo and Nebula Awards, author of the remarkable "Left Hand of Darkness" (1969) and the "Earthsea" cycle (1970 - 2001). <p>With "Orsinian Tales" (1976) she surprises the reader with a collection of short stories placed in an imaginary country: Orsinia. This country has all the traits of a Central European one (just as the fictional Ruritania of "Prisoner of Zenda"). The characters names and psychology have resonances of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, giving a special undertone to all the tales. <br>The stories take place in different time periods (in the last page of each one, is shown the year of occurrence) allowing the reader to have a side-glance of the historical evolution of the country.  <p>The tales are written in "minimalists" style, that is to say they portray every day scenes, no great adventures or speculations, just insights of ordinary people in ordinary situations. With this simple stuff Ms. Le Guin construct an engaging collection, full of touching details as in "Imaginary Countries". Family relationships and interaction with neighbors in a small town are described with a keen and gentle regard in "Night Talks".<p>A lovely sample of Le Guin's short prose.<br>Reviewed by Max Yofre.</span>

                    <span>OK, first off, if you're looking for SF to read, don't bother with this  book, because SF it's not, even though it's by Ursula Le Guin.  On the  other hand, if you're looking for some beautifully written, well-crafted  short stories, you might well stop and read.<p>ORSINIAN TALES is a  collection of "mainstream" short stories set in the imaginary  Eastern European country of Orsinia, which take place in various time  periods ranging from the pagan Dark Ages to the 17th century to the Cold  War.  They are by turns grim, joyous, lyrical, wistful, and always  fascinating.  My one cavil is that the date of each story's setting is  placed at the end of the story, so if you're not quite sure of the story's  period (the period is not always terribly well defined in the opening of  the stories, and it makes a difference--at least to me--if a tale is set in  1905 or 1950) you have to peek ahead.  But it's a small quibble with a  lovely piece of literature.</span>
