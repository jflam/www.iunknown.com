                    <span>I enjoyed reading the book.  Perhaps it's a function of having read previous works on the old Washington Senators (e.g., Henry Thomas' book on Walter Johnson, Fred Lieb, Shirley Povich), but there doesn't seem to be much here that I haven't read before other than a few personal rememberances handed down within the Judge family.  In fact, Judge the grandson cites Lieb and Thomas in several passages.  The only thing I really learned was how beat up Peckinpaugh was during the 1924 World Series.</span>

                    <span>Written by the grandson of the legendary first baseman of the old Washington Senators, Joe Judge, Damn Senators is a nostalgic telling of how the Senators with Joe Judge achieved their first and only World Series championship in 1924. A drama filled with history, legends, and profiles of great baseball figures of history, Damn Senators combines an introspective personal tale with a portrait of the riveting pressure of playing in the big leagues three-quarters of a century ago. A thoroughly engaging read and highly recommended -- especially for baseball fans.</span>

                    <span>Mark Judge's book, Damn Senators, is as finely executed as any 3-6-3 double play turned by the author's grandfather, Washington Senators first baseman Joe Judge.  The book focuses on Joe Judge and the Senators victorious season in 1924. In addition to writing about his grandfather, Mark Judge includes fine descriptions of Senators owner Clark Griffith, legendary Senators pitcher Walter Johnson and a superb sketch of Washington D.C. and its citizens at the time of the Senators  all too brief ascendency.<p>Those who believe game six of the 1975 World Series is the best game ever played in the fall classic should read Damn Senators. Mark Judge does a fine job depicting the excitment of game seven of the 1924 World Series, when Walter Johnson came out of the bullpen to gain victory for the Senators in their one and only World Series triumph. I saw game six of the 1975 World Series on television. After reading Damn Senators I almost feel as though I have seen game seven of the 1924 Series as well.  <p>Damn Senators is well worth its purchase price.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the winning combination of baseball and fine writing.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to this superb book, the reader can almost taste, feel and see what it was like to live in Washington in the mid-1920s.  At the time, DC was by far the smallest city in the major leagues, but baseball fever overtook the Nation's Capital in 1924 after years of horrendous teams.  Judge takes you week by week through that wonderful season, culminating in what is arguably still the most exciting World Series ever.  A heartstopper won by the Senators over the highly favored New York Giants in the 12th inning of Game 7.  The city broke out in celebrations wilder than those following the end of the Civil War or World War I.  Judge nicely reproduces the legendary sportswriter Fred Lieb's account of his conversation with Commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis the night Washington won it all, in which Landis described the Capital's unprecedented celebration as the "zenith" of baseball's popularity in America.   <p>Sadly, of course, it wasn't long after the glory days of the author's grandfather that Washington fans were forced to endure nearly 4 decades of teams that did not even try to compete, with the inevitably attendance problems resulting.  Judge poignantly recounts the departure of the Senators in 1960, and then of their expansion replacement in 1971. Ironically, today Washington is the center of huge metropolis, the 6th largest media market in the U.S.  Yet it has no baseball team.  Mark Judge's book reminds us of a better time for baseball fans in the DC area, and points us to toward a day when the Washington Senators may be reborn.<p>Some minor quibbles with the background chapter that opens the book:  Judge seems to confuse the identity of various 19th century teams (e.g., the Chicago "White Stockings", "Colts", and "Cubs" are all the same team).  He conflates the founding of the short-lived National Association in 1971 with that of the enduring National League in 1876.  And the number of pennants and World Series championships won by Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics are grossly understated.  But none of this detracts from the excellence of the book as a whole, and particular the heart of it which recounts so beautifully Washington's experience as World Champs in 1924.  We can only hope that there will be future authors to write so artfully about the championships of future Washington baseball teams.</span>

                    <span>Although this book was about the great Senators' franchise of the Walter Johnson era that included the "Big Train" Walter Johnson, Sam Rice, Goose Gooslin, Bucky Harris and the perennial first baseman Joe Judge, the author's grandfather, it also reflects on a City that had struggling teams in the last two decades of D.C. baseball only to lose them to a new owner that took the team to Texas with great sadness to the D.C. fans. Judge tells the story of one of the worst teams in baseball that eventually unfolds into a star-studded team that could beat the Yankees and actually win a World Series in 1925. Judge intermixes the play by play with biographies of the players of that era anchored by quality detail about Walter Johnson the dominating pitcher, a modest gentleman, and of course his grandfather who typically hit 300 plus with a tremendous fielding percentage. The exciting description of the Senators great team is also full of sports articles and editorials of that era that contribute to the telling of how the fans felt about their team and their national good guy, Walter Johnson. The author has a special view of Judge through his family as they presented a personal picture of the player that played consistently at a Hall of Famer level in 17 seasons with the Senators. The star players of the Senators of the twenties are in stark contrast to Ty Cobb with a bad guy image and the loutish Ruth who actually couldn't play at times due to bellyaches. The author quotes a Ruthian binge of eating 12 hotdogs and 5 sodas at a train stop resulting in intestinal injury. The good guy Senators of the twenties reminds me of my favorite Senator of modern times, Ken McMullen. McMullen, a lifetime 260 hitter with Washington wasn't the star sacker like Judge but he anchored the infield and played steady and had a consistent bat. But what I remember most about McMullen was that he signed autographs after the game for kids including me while most of the ball players of this second division team ran to their cars. McMullen like the Big Train and Judge were players that were gentleman far from the era of today made up of individuals. Bob Short, the 70's owner of the Senators, traded the left side of the infield (McMullen and Brinkman) for Denny McLain who lost over 20 games while Detroit flourished. That bad trade seemed to start Short's cruel destruction of a team that literally went south.</span>
