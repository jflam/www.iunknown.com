Make sure if you get it to read it starting with chapter 1 and read everything, dont skip around.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book blindly (no retailers stock any bike books anywhere near me) based on the reviews here.  I'm more than happy that I made the choice that I did.
<br />
<br />As a background, I've been riding for 18 of my 25 years, but I needed some help with certain techniques.  I feel that I'm a good rider, but I know that this book will improve my riding tremendously.  It's incredibly easy to read and doesn't get boring or condescending.  In some parts, it's downright funny.  I managed to read this book in a matter of two days, and that was at work! 
<br />
<br />The strength of this book is that it's a good "mid-point" book between the beginner's books and the racing technique books.  Certainly, beginners AND racers could learn a lot from Lee Parks, but this is exactly what I was looking for - explanations of WHY to do certain things in certain situations, as well as HOW to perform them.  If you've got a basic understanding of how to ride a bike, along with some experience riding, this book is for you.  I'm reading it for the second time this week, and I'm already picking out points that I missed or glossed over during the first read-through.  It really is that good.</span>

                    <span>When I first started reading this, I was concerned it was a bit over my head.... directed to hotdogs and racers. They will like it too, but Parks has carefully related track experiences to "road smarts" without suggesting you go beyond your limits.  Well written so experienced riders can improve their weak areas, at their own pace.</span>

                    <span>Overall impression:
<br />
<br />First, the book "Total Control" was an exceptionally well paced and visually pleasing read!  It is immediately obvious that you have spent a great deal of time and thought on the material placed within its pages.  It's technical enough to clearly present the necessary data within the defined concept, without going so deep that it becomes difficult to navigate.  Nor is it so simplistic that the reader would feel slighted by being overly "hand-held" or "kid-gloved".  If there were three bears and some porridge handy, I'm sure "it's just right" would be the theme of the day.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Details:
<br />
<br />While the majority of these concepts are not new to me, it is still nice to have someone else positively reinforce said concepts, and at times, distill them down to more accurate truths.  This happened several times throughout the book when I would find myself nodding along with a passage, a bubble of remembrance surfacing in my mind as I recalled the event(s) that first led to the discovery of these factoids, usually in a much less desirable way.  Often I had to set the book aside, while I mentally re-examined an idea I thought I knew backwards and forwards, yet was being presented from a different perspective.  This of course, leads to additional insight and greatly increased understanding of not only the outlined principle, but also how these principles are all connected to one another.  It's one thing to know a bunch of individual concepts, it is quite another to see them as a contiguous whole.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Without doubt, the most enjoyable chapters in the book for me are Ch. 4, 5, and 6 titled "Fear", "Concentration", and "Right Attitude" respectively.  The truths contained within these three chapters are so profound, so absolutely and undeniably essential in every aspect of life, that I am amazed that so few people actually address it!  I have been saying the very same things, although not nearly as well, for years.  Yet the response is almost always the same:  Disinterest, Scorn or flat out Denial.  No, it's much better to focus on "hard" data like horsepower, torque, weight and so forth.  Until someone goes to a track, and has the ex-racer / instructor absolutely walk away from them at any point on the track, while on a machine that makes 50% less horsepower and weighs 150 lbs more than theirs, then clueless that someone shall remain.  I should know, I was that someone.  Believe me when I say that it is a humbling, and if you have the right mindset, incredibly enlightening experience.  Thank you for brilliantly explaining how the brain is the most important item to bring on a motorcycle ride!
<br />
<br />
<br />Second favorite is the chapter on low speed U-Turns.  A beautiful and clearly photographed example of how it should be done!  I've lost count of the number of riders I've seen employ the exact opposite form, as if they were somehow going to yank a several hundred pound bike around 180 degrees, and consequently end up falling quite flat on the pavement.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Truthfully, I cannot fault anything within this book, except maybe the fact that I didn't write it myself!!
<br />
<br />I am recommending this as a mandatory read for anyone who wishes to improve their motorcycling skills.

                    <span>If you do well by reading and learning, This is a must read!!!<br>If you are considering a sports bike, buy this before you spend the thousands of dollars. I have read Park's, Total Control and Hough's More proficient motorcycle riding. Park's book is more geared to the proper mechanics of riding. Hough's book addresses the crap to look out for on the road.<br>The BIG difference is the examples he uses to further explain the process. They are with out a doubt some of the best examples I have seen for teaching a sports related process. <br>  He goes into proper bike set up. He adresses saftey gear, Suspension set up, traction,steering, and probably the biggest gorilla Fear. Let's face it Motorcycling is about the thrill of carving a turn. Managing that so it remains a thrill and not down right scary is the goal for me. Mr Park's really hit a homerun with his Mental Dynamics section. <br>Enjoy your copy cause I'm not loaning mine out!</span>
