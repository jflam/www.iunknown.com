                    <span>Live the Life You Love is overflowing with valuable ideas that will help you to uncover and appreciate your uniqueness -- which in turn, can lead you to fulfilling work. Barbara guides her readers through a series of exercises  -- exercises which I think are not only thought-provoking, but also fun. Her tone is conversational and genuine. If you're looking for a no-nonsense approach to self-exploration and career guidance, read this book.<p>Paula Fitzsimmons, pjpublications.com</span>

                    <span>I am a sucker for self help books. I usually feel great after reading one and then nothing. This book however is an exception. A truly insightful book that can change your life! We often read that if we think a certain way, and do things a certain way we can make what we want happen. Then of course we wonder what is wrong when things don't workout. The author explains why positive thinking, affirmations, and willing and wishing aren't always successful. <p>She describes how everyone is motivated differently and by using her techniques you will be able to determine what motivates you. She will help you learn how to take steps to make your desires come true even when you feel like you can't possibly succeed. The author describes techniques for a strong imaginary support system that will help you achieve your goals.<p>This book is very different than the usual "you can do it" book. If you follow the simple steps with this book "you will do it"! A wonderful book! You can start implementing the steps right away and be on your way to the life you love! As I read her book I put her suggestions to work. I can not believe how much easier it is to accomplish my goals!</span>

                    <span>At a difficult point in my career, I turned to this book to help me move  to something new. I followed the steps described and it really worked. I  had a dream of teaching environmental ethics at university, and now I am! A  great thing about this book is that it is really written for sceptics like  me who can't stand self-help books. Barbera Sher is particularly suspicious  of resolutions and positive affirmations. She states quite clearly that you  don't have to improve your character in order to get a good life - good  news indeed! Another great thing about this book is that, just as she  promises, all the exercises suggested are actually fun. This book moved me  from a place of despondancy to a widening sense of wonder and excitement in  life. Could you ask for more than that?</span>

                    <span>Just started reading, it becomes one of my fav books all time.  It will truely set you free.  Live the life you love is not just a carrer, it's exactly why we are here in this world.  It's our authentic and spiritual  life.  She is one of the rare authors that knows exactly how you feel and  knows exactly the feelings of axiety, loneliness, hopelessness.  Her  lessons will lead you to home.  I read the first and second lesson so far,  but I can feel something is changing inside of me.  I feel that I am  returning home.  When you know what your true purpose is, you ARE living  the life you love.  It's so simple yet we were all taught to live what we  are good at and competing others.  She said, 'when you love doing  something, you have a gift for it...everytime...that's what you are  supposed to do.'  I will never undervalue my needs anymore.  Great book for  this summer, so excited! =0)</span>

                    <span>For some lucky few, life is lived like a powerful river flowing directly to open sea letting nothing block its path.  For some of us others, we are bankless and flow in every direction, sometimes creating marshy messes,  dwindling too often into mere trickles.  This book in its 10 steps provides  channel pieces that can direct that energy.  No longer do we, dissipated  with choices and talents, need to feel aimless.  This book guides with the  gentlest touch, making it safe to say, "Yes, this is what I want to  do...This is what I've always wanted to do."</span>
