                    <span>An excellent first book for serious amateur photographers. Not a primer on photography - you should know the basics before tackling this one. <p>That said, it has one of the best introductions to exposure (specially for color film) and composition I have read. The short section on equipment (oriented to 35 mm SLR, but this is what most serious amateurs use anyway) alone is worth the book. I wish I had read this book when I was younger and was starting my hobby! <p>Patterson ties expertly photography with introspection, which is not surprising if you look at his background. <p>The examples in the book address mostly nature and a few urban subjects, with a few portraits thrown in. I find Patterson's photograhic style subtle and intimate, sometimes a bit too much for my subtropical taste (maybe he developed it from that wonderful high latitude Canadian light!). <p>This book is full of sensible, useful advice - not just on taking photographs, but also practical tips (At the end there is an excellent list of tips). Highly recommended. I wish there was a Spanish version to give to my children!</span>

                    <span>If you have just received a camera as a present, this would be an ideal first photography book to buy. Patterson covers all the basic technical and design aspects of the art without getting into too much boring detail.<p>The only rule or admonishment Patterson really conveys is to get out and use your camera. Take photos!</span>

                    <span>Freeman Patterson is an artist with camera in his hand. All of this books are not limited to the "talking-of-equipment" nor "exposure setting".  Instead, Freeman gives you the visual design; then, you address what you see + what you design on film. In this book, Freeman tells you how joy of photography using a basic set of equipment.  Unlike other books, Freeman spent more pages on equipment discussion as well as exposure. Therefore, I believe this book will favor both novice and professional photographers.  From the first page, Freeman starts with the fundmental of photography, a tool and basic exposure, then he extended the scope to "visual design". Many simple workshops are given for your practice and I found they are very useful. The workshops are both "visual design" and "exposure" practice. This book is the greatest book of Freeman Patterson if you plan to have only one.  This book is also suitable if you start to learn Visual Design technique.</span>

                    <span>Freeman Patterson brings you with him on an eye-opening trek into the Canadian wilderness where he shares his frame of mind and a packsack full of expert shooting advice. The only disappointment in this book is on page 165 when the writing stops and there are no more of Freeman's amazing photos to devour.</span>
