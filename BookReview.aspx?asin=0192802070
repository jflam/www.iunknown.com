                    <span>The book is very good. It analyzes the war and thus explains certain outcomes. However, because pages are spent on analysis, it could not cover the war in a wider scope. I personally prefer less analysis (I'll do that myself) and more on events, personalities, and scopes.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>For serious students of the WWII era wishing to have a handy, concise, and yet quite comprehensive overview of the Second World War and its times by way of a one-volume effort, this is the book to start with. Unlike much more massive, detailed, and descriptive tomes such as Gerhard Weinberg's "A World At War", Sir Martin Gilbert's "The Second World War", or the new "A War To Be Won" by Murray and Millett, this book pares down the tremendous sweep and circumstances surrounding the war to a relatively brief (just over three hundred pages) and yet amazingly concise and comprehensive narrative. Indeed, Professors from Harvard to Stanford often assign this book for introductory courses on World War Two because it is both manageable and accurate. <p>Parker's narrative is informed by his matchless grasp of the relevant documents and official records as well as a unique feel for the way in which the various aspects of the conflict interweave and interact to create and sustain a worldwide conflagration. In his stirring and entertaining treatment, one finds a treasure trove of details, and at the same time also gains a better understanding of the way in which the economic, diplomatic, and military factors combine during the drift toward war in the late 1930s. In this sense the book is written with great verve and obvious historical impact.<p>Viewed in this way, the book can be considered a quite compact and yet still comprehensive overview of the war itself, how it began, its slow and horrific progress, and how it was both won by the Allies and lost by the Axis powers. Indeed, one comes away from the reading experience with a much improved and enhanced appreciation for the far-reaching impact the war had on humanity at large, since the war affected everyone, combatants, noncombatants, and onlookers alike. As Parker argues quite persuasively, the Second World War changed the course of the 20th century forever.<p>The author faithfully traces how the key events of the war progress, showing how the strategies of each of the participants as well as their indigenous populations and economies affect the course of the conflict. In looking at major battles and campaigns, Parker provides a wealth of insight that is disproportionately detailed compared to the length of the book, and provides the reader with a wonderfully informative, insightful, and entertaining reading experience. He discusses specific aspects of the war such as mobile warfare, the Holocaust, forced migration, and the use of the atomic bomb in a way that helps the reader to understand the importance of each and gives specific reasons as to how and why they occurred. This is a book that is easy to recommend to anyone wanting a relatively concise and yet immensely rewarding reading experience. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent overview of the Second World War using the most recent information available.   Parker's book is well-written, lucid and concise.  I am using it to teach a undergraduate level history course on  the war.</span>

                    <span>If  only a  single one-volume history of World War II had to be chosen,  it would be hard to beat  this one.<br> The entire global sweep of this greatest of all wars  is covered comprehensively here,  from  its historical and economic roots to  its  world-changing consequences.  The narrative is graceful and remarkably readable,  with such essential matters as  balance-of-forces and  production  figures woven  in skillfully and  painlessly,   rendering unnecessary  the footnotes which clutter other works of this scale.  The author's analyses  of   issues of Allied leadership are models of fair-minded judgement and balanced perspective, and his evaluations of  generalship  virtually unassailable,  to the probable discomfort of partisans of all stripes.<br>
Parker's work is exemplary history, and a rare pleasure to read as well.  Highly recommended.
