                <span id="Label1">Software developer and author Karen Hazzah expands her original treatise on device drivers in the second edition of Writing Windows VxDs and Device Drivers. The book and companion disk include the author's library of wrapper functions that allow the programmer to code VxDs almost entirely in C, eliminating the necessity of expensive third-party tools. Virtual and nonstandard device drivers extend the capabilities of Windows to go anywhere and do anything. Hazzah specifies how to determine whether a virtual device driver (VxD) or dynamic link library (DLL) is appropriate for the task at hand, depending on privilege, restrictions, kind of interface, class of device, and performance requirements. Whatever the case, Hazzah presents her material in the context of the Virtual Machine and the 80x86 architecture. This book is primarily aimed at developers who need to write nonstandard device drivers, either as VxDs or DLLs. Readers who have already written device interface code or a device driver, have a strong grasp of how segments are used by DOS compilers and assemblers, and can read 80x86 assembly should feel comfortable with the material presented. The second edition expands the coverage of VxDs, with attention to new Windows 95 features and uses far less 80x86 assembly than in the first edition. </span>

                    <span>I sure wish I'd had this book when I started out writing drivers, it would have saved me a ton of time and grief.  I too, wish there were more information on specific driver types, such as soundcards, but that stuff is  in the DDK anyway, once you know what to look for -- and this book will  tell you that, and a lot quicker and better than the DDK will.  Any of the  other required tools will tell you how to install or load a VXD, so I don't  consider that a big problem.  I could wish that this book also covered  Windows NT, but was extemely glad for the plug and play coverage, which  other information sources obfuscate badly. Good information on windows  innards, useful to an overall understanding.</span>

                    <span>This book is a good overview of Windows 95 VxDs.  However, it was EXTREMELY frustrating to use as a guide or tutorial while actually writing a VxD.<p>There are a large number of errors in both the samples and the  descriptions of interfaces.  I don't know how such glaring errors could  have been published.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I needed to write a basic driver that an application could access through  standard Win32 API's - CreatFile, OpenFile, ReadFile, WriteFile, etc.   While the author does indeed provide lots of samples that are easy to  follow and will work, - they are limited to use for custom or  special-purpose I/O access.  There is no discussion about the varios types  of file or IO systems and types of drivers - i.e., File System Drivers  (FSD), Input/Output Supervisor (IOS), Communications (COMM), Miniport, MCI,  etc.  There is no discussion about how to install & register your  driver properly, creation of INF files, etc.  So who is this book written  for?  Hacks that simply want a quick way to access hardware without  creating system errors.  It is not for engineers that want to create an  installable device driver for a common I/O devices and distribute it with  their hardware so that it will work seamlessly with the operating system  and other existing, professionaly written, application software.  If you  need to create a driver for a standard I/O device already supported by  Microsoft API's, keep looking.  If you have a custom i/o board and a  low-level driver that can access it & handle interrupts, but plan on  providing your own high-level custom API software so your customers can  access it (i.e., a proprietary solution), this is for you. Good luck!</span>
