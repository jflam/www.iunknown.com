This quality, says women's wellness visionary Victoria Moran, is independent of age or body type. Rather, it is the result of a well-tended soul.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In this inspirational and Wise book, Moran shares the wisdom and experience from her own search for inner and outer beauty. Her thoughtful observations and advice show how anyone can transform their thinking about what makes us beautiful, while providing simple guidance for creating a radiance that only comes from within.</P><P>Each compact essay contains a tool you can Put to use <I>today</I> to heighten your awareness of your own inner beauty. With her trademark candor, Moran illustrates how true beauty comes from a sense of wholeness. She combines tips for taking care of your spirit with simple techniques for tending the needs of your body and essays on self-affirmation and the care and feeding of the soul. Women of all ages will relate to Moran's reflections on her journey to a deeper understanding of inner radiance -- beauty that is soul deep.</P><P>This sane, sensible approach to a strong self-image and loving self-care is firmly grounded in spiritual common sense, the marriage of body and soul. You start by lighting up your life -- and before you know it, you're lighting up the room.</P></span>

                    <span>I once had the pleasure of running into the author, Ms. Moran at the New York City airport and we shared a cab. The ride to manhattan was the most enjoyable cab ride I ever had. The positive vibes Ms. Moran exuded, and the quality of our conversation left an indelible impression on my mind. So after reading her book, Lit From within, I now know how she has been able to reach that high level of living and thinking. I particularly liked her discussion on distinguishing between dreams and fantasies, her emphasis on regarding others as important and allowing others to be beautiful too. <P> I strongly recommend this book to anyone wishing to bring more positivity and pure beauty into their life.

                    <span>I am a guy and I was given a copy of this book with a note of apology for the gift of a "girly" book. But I read it and the lessons within, full of warmth and wisdom, are applicable to EVERYONE. It's about self love, self acceptance and finding self worth in your day to day life.<P>Victoria Moran writes with great insight and common sense, with a warm heart and a keen mind and this is a book I will treasure and give as gifts to all my friends, girls and otherwise.</span>

                    <span>I bought this at a time when I was having medical problems. This helped me put all in perspective. I ejoyed the book so much I gave a copy to my sister who was undergoing cancer treatment. The two of us have carried this book as sort of a bible for us. There are so many things in life that can cause you to be happy and unhappy. This book allows you to see the good in life and not put the emphasis on the bad or the unlucky things that might happen.</span>

                    <span>At first I was enthralled but as the book went on it seemed more like one of those toddler books where each page shows some aspect of a child's day- My Breakfast- My Friends- My Bath. I really don't care to know what she has in her closet. How trite!! I agree with several of the other reviews. There is nothing new and seems to be more of an ego trip of a woman with too much time on her hands.</span>

                    <span>I was really disappointed by Lit from Within. Amongst books of this type, it's rather cursory and a little self-serving. Very little new here. Try "All the Joy You can Stand" by Debrena Jackson Gandy for a real treat.</span>
