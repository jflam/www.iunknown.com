                <span id="Label1">Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman expose the fallacies of standard management thinking in <i>First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently</i>. In seven chapters, the two consultants for the Gallup Organization debunk some dearly held notions about management, such as "treat people as you like to be treated"; "people are capable of almost anything"; and "a manager's role is diminishing in today's economy." "Great managers are revolutionaries," the authors write. "This book will take you inside the minds of these managers to explain why they have toppled conventional wisdom and reveal the new truths they have forged in its place."<p>  The authors have culled their observations from more than 80,000 interviews conducted by Gallup during the past 25 years. Quoting leaders such as basketball coach Phil Jackson, Buckingham and Coffman outline "four keys" to becoming an excellent manager: Finding the right fit for employees, focusing on strengths of employees, defining the right results, and selecting staff for talent--not just knowledge and skills. <I>First, Break All the Rules</I> offers specific techniques for helping people perform better on the job. For instance, the authors show ways to structure a trial period for a new worker and how to create a pay plan that rewards people for their expertise instead of how fast they climb the company ladder. "The point is to focus people toward performance," they write. "The manager is, and should be, totally responsible for this." Written in plain English and well organized, this book tells you exactly how to improve as a supervisor. <i>--Dan Ring</i></span>

                    <span>"First, Break All the Rules" is the perfect book for new managers or supervisors that are looking to get a feel for what they should be doing as managers or supervisors.  This book does not delve much into the focus of leadership, which is good if you're just starting out.  All managers that I train from now on will be receiving a copy of this book or a summary of everything it entails.  
<br />
<br />The story of the great worker who refuses to stay with the company unless she receives one thing and one thing only is extremely persuasive.  She doesn't want money, promotions, benefits, or stock options.  She wants only one thing and there is only one thing her company won't give her that they should.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Why did I like the book ?
<br />I liked it:
<br />First, because it consolidated a lot of concepts to great management that are contemporary and that I always could relate to but was less able to place into perspective.
<br />Second, because it challenged my intellect, my perspective on the field of management and communication, my mind on a neuro-emotionally intelligent level and my identity as both an employee and a manager
<br />Third, because it helped me set a more comprehensive standard to what a great manager can be on an international scale. I feel I could tie in some key cross-cultural theories and training methodologies and use this as an effective base line from which to grow personally and professionally.
<br />
<br />I would recommend this book to others, notably those in my field of management and colleagues (of which some are my bosses), even to those managers and employees with untapped potential out there!
<br />
<br />What have I learned that is new (versus repackaged, like the proverbial old wine in new bottles)?
<br />
<br />I have learned that:
<br />- certain preconceived ideas I had of what a great manager is can be unlearned or reevaluated so as to help me refine my tasks and role as a manager and improve the quality of and precision with which I can communicate and make myself better understood, as well as simplify the working structure I work in.
<br />- there is proof supporting the fundamental postulation that the role of a great manager cannot be placed in a box, a company policy nor applied across companies or organizations
<br />- to simplify one's tasks is not to dissolve another's creativity or role but to enhance another's steps towards a more succinct and adaptable method by which to perform at an exponentially higher standard
<br />
<br />One should read this book because:
<br />- it is a primary source of information based on a comprehensive study made of a meta-analysis that cuts through core of the various ways in which different companies have devised ways in which to measure performance
<br />- it provides a series of answers to fundamental questions geared towards the analysis and description of the links that lie between employee opinion and business unit performance
<br />- it is a fast and reader-friendly book that allows for an in depth perspective, understanding and methodology of what defines a great manager, the crucial role of employees to a company and the link between these two in producing the highest levels of performance.
<br />ENJOY IT, MAKE IT HAPPEN, LIVE IT AND THRIVE! Peace, Joe:)

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the best statistics book that I've ever read.  And, I know statistics books, because I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics.  Still that isn't saying much, because most statistics books are dead boring.  But, this was a really good book.
<br />
<br />The really unique thing about this book is that it is written to regular people--managers of groups of 4 to 10 people.  Most business books are written to CEO's and so regular folks can't relate to them, but this book is written to everyone.
<br />
<br />This book is all about discovering the strengths of your employees and using those strengths.  I really like that concept.  My philosophy is that your strengths are indelibly tied into your weaknesses, so you can't really get rid of any weaknesses without really dumbing down your strengths.  The book goes along those same lines.
<br />
<br />The book does a good job at giving a model for "the ideal manager," and gives a lot of good, practical advice.  I think you should take their "statistically relevant 12 questions" with a grain of salt, however, because unless you use the same methodology as they did in administering those 12 questions, you're not going to get results with the same integrity as they did.
<br />
<br />Or, in laymen's terms--DON'T use this book as a tool for your HR department to come up with a survey so that you can figure out which of your managers are crappy managers.  DO use this book as a tool for managers to read on their own, and you'll find it helps them to become better managers.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book started off very interesting, with strategies backed by Gallup statistics and modern examples. Unfortunately, this trend did not continue through the book. 
<br />
<br />The discussion of talent and it's implementation make for some of the best management reading ever. Some very pertinent examples and data are given in the first chapters which strongly support their points.
<br />
<br />However, the writing style is very dry and repetitive. The phrase "The best managers believe...the best managers don't...." becomes common to the brink of insulting. With no examples or statistics the last half becomes a real chore.
<br />
<br />I recommend skimming through this book: readers should be aware that the ideas in this book are mere stepping stones and not taken as gospel. The book succeeds at providing a good general management philosophy.

                    <span>As an Executive Coach. Management Team Builder and Leadership Development Trainer I have found this book to be a finger, pointing at almost every executive I know. It clearly identifies how managers become their own worst enemy by virtue of the things they do (or don't do). In coaching executives I recommend this book in conjunction with Peter F. Drucker's "The Effective Executive" which defined the same principles 35 year beforehand and which was reissued in 2000.</span>
