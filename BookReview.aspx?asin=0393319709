                <span id="Label1">David Baltimore won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1975. Known as a wunderkind in the field of immunology, he rose quickly through the ranks of the scientific community to become the president of the distinguished Rockefeller University. Less than a year and a half later, Baltimore resigned from his presidency, citing the personal toll of fighting a long battle over an allegedly fraudulent paper he had collaborated on in 1986 while at MIT. From the beginning, the Baltimore case provided a moveable feast for those eager to hold science more accountable to the public that subsidizes its research. Did Baltimore stonewall a legitimate government inquiry? Or was he the victim of witch hunters? The Baltimore Case tells the complete story of this complex affair, reminding us how important the issues of government oversight and scientific integrity have become in a culture in which increasingly complicated technology widens the divide between scientists and society.</span>

                    <span>As an engineer by training and profession, this book really makes my blood boil.  It's basically the true story of some scientists at MIT who publish a paper on immunology.  A student of one of the professors challenges that some of the data in the paper was faked, and an epic of Phyrric proportions ensues.  <p>In the 10 years that this book covers, scientific careers are ruined, researchers are vilified in the media and in the court of public opinion, and (most troubling of all to me) our elected officials engage in a witch hunt of completely innocent scientists.  In particular, Senator John Dingell (Michigan) and his staff are revealed as complete devils; the author has thoroughly documented and footnoted the evidence in the case, so there is really little doubt that Mr. Dingell is as pernicious as he is portrayed in this book.  Unfortunately, Mr. Dingell is still a senator to this day and no doubt is still out "to get" the scientists involved.  Fortunately for science (and society), history has proven the scientists involved innocent and they have all been restored to preeminent positions in the scientific community.<p>Be forewarned that this is quite a tomb, weighing in at hundreds of pages of meaty scientific and political reading.  At times, I contemplated giving up on it, but as the story unfolded, I wanted to see just how far this tragic comedy would unfold.  The subject matter (immunology) is far removed from the layperson and I found myself at times not understanding the concepts fully.  Luckily, this book is more about the sociopolitical ramifications of the science, and thus not understanding the science does not detract from the novel.</span>

                    <span>If ever there was a clear case of people choosing sides based on what they believe a priori, this is it.  While some authors (Judy Sarasohm for example) followed this case from both sides, Kevles obviously entered the discussion with a judgement to be excused.  The case of Imanishi-Kari v. O' Toole is one that should have be decided in science, by scientists.  But the intervention and face-saving by David Baltimore caused this case to linger half a decade beyond it's merit.<p>This book wends its way through the facts of the case in 512 pages, but prejudges it's view from page 1.  Science isn't the question; in the original paper, the Tufts review, the MIT review, the NIH review or the Secret Service investigation.  <p>Rather, the intent is clear from the beginning, politics has no place in science, except when practiced by Nobel laureates.<p>Read "Science On Trial" as well, to see an honest (but admittedly poor) author explain the entire case, instead of a biased view decrying the proper research.</span>

                    <span>Kevles has written a masterful account of the Baltimore Case (Imanishi-Kari Case might be better). I can only second the glowing reviews already on this page.  A few things that might interest the general reader: at the time of this book's publication, Baltimore-bashing was practically a national sport among scientists.  Kevles set out to write a balanced account, and he has done so-- it is a good job all around, as Yale recognized when it gave him an endowed chair recently (Caltech's loss, alas!). Information subsequent to its publication only enhances Baltimore's stature. Unfortunately, like the French Dreyfus case that it resembled at times, too many prominent people said too  many harsh things about Baltimore that they cannot retract. Contrary to at least one of the editorial reviewers, it is clear now that Kevles was too hard on Baltimore and company, but so many people attacked Baltimore(Nature's Maddox, Paul Doty, Jim Watson, W.Gilbert, J Darnell, G. Blobel, and a whole nascent federal bureaucracy, inter alia) that these contemporary anti-Dreyfusards will never be refuted. Be that as it may, read this account to get a detailed study of how scientists and government can go wrong, all while trying to do the right thing.</span>

                    <span>"The Baltimore Case" tells a fascinating, frightening story well, but in far too many pages.  The previous reviewer describes the details of the case, which are familiar to most biologists but still  misunderstood by many in the sciences as well as by the general public.   Mr. Kevles is a descriptive master.  He lays out the facts of the case in  as objective a manner as I think is possible and he makes the murkiest of  quarrels clear (although more figures would have been useful), but his book  is very repetitive, is excessively detailed, and by the final chapters a  feeling of déjà vu permeates every page.  That said, he provides a very  important service by convincingly showing that the Baltimore case was  primarily a congressional and media fiasco perpetrated under the guise of  scientific justice.  Some might say that scientists are placed on a  pedestal by the non-scientific public and that it is a good thing for  scientists to be monitored by "impartial" parties to "keep  them honest".   Maybe so, but in a country whose populace still fights  the teaching of evolutionary biology in public schools and rejects  genetically-modified foods without a basic understanding of biology, whose  congressional members only support applied research that is fodder for  votes, and whose media have trouble reporting the most basic scientific  discoveries accurately or without sensationalizing them, the policing of  scientists should be done very carefully, and "The Baltimore  Case" shows why.  When ignorant and incompetent individuals like Feder  and Stewart are allowed to impact science for transparently self-serving  reasons, and powerful politicians like Dingell are given free reign to try,  convict and punish dedicated individuals with ill-concealed intellectual  jealousy, the entire scientific enterprise in the United States is placed  in serious jeopardy.  The scientific community, like any other, will turn  defensive, in-fight, and self-destruct, and the public will view scientists  with greater suspicion than ever.   If, after Margot O'toole lodged her  initial complaint, independent scientists had been allowed to validate the  work under question, which was later shown to be unimpeachable, millions of  dollars would have been saved and many years of anguish would have been  avoided.  Instead, intellectual laziness and administrative incompetence  won out and a travesty ensued.  Mr. Kevles should be congratulated for  making this simple, refreshing fact clear.</span>

                    <span>The Baltimore case was really the Imanishi-Kari case. A young scientist in Theresa Imanishi-Kari's lab, Margot O'Toole, approached her superiors with  a disagreeing opinion about one of the papers published by her superior and  co-authored by Nobel Prize winner David Baltimore.Two committees found that  there had been error, but not misconduct or fraud. Somehow, the case was  brought to the attention of two self-appointed "fraud-busters" at  the N.I.H., and a full-scale investigation was launched. The secret service  was brought in to examine the lab notebooks and a draft report finding  evidence of fraud was leaked to the press.  A public controversy ensued,  especially when it became clear that Imanishi-Kari did not have access to  her own notebooks to prepare her defense. The case dragged on for a decade  but ended in a triumphant exoneration on all charges. The book pleased me  for two reasons : 1) It made clear the scientific controversy, which had  often been overlooked in the press reports of the time, and it also defined  the difference between scientific disagreement about the interpretation of  data,versus fraud or error. 2) The book described the frightening  escalation of the charges against Imanishi-Kari. What started out as an  inability to reproduce experimental results with a temperamental reagent,  ended with accusations that a third of the experimental notebooks would  have been falsified ! <p>One moral lesson can be drawn for all scientists :  make sure your notebooks are organized in perfect chronological order !</span>
