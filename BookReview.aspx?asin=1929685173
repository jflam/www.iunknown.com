                <span id="Label1">In "Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases," John Smiley provides a solid foundation for the beginning or intermediate user interested in working with database theory and uses this knowledge to create a fully database-enabled Visual Basic application. Smiley's simple, conversational style is entertaining even when he is explaining the most difficult programming principles. The book is classroom-based, and his question and answer format often addresses commonly-asked student queries. Smiley also provides step-by-step instructions for each exercise and handy online references for more information.</span>

                    <span>John Smiley continues with the venerable Bullina China Shop program and his university class to introduce the reader to programming data bases using Visual Basic. The style of the book follows Professor Smiley's university class through the semester as they learn to use and interface data bases to Visual Basic. For me this engaging method involves me and makes learning this subject very pleasant. The information is presented in a logical progression within the framework of a standard development process as Professor Smiley's university class modifies a class project completed the previous semester for Joe Bullina, owner of the Bullina China Shop.<P>The book is geared for the beginner and uses DAO (Data Access Objects) methods in presenting the subject rather than the current ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) methods. So if your an experienced programmer looking for an introduction to ADO look elsewhere; however, for the novice, this book walks you through the processes necessary to bind data controls to the VB program. With this background the reader can go on to the ADO methods with a rich background that will smooth the transition to the current popular method.<P>The book includes a CD with all the source code and supporting files needed to develop the project chapter by chapter. Additionally, the author maintains an extensive web site where you can go for help and assistance. <P>In summary, I highly recommend this book to all who have an interest in getting up to speed using Visual Basic with data bases. Buy it, read it, work through the demo project, and you will have gained valuable skill.</span>

                    <span>THE BEST book I've encountered on programming databases with VB. I've taken a couple of Visual Basic classes over the years but find I'm learning LOTS reading John's book! In fact, some things that were always a bit fuzzy are now very clear.<P>Like another Amazon.com reviewer, I think John needs to do a second edition to this book to cover two topics: more about programming with ADO and programming without a data control. MS Access 2000 doesn't support the DAO so more support for these topics would make a "must-have" book an indispensable reference.<P>As a benefit to his readers, John does provide "updates" to his book via his website. There one can provide feedback, receive monthly update topics, etc.<P>Anyone that wants to UNDERSTAND what and WHY they're doing something when they're programming with databases should buy this book. I only regret it wasn't my textbook for my last VB class.</span>

                    <span>I don't usually write reviews of books but this book is exceptional. I consider myself a near expert with Microsoft Office VBA but struggled with Visual Basic (the application). The unusual classroom setting of this book made me feel as if I were in the classroom with John Smiley teaching. I was finally being taught by someone who knew how to teach. In chapter 4 I finally ran into a problem I couldn't figure out. John Smiley was gracious enough to post his email address in the front of the book so, at half past midnight I sent him a note discussing my problem. I recieved a response from John at 8:30 that morning. John knew exactly what my problem was and gave me instructions on how to fix it. Once applied, my project worked perfectly. I can't express enough how much I appreciate this kind of customer service. Thanks, John.</span>

                    <span>Let me begin by saying that I'm the author, so let's get that out of the way. <P>I'm posting here to point out that the book has a tremendous amount of support materials that have never been advertised. Each of my books has a support page containing a current list of errata, downloadable files (completed exercises from the book), extra links to extra materials I have written and my email address in the event you have problems. I also run a series of online classes so that if you would like to learn with me in a more structured setting, you can do that also. You can access those materials via this link<P>http://www.johnsmiley.com/books.htm<P>I should also say that this book isn't for everyone---and you can read through some of the other reviews posted here to see why and why not.<P>I wrote this book for beginner level programmers, and the book is written in a unique style. <P>You (and I) can thank the now defunct Wrox Publishing house for the style of the book that some people absolutely love and others (primarily hotshot programmers with lots of experience) hate. The book is written as if you are participating in an actual classroom---many people, particularly those learning on their own or in an Independent study setting find comforting. <P>My thanks to the many people who have written to me to tell me how much they've enjoyed my books and how they have helped them achieve their goals of learning to program. <P>John Smiley</span>
