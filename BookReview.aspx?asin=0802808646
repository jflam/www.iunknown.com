                    <span>Grenz initially usurps postmodernity as a tool to echo the death of modernism.  It seems his primary purpose in this task is the conflict between modern thought and Christianity's feasibility.  Once he feels he's accomplished this he goes back and asks us to, in certain instances, ignore the triumph of the postmodern over the modern he's just outlined that we may embrace those few elements of modernity that may prove useful in allowing his yearning for Christian legitimacy to continue with the least amount of resistance.  Then he audaciously asks us to simultaneously ignore the nuances of postmodern thought that don't fit particularly well with Christianity.
<br />
<br />If you are used to picking favorable parts out of texts to support your position and blatantly ignoring all points to the contrary, this book may be for you.  It appears that Grenz is adeptly applying the traditional Christian technique of selectively quoting Bible passages out of context without regard for the overall message to his analysis of the modern and postmodern.
<br />
<br />Fortunately, we don't need to perform any act of deconstruction on this text as the deconstruction is always already inherent in the text.</span>

                    <span>Stanley Grenz's A primer on Postmodernism provides an overview of the socio-cultural phenomenon known as postmodernism.  Although as a professor of theology and ethics Grenz has a particular interest in the religious implications of the postmodern movement, his work is an excellent well-rounded introduction to this important cultural and intellectual movement
<br />
<br />As with other broad terms, the expression "postmodernism" is somewhat ill-defined and can be variously interpreted.  Postmodernism, as the term implies, is fundamentally a move, or an attempt to move, beyond the views of modernism.  The roots of what we refer to as modernism can be traced to the European Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  The Enlightenment is often viewed as a turning point in Western civilization where revelation was supplanted by reason as the means to knowledge and truth.  The pre-modern approach to knowledge is represented by the sentiment that belief is required for understanding.  Modernism's focus on verifiable truth transposes this argument and makes belief contingent upon understanding.  Modernism holds several key assumptions.  It postulates that epistemological and ethical truths exist, and that these truths are available to man.  Postmodernism has challenged this modern faith in reason and raised questions about man's ability to understand the universe.
<br />
<br />Grenz provides an excellent and succinct overview of modernism and postmodernism that, in my opinion, is useful to both new and advanced students of this subject.  I found his discussion of the scientific and philosophical roots of postmodernism particularly clear and insightful. 
<br />
<br />A primer on Postmodernism is the best book I have read in this area.  I highly recommend it to readers interested in this topic</span>

                    <span>This is a very helpful book that introduces the reader to the basic contours of postmodernism in its cultural, historical and philosophical dimensions.  Grenz helpfully traces the ethos of the postmodern context, showing how it reacts against Enlightenment concepts of rationality.  He likewise examines the shift in philosphy of science that has taken place in the postmodern context, largely attributable to Kuhn.  He then spends two chapters chronicling the rise of modernity and the transition to postmodern.  Following this discussion, Grenz offers a basic portrait of crucial postmodern philosophers, Foucault, Derrida and Rorty.  Grenz concludes his book with a small chapter on the gospel in the postmodern context.
<br />
<br />On the whole this is a helpful book that adequately introduces the reader to the basic issues, currents and philosophers of postmodernity.  Certainly some of Grenz's readings of Foucault and Derrida will be controversial (whose aren't?), but it is a helpful intro nonetheless.  It was also unfortunate that Grenz spent so little time on the gospel in the postmodern context.  Readers wanting more on this issue should consult Grenz's "Beyond Foundationalism", or for something more substanatial, the many works of Lesslie Newbigin.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the best book I've read to understand postmodernism and it's imact upon the church. Grenz is highly readable and immensely insightful in making plain the complexities and realities of our day.</span>

                    <span>Is a good book to read if you're searching to (and, I know this is ironic) nail down postmodernism to a few tenets you can understand. Provides the necessary framework to understand the topic when it comes up-- and, at the same time, Grenz does a good job of sifting out the negatives of the movement while pointing to the opporutunties it holds for Christianity to communicate to this culture.<p>Does not contain much info at all an literature, art, and architecture, which are the main purveyors of the movement. Then, again, by the time most of us in the Church catch wind of anything like PM it's already in the rear-view mirror for most of society, anyway.</span>
