                    <span>This book will be easy for those who are familiar with poetics, something Aristotle wrote about, which in DYLAN'S VISION OF SIN by Christopher Ricks is applied to songs by Bob Dylan, particularly the songs listed on pages 492-499 in the Acknowledgements.  Twenty-seven books of the Bible and the Ten Commandments are listed in the index, along with the poems of major poets compared to Dylan's work.  The Sins, Virtues, and Heavenly Graces used to list the Contents of the book are classical concepts that are not explicit subjects like adultery, death, friendship, war, and race, hardships which are so popular in modern psychological studies.  On Charity, most people don't get interested until the topic is Love, and that concluding chapter starts with a song called `Watered-Down Love' from the album `Shot of Love' which was "unlovingly shot down by the reviewers."  (p. 468).  I know what song he means, but I'm not sure I can figure out what happened when it was recorded:
<br />
<br />`The studio out-take (which is the performance that was released but with a final verse that was edited out when released) ends its assurances not with the rising delight felt in the confidence that love that's pure "Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning", but with a further verse that would have demeaned the song into the self-serving, the self-pitying, and the self-praising:
<br />
<br />Love that's pure is not what you teach me
<br />I've got to go where it can reach me
<br />I've got to flee toward patience and meekness
<br />You miscalculate me, mistake my kindness for weakness
<br />
<br />`I don't mean that we would have had to take this as autobiographical; not that it would . . .  Whereas the song as released, and as blessedly released from its final verse, does not have even once any of the words "I", "me", or "my" . . .' (p. 469).
<br />
<br />"The studio out-take" is four lines longer than the song we already knew.  The personal is assumed to be stupid for hundreds of fans who might be unfamiliar with the psychological standards which allow Ricks as critic to proclaim, "For the move out from the large love that is charity to a love-affair about which one of the parties now feels uncharitable, this move is in itself a false move artistically."  (p. 469).  Such theological judgments are likely to be unfamiliar to those people who are most familiar with Dylan's songs, limiting the appeal of this book to a narrow segment of the educated reading public.  Intellectual fanatics with a philosophical interest in religious issues might marvel at how well a modern professor can combine promoting religious interests in a pop culture without offending any readers except those who expected a book about Bob Dylan to be easy to understand.
<br />
<br />The Index of Dylan's Songs and Writings for this book is on pages 508-511, but it only lists a few pages for most songs.  Which Album a Song is on (pp. 512-517) is inclined to list just the first time a song appeared.  The exception which proves the rule is "Positively 4th Street:  Greatest Hits [1], Biograph, and The Essential Bob Dylan."  That list does not include "Man of Peace," a song mentioned on pages 158 and 449, (where the first line is quoted without mentioning the song) according to the Index of Songs, but which is also quoted much earlier, "You know Satan sometimes comes as a man of peace."  (p. 43).  It is from the album Infidels, but according to the words I have, the final line of each verse starts with:
<br />
<br />You know, sometimes Satan . . .
<br />You know that sometimes Satan . . .
<br />I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
<br />
<br />People who have learned the song well enough to sing it without having to look for the words of any of the eight verses might wonder how tired an author would have to be to write the words down in the wrong order when writing about songs by someone who is as popular as Bob Dylan, but this kind of thing is an occupational hazard for professors who write books and philosophers who wonder if the error was beneficial in any way.  Knowing Satan might be an approach that could draw on a lot more of our culture than just Dylan's songs, and the great song "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones could be a wonderful start for that project.
<br />
<br />Christopher Ricks is extremely knowledgeable about critics, and those readers who are looking for new literary angles ought to gain a lot from his insight into the Dylan interviews that are also discussed in this work.  In a song with an `I -- You' framework, any mention of `he' is likely to apply more to the critic than to the singer or an audience, particularly in the lines:
<br />
<br />With the one who tries to hide
<br />What he don't know to begin with  (p. 66).
<br />
<br />This makes more sense in the song it's in, and in the section about envy:
<br />
<br />I know the reason
<br />That you talk behind my back
<br />I used to be among the crowd
<br />You're in with
<br />
<br />Do you take me for such a fool
<br />To think I'd make contact
<br />With the one who tries to hide
<br />What he don't know to begin with  (p. 66).
<br />
<br />This is `Positively 4th Street.'  The most positive thing this book has to say is about rhymes.  In another song,  "And the rhyme in this refrain is beautifully metaphorical, because it's a rhyme of the word `end' with the word `again':
<br />
<br />Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
<br />To be stuck inside of Mobile
<br />With the Memphis Blues again? (p. 31)
<br />
<br />"`End' and `again' are metaphorically a rhyme because every rhyme is both an endness and an againness."  (p. 32).</span>

                    <span>Christopher Ricks' enthusiam for Dylan and the English language mirrors Dylan's enthusiasm for his music.  Other reviewers have complained about Ricks' punny style getting in the way of the reading.  All it showed me was that he was having a good time writing about his subject.  Reading the book brought me back to the Dylan songbook and I found myself wishing that Ricks had covered this song or that song along with the many ones he did analyze.  If you don't know or don't care about a particular song, or find yourself getting bogged down, you can always skip the discussion of that one and start again somewhere else in the book.  I found myself not agreeing with every one of his interpretations, but what the heck, isn't that what the interpretation of complex work is all about?  I liked the book and am more likely to pick up a copy of "Chronicles", because of it.</span>

                    <span>Ricks' tome is like the curate's egg: good in parts. 
<br />
<br />At times it is superb - as in the discussion of The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll. At others it is remarkably blind to the real tone of the songs - for example, in its abject failure to see that Most of the Time is a classic portrayal of 'I get along without you very well' attempts at self-delusion. 
<br />
<br />Much too often the author is self-indulgent; and his obsession with [often self-focussed] punning is almost too irritating for words. For all Ricks' close-reading skills and his awesome knowledge of literature, the book frequently fails to convince in its connections. Where two writers both resort to common-usage terms or forms of words it surely need not mean the latter user is necessarily quoting, referring or alluding to the former. Ricks does not seem to acknowledge that ideas and phrases pass down through many hands. Latter-day useage is just as likely to reflect the 55th user as the original [if original use can ever be determined]. Ricks over-eggs the pudding. As Dylan correctly said of Greil Marcus, he 'over-intellectualises'. 
<br />
<br />Above all, Rick's study is diminished by its clear lack of musical context. This is a shortcoming made all the more significant by the subject's immense skills in interpretation and phrasing in performance. Primarily, it is this absence of the music that makes the book a disappointment. 
<br />
<br />If comparisons must be made, Ricks' effort does not match up to the work of Michael Gray or Paul Williams, both of whom consistently demonstrate a precise understanding of what Dylan's art form actually is: the writing and PERFORMING of wonderful songs.

                    <span>As a die-hard Dylan fan, I tend to try and get my hands on new stuff as soon as it appears. As a lover of English lit. I thought this book would be right up my alley. And it is...sort of. The content is solid, an interesting take, even if I disagree with Prof. Ricks that the concept of sin is the best way to "get hold of the bundle" of Dylan's songs. The book is an intersting read nonetheless, although of course what we have here is Chris Ricks' vision of Dylan's vision of sin, and the seven deadly sin grid we have here, while interesting, reveals little of Dylan's vision of sin. The biggest qualm I have with the book is Ricks' language. As if to prove he knows all the songs, even though many seemingly appropriate ones are omitted, he frequently includes song titles in descriptive sentences about other songs. The language is all too frequently all too clever and obfuscates rather than illuminates the point being made. The book would be much more enjoyable were it written in a more straightforward manner. The good Dr. covers interesting territory with a wealth of background knowledge, especially revealing are the connections to Keats and Melville...yet you can open up to almost any page and cringe at the unnecessarily "clever" passages. Sooo, thanks Christopher Ricks...buuuut...  </span>

                    <span>You'll be a little jealous, of course, wishing you had the literary storehouse of information and insight that Christopher Ricks has at his disposal from which to gather literary parallels, borrowings, and coincidences. I have never been more impressed by ANY book of criticism written about a modern writer or musician. To be honest, I have not yet finished "Dylan's Visions of Sin," but I couldn't wait to comment here after reading the detailed comparison of "Not Dark Yet" and Ode to a Nightingale (yes, KEATS' Ode to a Nightingale) on pages 359-374. Sound ridiculous? It won't after you've spent the first 350 pages getting to this tour de force reading of a deceptively simple song from Time Out of Mind. But not only is the close reading of these lyrics/poems (the distinction won't matter after awhile in the author's pleasant company) impressive, but this is also a very funny and very warm book. There's nothing cold or academic about it. And there's no psychobiography, or any biography at all. This is Bob Dylan stripped to his most essential gift, his words. It's an absolute joy to read and I recommend it unreservedly, even to those of you (or especially to those of you) who may have been put off by the singer's voice, or his associations with Christianity, Victoria's Secret, and the Traveling Wilburys. I'm finding myself pulling out all my old LPs, even the scratchy bootlegs in their plain white sleeves, and listening to them with brand new ears.</span>
