                <span id="Label1">Author Matt Heid has taken the best hikes in Northern California and put them in one, easy-to-read reference book. Covering the entire northern two-thirds of the state--from Big Sur to the Lost Coast, Sequoia/Kings Canyon to the Modoc Plateau--the featured trips range from easy strolls to strenuous treks. All hikes can be done in a single day, but many are ideal for overnight backpacking trips.  <P>Each trip includes easy to read symbols that allow the reader to determine the nature and difficulty of the hike, a detailed route description, accurate directions to the trailhead, location of the nearest campground, and extensive natural history information. 101 Hikes in Northern California will quickly become the first guidebook you reach for when you want to explore the best of Northern California's fabulous backcountry.</span>

                    <span>I wish this guy would write more books. I liked the geology. I liked that he had a 5 star system instead of a 3 star. I like that there was a one line highlight description for each hike</span>

                    <span>This is an amazing resource book for exploring the most spectacular wilderness areas in Northern California. It is easy to use with accurate and detailed maps and inspiring pictures that make you want to get out there and start hiking. Heid has chosen some of the most remote parks, preserves, and national forests in Northern California to explore, making 101 Hikes the best book off the beaten hiking path.</span>

                    <span>This is the best hiking guide for Northern California that I've ever used. The great selection of hikes covers more area than most books about the region. I've found a lot of places I never new about. I love the descriptions of the hikes-a great easy style, really clear, and full of interesting information about the plants, geology, and history that adds a lot to the hike. A helpful locator map, good topo maps, and great photos too. A nice addition is the comprehensive list of hikes by theme that help choose where to hike based on what you want to do-lakes, waterfalls, wildflowers, etc. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the best Northern California hiking guide-for both dayhikes and backpacks.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. The author has put a lot of effort into finding a large number of hikes well off the beaten track. To date, I have done nearly a dozen of the hikes and seldom encountered anybody else. If you like beating the crowds while enjoying some of Northern California's most scenic backcountry, the majority of the hikes more than satisfy. Several popular hikes are included as well (Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, for example) but these are much fewer in number and seem to be limited to those truly spectacular destinations which more than merit the crowds. Directions are good, the topographic maps are very usable, and lots of natural history information is included for trail-side reading. The book also covers a much greater area than other Northern California guidebooks and includes areas in the southern Sierra Nevada and Central Coast neglected in similar titles. About the only bad thing about the book is the index, which is sparse in places and can make finding a particular park difficult</span>
