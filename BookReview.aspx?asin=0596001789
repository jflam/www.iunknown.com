                <span id="Label1"><I>Perl & LWP</I> sets out to unwrap the Library for the Web in Perl (LWP), which is a collection of modules that make it easier to access and pick apart Web pages (and FTP-accessible files, and outgoing e-mail messages) from within your Perl programs. The book succeeds wonderfully, not only in conveying the technical aspects of LWP programming, but in making clear the fun of doing work that's very well suited to Perl. Sean Burke assumes that his readers know something about Perl, albeit not much, and a similar amount about HTML. He does a great job of explaining how LWP functions fit into Perl programs, and how you can use them to make reference to Internet resources far more easily than before.<p>Burke's narrative takes the form of a guided tour in which he introduces his readers to aspects of the LWP modules one by one. His tone is generally straightforward (sharp commentary alternates with brief code listings, with occasional passages of reference material), but there's sometimes an undercurrent of exuberance that makes the reader want to get going with his or her own programming right away. Overall, the emphasis is on teaching both LWP and Perl itself to the extent necessary to do LWP work. Because of the concise and nicely indexed code modules, though, you'll find this book useful as a reference after you're under way with LWP. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to program with LWP and Perl itself. All of LWP's strong points--including HTML parsing (with tokens and trees as well as with regular expressions), HTML generation and modification, manipulation of HTML forms, and the operation of spiders--are covered. This book has more of a tutorial tone than any similar reference material on the Internet.</span>

                    <span>If you aren't yet comfortable using object-oriented Perl modules, the multitude of examples will at least allow you see how it's done even if you're a bit fuzzy on what's happening 'underneath' when you call object methods. If you're comfortable learning how to do something without knowing exactly why it works, then the author's clear step-by-step explantions and numerous progressively more powerful examples should make this book accessible even to relatively innexperienced Perl programmers.<p>More experienced programmers will understand better why things work, but any Perl programmer will set this book down feeling empowered to turn the web into their own valet. No longer do you need to check multiple sites looking for interesting information. Instead, you can readily author code to do that for you and alert you when items of interest are found. You can use these tools to free up personal time, to harvest information to inform business decisions, to automate tedious web application testing, and a zillion other things.<p>The author's clear exploration of the relevant Perl modules leaves the reader with a good depth of understanding of what these modules do, when you might want to use which module, and how to use them for real world tasks. Before reading the book, I knew of these modules, but they were a rather intimidating pile. I'd used a few of them on occasion for rather limited projects, but was reluctant to invest the time required to read all of the documentation from the whole collection. Mountains of method-level documentation do not a tutorial make. This book takes all of that information, selects the most important parts, and ensures that those parts are covered in progressively more powerful and/or flexible examples.<p>If you know Perl and you're sick of 'working the web' to get information and you want the web to work for you instead, then you need this book. I had a personal project that was on the back burner for a couple of years because it just sounded too hard. The weekend after I finished this book, I wrote what I had previously thought to be the hard part of that project and it was both easy and fun. This book makes hard things not just possible, but actually easy.<p>-matt</span>

                    <span>If you are unfamiliar with LWP and web scraping, or HTML parsing using tokens and trees, I strongly recommend this book.  It's the best *introduction* to these topics I've been able to find.  Sean's style is clear and concise-just what I expect from an O'Reilly book.<p>To get the most out of this book, you'll want to be familiar with Object Oriented programming in Perl, because (with the exception of LWP::Simple) all the modules discussed in this book use objects.  <p>Also, don't expect the LWP sample code in the book to work correctly.  Many of the sites that the scripts try to "scrape" have changed their layout since this book was published, braking the scripts.  This isn't a problem though, because the samples Sean provides are very short and clear, so it's not necessary to run them in order to figure out how they work.</span>

                    <span>I really don't know how the previous 5 reviews gave this book 5 stars.  I was really excited about this book when I first read the reviews, and now here I am only a few chapters in and already thinking about dumping it altogether.  This book has so many flaws for its size, the biggest of which was the codes.  I am no Perl expert, but could find my way around in a decent size program.  However, no examples I have tried so far in the book actually worked, and some of these are just 10-20 lines long.  I am completely new to LWP, I guess like anyone who would buy this book, so it's hard for me to see what the author is doing.  The explanation of the code didn't help much either.  As oppose to explaining the steps, he just said "the code below does this".  And it's pretty obvious little or no editing has gone into this book.  If you do buy this book, you'll probably want to make a trip to the Errata page at the Oreilly website.  The amount of typos, printing errors, warnings and grammatical mistakes found by readers and editors listed on this page rivals the usuable content of the book itself.  You know what, I have spent way too much on this book already.....</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer: The author is an online-type-friend and I used to work with the author of the foreword. I even got my copy for free. <p>If the above hasn't totally disqualified me from commenting, I just wanted to note some things most reviewers have ignored. <p>The book is an excellent resource for two kinds of people. <p>Many people scan technical books looking for little scripts and thingies; a few lines changed and BOOM! They have the program they always wanted. Sean provides those in abundance. <p>It is also a good resource for a complete novice to learn about the hodgepodge of technologies we call the web - the ... wire protocol, markup languages, tree-based parsers, and encodings, to name just a few. The author is an expert in all of these, but has restrained himself to provide just enough information to get a programmer going. I was impressed time and again with how he manages to give the reader exactly enough knowledge to get their tasks done, with short but accurate explanations and pointers on where to learn more. <p>Best of all, this is a funny technical book. Usually if a technical book has pretensions to humor, it jabs you in the arm repeatedly with lots of groaner puns and dumb cartoons, in order to fill the space between bland code sections. But Sean has sprinkled the *code sections* with his dada sense of humor, which also highlights the difference between mere placeholder data and the concept being illustrated. And then the text gets right back to the point.<p>This is a slim work (242 pages, no thicker than my thumb) but packs a lot of value for your money. So buy it already.<p>My only criticism is that it is exclusively focused on consuming services on the web - like downloading TV listings and so on. But you can use everything Sean talks about to also *publish* information; for instance, making some nifty Perl-based thing to update your online journal from MS Word or something. Or to aggregate information that's out there, and feed it back onto the web. Nevertheless, if you've got half a brain it will be obvious how to do this stuff once you've absorbed everything you'll get from this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a comprehensive and authoritative guide to web automation.  It reads as both a gentle tutorial and a well organized reference.  Basic HTTP operation, regexp HTML parsing, tokenizing, cookie authentication, form handling, and robot spidering are covered extensively in numerous case studies and practical examples.<p>Naturally, I was impressed by the simple, consistent treatment of examples: inspect source and find the interesting bits, code things up and then enhance to suit.  :-)<p>A particularly satisfying thing to me is the sane way of working, that the author assumes.  So many people seem to just bungle their way through web programming while ignoring basics like the robots.txt file.  This book helps to prevent this.<p>One would think that only a thick tome would be sufficient to cover such vast territory, but the author (who is an active LWP module developer) does a fabulous job covering this extensive subject matter.<p>I recommend this book both to anyone starting out on their way to working with the underside of the web and to accomplished professionals in need of a full reference manual.</span>
