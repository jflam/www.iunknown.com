                    </div>
                    <span>I have developed using ASP for about a year, so I wasn't exactly "new" to the whole ASP thing.  I already learned how to develop database-intensive websites using "Beginning ASP Databases," ISBN:1861002726 .  When .NET became the new thing, I needed something to get me up to speed.
<br />
<br />The whole reason I got this book was because I wasn't sure what was the difference between ASP classic and ASP.NET.  I got the impression that this book might fill in some gaps.  The gaps were created when I attempted to get started using the O'Reilly books but that didn't work.  They were more reference-oriented, so I got lost.
<br />
<br />This book did a fine job of making me feel comfortable in the transition to .NET by explaining what was the same or similar and what was different.  After reading this book, I basically came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to have to learn a new syntax and that with almost no effort, I could write simple .NET pages immediately using my ASP classic foundation with any editor of my choice.
<br />
<br />I also learned, to my surprise, that one can still use ASP classic techniques in ASP.NET pages.  For example, if you still want to use the old way of form handling, you can.
<br />
<br />The author explains common VB.NET syntax, which is great for those familiar with VBScript.  Then the author talks very simply about objects, which you'll see in .NET.  The author also does a good job explaining the differences between form handling in ASP classic and how it works in .NET.  Form validation and server controls (form elements) are then explained.
<br />
<br />Up to that point (ch17) in the book, things went well for me.  However, I became disappointed when chapter 18 came along, which deals with working with databases.
<br />
<br />Some of the previous comments indicated that the book is weak in its attempts to describe the database techniques.  In all of my web design experience, databases are at the heart of everything I have done, so I was disappointed to not get the sense that I could handle all of the database tasks I will certainly run into.
<br />
<br />For example, when I tried to connect to an MS Access database on my IIS server using the examples listed in the text, I got an error that the workgroup file is missing or locked, and was not able to connect to the database.  The book doesn't address potential problems of this sort.  I was able to use the book example and connect to a SQL server database just fine, but quickly discovered the book's lack of information beyond just displaying database data and making simple updates.
<br />
<br />Also, you have to have access to Internet Information Server and a database and have permissions to set that stuff up if you want to try working with a database, so you may not be able to get your feet wet anyway.
<br />
<br />I have found in my experience that the database stuff can get really complex when the task requires for example that the database display results must be broken down into a certain number of results-per-page, certain amounts of information displayed, sorting results, and of course formatting.  As a result of this, I am hunting for a really good book focusing on databases with ASP.NET.
<br />
<br />Additionally, I was disappointed with the author's web site.  I visited it once hoping to find a lot more information.  He lists a discussion forum, CD content download, and Book Corrections, which I thought would be useful.  They were not at all useful to me.  Especially disappointing is the online forum, which when I last counted, had less than 20 posts.
<br />
<br />Overall, I think this book helped reduce the initial worries I had about making the transition.  Yes I can now write a .NET page that can collect some information from a form, validate it, and operate on it.  Yes I can write a page that can fetch and display some database content.  Can I write a database driven website just like I did with ASP classic?  No.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, data driven websites are where the Internet has headed, and if I am to be a successful web application developer, I must be able to use different technologies (including .NET) to handle all of the data.  This book has not given me the knowledge tools to do just that.
<br />
<br />I give it 3 stars because it was useful in helping me see that a lot of what I already know can transfer over to .NET.</span>

                    <span>There is so much depth to asp.net that a "For Dummies" book can't possibly begin to do the subject justice.  
<br />
<br />In making the jump from classic ASP to ASP.NET I purchased this book first and found that it did not even come close to teaching me what I needed to know about dynamic page generation and database driven content.
<br />
<br />This book would be a good place to start if you are completely new to web site development and would like to just get your feet wet, but if your versed in classic ASP and are looking to migrate, then I would suggest ASP.Net Unleased instead.

                    <span>Man...I always start off these reviews with a good idea in my head and end up blank when I go to type it!  Anyways...I'm an intermediate ASP developer and have been hacking away at ASP pages for a good three years now.  Making the jump to ASP.NET was a scary proposition!  The reason is that I've been an avid Dreamweaver user and didn't want to switch to M$'s rather funky software just to do coding.  Nope!  No can do!  Don't force me to have to switch back and forth between two different coding environments!  So the trick for me was to learn the basics of ASP.NET and then learn how to encorporate it into Dreamweaver.  
<br />
<br />On that note, I picked up this book as a good jumping off point.  I gave the book 4 stars simply because, although it indeed accomplishes it's goal, it's by no means perfect.  For someone transitioning from ASP to ASP.NET, the writer does a good job referencing the differences between the two as he goes along.  He also does a good job starting off with the basics.  He works from the most simplest of concepts (variables and delimiters) to the most advanced (ADO connections) in a step-by-step manner.  It's a quick read for any seasoned ASP developer.  Not all ASP developers will get entirely what they want out of this book...but some will.  For the beginner though, this book is a pretty darn good jumping off point.  Even if you don't entirely understand everything you're looking, just know that you can always go back and review what you've learned.  Just remember that this book is not a thorough how-to book...it's more of a prep-book for a more advanced how-to book.  Not perfect...but darn close!  :D</span>

                    <span>Even though I had a reasonable background in using vb.net, I just couldn't put all the pieces together for ASP.NET when using Microsoft's ASP.net with VB .net (G. Andrew Duthie).  After reading ASP.NET for Dummies, the ASP.NET technology finally started to make sense.  
<br />Now I've been able to return to G. Andrew Duthie's book and get more out of it.  
<br />One negative comment though--even though vb.net still supports much of the old vb6 style programming, the book should have used the .net OOP style throughout.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in 2.5 weeks. It's short and clear. I have not touched serious a web programming language for about 2 years<br>and this book reintroduced me to this world easily and without the stress of expected previous understanding.<p>I learned the basics of VB.NET and ASP.NET and I can now adapt basic applications to suit my needs.<p>I am not saying you should read this without any understanding of the web. It assumes some basic knowledge but most persons interested in ASP.NET already have this knowledge already.<p>You will need other books if you want to go deep into databases or other neat stuff in ASP.NET but if you want a solid hands-on introduction, this is the book for you.</span>
