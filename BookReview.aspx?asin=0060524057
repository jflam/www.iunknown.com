                    <span>This book is about Paul O'Neill and his relationship with his father. His relationship included the life lessons that his father taught him while they were on the diamond. Remember, it is important to have this relationship with a special family member so that you always would have somebody to talk to. I personally enjoyed this book and loved reading it. The book was kind of fuzzy throughout some parts. By this I mean, that some of the book was filled with filler. The book then went on to talk about how his father was important while he was on the road for a long time. In addition, while he was on his way to the majors. It is evident that Paul is a great author and he has great writing abilities. Finally, I would just like to say that this was an all-around great book!</span>

                    <span>	Me and My Dad is Paul O'Neill's tribute to his late father Chuck O'Neill.  The book takes you through Paul's life from playing homerun derby in his backyard as a child, to playing in the World Series as a New York Yankee.  He places emphasis on his fathers influence and wisdom he shared with him through the many troubles he had in life.  Throughout the book Paul tells us about his experiences and how his father could always put a positive spin on everything by relating life to baseball, or baseball to life.  The book helps to give the reader a deeper and simpler look at professional athletes.
<br />	While it is a must read for any Yankee or Paul O'Neill fan, I can not recommend it to anyone else.  Even for a baseball fan like myself it has limited appeal.  It is short and not very well written; some parts seem to drag on and on about nothing.  Yankee fans will love it just to get a deeper understanding of one of their better players, but others will laugh at Paul's girlyness and grow to dislike him by the end.  Because of these reasons, I can only recommend this book to Yankee fans, and possibly women who like to see the softer and more sensitive side of men.

                    <span>I hardly remember Paul O'Neill as a Red's player, he's always been a Yankee to me. Never have I ever seen any one bleed Yankee blue and white as Paul O'Neill did. This book is a great book. He brings the same perfection to writing a book as he did on the field. His story brings new meaning to father/son baseball relationships.</span>

                    <span>Being an Indians fan I have never been a Yankee or Paul O'Neill fan.  This was mainly due to O'Neill's actions of emotion of breaking water coolers or throwing his helmet after he failed on the field.  After reading his book "Me and my Dad".  I still hate the Yankees but I do respect Paul O'Neill.  He was a great ballplayer and he loves the game just like his Dad taught him to. This book gives a good capsule of a journey of a little kid and his Father by his side from little league to the majors.  One side note, there is a typo in the book about the 1997 Yankees - Indians playoff game.  Sandy Alomar hit the home run off Mario Rivera not Robbie Alomar.  As an Indian fan I will never forget it!</span>

                    <span>The father-son baseball connection has been done many times but usually in connection to fans, not a major league player and his dad. This original & touching treatment of the topic makes Me and My Dad one of the 10 best baseball books of year and worthy of its Finalist nomination for the 2003 CASEY Award.</span>
