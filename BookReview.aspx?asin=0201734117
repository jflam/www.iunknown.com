                    <span>only for advanced readers. If you are a beginner, you may get lost. I had to read a couple of times to get 100%. Excellent. Some concepts are pretty difficult to understand. </span>

                    <span>This is not the book to dive into first if you want to really get .NET. It's actually a fairly interesting mixture of what I now consider obvious and what I never stopped to consider. If you are just starting out, I would begin with Richter's book, and then digest this one quickly afterwards. There is a significant amount of overlap, but your final understanding will be very balanced.</span>

                    <span>There are like a zillion CLR books out there and overall, it's not the type of subject that normally keeps you glued to it.  When I got Jeffrey Richther's Microsoft .NET Framework book, I was convinced no one was going to outdo him.  Well, it's a close call, but I think they are both Superb books by excellent authors.  I've purchased Don's stuff before and really liked it.  This book lived up to its expectations.<p>I think his ability to communicate some of the more obscure areas of the CLR in a very clear matter is what makes this book shine.  This book can be understood by anyone because of the writer's gift for writing...but that's not to say it's a novice's book.  Wherever you are in the .NET learning curve, there's something for you in this book.<p>If you really want to learn the CLR, this is a great place to start.</span>

                    <span>In my POV this is a masterpiece!<p>I read both (Don Box's book and Stutz's Book)!<p>Stutz's book has an "inside-out POV" to expose the CLR features,<br>Don Box's book has an "outside-in POV" to expose the CLR features.<p>These two books are really cool... Any review less than 3 stars must be ignored!</span>
