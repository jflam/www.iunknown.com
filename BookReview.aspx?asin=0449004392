                    <span>David Halberstam's publication "The Children" is an exciting overview of the Civil Rights Movement from an enamored journalist through the eyes of Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. (SNCC)  The author focuses on the major players such as Diane Nash, James Bevel, Jim Lewis, Curtis Murphy, Bernard Lafayette and James Lawson, with heavy emphasis on the Nashville Sit-In Movement and Freedom Rides.  The strength of his work is that it reads much more like a fast paced novel than an academic analysis.  He does however at the same time provide plenty of background material and socio-economic, political and cultural variables within his work.  Halberstam also revisits these former SNCC workers after the "high" of the movement and even much later in life.  It's quite obvious the work of a journalist within the pages.  
<br />
<br />This is a good overview of Civil Rights through the eyes of SNCC rather than a broader based examination of the movement.  Halberstam's book is quite impressive, and what I admire is the length of information he was able to attain from the vast interviews he received, largely because he had already covered and had known many of the players as a journalist covering the Civil Rights Movement.  If you are just starting out or have little knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement this book would be a good starting point.  Journalists make great writers because they simply know how to tell a story.  Well done!  </span>

                    <span>Halberstam has produced another masterpiece, perhaps his best since B&B.  As with Vietnam, this book is permeated by his personal experience as a young reporter full of ambition and working hard to find a story.  The story here are the young people, who appeared as if out of nowhere in Tenessee, and entered history with their courage and dignity.
<br />
<br />What distinguishes this book from others on the civil rights campaign is its focus not on the most visible leaders of the fight - ML King, Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers - but on the students who served as foot soldiers and then leaders in their own right.  These were young people whose names are not household words, but whose courage and action did as much to change American society and politics as King and the others.  It is a truly amazing and inspiring story, as they started in Nashville with solid training in Ghandian non-violence techniques and then went into the deep south, where they were beaten and threatened with a viciousness that shocked the world.  In the process their audacity not only pushed a reluctant and cautious MLK to greater ambition, but they matured as political actors and many went on to outstanding careers as politicians, teachers, and preachers.  
<br />
<br />Halberstam delineates how their non-violence and charismatic dignity in the face of these threats dovetailed with the development of television, broadcasting the brutality of the old south into the living rooms.  It was this combination - a mass movement addressing centuries-old injustices, the bad-guy thugishness of their primitivie adversaries, and TV's images - that culminated in the Civil Rights and then Voting Acts of 1965.  It is a fascinating analysis of how politics was changing at the time.
<br />
<br />But Halberstam doesn't stop there:  he also chronicles the  aftermath, when new "separatist" leaders emerged, like Stokely Carmichael, who split the extraordinary unity of the movement for more selfish purposes.  He also evokes the deterioration of the inner cities as the issues shift to the far more difficult and ill-defined challenges of poverty and personal identity.  It is the other half of the story - the disappointing aftermath - when lesser politicians took over and disillusionment set in after a series of terrible assasinations.  Perhaps it was inevitable, as the society digested such fundamental change and moved on to the Vietnam war period.
<br />
<br />Most interestingly, Halberstam follows many of these students leaders through their entire careers, which serve as the vehicles to portray the issues in the paragraph above.  We see some of them unable to sustain the intensity of their purpose, sometimes degenerating into self-destructive paths or irrelevancy as single mothers, demagogues of questionable sanity, and drug abusers.  But there were many who became great leaders, entering politics as congressmen and demonstrating that the right to vote really did change America into a more inclusive society, or becoming business men - they were able to participate fully in an integrated society, the first generation of blacks to do so.  These individual portraits are masterpieces of depth reporting and the humanistic impulse, which are the hallmarks of Halbertam's unique voice.
<br />
<br />This book rises to great eloquence, his best since B&B.  Warmly recommended as one of the best books I read in years.  </span>

                    <span>It's hard to believe that about 40 years ago most of the south was still segregated.  Black people there were not allowed to use the same bathrooms or drinking fountains as white people, were not allowed to sit in the front seats on a bus, were not allowed to eat at public lunch counters, and most of them were denied the right to vote.
<br />
<br />This is the story of a group of kids who had the courage to fight to change this.  They carried on their fight in a non-violent way, accomplishing great results with their courage, wisdom and determination.
<br />
<br />It's amazing to read about what they endured to win their fight.
<br />
<br />Halberstam is one of my favorite authors and this is one of the best books I've ever read.</span>

                    <span>David Halberstam has written an epic history of the young men and women, most still in their teens, who had the courage and nobility of spirit to fight the unjust status quo of segregation, and change the course of our nation's history. This is the story of the civil rights movement in the United States, beginning in the late 1950s and reaching its height in the mid-1960s. The story is told from the eyes of these young people - it is the history they made. "The Children" frequently put their lives on the line, risking physical danger and even death, to join the non-violent protests that would give all Americans equal rights under the law.<p>The Movement's leaders were two black southern ministers, both strongly influenced by the teachings of Mahandas Gandhi. These two men, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jim Lawson, designed the framework of the mission. They stratagized like generals waging a unique war. Young college students, mostly African Americans, whose parents had sacrificed much to send them to university, were recruited as soldiers. These vulnerable and committed students were schooled in the nonviolent tradition, with workshops, such as: "Justice Without Violence" and "The New Negro In The New South." We meet these children and hear of their experiences in Nashville, Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, and many other towns and small cities all over the South. Halberstam documents the background of these young troops, their families, and struggles, growing up Black in America. He movingly describes the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and the terrible violence of the Klan, and of ordinary citizens, steeped in bigotry, that endangered all of them. We read about the voter registration campaigns, and the founding of SNCC and CORE. The moral, philosophical and political roots of the civil rights movement, and the divisiveness within the group as different ideologies emerged, are well documented, as is the death of Dr. King.<p>Halberstam draws an amazing portrait of Jim Lawson, whose fervor and dedication moved a generation of Americans to action. The author truly excels, however, in bringing to life the young people whose story this is. We are updated, toward the end of the book, on the lives of the young activists today. This incredibly moving history reads like a novel you don't want to put down. And while we read about a most shameful period in our nation's history, who can fail to be proud of the young citizens who took action to make such important changes?</span>

Board of Education, Bernard Lafayette, James Lawson, Nashville Mayor Ben West , Robert Kennedy, Rodney Powell, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, mayor Marion Barry, and Vanderbilt Divinity School.<p>The children is an excellent historical document highlighting the oppression and struggles of the black man, the nonviolent influence teachings of Ghandi, and the lives of early Black religious, political, and student leaders.  Halberstam gets caught up in the movement and details the adventures, tradegies, struggles, and pain associated with the civil rights movement.  The supreme court ruling in Brown v Board of Education starts the paving of the road against segregation.  The struggle would not be easy as young black activist wanted more rights, rights not popular among the white community,  right such as, to eat with caucasians, ride buses in non-segregated sections, attend movies without having to watch from the black only balcony, and vote limited by the literacy and discriminatory practices design to prevent eligibility for blacks.   The movement for equal rights started slowly and was large based on Christian idealogy, "if they enemy strike thee on the check turn also the other cheek".  Black religious leaders would draw from simple fundamental teachings of Christ and Ghandi about non-violent philosophy to encourage the black community to resist violence to achieve their objectives.  The religious leaders could see the long term advantages to non-violent protests, knowning that militant approaches would lead to significant increases in death.   The civil rights era was a time of danger, excitement, and determination.   The black leaders believing the beating could not break down the spirit and they could rise above their attackers.  If they were beaten down, they would be replaced, and show their undominatable determination.<p>As the movement grew diverse idealogies emerged leaving some of the black leaders disoriented about the groups commitment to non-violence.  The first trumiphant event breaking the barrier of segration came as political pressure mounted against Mayor Ben West who commit to stop segregation and allow blacks and whites to eat together.  James Bevel who involved both the older black generation who feared and submitted completely the white man and the children in protest marches.  Halberstam seemed to believe this was the turning point for the movement as the older generation was ready to standup against their oppressors.  If even the children could make a statement the movement was gaining force.  An the movement would increase in the thousands from town to town and the media would follow the marches, beatings, speechs, and the unrest of a nation in disruption.  Halberstams book of over 700 pages demostrates the amazing interest the media acquired while centering on the social changes threatening to break the social imperatives of the time.  The intensity and interest was amazing.<p>The movement was to remain disciplined, non-violent, and legal.   Individuals not willing to commit to the principles and practices of non-violence were not allowed to participate.  Mr Luther King would not march against a court injunction until his lawyers cleared the injunction. The goal was non-violent protests.  The struggle to gain Federal protection for the freedom riders did not come immediately.   The freedom riders brought local law confrontation and klan involvement into the picture.  Robert Kennedy right hand man a federal agent would be badly beaten.   The battle lines were emerging between the Klan and the Federal government.  Violence, death, and brutality characterized the protests of the freedom riders highlighted with numerous encounters with Bull Conner, a known member of the Klan, and general racist corruption controlling the police force.  Halberstam struggles with explaining the issues preventing the Federal government from early involvement in civil right violations.  Its seems the south even after a 100 years of emancipation struggled with the after effects of slavery.   The social imperatives had not been redefined and the government seemed perplexed on how to influence change.  The civil war had been won by the North but the idealogy remained very Southern.  However, Dr. King would visionalize a future where the idealogy of the south and the world would be more tolerate and accepting of the black culture.  The price to gain this freedom would require the deepest commitment from all of the black culture.  Analogies to Dr. King being the Mose to liberate his people were often used to rally the black communities to action.  <p>Dr King would become the figure head for the media to focus on.  Dr King role in increasing black rights would be recognized by the black community.  However, some would not feel so supportive and desire leaders by John Lewis to play a more promient role.  The fundamentalism deriving the equal rights movement crowned in the confrontation between black activist and the white klan police force at Selma.   The violence is appalling as Halberstam paints a picture of hugh waves of militant officers beating and club innocent men, women, and children in the act of prayer.  This is an extremely painful depiction of suffering and determination.  Dr King would attempt to rally support in Chicago but find a different culture and challenges. Dr Kings assassination was a sad moment in American History.  Halberstam makes no conclusions about the black social problems today nor the long term benefits of the movement for the black community.</span>
