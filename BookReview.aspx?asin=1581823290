                    <span>Don't know who Tommy Gun is or if he's actually from Chicago, as both authors of this book are and are well familiar with the area. Maybe he just doesn't realize that some street names and addresses have changed since 1929. Or mebbe he's related to R.J. Whatisname. Anyhow, seriously folks, this is a fantastic book and the most accurate examination ever of the most famous gangland massacre of all time. Helmer's notoriously lively writing style as usual makes for great reading. </span>

                    <span>The book is very poorly written and some of the facts stated such as street locations are wrong.I had to reread some sentences over again and again and they still didn't make sense.If you're from Chicago,it's very obvious that the person who wrote this book doesn't know the city.Skip this one.</span>

                    <span>William Helmer, author of the recent page turner on Baby Face Nelson, along with Arthur Bilek, have provided us with another superb effort on the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre just in time for its 75th anninversary.  This brazen event was not pleasing to the New York mob because it drew too much attention to federal authorities and the public in general.  Although Al Capone didn't know it at the time his heyday as the Chicago crime czar were on the downswing, with Frank Nitti ready to take his place.  Many of the details have remained under wraps for many years, and the authors state the book is largely "the product of the personal memories and cooperative interrogations of Georgette Winkeler" whose husband Gus was involved with "his partners in crime."  All the characters of the 1920's and early 1930's Chicago crime era are here in all their infamy.  The authors show how ballistic evidence was used to identify two machine guns that Fred "Killer" Burke had in his possession when he was arrested for the murder of a police officer in St. Joseph, Michigan, as being guns used in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  The authors relate how J. Edgar Hoover closed his mind to the existence of any organized crime, instead focusing on two bit hoodlums such as Dillinger, Nelson, and Floyd.  Hoover comes across as a ego maniac who became disgustingly jealous of the recognition that came agent Melvin Purvis's way following the killing of John Dillinger.  Hoover had Purvis "reassigned", and Purvis finallly quit the F.B.I. in frustration.   Hoover then made it a point to make sure Purvis could not find any other work in law enforcement.  Finally when Purvis died of a gunshot wound in 1960, the F.B.I. made it seem as though it was a suicide, even though evidence showed it to be accidental.  Even though you may be well versed in Chicago crime lore you will find new information in this book, and want to make it a permanent part of your personal library.  I did find a few spelling errors that got by the editor, but it in no way detracts from the book.</span>

                    <span>I have been waiting for this one for a long long time!!!!Besides Capone himself, my biggest passion has been the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.I finally got my wish bigtime and to make it even better,the one and only Helmer is on the case.I couldn't ask for more(perhaps Mattix)on this book to make it perfect.I just was fascinated by the new info and intricate details involved in what was supposedly an easy hit as reported by crime writers in history.Helmer knows his stuff along with Bilek they pull off a wonderful job in a book that i highly recommend!!!!</span>
