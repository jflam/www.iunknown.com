                <span id="Label1">In <I>102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers</I>, <I>New York Times</I> writers Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn vividly recreate the 102-minute span between the moment Flight 11 hit the first Twin Tower on the morning of September 11, 2001, and the moment the second tower collapsed, all from the perspective of those inside the buildings--the 12,000 who escaped, and the 2,749 who did not. It's becoming easier, years later, to forget the profound, visceral responses the Trade Center attacks evoked in the days and weeks following September 11. Using hundreds of interviews, countless transcripts of radio and phone communications, and exhaustive research, Dwyer and Flynn bring that flood of responses back--from heartbreak to bewilderment to fury. The randomness of death and survival is heartbreaking. One man, in the second tower, survived because he bolted from his desk the moment he heard the first plane hit; another, who stayed at his desk on the 97th floor, called his wife in his final moments to tell her to cancel a surprise trip he had planned. In many cases, the deaths of those who survived the initial attacks but were killed by the collapse of the towers were tragically avoidable. Building code exemptions, communication breakdowns between firefighters and police, and policies put in place by building management to keep everyone inside the towers in emergencies led, the authors argue, to the deaths of hundreds who might otherwise have survived. September 11 is by now both familiar and nearly mythological. Dwyer and Flynn's accomplishment is recounting that day's events in a style that is stirring, thorough, and refreshingly understated. <I>--Erica C. Barnett</I></span>

                    <span>Unfortunately the United States of America has left itself open to any and all attacks.  But this book tells a story of bravery when the moment of disaster happened.  The USA lost many of its bravest and best that horrible day.  Many were alone and with only a cell phone to contact their loved ones---it was only for a moment to say goodbye.  Even if you read this book over and over again, you will never truly undeerstand the terror that befell our citizens that day.  Perhaps the not knowing is why so little has been done to protect our citizens.  It is probably only a 'moment' away from happening again. May the ones who died that day now rest in the arms of angels.

                    <span>If you want to read about 9/11, there are hundreds of books to choose from.
<br />
<br />I have read many of them.
<br />
<br />Up to now, only one volume I consider indispensable. "The 9/11 report" book.
<br />
<br />Now there are two.
<br />
<br />"102 Minutes" provides an unforgettable, harrowing account of those 102 minutes from first crash to last crumble.
<br />
<br />I found myself continuously astonished at some of the mental images the words generated; the bodies carpeting floor 78 or the molten aluminum dripping from the airplane wreckage, for example.
<br />
<br />I was humbled at the heroics of not only the firemen, but the "civilians" inside when the planes hit.
<br />
<br />It is almost a painful read...it will be too vivid for some, I'm sure. The image of someone looking out from the lobby, up into the sky, to see if it's safe to run away from the building, with the rain of jumpers, debris and plane parts coming down, is still chilling.
<br />
<br />Being out here on the West Coast, I watched with the rest of world, truly in shock and stunned disbelief, the events of that day. I said to myself countless times since that time, I couldn't imagine what it must have been like. Reading some of the other reviews, by people who were there, I now feel I can.
<br />
<br />If and when they make a film about 9/11, this will be their "bible" when depicting what was going on inside WTC.
<br />
<br />I will never walk in a fire escape/stairwell again without thinking about 9/11, or about this book. I will never look up at a skyscraper without thinking of this book. 
<br />
<br />The next time I visit NYC, I can guarantee you that I will be filled with emotions I will barely be able to handle, because of this book.
<br />
<br />The official commission book will give you everything you need to know about that horrible day from every perspective save one: the one from inside those buildings. This book does exactly specifically that.
<br />
<br />This completes the picture.</span>

                    <span>Great insight of the true heroism that took place inside the towers on 9/11.  The authors do such a great job of humanizing the survivors while honoring those who perished. I feel as if I know the victims of this horrible attack a little better which will allow me to honor them in a more personal way in the years to come. </span>

<br />However, I am aware of many other experiences that were left out: both survivors and non-survivors. They focussed on some great heroes and rightly critiqued some of the response.
<br />
<br />will we see one on the Pentagon?</span>

                    <span>my wife is wtc tower two survivor and reading these stories of survival made me realize what she went through that day. She worked on the 85th floor of tower two, and she told me that when the first plane hit tower one she attempted to call 911 but the phones were not working. She got some other people who she worked with and searched the floor for others before they evacuated.They were on there way down the stairs when the p.a. system came on and they were told to return to there office that there was a small fire in tower  one but it's been contained. she did not listen to the p.a announcement and told the others to continue down.Luckily they listened, moments later they reached the 72nd floor and the 2nd plane hit tower two. My wife said the tower swayed back anf forth they heard a loud boom. they then hauled ass and got out 8 minutes before tower two collapsed. i still have a hard time with that day,even though she went through it,she got over it quicker then i did. People she worked with said she was a hero for telling them not to listen to p.a. system and for evacuating the floor and searching for others before leaving. she never saw herself as a hero but i do.If thay had not left the 85th floor when they did they would have been trapped due to the plane hit between 76 and 84th floors. Sadly seven people died from her floor, my wife searched that floor before she left. she said people may have gone down other stairs before she and others left and came up when the p.a system told them to return to the offices. This book is one of the best i've read becuase it comes from the people who lived through it. god bless you all and our hearts go out those who perished and to there loved ones.
