Entries should be one or two paragraphs long with some links. That's it. Longer essay-style pieces belong in a different medium. </p>

<p>My vote is for <span class="caps">PDF</span> docs that are formatted for on-screen reading. This means acknowledging that folks hate scrolling and that 99.99% of the population have their monitor setup in landscape mode. Comments?</p>

<p>John- I agree that typical blog entries are probably best served by not being too long. You could always create a separate "articles" section on the blog and point to those longer writings. If you could keep in in HTML it might be easier for folks to read and print. You might also consider adding print stylesheets for those who like to read longer articles on paper (like me!).</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Brian</p>

<p>p.s. You should probably edit this blog entry. I think your Textile formatting isn't quite right with respect to those links.</p>

<p>I totally disagree. One of the chief advantages of blogging is that the form places no constraints on length.  As a writer you're free to write just enough to say what you want.  If that's two paragraphs, fine.  If what you have to say is interesting enough to your readers, then, 10,000 words is fine (Chris Brumme's posts have no wasted verbiage, and are fascinating to at least a few of us).</p>

<p>At its best, blogging occurs at the intersection of the public and private.  It's the equivalent of the office water cooler chit-chat or discussions at the pub.  While it lacks the fact-checking, editing, and legal vetting that go into "professional" publication, it has immediacy, personality, and honesty that are often missing from more structured forms.</p>

<p>I'm really dismayed at your suggestion of PDF as a format for on-screen reading.  PDF is a vile format for on-screen reading.  HTML is a pretty decent (and widely deployed) format for on-screen reading.  The Microsoft Reader format(.LIT) is marginally better for book-length material, but there's not much tool support for the casual author.  The new Microsoft Word Reading Layout view is pretty good as well, but Office 2003 doesn't have enough market penetration to warrant using that.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments, John. My frustrations stem from reading entries in Outlook/Newsgator format. I want to have at least _some_ typesetting for the longer entries to make it easier for me to read them. Surely folks that design books would agree that a long stream of essentially unformatted text is not the way to go to enhance readability.</p>

<p>I have some content in PDF that I will ship early next week. Perhaps I might be able to change your mind about PDF's :)</p>

<p>Folks don't hate scrolling. They hate horizontal scrolling while reading text. For this reason alone, on-screen PDF reading is a bad idea. How do you know I'm not reading it on my 204x320 PDA screen? </p>

<p>When I come across a long blog entry, I don't read it. I 'tag' it (usually by marking as unread!) and then either print it out for read on the commute or read it when I've nothing better to do.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree, both with the notion that blog should be short and especially with PDF being an alternative (IMO, it sucks). The main advantage of the blog format is RSS, this allows me follow many blogs without it sucking up a lot of time.</p>

<p>I don't think you'll ever get consensus on what blogs "should" be. I know my personal preference is to keep blog entries shorter than about five paragraphs. For longer stuff, I have a different system based on authoring in Microsoft Word, saving as XML, and doing a transform on the server. It works fairly well - you can see the results at http://staff.develop.com/weblog2/articleview.aspx.</p>

<p>This is the one thing that Radio got right, in my opinion - the separation of short and long content. </p>

<p>If you want the code I use, you're welcome to it. </p>

<p>PDF's....*shudder*</p>

<p>Publish your content as XML, then write app's to convert it to various formats. The web browser being the client for HTML version, Acrobat being the for the PDF version, FeedDemon etc for the RSS guys...etc. </p>

<p>...and CSS is equivalent to typesetting in HTML anyway imo. The latest browsers can do just about anything.<br />
see this url for some nice examples.<br />

<p>As someone who regularly writes long entries, I've thought about the question you've posed quite a bit. Ultimately, I decided that I would put long essays and reviews in my blog and a writing section. The two areas of my site get different readers and I'd hate to leave my blog readers reading only my short pearls of wisdom.</p>

<p>As for making them into PDFs, I always do that for those in my essays and reviews sections because they're long enough that some people might want to print them out. I've got a print stylesheet too, but I like PDF for printing. That, for me, is the only reason why anyone should use it. And there should be an HTML version of any PDF content as well because some people (most perhaps?) won't print out your content.</p>
