                    <span>In November 2000, Penguin Group approached Martin Marty to write a biography on Martin Luther.  He agreed and approached such a biography with no set agenda or niche he wished to fill that other biographies had left fallow.  Yet throughout the book, one finds Marty talking about Luther as a Jacob (from the Old Testament account of Jacob wresting with God by the Jabbok River), as one who wrestled with God his entire life.  
<br />
<br />On one level, I found Marty's biography a complete joy to read.  It straddles the fence between a theological development of Luther like that of Althaus or Lohse and a chronological, easy-to-read biography like that of Roland Bainton.  This middle ground of Marty's book turns out to be a glowing success--but in a few ways, also a gloomy failure.
<br />
<br />Marty succeeds getting into the mind of Luther as no other easy-to-read biography does.  Early in the book, he highlights more than others do the influence on Martin Luther by Usingen and Trutvetter, two professors of Luther who were followers of Ockham.  It was probably through them that the Sola Scriptura principle was planted into Luther's mind, which lay dormant until his struggles with Roman Catholicism forced that seed to spout and take root.  Marty with clarity explains Luther's idea of Anfechtung (of inner struggle and anxiety), of a Christian being a theologian of the cross, and even the functions of Law and Gospel in the life of a person.  Other biographies may touch on these topics, but not in the way Marty does--so that even a layperson or casual reader can grasp what Luther was getting at.  
<br />
<br />Strewn so informally throughout the book are golden nuggets of Luther's theology and insights that other biographies may not mention--or get wrong, if mentioned!  Luther calling the church a "mouth-house," his understanding of vocation, the idea of a "hidden God," and other areas too many to mention are nestled within the book, waiting for the reader to unwrap.  In Chapter Three (of four chapters), "Living the Faith," Marty hits his stride--bringing to light the challenges of early Lutheranism and also the educational reforms of Luther.  There were times when reading this biography I cried out in delight, "Marty, I can kiss that bald head of yours!"
<br />
<br />Marty so touches on the human side of Luther as well.  After Luther's daughter Magdalena died, Marty makes known that Luther "was inconsolable and almost lost the ability to sustain the life of faith.  He even spoke of losing his faith for a time, something he never did when he faced and had to fear the hatred and power of popes, emperors, and princes" (pg. 111).  Marty's description of Luther's relationship with his wife, Katy, is well done and Marty's "connecting of the dots" from such scanty historical information is stupendous.  But take note: this is no putting-Luther-on-a-pedestal biography.  Marty even brings out some of Luther's peculiarities, but never in a voyeuristic or gossipy way.  Near the end of the book, he brings out Luther's polemic writings against anyone he saw as an enemy of the Gospel, in particular, the Papacy, Muslims, and Jews (pgs 162-173).  In context, one can see that Luther was not anti-Semitic--but that he viciously attacked all enemies of the Gospel.
<br />
<br />Despite all the precious jewels awaiting their discovery, Marty leaves untold much of the social and political background going on in Luther's life.  So one unfamiliar with historic events and the "lay of the land" would be confused, not knowing who is doing what to whom in which context.  For instance, Marty writes on the later souring relationship between Luther and Karlstadt: "Karlstadt, who failed to hold the audience in the Leipzig Debate . . ." (pg. 79).  Yet, the biography earlier did not even mention Karlstadt in the Leipzig Debate; from Marty's earlier recounting, one would think that it was simply a debate between Johannes Eck and Luther.  
<br />
<br />When Marty covers the Peasants' War (pgs. 96-98), he does so accurately--but incompletely: he leaves unsaid Luther's earlier efforts to mediate peace before the revolt was in full effect.  Luther believed that the peasants in the end would be crushed, and if they rebelled, they would incur God's wrath, since rebellion goes against to His Word.  So Luther pleaded to the peasants not to rebel.  In the infancy of the rebellion, he also pleaded with the Saxon court to act swiftly against any conflict provoked by the Zwickau prophets, fearing that the discord would grow and destroy both the ruler and the ruled.
<br />
<br />In a few places, Marty allows his personal views to supplant those of Luther.  As an example, Marty's higher-critical views of the Bible come through when he writes: "The Scripture was an infallible guide to salvation, even though, contra to the views of the scholastics, in [Luther's] understanding its writers could and did make mistakes when writing on earthly matters" (pg. 83).  
<br />
<br />Although what Marty's biography gets right is done so well, I cannot recommend this book as the first biography of Luther to read.  One should first learn the broader historical movements of the Reformation, perhaps by reading Kittleson's biography.  After that, then one should read Oberman's Luther: Man Between God and the Devil.  And as tertiary texts, Marty's and Nestingen's recent biographies should be read savor the insights into Luther's mind.  
<br />
<br />Through Kittleson, one would be well rounded on the Reformation with Luther as its instigator and main character.  Through Oberman, a reader would get insight into the medieval world, Luther's torment over sin, and his battles with the devil.  Finally, through Marty and Nestingen, one would receive wonderful insights into Luther's theology without reading tomes of his voluminous writings.

                    <span>I'm not a Luther authority, but I was raised in the Lutheran church, so much of this is covered in our confirmation studies.  It was a good review for me, and it a=can be a good introduction for others interested in this historical figure.
<br />
<br />We studied Luther's theology and the reformation movement in confirmation, but they never covered his personal life much.  Luther was rather lusty once he married.  I'm a bit surprised that so much is known of his love life, though he must have enjoyed writing about it.
<br />
<br />Sex aside, this is a good book and worthy of a look.  I doubt many churches will include it in their teachings, but there is always more information for those who seek it.</span>

                    <span>Marty portrays Luther with fairness, objectivity, and clarity.  Though he doesn't get much into the free will/no free will theology, he does delve into other aspects of Luther's fascinating life.  Beautifully written and an excellent resource for any Christian library.</span>

                    <span>Martin Marty's new biography is an excellent starting point on the study of that oft larger-than-life Theologian and churchman, Luther, that changed not only the face of Christianity forever but that of the Western world. However, it is only a primer, to wet the appetite of those who will need to dig deeper to more fuly understand Luther, his times, his Theology and his effect on the world.</span>

                    <span>Here is another fine entry in the "Penguin Lives" series of short biographies. This is from Martin Marty, America's pre-eminent scholar of religion. His account of Luther's life is comprehensible, thorough and to the point. Luther left a mixed legacy. He promoted the use of reason and freedom of conscience in a world where those qualities were scarce. He also helped provoke the bloody peasant revolts and then sided with his patrons, the German princes, in suppressing them. He was also a grotesque, public anti-Semite. His emphasis on faith and grace over works and consequences gives you, as someone once said, "permission to live", to breathe freely and make mistakes. But he was also so self-absorbed in his struggles with conscience that he seems not to have realized that for most people, a degree of guilt is not a bad thing, the "natural man" being what he is. For better or worse, modern consciousness is to a larger extent a gift from Luther; the "curse" of knowing that there are two or more sides to most issues. Without him, democracy and capitalism would have been unimaginable.</span>
