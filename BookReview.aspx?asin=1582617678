                    <span>Though I live in Japan, I know about the rivalry.
<br />The chance that I knew about the rivalry was when Hideki Matsui joined to the Yankees. In Japan Hideki Matsui was the best super star player and the most famouse player.
<br />That is why, it was natural that I had the interest of major league baseball as same time Masui got to be the menbership of Yankees.
<br />
<br />And I got to be a deep fan day by day. Off course I got to know about the existence of Red sox. And I knew what Red Sox have been apart from the world champion rings, that is [the curse of banbeeno] contunuing for about 100 years.
<br />
<br />On the one hand, I love Yankees naturally that there is Matsui, on the other hand, I love Red Sox too. There are many reasons that I love the team: the unique atomosphere of the Fenway Park, to the contrary for Yankees, the style(hair, bear etc) of the menbers of Red Sox is different and freestyle. I think that the differece of both teams is the thinkin way of the both team GM etc, but additionaly the long history over about 100 years is related to such different style.
<br />
<br />I am interested to the fan's behavior among Red Sox and Yankees.
<br />When the both team played, I was very surprised to the high tension and atmosphere of the fans. Just today, 2004 league champion ship have finished. Fainally Red Sox won. For the game even, there are many events except for the game event: the fans who wore T shirts[who is daddy?] or the two time protests of Red Sox for A Rod' playing and miss judge homeran. Off course I love the high level games between Red Sox and Yankees, but I love the events out of the fields. The events just will not exists if the both teams.
<br />
<br />This year the league championship was Yankees got the consecutive three winnning at first, in the time, I believed that Yankees will have got the championship certainly. The reason was what the team have never lost the championship if the team got the three consecutive winnning from the first game to the third game.
<br />But Red Sox changed the history even: the three consecutive losser never win.
<br />
<br />I understood that The Great Rivalry have the power that change and break through the great history.
<br />
<br />Thank you for reading my poor writing.</span>

                    <span>The Yankee Apocalypse of 2004 
<br />Boston-New York rivalry will never be the same
<br /> 
<br />The point of the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry is that the Yankees always won in the end. That's what made the rivalry so great to a Yankee fan. At least to me anyway. It was always exciting for a Boston fan because they hoped that every year maybe, just maybe, it could be "the year" for Red Sox Nation. And with every regular season victory in their favor, that hope increased. But the Sox never beat us when it counted. Sure, even us Yankee fans had our doubts about our Bombers from time to time if we lost to the Red Sox. Of course we'd like to ALWAYS beat the Red Sox even in spring training but the fact remains, that's just not realistic. And when we lost to them badly during the regular season, questions arose from the Bronx as to whether it really was the year that THEY were going to win it all... 
<br /> 
<br />In the past, they never did. Whether it was because of Babe or Bucky or Buckner or Boone, the Red Sox always managed to lose. Now the Red Sox have won it all and the rivalry is now severely diminished.
<br />
<br />We as fans are no longer going to be able to chant "1918." Again, the beauty of the rivalry is that Boston always came oh so close but was never able to grab the crown. Their sincere passion to say "wait till next year" was as sincere as our "1918" chants. Now, that extra passion is gone. And even on years when the Yankees stunk (very late 80's/early 90's), we were still able to do the 1918 thing. Because even if we couldn't be champions, at least they weren't either!
<br />
<br />The streak/curse is over. Anyone who says Boston winning it all will "fuel" the rivalry is trying to put a spin on things that is just pure fabrication. It was "The Curse of the Bambino" that made this thing extra special. There will no longer be any talk of our "ghosts" or "mystique & aura" and no subplots of Bucky or Boone. It will just be two teams meeting and the better team winning and the lesser team losing. It will be purely cosmetic and that little extra juice won't be there anymore. There is also no such thing as the Yankees getting "revenge" and coming back hungrier next year. What revenge? Overall, we still have 26 titles to their 1 since 1918. But them winning just once will be felt forever, no matter how many more we win. 
<br />
<br />2004 will be forever known as the worst year in Yankee history. There is no real way to get over this, we as Yankee fans must try to somehow cope with this horrible reality and try and move on. There is no other way. There is no other choice. I don't care what anyone says, Boston winning the World Series is the worst thing that could have happened to this rivalry and to baseball in general. Next year is going to be a long, hard year and when these two teams meet again, it's just going to be weird and uncomfortable, and just not what it used to be. Even if we rattle off three World Series in a row, the sting will still be felt for 2004 as being the year of the Red Sox. I just want to forget this year ever happened. But it's going to take a long time. 
<br />
<br />I always thought to myself that if I was given a choice by God where I'd be told that I'd be unable to watch another Yankee World Series victory parade for the rest of my life in exchange for knowing that the Red Sox would never win it all in my lifetime, I would take it. I've already seen the Yankees win it in my lifetime more times than the Mets have ever won it. At times, you may feel bad for the poor Mets or even laugh at them. They are like our little sisters. Heck, they are from New York like us, so no Yankee fan should ever despise them as much as those dirty "Sawx." I'm not a Mets fan and could care less what they do, and I'm a Red Sox hater, but yet I care what they do. I care that they lose. They must always lose. But they didn't lose in 2004.
<br />
<br />The Red Sox are our bitter rivals and rivals do not deserve to ever win a battle. But they did. I always believed that Boston should finish in last place every year and we should destroy them every chance we get. But again, that didn't always happen and more often than not, they were that troublesome pest that always TRIED to beat us, creeping behind in second place. But not anymore. 
<br />
<br />I know that the Yankees as a whole are in complete devastation right now. I'm sure The Boss went into his rage of anger when the Yanks lost the ALCS but now, I'm sure he's in utter shock and disbelief, on the verge of a heart attack. That's how serious it is now that the Red Sox won a World Series. From the Yankees minor leagues on up, it is imbedded into a player's skull to BEAT THE RED SOX and HATE THE RED SOX. I'm sure that lesson will still be taught, but this rivalry will just never be the same again.
<br />
<br />The Yankee apocalypse of 2004 will forever be remembered just as clearly as the 26 World Championships and 86 years of dominance over Boston. </span>

                    <span>USA TODAY SPORTS WEEKLY, <br> <br>As the Yankees and Red Sox gear up for more head-to-head battles this summer, zealots on both sides of the rivalry are well-served in this newest tribute to baseball's fiercest feud. The Frommers cover the hostilities from every angle imaginable, giving readers just about all they'll need to know as they settle in for upcoming bouts in 2004. The fun begins with a timeline of the major events that have enlivened the century-long competition, then turns to a comprehensive review of last season's epic playoff series. After a look at the roller-coaster ride of the storied 1978 AL East pennant race, the books follows with chapters on the rivalry's origins, the clashing cultures of the cites, a comparison between the hometown ballparks and capsule summaries of the most significant games. There's even an entire segment devoted to the various virtues of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio and their roles in the ongoing antagonism. Capping off the retrospectives is an open forum from both New York and Boston advocates. Politicians, sportswriters, entertainers, ordinary fans and the players themselves offer barbed , even witty viewpoints about the rivakly. Their caustic comments should provide more than enough combustion to fire up the Yankee and Sox faithful for this year's remaining games. - -</span>

                    <span>BOY OF SUMMER.COM/<br>As a Yankee fan myself, there are few endeavors more satisfying than reading about the histories of my favorite team, its closest rival, and their competition with each other. This book was and is a pleasere for me to read. Its pages are filled with stories of Yankees and Red Sox games and series, players and trades, fans and fights, quips and quotes, playoff wins and losses, heartbreak and joy for both teams. OK, so mostly heartbreak for the Red Sox. The Frommers start the book with a timeline that starts with the birth of Babe Ruth in 1895 and ends with the acquisition of Curt Schilling by the Red Sox in November of 2004. The book then provides an entire chapter on the Red Sox and Yankees rivalry as it was played out in the 2004 playoffs, which, while incredible to watch, somehow was not nearly as exciting to read about only a few months later. The chapter, however, like the rest of the book, is well writen, interesting in its own right, and very readable. I expect that ten or twenty years from now, I shall be able to pick up this book and find it an excellent resource as I recount my own memories of that exciting seven-game series to my own children or (God help you) yours. The book, like the rivalry it recalls, will stand the test of time, I expect. I know this because the very next chapter focuses especially on the 1978 season, and it is a great read. The Yankees and Red Sox were both vying for the AL East title and were forced to play a one-game playoff to win it, which the Yanks did, even though they had been down as much as 14 games in the standings as late as July 18th. From that huge deficit, to Reggie getting benched for dogging it, to Billy Martin getting canned to Ron Guidry's 25-3 record to Bucky-Effing-Dent, there is no dull paragraph in the chapter. Harvey and or Frederic Frommer could have made a great living as a beat writer, had they not gone into slightly more prestigious careers as an Ivy League professor and a political journalist, respectively. Moving on through the book, the Frommers spend chapters focusing on the general histories of the teams, the cultures and moods cultivated by the Rivalry, the merits and limitations of the respective ballparks, special games between the two clubs, a collection of quotes from various players, fans ad others, and list of statistics and trivia about the two teams. They even devote an entire chapter to perhaps the greatest rivalry between players on these two fabled teams, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Frankly, this is one area in which I think the Red Sox have a decided advantage, though I doubt if many of my fellow Yankee fans would back me up on this. As you may have deduced, the Red Sox don't have many advantages in this rivalry, and therefore I would venture a guess that this book doesn't offer nearly as much for them as it does for Yankees fans. In fact, the title, 'Red Sox vs. Yankees', is about the only time that Boston has gotten first billing in this struggle for the last three quarters of a century. Personally, I can't imagine being very excited about spending hours on end reading about the myriad disappointments and seemingly endless heartbreak associated with my chosen team, thankyouverymuch. But maybe that's just me. Regardless of your particular bent, Red Sox vs. Yankees is still a very well-done book. As a coffee-table book, it offers large, whole-panel pictures, many of them in vibrant color, to appease the eye, and solid writing to appease the mind. And even the price is right!</span>
