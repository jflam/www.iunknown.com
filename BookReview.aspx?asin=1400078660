                <span id="Label1">At the end of <I>Virtually Normal</I>, Andrew Sullivan called for the legalization of gay and lesbian marriages as a recognition of an individual's right to enter into a committed relationship with the person he or she loves. <I>Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con</I> is, as the title suggests, a collection of arguments for and against such unions. Sullivan provides little commentary, allowing the various authors gathered here to speak for themselves. No matter which side one supports on this issue, this anthology will enable both an intellectual support of one's own beliefs and a better, fuller understanding of the contrary position.</span>

                    <span>I can't stand Sullivan's right-wing political views, but I commend him on his pro-gay marriage position. The homophobes out there have never been able to answer this question: Why shouldn't I be gay? What, in other words, is wrong exactly with being gay? I'm an atheist, so shallow religious rantings aren't going to work with me. I love being a gay man and I wouldn't want it any other way. I have a great life AS a gay man and I couldn't imagine "going straight" without, at the same time, being totally miserable. But the point is, gay men not only have the right to be gay, but should be proud of the fact that they are gay. All straight people have is their absurd fundamentalist ideology. To an atheist, their hateful rhetoric means absolutely nothing. The straight people are going to have come up with a better line of argument than something about my not being "saved" or whatever. But that's not very likely.</span>

                    <span>I love Andrew's blog but I respectfully differ with his views on gay marriage. He fails to recognize that it isn't only Christians who oppose gay marriage and he fails to debunk the best idea for traditional marriage, linking kids to their parents.</span>

                    <span>The book is indeed well-balanced, and comprehensive (considering the dearth of information and research on this subject and its relatively recent rise to a prominent place in public discussion). Highly recommended for anyone seeking greater understanding of this issue. <p>It is best used as a resource, rather than read straight through. The arguments presented often get bogged down in wordy legal and political jargon. Not that there isn't a place for such books; I just wish it were more accessible for the average person, so I could give a copy to my grandparents to read, for example.</span>

                    <span>A great collection of arguments both for and against Same-sex marriage.  Although the author admits his bias (pro) and includes many of his own arguments and essays, the book is really rather evenly done.  I suspect that most people will not be swayed either way because there is plenty of  reinforcement for both sides.  This is a book I would like to have in my  library.</span>

                    <span>Sullivan has put together a definitive compilation of pro-and-con-arguments over the issue of same-sex marriage--one which demands reading by both sides in the debate.  It should not, however,  simply and blindly be used to bolster one's own position on the issue.  Use  this reader to learn why the opposition feels the way they feel and  believes what they believe.  Understanding the intensity of and reasoning  behind these positions will doubtless improve the intellectual quality of  the debate on both sides (a point our friend from the Heritage Foundation  [below] and his ilk miss entirely).</span>
