                <span id="Label1">Good software starts with a good design, and the subtitle of <I>Applying UML and Patterns</I>, "An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/D) and the Unified Process" reinforces that that's what this book is about.<p>  The first edition of <I>Applying UML and Patterns</I> became a standard. The second edition uses the unified process (UP) as the iterative process within which OOA/D is introduced, and extends the case study used in the first edition. Other changes have been made to reflect the growing consensus on the most effective ways to work with OOA/D and patterns.<p>  Although you will learn UML, this isn't what <I>Applying UML and Patterns</I> is all about. It's designed to teach you to think of software as a collection of objects with properties and to manipulate the relationships between them. This is far more profound.<p>  The case study enables Craig Larman to carry the design through to Java code. In practice, you will need a basic understanding of OO programming to benefit from <I>Applying UML and Patterns</I>, though you needn't know Java--you can implement the designs in the OO language of your choice with equal facility.<p>  When it comes right down to it, <I>Applying UML and Patterns</I> is all about providing you with a language in which to think about software design. This is quite different from learning a language in which to code a design.<p>  A facility with OOA/D will enable you to design and discuss programs independent of code, to produce more elegant and maintainable software, and to take a 30,000-foot view of the way your software interacts with the world. In effect, it can shift your viewpoint from that of a mechanic to that more sophisticated viewpoint of an engineer. Recommended. <I>--Steve Patient. Amazon.co.uk</I> </span>

                    <span>It is easy to run out of space just by listing the topics introduced in this book, nevertheless here are some of them: OO fundamentals, UML 1.4, design patterns, Unified Process, domain modelling, mapping of design-to-code (Java), architectural analysis, framework design and the list goes on... The content is organised in 6 parts, including a total of 36 chapters spread over 600+ pages. Long book, many topics... If you are after a quick or thorough description of a single topic then naturally this is not the right reading.<P>The core offering of the book is the middle 4 parts that describe the analysis & design of the case study (a POS system). We are taken through the inception and 3 iterations of the elaboration phase of the UP. It is almost minimalist-UP, as the emphasis is on just doing what is necessary and not creating text/ diagrams for documentation purposes only; the code is the ultimate real model. Naturally, use-case driven, iterative and incremental development is highlighted. In addition, during the OOAD, we are taught how to harness the UML and not only shown the notation and elements that it contains. A good number of patterns are described, again while being applied to the case study, from the GRASP (essential if your background is not OO) to the GoF patterns and many others. The title and subtitle of the book are definitely justified.<P>The author explains all techniques very well and provides precise definitions and examples that hit the spot. In fact, every decision taken when designing for the case study builds on notions previously introduced, thus demystifying OO design; Craig Larman proves it to be a science and not art or magic. Furthermore, numerous references are given for the principles illustrated as well as pointers for further reading (which sometimes are needed given the introductory nature of the writing).<P>In reality, few developers are completely agnostic to all the topics covered in this book (and if they are, then it is the perfect read). Hence, given the intertwined exploration of all areas, few readers are going to avoid reading about material they already know. Following from the previous point, it is natural that the book does not serve as the best of reference titles; although its well-organised index, glossary and in-cover tables/ diagrams do help. In any case, this excellent book would make an ideal university course book.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book greatly. It provided me with a solid understanding of how to work with UML and OOA/D. It not only covers the basics of UML but brings the reader through the process of creating software, using a persistent example throughout the book. It helped improve my knowledge of object oriented design and overall software engineering skill.<P>I found the book clear and easy to understand. Additionally I found the examples very helpful in showing me exactly what needs to go into a certain UML artifact. <P>The discussions on the GRASP design patterns and GoF design patterns were both very thorough and helpful and opened my mind to new ways of handling various software problems.<P>The one problem I had with this book is the occasional instance in which the author contradicts himself.<P>Overall an excellent book and I would recommend it to any future software engineer.</span>

                    <span>This book nearly defies description in terms of the breath and depth of material it covers (and covers very well). In addition to OOA/D, you get essential and detailed information on Use Cases, Requirements gathering, UML, Design Patterns, and Iterative/Agile Development, as well as insights into Test Driven Development.<P>And the best part: all of this information is carefully integrated so you really get a deep feeling for the multitude of skills it takes to be a software developer/architect in the 21st century.<P>No book is a substitute for real world experience coupled with in depth instruction and mentoring, but this book comes as close as humanly possible to achieving those lofty goals without leaving your easy chair/workstation.<P>Most in-depth books leave me with a headache - you get the gist, and then the brick wall goes up when you get to the details. Mr. Larman slowly and steadily gets you into the details without ever over simplifying, yet without sacrificing the "meat"<P>Bravo!</span>

                    <span>I am in agreement with some of the observations made in the 1-out-of-5 review by wiredweird. However, I am inclined <BR>to rate this book a 5 out of 5. <P>There are a lot of books out there that talk about O-O but stop at inane and condescending examples that limits <BR>what knowledge, if any, you could get from the books. On the other side of the spectrum, you have outstanding <BR>books like "Design Patterns" that might be a little hard to follow for people like, for instance, me. The uniqueness <BR>of this book by Craig Larman is that it effectively bridges the yawning gap between the O-O for idiots approach and <BR>the O-O for experts approach. Granted that Mr. Larman seems to be calling "Principles" as "Patterns" -- it is kind of a <BR>stretch to call "Polymorphism" a pattern, but nomenclature aside, the emphasis is rightly on general principles that <BR>prevade patterns of design. Larman might have stretched the limits of UML notation here and there -- but it is <BR>almost always to emphasize an idea. <P>The main portion of the book deals with a case study involving a POS system -- good choice, a POS system is something <BR>we are all familiar with and it offers a lot of possiblities to show the application of design principles and patterns. <BR>Its possible that this is not the best book to teach (or to learn) O-O design -- but I havent come across one that is better. <P>An irritant i have with this book is the quality of the paper used -- it reflects light making it a strain to <BR>read it under fluorescent light. Maybe they will fix it in the next edition so that the reader is the only one doing the <BR>reflecting.</span>
