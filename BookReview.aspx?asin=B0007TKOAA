                    <span>This movie is the funniest I've seen in some time.  The performances and writing are first rate.  The movie is not about wine, but about the characters and their weeklong journey and experiences while in wine country.  I thought it was anything but boring.  The dialogue and situations throughout more than make up for the lack of shootouts and explosions.  While many seem to have trouble with the characters lack of ethical behavior, this is not a reason to run down the film.  Would they prefer any other film where not all characters are perfect?</span>

                    <span>I feel Amazon should put the 5 star reviews, outnumbered by lower ratings, at the bottom of the list.  This film, so wonderfully reviewed was a sordid and unfunny waste of money at the cinema.  Let's face it American filmakers cannot pullof the subtle stories as the Europeans do.  It was a try hard and failed.</span>

                    <span>People are either in love with this movie or completely hate it.  I'm somewhere in the middle as I had heard nothing but phenomenal reviews for it.  I was shocked at how much it wasn't a comedy and moreso a drama about two men trying to figure out 1)meaning of life 2) their place in it 3)neither one wanting to accept the realities of life.  I think people relate to this movie because they suffer the same three things above and somehow feel that this movie makes it that much better for them.  From an entertainment perspective it was ok at best.</span>

                    <span>This is the most pretentious, un-funny so-called 'comedy' I've ever seen!!  The only time I even laughed (snickered, actually...not even a chuckle) was when they were trying to ram the car into the tree.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, when Miles went into his pompous-ass wine review mode, I just sat there in silence, shrugging my shoulders with my eyes just glazed over and thinking to myself "huh..?!?".
<br />
<br />Also, how many scenes were there where Miles drank enough to kill an elephant (on top of his Xanax, nonetheless) and got behind the wheel without a second thought?  Nice message.</span>
