                    <span>I'm not really a student of military tactics, so I can't judge this work on those merits.  From what I understand from the other reviews, and from the ravings of enthusiasts that I have heard, this book is one of the more important books covering the topic.  This particular edition was interesting to me because there were a few examples of various applications of Sun Tzu's writings in actual battles from Stonewall Jackson to Hannibal given in the form of notes (I assume by Giles).  Since I am more interested in historical events, than in strategy, this helped me understand the fine prose of the writer, even if I am not quite able to apply any of his "art" to my everyday life.  I'm certain that a student of strategy would appreciate this work, as would people who are interested in Chinese history.  I fail to see how it could be applicable to a corporate environment, but once again, that's not really my forte.  I did love the concise method of the author, the easy to follow philosophies intertwined with the codified systems, and the colorful grace in which the subject was handled.  The Introduction to this edition was also most insightful, and gives the reader an idea of what kind of man the author was.</span>

                    <span>It is interesting to note that all of the readers see this as a text on war, and how to beat your enemies.  The first part of the book should be a leson to all of the war-mongers out there, that is If You Go To War You Have Already Lost.  The consequences to your own people and soldiers and even the land must be counted for years after the battle is done.  Sun-Tzu explains this well, and proceeds to explain how to wage a war causing the minimum amount of damage and suffering.</span>

                    <span>This edition of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" (by Sunzi, et al) is the classic translation by Lionel Giles.  For the price, it is a great buy, but it is not the complete Giles translation.  In the full work, throughout the text, Giles included commentary by various ancient writers as well as his own explanations and clarifications of Sun Tzu's statements.  
<br />
<br />Lionel Giles was a curator of the British Museum, in charge of Oriental printed Books and Manuscripts.  In that position, he was the world's leading authority on ancient Chinese writing, having read and analyzed more material than perhaps anyone who ever lived. Not including Giles's commentary makes this a rather bare-bones book, or actually a booklet.  This volume does, however, overcome the major objection to Giles' annotated work which was that the commentary tended to muddle the flow of Sun Tzu's expression.  By stripping away the commentary, it leaves a text so clean that it is almost poetry.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately this almost poetic monologue can be interpreted to mean almost anything the reader wishes it to mean.  To more nearly understand what Sun Tzu was attempting with his essay requires the kind of in-depth scholarship that Giles included in the original imbedded commentary.  Without the accompanying detailed explanations, the bare translation is very limited.
<br />
<br />To overcome both objections to the various editions of "The Art of War" you should consider also buying a second copy of the Giles translation that contains the complete commentary.  Another alternative would be to get the 2005 edition that contains both versions in one volume: "The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Special Edition."</span>

                    <span>This is worth reading for historical value.
<br />
<br />This particular book has a lengthy introduction that focuses on the history of Chinese warfare, and actually takes up most of the book.
<br />
<br />This is a 99 page book, and the Sun Tzu's text is actually only in pages 40-99.  The rest is the introduction that I mentioned.
<br />
<br />The introduction is very mediocre.  It reminds me of if you were to type "Chinese Warfare" into google, and read the first page that comes up.  It's probably going to be good, but you're probably better off buying an actual book about it.
<br />
<br />This book is short enough that you can read the 40 pages of text just going to the library.  I wouldn't buy it unless you really want to study it.
<br />
<br />I bought this book because I heard that it has applications to business.  There really aren't any direct applications to business.  This is a book written to a general of a Chinese army on how to win a battle.
<br />
<br />I'm sure that you can draw inferences to anything from business to scrapbooking, out of it, though.  For me, all I think it did was improve my Age of Empires game.</span>

                    <span>The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction.  It's a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars (and business). It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles. 
<br />
<br />The heart of Sun Tzu's thought is "All warfare is based on deception. Thus, when able to attack, we must seem unable. Hold out bait to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant." 
<br />
<br />Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isn't. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagon's Star Wars proposal. No one knew if it would work. But if it had, there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it. They didn't have the computer systems, and because of their closed society they didn't have the young kid genius programmers that we've developed in this country. Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country, it ended the cold war without a shot being fired.</span>
