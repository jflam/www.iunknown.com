                <span id="Label1">"There are photographers, and then there is Murray Garrett. He has a magic eye or a secret device in his camera that captures something different, something special that is missed by other photographers." <br>-Bob Hope  <P>This collection of rare photographs from Hollywood's Golden Era-including never-before-seen shots of Marilyn Monroe, Gary Cooper, Frank Sinatra, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, and other legendary stars-showcases 150 of the best pictures taken by photojournalist Murray Garrett when he was on assignment in Hollywood from 1946 to the 1970s. Some of these shots ran at the time in LIFE, Time, and other national magazines; many are published here for the first time.  <P>From a rare shot of Marlon Brando at home snuggling with his cat to a heartwarming photo of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall whispering together at a party, these remarkable pictures, together with Murray Garrett's own comments and reminiscences, give readers a unique behind-the-scenes glimpse of Hollywood in its heyday.  <P>MURRAY GARRETT was a professional photographer specializing in show business, first in New York in the early 1940s, then in Hollywood from 1946 until the early 1970s. He was sent on assignment by the best news magazines, including LIFE, Time, and Look, and also worked privately for many directors, film executives, and stars. Now retired, he lives in Sherman Oaks, California.  <P>150 duotone photographs, 9 x 113/4"</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful compilation of photographs and text taken throughout the years by Murray Garrett. All of the Hollywood golden age stars are featured: Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons, Natalie Wood, Ava Gardner. The photos catch the personal side of the stars, such as the photo of Richard Burton strapped into an airline seat along with his daughter's doll, as well as their entrances into glamourous events. He also adds his personal recollections such as Ava Gardner's love of jokes, off color or not, Eve Arden's love of her daughter, the secrecy of Natalie Wood's 21st birthday party. The stories are fascinating. The pictures are beautiful and unique. I am glad Murray decided to share them with us.</span>

                    <span>It's amazing that the following mistakes appear in this book:<P>1) A reference to Cecil B. DeMille's "Sunset Boulevard".<BR> It's Billy Wilder's and Leigh Brackett's picture. DeMille had<BR> a cameo in it.<P>2) Donna Douglas (of "Beverly Hillbillies" fame) is referred to<BR> in a caption as "Donna Dixon" and in the accompanying text as<BR> "Joey Heatherton".<P>3) Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, in English riding clothes,<BR> are described as wearing "Western gear".<P>4) Sammy Davis Jr's ex-wife, Mai Britt, is twice referred to as<BR> "May Britt".<P>Did anybody edit this book, or were Garrett's reminiscences taken<BR>on faith because he, of all people, should know?</span>

                    <span>I have had the priveledge of knowing Murray Garrett for over 25 years as a business associate and friend. I was completely blown away by his incredible talent as a photographer and writer. This book captures a Hollywood that I remember as my home town and really was the entertainment capitol of the world. The pictures are unique, and definitely candid. Murray's comments about the stars shed new insights into the personalities and quirks of some of the most loved and famous celebrities of the era. A beautiful collection of memorys from a man who approaches Hollywood from an honest, compasionate and humorous point of view. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I had the privilege of seeing much of this book in pre-press form and knew it had to be a knockout. The pics are all exceptional but Murray's anecdotes and insight make this much more than a celebrity puff-piece. The finished book is even better than my early predictions. Great stuff!!!</span>
