                <span id="Label1">Here's a hard fact of golf life: despite the technological improvements in golf equipment and the billions of dollars spent on that gear, the average golfer is still as bad as he or she was 15 years ago. Bob Rotella, sports psychologist and author of <i>Golf Is Not a Game of  Perfect</i> and <i>Golf Is a Game of Confidence</i>, knows what the problem is: commitment. Once a player commits himself to doing better, and does what it takes to achieve that goal, he or she will improve. Rotella's plan for making and following through on that commitment is an excellent one. He says very clearly, and right at the beginning of the book, that his plan isn't for someone who plays golf once a month for pleasure. This is for hard-core dimpleheads, male or female, and it's a serious, extremely workable program. </span>

                    <span>Hits: <BR>This book is a good read for beginners. Wonderful advice on finding the right instructor and the importance of lessons. There are good examples to support his reasoning. <P>Misses:<BR>Some of the chapters appeared redundent, as some of the points from one chapter seemed to be carried into another. Some of the chapters were rather boring because of this, and the book lacked the flow that I was looking for from subject to subject. While it does offer some good advice for beginning/novice golfers, I found it to be of no significant help to more accomplished players. Maybe after reading arguably the greatest golfing book he's ever written, "Golf is a Game of Perfect", I was expecting more.</span>

                    <span>Naive in my opinion some of reviews. Everyone knows at some point to play better it takes a swing coach. But not everyone knows how to interview and pick out the best for you. This book shows us how.<P>Also, not everyone knows the mental games we have to win about practice, practice, practice in order to raise our games. If it was so simple and easy, as the Doc critiques, why don't most golfers improve then?<P>I've made great strides in past nine years, and still pushing handicap down. This stuff is what it takes. Doc is the best!</span>

                    <span>Little contained in this book not already known by serious golfer or athlete. Chapters about choosing a pro and sticking with the pro over years took many pages to describe something that is mostly common sense. On the other hand, advice about commitment to an improvement program, the improvement cycle, value of a systematic approach and the time needed to make significant improvement rang true. I'll see over the years what sticks.</span>

                    <span>I have read all three of Dr. Rotella's books: 'Golf is Not a Game of perfect', 'Golf is a Game of Confidence', and this piece 'The Golf of Your Dreams'. If you have read 'Golf is Not a Game of Perfect' you will not get much more insight into the mental aspect of the game in this book. Although some material is repeated here it definately is not a complete rehash of his other books. However, the book can be summed up to: find a golf pro, and commit to a practice schedule. That's pretty much it.<P>Now the reason this book gets three stars is because there is something about Dr. Rotella that is very motivational. The things he discusses make you believe that you can get better, that you are capable of playing 'the golf of your dreams'. And I don't doubt that you are. But if you are a very self motivated person, just find a reliable pro, promise to practice consistently, and you'll be on your way. But, if you are like me, and always need a little push in the right direction from someone who knows how to say things in the right way, then pick this book up. It might not be his best work, but it's worth the money if you're willing to put in the time.</span>

                    <span>Throw out all the magazines and tips books you have bought andcommit yourself to really changing, that is the message of this bookand it will tell you exactly how to go about it. I love to listen to Dr. Bob in the car when traveling to the range or golf course because he will put you in the mind to play golf or focus you on your game improvement needs. I rate the tape highly because I needed the information and have improved my game because I followed some of the advice given on the tape. It was the best money I have spent on Golf Improvement in a long time. END</span>
