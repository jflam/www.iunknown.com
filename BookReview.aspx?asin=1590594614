                    <span>I'm about 1/2 way through my second reading (no small task - this is a big book) and I can't say enough good about it.  If you're a J2EE architect without any exposure to IoC/DI, this title will open up a whole new way of thinking about application architecture for you.  If you already have Spring experience or are already working with Hibernate, iBatis, JDO, JMS or the other staples of enterprise development, you'll still learn a lot from the book (I had a year of intensive prior experience and I'm gaining a lot from each chapter).</span>

                    <span>When I cracked open the first book dedicated solely to the Spring framework, I expected a rush job. After all, the book covers Spring 1.2, which hasn't been out there all that long. I was pleasantly surprised. It's tough for a book this fat to be this timely. But it is.
<br />
<br />Let me start with what I liked the most about the book.
<br />
<br />- The authors start with examples that don't use dependency injection at all. They refactor those exmaples, so you can see the value of the core design pattern supported by Spring. This, in my view, was nicely done. It's critical.
<br />
<br />- The authors treat each topic completely before moving on to the next. For example, for the base container, they walk through the edge cases, like method injection and introduction, and explain the core problem that they solve. As  early contributors of Spring, the authors were well positioned to do this.
<br />
<br />- The example is simple. I think that there's been too much of a movement to building real business applications in books. These treatments quickly bog down into details, and distract from the topics that they're trying to cover.
<br />
<br />- The sense of humor is there, and it's not overdone. I like having the obscenity filters as an AOP example. (I just wish that the book found some way to include a logging example...or not.)
<br />
<br />- The book is comprehensive. It covers the core subjects of DI, AOP, persistence, messaging and remoting, but also some edge scenarios like mail, scheduling, and the like.
<br />
<br />It's tough to find a down side, but if I had to pick, I'd say that the language bogs down at some points. This, in my opinion, falls on the editors, and not the authors. I do think that the order of the topics was a bit strange, like introducing AOP before establishing a need.
<br />
<br />But I'm picking here. This book is very well done, and I'm glad I got it. I would definitely buy it again.</span>

                    <span>After reading way too many docs about way too many web view technologies, I found Spring which was exactly what I was looking for to help me with the middle and back-end tiers.  The only problem is that even though everyone says it's so well documented, the documents tend to be either in-depth reference manuals or really simple tutorials that only show one aspect of the framework.
<br />
<br />I was very pleased to find this book, and after reading it, I feel very excited about starting a large spring adventure.
<br />
<br />This book covers just about everything you need to know about Spring to build a full blown app, but more importantly it also shows you where/how to start (which is not so easy to figure out sometimes) and how to implement things in a very reusable way.
<br />
<br />The organization of the book seems strange sometimes... having the huge sometimes confusing section about AOP in the beginning (chapters 6 & 7) really makes your brain spin, but by the time you get to chapter 11 (designing and implementing Spring applications) you can easily put things together and the previous sections make more sense.
<br />
<br />The book takes you through building a blog application as it's main sample app, but all along the way there are many many tiny little code examples that are self-contained and demonstrate how a single concept works.  This *does* work well to make sense of things, but I wish there was a section that only delt with building the sample app from start to finish all in one place.
<br />
<br />Also, after downloading the sample app, I had a few problems running it....  there aren't any configuration instructions, even though you can choose any of 3 data layers, and once I built and deployed it, I found it was missing some jar dependencies.  Once I put them in place, it did run as expected.
<br />
<br />I think that the best thing about this book is probably the way in which it promotes good software design and reuse, even if you're not going to use Spring through the use of the DOM pattern, designing to interfaces, and testing.
<br />
<br />All in all, this is a great book. If you're looking to build an application using Spring, read this book.  It's the best resource for getting started, and will also make a great reference.</span>
