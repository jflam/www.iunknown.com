                    <span>I was using HomeSite long before Macromedia purchased it, but didn't try Dreamweaver until earlier this year, when I downloaded the trial.
<br />
<br />Those who claim Dreamweaver is crash-prone are correct; I see the most crashes in mixed-mode, but the crashes are generally avoidable once you learn to work around them.
<br />
<br />I'm relatively new to CSS, PHP and MySQL, and DreamWeaver has eased my learning curve for these. That alone has been worth the purchase price.  I also appreciate DW's extensibility, and the helpfulness of the DW Community.
<br />
<br />At root, DW is just another text editor, and is friendlier to the coder than the visually inclined. If you're the latter, you may prefer Adobe GoLive.  For me, it's a step closer to visual web development from HomeSite, which I still use and enjoy.</span>

                    <span>I am not sure why some people had trouble with this version. I haven't run across any bugs or problems of any kind. maybe other people hadn't applied the updater or maybe their computer wasn't up to the challenge or maybe I just don't do the same things they do but my experience has been troublefree. I use the program in conjunction with Coldfusion MX 7(also by Macromedia) and the integration work well, too. Maybe if people that talk it down could be more specific rather than just saying "it's buggy" I could test out their issues and see if I can duplicate their problems</span>

                    <span>This is a note that I wrote after reading a number of reviews of the newest version of Dreamweaver, MX 2004. I am trying to choose an application for a site that I hope to build in the near future. I have read a lot of reviews on Amazon and on specialist forums about Dreamweaver, and realize that the newest version still needs to have some of the bugs stamped out of it. It is for this reason that I originally gave it only three stars. And I cannot attest to the correspondence between the trial version I have used, and the real version that seems to have caused a bit of consternation among more experienced users.
<br />
<br />However, I was so impressed by what one of the reviewers has done with Dreamweaver, and how incredibly interesting the end product he has created is, that I changed the rating to four stars. I also felt I had to bring everybody's attention to the reviewer and his site. The reviewer is named Antonio Rubiera (I hope I spelled his name correctly)and his site is named in his review. It is one of the most interesting sites I have seen in a long time. He is to be congratulated for this work of art. I assume that Dreamweaver has to get some of the credit, too, so I think I will give it a try. </span>

                    <span>I first developed my web site using Yahoo Sitebuilder, and when I reached 300 pages or so, I began migrating to Dreamweaver MX 2004. The installation is simple (on XP Professional SP2). This software is very easy to use and runs very fast on my 512 MB desktop. The tables resize easily as add or delete images of various sizes. The templates are very handy. My web site (www.somestamps.com) is based on showing thousands of stamp images. Dreamweaver has enabled me to work faster and to design a web site that looks very professional.</span>
