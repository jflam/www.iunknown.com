                    <span>Although I'm not really into "art" quilts, this book is totally awesome!  The quilts are beautiful, and Ricky's hilarious writing style is worth the price of admission alone.  The techniques are thoroughly explained, and detailed photos accompany each step.  I was amazed at what you can accomplish with one small piece of fabric!  I have over 500 quilting books, and this is one of my favorites.  You definitely won't regret buying this one!</span>

                    <span>This is a fabulous book. The results of each quilt is a surprise.  It is now my favorite type of quilt to explore.  Every quilter should try this technique at least once.  The book is easy and Ricky is very specific on the areas where you need to be casual and then areas that are to be very specific.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT!.  For the new and experienced quilter.  Batiks are perfect for this style.  </span>

                    <span>This is one of the most fascinating books I've read on quilting and stitchery!!!  It covers everything from the architectural aspect along with the mathematical.  I have only been quilting for the past year and a half; and being self-taught,this book is phenomenal if you are looking for something totally strange and unusual!!!  It's pretty easy to follow - but you have to pay attention to details!!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is eye candy.  The technique is fun, fast, exciting, and easy to do as long as you are paying attention.  It is also forgiving if you make a wrong cut.</span>

                    <span>I know Ricky and have studied with him for several years.  This book brings his orginal Harmonic Convergence technique to any quilter.  His instructions are clear and concise, and he offers many alternatives to the orginal pattern.<p>The first joy of the book are his telling of his own story, including the devastation of a tornado on his home town.  He chronicles his life in music and how that translated to his magnificent quilting.  He brings his Granny alive to the reader, just as he does in classes.  The second joy is the display of full color quilts constructed by his students from across the country.  It was amazing to read the names and home towns because I've met so many of them through Ricky's classes.<p>I have never read a quilting book from cover to cover.... but this one I did... and will again.... I honor him as a friend and mentor!  And wait til you see his DVD's of techniques!</span>
