                    <span>This is a great contribution to understanding the .Net framework. I would have liked for Jeff to have included a "Best Practices" or "List of Recommendations" based on his many findings. There's so much content to remember, that it will be hard to use it as a reference if his recommendation isn't in the section/chapter you think.<br>  The Summary Info could be a download or an appendix.  Just a thought.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Richter has an incredible mastery of the elements of the .NET Framework.  As others have observed, Microsoft development teams could indeed benefit from reading the book.  (In fact, there are several instances in which Mr. Richter critiques the implementation that Microsoft has provided and offers his recommendation on how it could be improved.)  Unfortunately, you would have to be a member of a Microsoft development team to have enough grounding in the concepts presented here to benefit from Mr. Richter's expertise.  What it comes down to is there's a difference between presenting material and providing the tools that enable a learning experience to occur.</span>

                    <span>I recently placed an order for the book.  The listing for the book says it usually ships in 1 to 2 days.  Once I place the order, I could see that the book would not SHIP for 1.5 weeks!  Now I would consider canceling the order, but I can't because it has entered the shipping process.  There is still a week before it ships.</span>

                    <span>This book is an exhaustive reference for VB Programmer wanting to learn .NET Frameowork. Whether you're just beginning to learn programming or you're experienced, this book will get you wherever you want to go. Richter have done a marvelous job creating a book that gives you what you need. If you're experienced in VB.NET this book is a great one that will show you what you need to know about .NET Framework. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to beginning VB programmers, as well as seasoned VB programmers looking to learn VB.Net.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book if you are serious on becoming an .NET expert. This book shows the right direction and clarifies the .NET Framework. If you are experienced with VB.NET, then this book is more useful. I am an experienced VB.NET/COM professional . This book helped me to master the overall .NET Framework. I recommend this book to all VB.NET programmers.</span>
