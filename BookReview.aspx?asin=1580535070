                    <span>This is a pretty good overview.  I wonder if the editors were lazy in this fast moving field?  Although the publication date of the second edition is 2003 it seems much of the information was collected in 2001.</span>

                    <span>This book covers a general overview of 3G wireless communication systems. Content is rich and covers many concepts. Some chapters could be more detailed and some chapters gives a feeling like reading a summarized version of 3GPP specs. There is not much maths in the book and it is easy to understand both by managers, engineers and marketing guys. Diagrams are nice and text is in plain English. What is particularly good is the chapter on signaling procedures. This book is perhaps as good as Heiki Kaaranen's book. Warmly recommended.</span>

                    <span>as the author puts, this is a good introduction to 3GPP technical papers.<br>the author tried to organize and he succeeds most but chapters 2 to 7 denied his efforts.<br>these chapters are very intertwined and you may get a good map to browse thru 1st pages of these chapters after finished chapter 1.<br>the original papers sometimes give better illustrations, so you are strongly encourged to download from the 3GPP ftp site according to the author.<br>i recommend to begin with the following 3GPP documents:<br>(1)TR 25.990 Vocabulary<br>(2)simple-3GPP-Spec-Status.xls<br>and non-3GPP ones:<br>(3)[URL]<br>(4)[URL]<br>(5)[URL]<p>it's a book of the state of the art.<br>buy now!</span>

                    <span>This book is a systematic look at 3G's component parts and underlying technologies.  It is not an engineering text in that there are no formulae or engineering details with respect to signalling, capacity or performance (even though network planning considerations are addressed).<p>It dissects 3G, starting with principles to provide an anchor.  <p>The table of contents shows the progression in which the author deals with 3G as a collection of components, principles and protocols: Principles of Division Multiple Access, WCDMA Air Interface: Physical Layer, Modulation Techniques and Spread Spectrum, Spreading Codes, Channel Coding, WCDMA Air Interface: Protocol Stack. Network, Network Planning, Network Management, Procedures, New Concepts in the UMTS Network, 3G Services, and 3G Applications.<p>Because of the technical nature of this book and the level of detail given, it's best suited for readers who are familiar with the technical underpinnings of TDMA, CDMA or GSM.  The writing is clear and augmented by numerous illustrations, and each chapter ends with a list of references. The references are a strong point about this book because they are up-to-date and include books, papers and URLs. <p>If you are looking for engineering details this is the wrong book. If you have a background in related technologies and want to quickly get up-to-speed in 3G this is an excellent resource.</span>
