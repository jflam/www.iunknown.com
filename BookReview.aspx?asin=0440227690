                <span id="Label1">Eighteen-year-old Francis Cassavant has returned from World War II an unwilling hero. Although he can still see and hear, a grenade has blown away his nose, his ears, his teeth, and his cheeks, leaving him faceless.  Hiding his ghastly wounds with bandages and a white silk scarf, Francis welcomes the anonymity his mutilation brings him, for he has returned to his hometown with a secret mission--a plot for revenge (against his enemy Larry LaSalle) that he values more than his own life. Francis's eerily matter-of-fact acceptance of his hideous mien, along with his sweetness and selflessness, contrast sharply with his obsessive need for vengeance. No one recognizes him as the quiet kid who once loved Nicole Renard and hung out with fellow teens at the Wreck Center. LaSalle, formerly a charismatic youth leader, has also come back from the war a hero, and only Francis knows the dark side of this older man's concern for young people.  But does LaSalle's one evil act wipe out all the good he has done? And is Francis just as guilty because he could have prevented it and didn't? <p>  Robert Cormier--winner of the Margaret A. Edwards Award and many other honors--has once again crafted a riveting yarn of psychological suspense. Francis's story is revealed only gradually in hints that keep the reader guessing. Young teens will find it a quick and absorbing read, and older adolescents (and full-fledged adults, too) will relish pondering the many-sided ethical questions Cormier raises about heroism, guilt, and forgiveness. (Ages 13 to 16) <I>--Patty Campbell</I></span>

                    <span> I like the book heroes.  The book is intresting.  Francis tries to die for his country by stepping on a grenade.  Most of us wouldn't even consider doing this.  The book tells a story that could really happen.  It had a message that people can relate to.  It's a great book.  I like the romance and I would definitely recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I chose this book because I like to read about people who were in the war.<p>Heroes is about a boy and his name is Francis Joseph Cassavant.He's eighteen years old. He has just came back from the world war 2. He has no face because he fell on a gernade. Three days after blowing up his face, Francis retuned  to Frenchtown, his hometown. He had a mission to kill his childhood hero who had been trying to kill the love of Francis's life,and save her.As he tracked down his childhood hero he realized he wasn't a hero.<p>I would personally recommand this book because it has a lot of thrilling action in it.I especially like the part when he went to the club and saw his childhood hero and went after him.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Heroes, by Robert Cormier, is not the best book in the world. Francis Cassavant is a person who doesn't like his life a whole lot. He wants to die but does not want to commit suicide. So he joins the army hoping he will get shot or blown up. In conclusion Francis ends up falling on a grenade. This blows his face off except for his eyes and three caves. Two for his nose and one for his mouth. Since he has lived he is on a mission. To kill his former small town hero. <br>       The theme for this book is bravery because it takes a big deal of guts to jump on a grenade and to try and kill a town hero.<br>       I would not reccomend this book to any one who does not like a book unless it has action/ adventure. Robert Cormier does not stay on the main plot and gets you lost from chapter to chapter. He does not show any attempt to use show action any where through out the whole book.</span>

                    <span>Francis Casavant is an eighteen-year old boy who tells about his life since world war two. Throughout the book you experience the horrors of walking down the streets of French Town with half a face!<br>	Francis goes into a depression after letting his true love down when she needed him the most. He joined the military hoping to bring an end to his life. His chance came when a grenade lands in his platoon's bunker, with no hesitation he dives on the grenade. He saved many lives and even his own! Even after receiving a Silver Star for his heroic effort, Francis is convinced he is not a hero. Now he is on a new mission, to kill the man that destroyed his life!<br>	When I first started reading this novel I was immediately enthralled. The author's style of first person writing makes this book fun, easy to read and understand.  Although the book is small, I feel that it's  descriptive and to the point.</span>

                    <span>Book Review: Heroes<p>	In the book Heroes by Robert Cormier you get stuck to it, because you try to uncover this person's past to find out how his face was blown off.<br>	This book is about a boy named Francis Joseph Cassavant that went to war under age because he had a .. wish [to end his life].  He wanted to [end his life] because his childhood hero Larry LaSalle tried to [harm] the girl he loved and he didn't do anything about it. Then he went to say sorry to the girl and she was mad and refused to talk to him.  So when he was in action he took the opportunity of jumping on an [explosive] to put his life to an end, but he survived without his face and saved the lives of his friends.  Then he came back to Frenchtown to [destroy] Larry with the gun he got for being in the service.  <br>	I think this book has an outstanding story to it.  This story grabs you every second you read it.  To me this book is cool because not a lot of books impress me but this one makes me speechless.  I really recommend you to read this if you like these kind of stories.</span>
