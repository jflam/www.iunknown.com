                    <span>History today is written for entertainment value, either to sell books or lead into a movie deal.  The viewers and readers think they are reading what really happened, when a good deal of the 'interesting' parts were made up and didn't happen -- at least, not in the way they are presented.  We in America are constantly 'revising' our history, leaving out relevant activities and inserting things which didn't take place as promoted.  He admits as much with his diagnosis of a 1959 book, THE FUTURE AS HISTORY:  "I am struck by how much he (Bob Heilbroner) got right, as well as what he missed."  Ommission is as bad as a downright lie or 'error' of judgment, but you can't convince the local newspaper or elderly 'historians' they have made a mistake by leaving something out.
<br />
<br />We can say the same for his umpteen history books.  When Meriwether Lewis' 'suicide' was presented as fact and listed as history by him in UNDAUNTED COURAGE, I could not persuade a local historian how wrong he'd been.  Even though I have been in the actual building there on the Natchez Trace where Lewis died and seen the monument on which the word 'melancholy' was misleading, I still was looked on as not knowing what I was talking about.  When I read that, I too automatically thought 'maybe' it wasn't murder, but all the facts show it definitely was.  'Melancholy' back then wasn't the same as clinical depression today.
<br />
<br />Every one of these nineteen chapters came from his preceding books on the same subjects.  Nothing new was added.   I was interested in the eight pages he devoted to Andrew Jackson, who was not an evil man, as one teacher here in Knoxville teaches her students!
<br />
<br />It goes from the Founding Fathers (Washington and Jefferson) to Nixon's paranoia and resignation as president of the United States.  In between, he touches on U. S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and the war stories about  George Custerand Crazy Horse, the Creek Indians, War in Europe and the Pacific (D-day, 6-6-44 and Normandy (6-7-44 to 5-7-45), and Vietnam.  This took the first 2/3 of this book; the last third was his own opinions on just about everything.  I'm glad he got it out of his system before he died.
<br />
<br />His view on what history professors decided the robber barons had profitted from the TransContinental Railroad was only his opinion.  That book was problematical as to the information being factual, and he was called to task for his interpretations.
<br />
<br />In Founding Fathers, he promoted Joseph Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS, his own UNDAUNTED COURAGE (both of which had historical errors)  and David McCullough's JOHN ADAMS, which Jeff Rollins out in California read in its entirety.  Ambrose was accused of plagiarism and Ellis of distorting facts.
<br />
<br />He touched on racism and slavery, saying that Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and William Clark were all slave owners.  So were a lot of people!  He states that Abraham Lincoln wanted to ship all slaves back to Africa.  "He'd decided that the whole country was guilty of the fact of slavery, not just the South."  How different America would be today had that happened!  He spoke of Washington being 6'3" tall, or was that Abe Lincoln?  Whoever, he writes, "His army lost more battles than it won."  What kind of historian, I ask you, was he anyway?  Distorting facts the way he did, he deserved what he got.</span>

                    <span>For a number of years I have watched Stephen Ambrose on the history channel or PBS discussing a variety of historical characters and events. I found him easy to listen to and very well informed. This is the first of his books I've read and I'm very impressed with how easy it is to read and understand. I also appreciate Ambrose stating that he changed his mind about how he saw certain individuals and events as time passed and he watched, studied, and observed (I miss him dearly).
<br />
<br />"To America" also made me realize the extent to which many history books are biased, not written with an objective view. This is very distressing. I've always believed that history will tell us the truth. Perhaps that's still true, given enough time. 
<br />
<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am grateful to my son-in-law for giving it to me, knowing how much I love history and my country, complete with its flaws.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Ambrose knew how to write history that was accessible, gripping, solid, and pretty much on target.
<br />
<br />He had planned to write a work similiar to "Band of Brothers" and "The Victors" about the Pacific War, when he was told he had terminal cancer. Like U.S. Grant, a man whom Ambrose had written much of and clearly respected, Ambrose faced death not just with courage - but fighting to the end as he wrote this historical love song to America.
<br />
<br />In "To America", Ambrose writes movingly about himself, his family, why he chose to be a Historian,the great American Historians who were his mentors - Hesseltine and T. Harry Williams, how his M.A. thesis - the published biography of the Civil War General Henry Halleck prompted Dwight Eisenhower to call upon Ambrose to edit his papers. Ambrose also writes how he never wanted to write about Richard Nixon, but having done so, found himself respecting, if not liking that complex former President.
<br />
<br />In "To America" Ambrose writes about our major events in a narrative that reads as if he were talking to the American people in their living rooms. He writes how:
<br />
<br />- U.S. Grant meant to enforce Reconstruction and preserve the rights of Black Americans, but was unable to do so because the weary North no longer had the desire nor the will to confront a bitter South over Reconstruction policies 10 years after Appomattox.
<br />
<br />- That there was no deliberate policy by the U.S. Government to wipe out the Indian tribes; but that a combination of factors, disease, inter-tribal conflict, even buffalo killing by Native Americans, as well as White lies, Manifest Destiny, and the Plains Wars marked the demise of the Indian grip on the territories of the West.
<br />
<br />- He writes how he originally felt revulsion over the Atom Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until he discovered how fully prepared Japan was to commit collective hari-kari over an American invasion of the home islands. He cites how one American officer, future NATO commander Andrew Goodpaster, in projecting American casualties, figured that 800,000 Americans would either be killed or wounded in an assault on Japan, and that Truman's decision to drop the bombs was not only a just one - but a necessary one that saved the lives of both Americans and Japanese.
<br />
<br />- He writes of how he was educated to dislike Theodore Roosevelt as a blowhard and braggart - and then grew to admire him for both his domestic and foreign policies.
<br />
<br />- And how he met and wrote about those "Bands of Brothers", whether they be the men from U.S. 101st Airborne who fought from the Normandy Drop Zones to Hitler's "Eagles Nest", Major John Howard, of the British 6th Airborne who secured "Pegasus Bridge" and of the German Panzer General Von Luck, who opposed Howard and the Red Berets at Pegasus Bridge yet became a firm friend of that gallant man of the Airborne after the war.
<br />
<br />- He writes of how he grew to dislike and vocally oppose our Vietnam involvement yet how he also fully respected the American soldiers, sailors, and airmen who fought there.
<br />
<br />Ambrose also wrote of how America, after 9/11 still remained the last best hope of mankind, and how this nation is a force for good, not evil. He wrote all this in a slim, readable volume that should be passed on from generation to generation. For it was not just Stephen Ambrose's lasting legacy - but a lasting legacy from a beloved historian to all Americans.
<br />
<br />At 6.99 this book deserves an honored place in the libraries of all thoughtful Americans.</span>

                    <span>As a reader of many of Stephen Ambrose's books I find it painful to speak negatively about his work in this one, however I would be less than honest to say this is a great book.  <p>Much of the first part of the book is taken up with historian Ambrose talking about historical figures he used to be more critical of, but now in his more enlighted stage of life he is willing to overlook their warts and see the good they did or at least tried to do.  <p>This type of thinking is common perhaps more common at the end of life when we try to place a more charitable spin on other's actions, but what  a shame he felt not the need to soften and reasses his first wife's life and death by suicide.  Instead he barely mentions her death and dismisses it by saying she was depressive.<p>He shares his personal views, views in some cases markedly out of character with the men whose valor and principles he has become a household name writing about.  I felt a vauge sense of disappointment that he was not cut out of the same cloth and was instead self-absorbed, disrespectful and callow.  His facts are not always straight and his personal forthrightness highly questionable.  He engages in Clintonian type non-denial-denials such as  asserting I was not fired and then allowing although the univerisity let it be known they would be much happier if I would find other employment.  Technically it is true, but when presented as a non-firing becomes a lie. When your employer tells you to leave you are fired even if the words are not used, and half truths are the very worst trait a historian can possess.<p>I am sorry I read this book not because it is bad, indeed much is good and enlightening especiall the section on Nixion.  No I am sorry I read it for what it told me about the writer.  Sorry I like the author less.  Most of all sorry he didn't quit while he was ahead.</span>

                    <span>A summary of events and important people in American history from the beginning of our independence to the present century, Stephen E. Ambrose takes us on a journey of enlightenment from his perspective, allowing us to form our own opinions while eagerly reading his.<p>Part autobiographical, he shares his personal history and the love and support from his wife and five children.  They researched together, spent vacations in the west exploring the Lewis and Clark trail, and respected one another. How refreshing.<p>As the title aptly reads, Personal Reflections of an Historian, the reader is captivated by his unique stories which include his long association with Dwight Eisenhower whom he reveres as the brightest and wisest leader of the past century; his part in establishing a World War II National D Day Museum in New Orleans; his encounter with a German officer;  a thrilling description of the Battle of New Orleans; his research on Richard Nixon; the war in Vietnam, and many many more insightful<br>chapters on various subjects.<p>Every chapter of this book for Americans is worthy of our reading time so that we too, can form our own opinions concerning each subject. It should be required reading as an overview of our country with its movers and shakers, heroes and villians, mistakes and progress, for all our leaders - the president included!<p>I was impressed by the fact that this worthy historian is unashamed to admit his own bias in some cases  and how he eventually changes his thinking as he makes new discoveries.<p>He compares a number of presidents and their leadership, as well as taking us to the battlefields with America's brave fighting men. Thanks to this author and his numerous books, and to Tom Brokaw, we will not be allowed to forget the price paid by the veterans in all our wars.<p>Wonderful stories, interesting reflections from a well-educated professor and historian, and a great book for a discussion group. Read and enjoy!</span>
