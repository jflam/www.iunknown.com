                <span id="Label1"><P><i>Cosmopolitan: A Bartender's Life</i> is a memoir of the bartending life structured as a day in the life at Passerby, the bar owned and run by Toby Cecchini.  It is, as well, a rich study of human nature&#8212;of the sometimes annoying, sometimes outlandish behavior of the human animal under the influence of alcohol, lust, and the sheer desire to bust loose and party.  It's not a pretty picture, but it's always compelling through the gimlet-eyed gaze of the author.  As his typical day progresses, from the almost pastoral quiet of opening the bar and setting up to the gathering rush of customers dropping in after work to the sheer madness of catering to a crazed crush of funseekers, Toby Cecchini muses over a life spent in the service industry and the fascinating particulars of his chosen profession. Topics touched on include dealing with regulars, both welcome and not; sex and the bartender; cocktail connoisseurs (and drinks he refuses to make); learning the bartending ropes of the Odeon when young and newly arrived in New York; the sheer man-killing pace of keeping those drinks coming at flood tide; and the manifold varieties of weirdness and bad behavior that every bartender has to learn how to manage.<br><i><br>Cosmopolitan: A Bartender's Life</i> is the hip, behind-the-scenes look at the frenzied yet undeniably fun atmosphere of that great establishment&#8212;the bar&#8212;and Toby Cecchini is, by turns, witty, acute, mordant, and lyrical in dealing with the realities of his job, shedding plenty of light on the hidden corners of what people do when they go out at night.</p></span>

                    <span>I love memoirs and when I had heard some buzz on this book I went ahead and picked it up. I read it fairly quickly and when it was over I felt down and unsatisfied. Cecchini's writing tries too hard to be literary and isn't straightforward enough. A lot of big words that seem out of place for a book about nightlife and booze. The cover made me think it would have been a lot more fun about a business that seems glossy and glamorous. Unfortunatly, Cecchini seems to think it was a drag one time too many - it wouldn't be an understatement to say that he's a little hard-boiled in the way he tells his story. <P>Definitely a great atmosphere book, in that the place seems real but the customers act like jerks and who wants to hang out with jerks? Just wish it was more fun, is all.</span>

                    <span>The premise of "COSMOPOLITAN" is excellent: life of the hangers on and random passers by at a bar from the prospective of the bartender. TOBY CECCHINI does an excellent job with the story telling. There are elements of RIKKI LEE TRAVOLTA's "MY FRACTURED LIFE" in the details provided in the observation of others and the sitting around talking feel. The two have a very similar feel and tone and should mutually appeal. There are also a few elements of AGUSTEN BURROUGHS' "DRY" but not as many as I expected.</span>

                    <span>"Cosmopolitan" is an authentic slice of life. There are definite similarities to "My Fractured Life" but with a different slant, less bite to the cynicism and less spanning in events. This is more of a neighborhood event than an up and down roller coaster and the writer has an even keel delivery to match.</span>

                    <span>This book was a huge disappointment for me. I found his macho take on bar culture non-observant, but too critical. Anthony Bourdain wrote a rave about a book that discourages smoking in bars??? The guy is never shown without a Marlboro hanging out of his lips. I found this book pretentious and at times monotonous. The cover is fun, but it is not representational of the work.</span>

                    <span>Cecchini should have gotten out of the business years before writing this book. Yes, he has a knack for using big words in hopes of bringing this book to a more literary level, but he should have stuck to finding better stories instead. As a regular at two bars in Los Angeles, I have personally seen funnier and more interesting moments than Cecchini. He's so hard-boiled and tired that he barely seems interested in his own anecdotes. I don't mind bitterness, in fact the more the better, but without a sense of humor in telling the story, he doesn't make this a fun read. My fantasies of bartending are shattered forever. Fun as a concept, not so fun (or interesting) to read.</span>
