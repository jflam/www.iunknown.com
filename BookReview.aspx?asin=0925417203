                    <span>My wife and I are avid fans of Cajun and Zydeco music, and we take trips to Louisiana as often as possible to go to festivals and dance. On one of our trips we stopped by The Cajun General Store in Lafayette to do some souveneir shopping. I spied "The 100 best Cajun Recipes of All Time" on a book rack. It was a humble little pamphlet and very reasonably priced. I figured that any book that made that boast for so little a financial risk was worth a try. That gamble paid off with years of great eating.<P>I haven't tried all the recipes, only about 20. Not only have I not been disappointed, I have eaten some of the best food of my entire life. You won't find Paul Prudhomme in this cook book, but you will find Manning "Pete" Broussard of Lafayette Parish. Never heard of him. Well, don't feel bad, no one outside of his family has probably heard of him either. You see, these recipes were collected by Acadiana Magazine over a period of 20 plus years. The were sent in by true Cajuns who probably learned the recipes from their family members who had been perfecting them for generations. Most of the recipes are very simple. For example, there is a chicken stew recipe that I frequently make, and most of the time, I only need to buy chicken to have everything I need to prepare it. If you follow the instructions, you really do not need to be a great cook to prepare great Cajun food. But you do need patience, because most of the recipes require several hours to be prepared right.<P>I can't emphasize enough what a great buy this book is. If you like to eat great comfort food, you will be forever grateful that you purchased it. If you don't believe me, try this recipe and see if you are convinced.<P>Chicken Stew<P>2 tablespoons butter - 1/2 cup flour - 1 onion, chopped - 1 bellpepper, choppped - 1 rib of celery, chopped - 1/2 cup of chopped parsley - 2 cups of water - 1 chicken, cut up - Salt and pepper to taste - 1 teaspoon of garlic salt.<P>1. Make a roux by blending butter and flour in a sauce pan and continuously stirring over medium high heat until dark brown. Stir vigourously and don't burn.<P>2. Add everything and cook until the chicken is boiled off the bone. Cull out all the bones, cartiledge and skin. Serve over rice.<P>Mrs. Mary Colar Franklin, (St. Mary Parish)</span>
