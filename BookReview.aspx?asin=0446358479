                    <span>The world is divided into various types of people with regards to applied kinesiology:<p>The sceptical: Any sceptic worth their salt who spends five minutes investigating this field will become a non-believer. I have nothing to say to you.<p>The avid believer: You can't argue with a sick mind. I have nothing to say to you.<p>The con-artist: Anyone who perpetuates the myth for personal gain. I have nothing to say to you.<p>The flexible: Those who may have an opinion (either way) but are still open to persuasion - all I can say to you is; do a bit of surfing for applied kinesiology first and try including the words "scam" or "sceptic". When I first heard about it I thought it was a joke until a friend of mine actually paid good money for a session. Then I heard about applied kinesiology by proxy and I was incredulous that anybody, even the homeopathic faction, could take that seriously. The bottom line is this: It doesn't work. Don't waste your money on a book sold by someone who is either a con artist or a gullible fool.<p>My favourite quote by a chiropractor (often advocates of A.K.):<br>"You see, that is why we never do double-blind testing anymore. It never works!"<p>This book perpetuates the bad thinking, lack of rigorous investigation and downright lies that enables opportunistic  money making out of those who are quite often ill or unhappy.<p>By the way, I am not querying things like white sugar being bad for you or cows milk causing allergies in some people, but you don't need to buy this book to find out those kind of things.</span>

                    <span>This is the first of Dr. Diamond's books that I read, and it's easy to see why it became a best-seller.  Dr. Diamond looks in detail at some of the aspects of our lives that affect us negatively, and gives simple, effective ways of overcoming these stresses.  I have incorporated Dr. Diamond's suggestions in my normal working day for many years now, and I have found them to be enormously beneficial.</span>

                    <span>This book is a classic of its kind.  Although it is probably best known for its discussion of the kinesiological muscle test, it is ultimately more important for showing that stimuli, whether physical or otherwise, effect our Life Energy constantly for better or worse.  Furthermore, these effects tend to be the same for all observers: uncousciously, this painting, that food and so on all effect us the same, regardless of what we think in our conscious minds.  This, of course, is a remarkable discovery, and the implications of it have been explored more fully by Dr. Diamond in many of his subsequent works. In short, this has to be one of the most important health books of the twentieth century.</span>

                    <span>I first read this book in the early 1980s, and I have referred to it ever since for its highly practical suggestions on ways to reduce stress and enhance creativity. I have also used Diamond's discussion of "Stress and Cerebral Balance" as a text in teaching communication in college courses. While I understand that the use of kinesiological testing by those not professionally trained has turned out to be a more difficult and complex matter than suggested in this early work, the results of Dr. John Diamond's research are as relevant today as they were when this book was first published in 1979. This book truly laid the groundwork for Dr. Diamond's wonderful subsequent writings, which have developed and refined his work. And here, as always, Dr. Diamond's prose is wonderful reading -- robust, down-to-earth, and entertaining!</span>

                    <span>When I first read this book in the early 80's, it profoundly changed my life. The idea that there is an innate body wisdom that guides us, physically as well as ethically and spiritually, was a revelation to me. And the fact that this body wisdom could be known through objective means was a real eye (and heart!)opener. Dr. Diamond's pioneering work with the thymus gland is the basis for much of current immunology as well as mind-body therapy and interpersonal ethics. This is a classic that everyone interested in holistic health should read -- as well as everyone who practices holistic medicine or purports to to use kinesiological testing therapeutically.</span>
