                <span id="Label1">This book is about creating your life just as the artist creates a painting, a composer writes a symphony, or the poet writes a poem.  Robert Fritz further develops his special insights that he introduced in his best selling book The Path of Least Resistance.  In Your Life As Art, Fritz shows the relationship among the mechanics, the orientation, and the depth of the human spirit within the creative process, and how your life itself can be made like a work of art. Your Life As Art breaks new ground, shakes up the status quo, and, at once, is common sense and revolutionary insight that can change the way you understand the dynamics of your life-building process.</span>

                    <span>Using what I've learned from reading all of Robert Fritz's books, and especially Your Life as Art, I've seen changes that are nothing short of phenomenal with clients in my psychiatry practice, and in my own life. After years in therapy trying to "fix themselves," often without success, I hear clients newly introduced to this work say, "Oh! You mean creating what matters in my life is what it's about!?!" It often doesn't take them long to put this into practice, with gratifying results.</span>

                    <span>As a long time fan of Robert Fritz's books, I come by my eager anticipation for this new release quite naturally. <P>You see, I've been caught up in a pattern for the past few years that goes something like this: Robert Fritz releases a new book - I then read it and digest it - then I apply his teachings and as a result, my life experience becomes significantly altered for the better. With each of his four previous books, I have been blessed to see my pattern repeat itself over and over again. <P>From each book to the next, Robert Fritz introduced me to new facets of the art and science of developing my creative process, whether applying it to my personal life, my professional life or my organizational life.<P>And now, with Your Life As Art, Robert Fritz stretches my understanding of the creative process even further. He ties the key ideas and principles from his previous work together with his new ideas into one clear and compelling central theme.<P>You do not need to have read any of Robert's previous books in order to enter the fascinating universe of this new one. It is highly readable to both novice and seasoned readers alike.<P>I feel my life being transformed and enriched yet again. What a thankful pattern I have. Thank you, Robert!</span>
