In <I>Napalm & Silly Putty</I>, Carlin's characteristically ironic and hilarious take on life shines through. He asks:   <P><I>How can it be a spy satellite if they announce on TV that it's a spy satellite?   <P>Why do they bother saying "raw sewage"?   <P>Do some people cook that stuff?  <P>In the expression "topsy-turvy," what exactly is meant by "turvy"?</I></span>

                    <span>Classic Carlin comedy, just in written form.  Beware, people will stare at you if you are reading in public because you will definitely be laughing out loud!  Lots of bits and pieces type of book - you don't have to read from the beginning to enjoy the book.  You can skip around and still enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Again, George has highlighted many daily mental notes that we make to ourselves (though refusing to share with those who crave our valid opinions).  I love him for it!  And I'm impressed with the fact that Napalm & Silly Putty is substantially more organized, and well put-together, than Brain Droppings.  
<br />
<br />Still, both books have made my day!  I cannot wait to read his latest.</span>

                    <span>I was very dissapointed with this book. I think that I only laughed out loud maybe five times while reading it. Don't get me wrong I still think that George Carlin is still one of the greatest comedians of all time, but this book is mostly recycled material from his old stand-up routines. It has been a few years since I read Brain Droppings but I definatly remember flying on a plane and having to put it down because I was laughing too hard. I gues that I would reccomend this book only if you are not familiar with any of Carlin's stand-up. Otherwise check out Brain Droppings.</span>

                    <span>This book is hilarious Carlin ranting.  If you can think of no other reason, buy this book for the last section: "Seven Death Wishes."  I still laugh so hard that tears come when I read this section.  Extremely funny stuff!</span>

                    <span>Brain Droppings was a great book, but this one is even better and a bit funnier. I don't know why this book is given 3.5 stars overall, if you don't know who George Carlin is or don't like him why would you buy his book anyway. If you've seen Carlin's stand up then you should like the book.</span>
