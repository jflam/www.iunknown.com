                    <span>...and the ideas in it changed the way I write.
<br />
<br />Now, I haven't read _all_ writing books, obviously, but usually I get to the end and have learned nothing new.  If you decide to review Card's book, and consider it basic:  identify the books you found more helpful!
<br />
<br />As for me, I found new detail on:  POV; brainstorming for ideas; the types of stories and where they should start; how to put info in as part of the narrative, without the "info dump" that stops the story; and how to make characters interesting with multiple motivations.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the first books I ever read on writing. I found it very effective and well thought out.</span>

                    <span>The book was average. I actually wanted something on POV but Card, although I understand he's a good sci-fi writer, barely touches upon the profound nature of POV which (from a literary POV) can be tricky. The Characters section (most of the book) went over all the obvious stuff. Again, there was no in-depth examination of fictional characters, and nothing above and beyond the rudimentary steps and formula to creating a character. Then again, after reading several other how-to write books, maybe I was expecting too much.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When this book came out, it was one of the few to go beyond the basics and to do it in a clear, useable way.  Today, a number of books have gone beyond this book on the problem of characterization, so the book is dated.  And since the book is very brief, it is not as in-depth as the title makes it appear.  
<br />The discussion of point of view follows the all-too-familiar pattern of listing the possibilities and discussing each one.  First person and third person are the two main categories, with omniscient, limited omniscient, and shifting as subheads.  Only a few words about the advantages of each and these are the same found in most introductory books on fiction writing.  You want to use the most effective point of view, so you'll need to get another book to tell you which those are and to show you why.  Still, if you've read only an introductory book on fiction writing, this might be a good next step.  </span>
