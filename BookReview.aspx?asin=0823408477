                    <span>This book will be enjoyed by all students.  It really speaks from the heart and instead of continually writing on all the negative stuff that authors seem to write on, i really think that Adler focused on writing on all the positive things that King did for the nation.  The book was beautifully written.</span>

                    <span>The entire "A picture book of..." biography series byDavid Adler is outstanding. Perfect for lower elementary studentsdoing their first real report. Makes a great read-aloud for non-readers as they are easily completed in one sitting. They are loaded with information including a timeline of important dates. The illustrations in this book are not cartoon-like as in his other biographies of Washington or Lincoln, but are appealing to young children.</span>
