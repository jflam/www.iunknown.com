                <span id="Label1">When we think gangster, hood, or wiseguy, we often associate these characters with such names as Capone, Luciano, or even Corleone. However, when organized crime reared its ugly head in the late 1920s in Brooklyn, at the foundation were men like Meyer Lansky and Ben Siegel--both Jews. Rich Cohen's romantic account of Jewish gangsters, <I>Tough Jews</I>, brings to life the story of Jewish involvement in the world of organized crime. <p> Cohen persuasively achieves his objective by recounting the stories he heard from his father, who grew up with his friends (including broadcaster Larry King) at the end of the gangster era in Brooklyn, finding heroes in men like "Kid Twist" Reles and Bugsy Goldstein. The intriguing tales Cohen heard, although slightly embellished over time, offer a rare glimpse into a world that can barely be related to today's generation of Jews living in America. These Jews went to prison for committing violent felonies, not white-collar crimes, and got the chair for it. Inspired by their stories, Cohen went on to conduct extensive research through old journals, police records, and court reports to uncover the real stories behind the tales he heard as a boy.<p> Cohen warmly discusses his father's fascination with these powerful, charismatic figures, and openly envies his experiences at a time before Jewish people lived under the debilitating shadow of the Holocaust. In addition, Cohen shows compassion for the need of his father's generation to look up to "someone who gives them the illusion of strength." <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></span>

                    <span>The book does what the title implies. It sheds light on an often neglected aspect of the Jewish-American immigrant story and shows early 20th century mobster culture was much more inclusive than it is often portrayed.
<br />The author tries to create the background by paying homageto his dad and his friends (great pictures of a young Larry King with normal shoulders), law abiding aggressive business men who grew up with the legends of Arnold Rothstein and Meyer Lansky, emulating them like kids playing army. But in the end, the metaphor falls flat. The gangsters had no more impact on how their lives turned out than did their Brooklyn Dodger heroes.
<br />The writing style often diverges into a very personal, chatty conversational style, an off-stage commentary on the historical goings-on. A little too colloquial for the subject matter, the asides were like a fleeting stomach ache amidst a great meal.</span>

                    <span>In the early 20th century, many newly coming immigrants found work in America hoping for a better life. With these newly arriving immigrants, crime and violence was brought as well. Crime organizations formed in big cities from groups of immigrants coming together and creating gangs. These gangs committed criminal acts to make money, their sons learned from their fathers. Until the early 1920s when prohibition took an effect, criminal families had no great source of income. With this new way of earning money from bootlegging alcohol to speakeasies and such, the crime families prospered. Every ethnic gang profited from prohibition, Jews, Italians, Russians, Irish, and Asians. When Prohibition died, so did most of the criminal activity. With law enforcement growing and becoming keener to the ways of criminal families, crime organizations have become more and more secret. Today no one knows how powerful the underworld of crime is, but it still exists. Overall this book about famous gangsters was a wonderful book. If you enjoy reading about gangsters and how the made their money this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>I know Jewish people often (with usually good justification) like their own but he just flat out goes way too far in a sick, deranged direction in describing gangster, cheat, pathological liar, and drug smuggler Arnold Rothstein as a great man in this book. Also, Rothstein defies the idea of Rich's that the Jew needed to turn to crime to get ahead when Rothstein's honest hardworking daddy was already a rich man. And Rothstein's main anger (and motive to do no good) in life was his jealousy of his older, beloved upright brother not Rothstein's marriage to a girl who wasn't practicing Judaism. Furthermore, I don't believe for a second that Rothstein made the average gangster a more classy looking fellow than he was before. There were lots of gangsters in NY and Chicago before him and with no help from him who knew how to look and act spiffy in public. Skip this nonsense, sorry Rich but that's what it is.  </span>

                    <span>I came across this book in London, England, and not being Jewish myself the subject matter intrigued me. This account of Jewish life is written in a savvy street-cred prose, which I liked, and has the feel and mood of a nostalgic narrative - sentimental at times rather than passionate, and it is really a personal oddessy fo the author. <br>The author depicts the gangsters in a "idealized" fashion, like a painting by Claude Lorraine: it's romanticized, stylized, and I think if this was translated into a novel it wouldn't work as well. This is clearly a journalist at work, albeitit with some measure of imagination to create a mood. <br>I would agree with another review that the book is somewhat disorganised and patched together, like a collection of essays or reminiscences. Perhaps, that is part of its appeal, that you can simply dip in to it without worrying too much about plot or continuity. After all, it's not a novel, but rather an account expressed as a mood of a time that shaped the gangsters who themselves shaped (and exploited) their time. If you will, it's a kind of Gatsby for real - only a lot more violent.<br>I would recommend the book; and wish the author well.</span>
