                    <span>Coach John Wooden said a good player with good fundamentals will become a good player and a good player with great fundamentals will become a great player. If you're like me, a Father of a 10-year-old boy who loves playing baseball and you have been looking for that one book that can show you the fundamentals of baseball from hitting to fielding and pitching. Look no further, because this book has everything you will need and a whole lot more. The Ripkens have put together a baseball book that tells the how to, in an approach easy to understand and not only the how to but the why, which as Cal points out, all kids ask. Many thanks to the Ripken family from late Father Cal to sons Cal and Billy and their fine staff who have put together a great baseball book of fundamentals for the Father, Coach and ballplayer.</span>

                    <span>I am a baseball fan. I played as a kid and go to seem MLB games in my home town of Toronto. We are in the same conference as the Baltimore Orioles (American League East), Cal's old team so I saw him play quite a bit. He is a graceful and thoughtful player. His four trademarks were a love of the game, natural ability, a lot of practice, a thinking player, and he has a lot of experience. Also he comes from a baseball family. In short he is among the best all round players to have ever played the games and to our benefit he stayed late after every game signing autographs - a rarity today.<P>If I was going to pick one recent player to write a book an learning baseball he would be the man. He has intelligence, experience and the love for the game. Many other players might be faster, or better hitters, etc. but he was the total package, a guy that could pace himself on and off the field and a person that really loved the game and cared for the fans.<P>So that brings us to the book. It is impressive! It is a work of love by the authors. It is well laid out with a chapter by chapter review of the game with lots and lots of bright color photographs, some in a time sequence so they show how the action evolves. He and the other authors appear in the photos wearing simple black and white uniforms demonstrating baseball fundamentals. He tries to explain some of the more subtle yet important parts of the game. He covers all the basic aspects such as pitching, how to hold the pitched ball, catching, playing the infield, the outfield, hitting, etc. <P>Excellent for all levels of baseball, playing or a fan. Highly recommend. Everyone will learn something new, even old fans like me.<P>Jack in Toronto</span>
