                <span id="Label1">This guide shows how to extend Visual Basic (VB) with code that handles some advanced programming problems, including algorithms that you can use every day to write faster and more flexible VB applications. After an introductory discussion of profiling algorithms and some techniques to emulate pointers in VB, the author shows how to emulate a variety of data structures, such as linked lists, stacks and queues, and arrays, along with their implementations in VB.<p> Besides these basic container types, the author also proceeds farther afield into a demonstration of trees in VB, including balanced trees. (Though you won't need these data structures for most programs, it's interesting to see how they can be written in VB.) <p> More applicable to real-world problems are the sections on sorting, searching, and hashing in VB. (These algorithms can extend the range of the types of problems VB can solve.) This book closes with some network algorithms and some discussion of object-oriented techniques for VB, including some "patterns" or reusable designs for software. With the accompanying CD-ROM, you can use all the author's algorithms or write your own based on the techniques explored here. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>An excellent book, because it covers algorithms and solutions to everyday problems for an intermediate/advanced programmer. Although these algorithms are implemented in VB, the knowledge and techniques will adapt to any language readily. It covers all the basic techniques on lists, stacks and queues. The chapter on arrays is fantastic, with many useful ideas on how to efficiently store and manipulate your data (Triangular, sparse, forward star). Other topics covered include recursion, trees, decision trees, sorting, searching (including path finding), hashing and OOP techniques.<P>It's all written in a easy to follow but economical way, giving you the info you need to solve your data problems quickly and efficiently. <P>A must have book, even for non VB programmers!</span>

                    <span>Even if you have been programming in VB for several years, or have taken college-level computer science data structures courses, you need this book.<P>This book goes way beyond simply providing code snippets that you can paste into your VB apps. The author begins by explaining such fundamental algorithm concepts as time and space complexity analysis and the trade-offs between the two. He really focuses on providing an understanding of the "Whys" in addition to the "Hows".<P>Simply put, if you are or aspire to be a serious VB programmer, there are 4 books that you must have by your side at all times: this book, Dan Appleman's "VB Programmer's Guide to the WIN32-API", Bruce McKinney's "Hardcore Visual Basic", and Microsoft's "Visual Basic Programmer's Guide".</span>

                    <span>This book has thirteen chapters. It covers Lists, Stacks & Queues, Arrays, Recursion, Trees, Balanced Trees, Decision Trees, Sorting, Searching, Hashing, Network Algorithms and Object-Oriented Techniques. The one I'm most interested in is Chapter 8 (Decision Trees), the book has a small Tic-Tac-Toe game and source code. The game has 9 levels of "Artificial Intelligence". I thought I'd find some source code or explanation on chess game when I bought this book. This is the only reason that disappoints me slightly, other than that, it's a great book.</span>

                    <span>There aren't many good Advanced VB textbooks out there and most don't bother to teach this stuff, but most Professors or Instructors expect their students to understand sorting algorithms, queues, hashes, binary trees, linked lists, spanning trees, etc. This book was very helpful towards that end. The sample programs are great! Stephens spends more time than usual in explaining the general fundamentals of algorithms and their benefits. He really speaks to the reader. This is not an Advanced VB textbook or reference book. It does a very good job of covering Visual Basic Algorithms.</span>
