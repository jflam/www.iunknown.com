                    <span>This book is very well written and works well as a review book for the Architect exam. It doesn't really contain enough to cover the whole exam but it is a very good start. Some exam objectives are missing and others are just skimmed over. If this book contained double the material it would be excellent. It is much better written then the Paul Allen book.</span>

                    <span>Writing a certification guide poses some serious challenges to the author. Having co-authored a guide my self, I understand how tricky it is to decide how much to cover. A test like SCEA that covers such a broad ground makes the job even tougher.<p>The first ever SCEA guide met most of my expectations. It is concise, covers most of the exam objectives and most importantly, maintains the focus on the test without digressing over to J2EE trivia. Every chapter attempts to cover a set of objectives, and has a review section followed by some sample test questions. The accompanying answers provide explanation of correct, incorrect and not-so correct choices. The book also introduces a case study that introduces the reader to skills essential for solving part-II assignment.<p>I said the book covers "most" of the objectives. That's where it falls short of expectations. Any study guide should, at the least, cover all the test objectives. Some test objectives such as Legacy connectivity and Messaging have been totally left out which made me question the seal of approval from SunEducation! It is one thing not to cover an objective in detail, but totally dropping a couple of them is inexcusable. A good reader can easily point out some spottiness too - such as not including the state diagram for entity beans along with that of session beans.<p>In summary, they badly need to fill some gaping holes, and to the extent possible, work towards completeness. <p>[...]</span>

                    <span>Reading all the other reviews I just HAVE to warn everybody else about a big problem with this book: it's full of mistakes. Not just simple ones, but some fundamental ones as well. ONLY read this book to get an idea of what the exam will tell you, but get the real information somewhere else. The "review questions" were even worse. Many were more an exercise in your understanding of the english language than a question on the subject, especially those of chapter 2. But the most unforgivable mistake is a question where the answer starts with "We can assume that...". Pardon me? Anybody who calls himself an experienced architect knows Rule One: NEVER make assumptions. Making assumptions is the single most effective way of screwing up a project. To make a long story short, just read the index. That should help enough, and will at least not hurt you either.</span>
