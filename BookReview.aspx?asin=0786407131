                    <span>I recently had the opportunity to purchase and read this fine book.  While nothing in it was earth shattering for those of us who grew up as fans of Mike Schmidt - a great guy, not involved in any of the scandals that are the hallmark of many of today's "heros" - it was a fine read recapping the baseball history of a great athlete and a fine person.  While many ignorant people booed him through the inevitable slumps (I'm sure they "hit a home run" every time at bat throughout their daily personal and professional lives) and laughed at the tears he shed, on and off the field, he was an inspiration to many of us for his work ethic, outstanding achievements on and off the field and his community spirit.  I remember him being out of the line-up with a severe injury - knee or groin pull? - and coming off the bench to win the game with a three run pinch HR.  As great a home run hitter as he was he was a great base stealer and a super glove and arm man at the hot corner - simply the best.  And what Philadelphian can forget hearing Harry Kallas and Richie Ashburn in the broadcast booth when Michael Jack hit one out of the Vet?  Kudos to the author.  Buy the book - its a fine addition to your Philadelphia sports library.</span>

                    <span>The author does a nice job recounting Schmidt's career -- that is to say, his research was good.  That being said, there's a temptation when someone writes about his boyhood hero (and the author expresses his admiration for Schmidt in the introduction) to put the subject on a pedestal no matter what, to apologize for perceived problems, or, worse, both.  Unfortunately, the author falls victim to both temptations, and the book suffers because of it.  The book will serve those who don't know much about Schmidt fairly well.  For those who know more about him, you won't learn much that is new.  The book also lacks meaningful analysis about Schmidt's career.  In summary, I expected more on this subject and from this author, and I was disappointed.</span>

                    <span>The danger when someone writes about a childhood hero (which the author admits in his introduction) is that the author can  idolize the subject without question, apologize for certain aspects of his baseball life, or worse, both.  Kashatus' book is well-researched, but it falls prey to both temptations.  The result is a somewhat saccharine effort whose goal is to lionize Schmidt without much critical analysis regarding Schmidt's approach to the game and the fans.  If you don't know much about Schmidt, then the book might be helpful, but if you do, you'll be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>As far as the book itself goes, it is a very factual, general account of Michael Jack and his career.  Mostly gleaned from old newpaper clippings and quotes, it reads more like a history book than anything.  (although I  was able to skim through it in just an hour at the library).  Not being a  fan of baseball whatsoever, this biography actually did nothing for me.  So  why the 4 stars?  <p>I'll tell you why.  I am from the Philadelphia area  and am very familiar with our reputation as fans.  I am a Flyers, Sixers,  Eagles and Phillies fan, I will never sell out no matter how bad those  clowns are and no matter where I live.  Schmitty always whined and cried  about the treatment he received there and there's one little passage in  this book thats worth your time to read. <p>One snowy morning, Michael  "2 Bad knees and a dream" Jack was chasing after his daughter  when 2 kids saw him and excitedly started yelling his name.  Turning to  happily acknowledge the tykes, he was then proclaimed a,  "choker."  He cried.  Now thats funny stuff.</span>
