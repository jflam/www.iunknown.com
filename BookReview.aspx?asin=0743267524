                <span id="Label1">Fans watching the 2004 baseball playoffs were often treated to shots of Stephen King sitting in the stands, notebook in hand. Given the bizarre events on the field, from the Red Sox's unprecedented comeback against their most hated rivals to their ace pitcher's bleeding, stitched-together ankle--not to mention the Sox's first championship in 86 years--you could be forgiven for thinking King was writing the script as he went along, passing new plot twists down to the dugouts between innings.<p>  What he was writing, though, along with his friend and fellow novelist Stewart O'Nan, was <I>Faithful</I>, a diary of the 2004 Red Sox season. <I>Faithful</I> is written not from inside the clubhouse or the press room, but from the outside, from the stands and the sofa in front of the TV, by two fans who, like the rest of New England, have lived and died (mostly died) with the Sox for decades. From opposite ends of Red Sox Nation, King in Maine and O'Nan at the border of Yankees country in Connecticut, they would meet in the middle at Fenway Park or trade emails from home about the games they'd both stayed up past midnight to watch. King (or, rather, "Steve") is emotional, O'Nan (or "Stew") is obsessively analytical. Steve, as the most famous Sox fan who didn't star in <I>Gigli</I>, is a folk hero of sorts, trading high fives with doormen and enjoying box seats better than John Kerry's, while Stew is an anonymous nomad, roving all over the park. (Although he's such a shameless ballhound that he gains some minor celebrity as "Netman" when he brings a giant fishing net to hawk batting-practice flies from the top of the Green Monster.) <p>  You won't find any of the Roger Angell-style lyricism here that baseball, and the Sox in particular, seem to bring out in people. (King wouldn't stand for it.) Instead, this is the voice of sports talk radio: two fans by turns hopeful, distraught, and elated, who assess every inside pitch and every waiver move as a personal affront or vindication. Full of daily play-by-play and a season's rises and falls, <I>Faithful</I> isn't self-reflective or flat-out funny enough to become a sports classic like <I>Fever Pitch</I>, <I>Ball Four</I>, or <I>A Fan's Notes</I>, but like everything else associated with the Red Sox 2004 season, from the signing of Curt Schilling to Dave Roberts's outstretched fingers, it carries the golden glow of destiny. And, of course, it's got a heck of an ending. <I>--Tom Nissley</I></span>

                    <span>I haven't read any of the other reviews here, but I don't know how the average review, as of this posting, can only be 3-1/2 stars. You don't have to be a Red Sox fan: almost any long-time baseball fan with a heart should love this book. I am not a Red Sox fan, per se. I am a long-suffering SF Giants fan, who has had several Red Sox fans for friends over the past 30 years, so I can very much relate to their plight...and now that the Red Sox have finally won their world series, the Giants 51-year drought has moved the snake-bit San Franciscans up one slot nearer to the top of professional sports teams with the longest run of futility.
<br />
<br />Even if you don't like baseball that much, you might still enjoy Steven King's always entertaining commentary--and since his entries are printed in bold, they are easy to pick out. King himself acknowledges that he is the "from the heart guy" of this partnership, while O'Nan, whose technical knowledge of baseball is impressive, is the nuts-and-bolts guy.
<br />
<br />In fact, the only way I can see that a non-Yankee fan might not enjoy this book is if they find O'Nan--who also might be the luckiest SOB ever, when it comes to hauling in stray baseballs!--too technical, at times. Personally, I never found his discussion of the finer points of the game to be too dry...I have a better-than-average knowledge of baseball, but I definitely learned a few things from him.
<br />
<br />As an aside, this book and the movie Fever Pitch, when the latter comes out on DVD, would make an excellent "gift bag" for the Red Sox fan, or any other sympathetic baseball fan, in your life. </span>

                    <span>I was born an Oriole fan and I plan to go out that way.  I also chose not to get on the "Saux" bandwagon last season.  With this said, I highly recommend this book.  You really get the feeling of what it was to be a fan during what was obviously a wild ride for the Red Sox.  You finish the book hoping that your team could some day do for you what the Sox did for O'Nan and King.
<br />
<br />(Also, it will fuel whatever "Yankee Hater" instincts you may have brewing.  I even bought the hat.)</span>

                    <span>On the surface, this is a book for Red Sox fans.  I am not a Red Sox fan.  I grew up a Phillies fan, and am the son of a Cubs fan, so I don't need to be preached to about baseball futility.  However, the little details of what it means to be a baseball fan are what makes this book so readable.  So underneath all the Red Sox rooting, there is a very nice book about being a fan, of a team and the game.
<br />
<br />If you don't have a working knowledge of baseball, let this book slide.  The authors don't try to explain the game, rather they explain what the game means to them.  Parent and child moments at the ballpark, desperately tuning AM radio stations to catch a score, and perhaps even turning your cap inside out when it's really, really, needed.  
<br />
<br />Those little details help make this book a great addition to any baseball lover's library.  And, if you are a Sox fan, go ahead and revel in a perfect season captured in print.</span>

                    <span>Read where I'm from next to my name at the top of this review.  Yeah, I'm bitter.  A little bit, anyway.  But that aside, the Red Sox deserved to win this series, and I can certainly think of worse teams for the Cardinals to have lost to.  That's especially true given how poorly the Red Birds played in those 4 short games after such a spectacular season.  So no, I don't believe that my unfavorable opinion of this book has much to do with me being a Cardinals fan.  
<br />
<br />Stephen King is one of my favorite popular authors.  I especially love his pop culture column in Entertainment Weekly.  He comes across as a down to earth guy who enjoys movies, music, TV and sports just like me.  His writing style is friendly and folksy with the right combination of cynicsm and sarcasm to make for some truly enjoyable takes on all things involving entertainment.  So because of that, I was expecting much more from this book.  His take on being a Red Sox fan is just not that interesting, insightful or well-written.  I live in one of the biggest baseball towns in America, so reading about someone's obsession with a particular storied team is nothing new to me.  I thought I'd be able to identify with his interest in his team, but it comes across as mindless fawning mixed with exaggerated anguish caused by years of The Curse.  Maybe it'll mean more to a Red Sox fan, but that doesn't change my opinion that this book contributes nothing of substance to baseball lore.  That's a shame, considering one half of the talent involved.
