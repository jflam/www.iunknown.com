                    <span>A little backgound about me, I graduated in Telecommunication field, i am a Cisco certified, and working in the networking field, and it is happened that my job now require me more Micosoft and Redhat Linux certified.
<br />
<br />all i can say about this book is Useless and Disappointed. i can not express how disappointed i am with this microsoftpress book. it is such a wast of money and time.
<br />
<br />the book is hard to read, each concept is not explained well at all, not deepth. especially the review questions in the book,each chapter has about 3-6 review questions, the question are decided just for kids, really... the questions in the book are very easy and not enuf they r no point and stupid.i am sure in the real exam, there will not b any questions simply ask "group policy is ______?" or "you can share _______ connection in home or small office by using ICS-Internet Connection Sharing" (asnwer=Internet). can u see how simple and stupid the questions are, and turely it just ask like this in the book.
<br />
<br />I decided to stop and look for other resources, stop now, better than wasting my time (which i already wast my money for the book itself).
<br />
<br />i strongly don't recommend this book to anyone, easpecialy who is preparing for exam, this book won't bring u to anywhere close.
<br />
<br />if you want to donate your money, better make it somewhere else, not Bill's pocket, he is surely alot far richer than u, u should know that.
<br />
<br />Disappointed --- Shall i buy MicrosoftPress' product again?</span>

<br />The exam that comes with this book on the CD does not work.

<br />How did I find out?  I bought the book. I tried the exam. I wrote to Microsoft Press and they told me this.</span>

                    <span>After reading only few chapters I am convinced that this is one of the best books about XP. (I have 4 of them including ExamCram2) I can definitely recommend this book to any one who is seriously preparing for the MCSA/MCSE 70-270 exam. I found answers to my questions easily and I suggest to people criticizing this book that they should read "About this Book" section, where you can find the chapter and lesson related to any exam objective. The writing style is excellent and easier to read. The book was written in 2001 so for added features and improvement in XP you have to consult "Windows XP Help"(highly recommended) and MSDN (this is expected when you study for an exam). I would keep this book as my primary source for MS 70-270.</span>

                    <span>This Book is the biggest POS I have ever had for a MCSE book. The cd is such a joke the testing software sucks so bad it does not even test you chapter by chapter. I went and took the 70-270 test and I was not ready for it at all. I went out and bought the sybex 70-270 book and its safe to say I will be so ready for the test now. The software on the sybex book lets you test yourself chapter by chapter and overall the book it set up much better.</span>

                    <span>This book is far away for being a complete study guide for 70-270 exam preparation. Many questions, that you'll see on the actual exam, do not covered in this book at all. If you are familiar with Win XP, you'll find this book totally useless. If you're newbie to WinXP, you'll see the lack of explanations in many important topics. I'm totally disappointed with Microsoft Press. If you want to pass the exam, choose Sybex.</span>
