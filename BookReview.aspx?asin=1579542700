                <span id="Label1">It's hard to argue with success; it's even tougher to emulate it. But if  you want to train like a Tour de France winner, you couldn't do much better than  learning the tricks of the trade from two-time champion (1999 and 2000) Lance  Armstrong.<p>  In <I>The Lance Armstrong Performance Program: Seven Weeks to the Perfect  Ride</I>, Armstrong teams up with his coach, Chris Carmichael (whom the U.S.  Olympic Committee named 1999's Coach of the Year), to offer the ultimate  insider's guide to becoming a better rider, based on the regimen Carmichael has  been fine-tuning for Armstrong since the early 1990s. Noting that athletes of  all levels focus best when aiming for specific goals at the end of short  windows, the authors describe the performance program as consisting of "three  specialized weekly training programs that build on your current fitness level"  followed by a week of "recovery riding between each program." They provide an  easy-to-administer fitness-level self-test in the form of a three-mile time  trial (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), and they then define the key  operative terms that make up the bulk of the actual training, including  <I>Tempo</I>, <I>HighSpin</I>, <I>PowerIntervals</I>, <I>Sprints</I>, and  <I>Training Zone</I>. A brief section of workbook-style pages provides readers  with a user-friendly outline for the entire seven weeks.<p>  Here is week 3 for an intermediate rider:<p>  <ul><li>Monday: day off. <li>Tuesday: 1 hour in zone 2 with 20 minutes Tempo on flat terrain. <li>Wednesday: 30 minutes in zone 1; recovery ride. <li>Thursday: 1 hour in zone 2 with 15 minutes Tempo on flat terrain. <li>Friday: 45 minutes in zone 2 with 10 minutes HighSpin on flat terrain. <li>Saturday: 1 hour in zone 2 with 15 minutes Tempo on flat terrain. <li>Sunday: 1.5 hours in zone 2 with 30 minutes on hilly terrain.</ul><p>  Though clearly the focus, the performance program itself makes up less than a  third of the book. Other subjects covered include cycling equipment, essential  maintenance and repair, riding in bad weather, road hazards, mental toughness,  and the pros' eating habits both on and off the bike, to name just a few. What  the book is not is the story of Lance Armstrong's remarkable recovery from  testicular cancer (see his autobiography, <I>It's Not About the Bike</I>, for  that). Rather, Armstrong and Carmichael have produced a detail-packed training  manual, sprinkled with photographs and tales of the racing life, for those who  spend a large percentage of their time on two wheels--or dream of it.  <I>--Patrick Jennings</I></span>

                    <span>This was the first cycling/training book I picked up when I started trying to get myself back in shape. After dropping 50 pounds and being in the best aerobic shape of my life I can honestly say that this book got me going in the right direction in regards to training routines and nutrition. It is simple and a must read for beginners. More advanced cyclist might find it a little dull but there is still useful information no matter your skill level. Chris's other book, "The Ultimate Ride" is a great follow up to this book.</span>

                    <span>For the person who would like a strong, proven way to begin to add structure to their training - you really can't lose with this book. True, there are those in the cycling world who view Carmichael's business as becoming the 'Walmart' of coaching, but still...it's sound stuff. <BR>I have found that the most beneficial thing an athlete can do to their training is...simply get structured. Appropriate rest and slow, steady development of the aerobic system will pay off in the long-term. This book is as good of a beginning for the entry-level athlete as any other. You also might look for Joe Friel's Cyclist Training Bible.<P>Pedalhome<BR>www.bicycleblowout. com</span>

                    <span>While most of the text of the book seems to be written by Chris Carmichael, Lance's personal coach, there are snippets of "What would Lance do?". These are very helpful and inspirational to novices like myself, and cover such various topics as diet to weight training. I was referred to this book by the bicycle shop where I purchased my road bike. The salesperson who helped me had taken up biking later in life, like myself. He had made amazing progress, and attributed it to Lance's book. For those like myself, who are on the steep part of the learning curve, it's good to have an accessible role model (Lance Armstrong) by means of this book. Although workouts are sketchy, each type of training is detailed, chapter at a time. I am still in base training and not yet into the seven week programs, but am looking forward to applying the workouts in my training regimen.</span>

                    <span>The self-appointed elitists who gave this book a bad review only have themselves to blame if they bought this book only to find out that it wasn't for them. It only took me a few minutes scanning through the book to realize that it was geared more for beginner and recreational cyclists. (although there is good advice even for racers here) Even if you only had this website to go by, (instead of a personal visit to the bookstore) the Edtorial reviews here gave plenty of information to allow one to determine the content of the book. <BR>Many athletes I've dealt-with over the years were guilty of over-training, and neglecting the basics that help prevent injury. This book will be a help to anyone who wants to work and improve at cycling without "killing" themselves every time they head out to train.....or literally killing or injuring themselves because they didn't learn a few riding techniques to stay vertical during turns, pack-riding or emergency maneuvers. <BR>It's an excellent place to start.</span>
