                <span id="Label1"><I>Brand Yourself</I> compellingly advocates combining today's hottest business concept with the biggest trends in business demographics. Geared toward anyone switching careers, running a small business, or just striving to advance in a current job, the book--by veteran career coaches and marketing consultants David Andrusia and Rick Haskins--argues persuasively that one must carefully create a personal brand and aggressively market it like soup or mouthwash in order to get ahead in these ultracompetitive times. "Branding is such a powerful tool in selling products that it makes perfect sense that we as individuals should brand ourselves," they write, "thereby creating a strong, positive sense of ourselves and our services that is different and better than what our peers have to offer." They begin with an extensive but clearly articulated "career self-evaluation and brand assessment" to facilitate development of a "Personal Branding Statement" that is specifically shaped by your skills and personality traits in addition to marketplace needs. They then focus on "packaging your brand" with the right name, collateral material, and even office space, and "making yourself known" through properly framed written matter and personal contacts. Concluding chapters offer specific suggestions on attaining promotions and changing careers, as well as using the concept in other special circumstances. <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>Branding is critical to success in today's marketplace. Any politician will tell you that success rests with public image and getting people talking about you, your business, or your product. But not everyone is comfortable with self-branding. So before you take a giant leap towards the front covers of "Time" and "Newsweek," your community newspaper - or even the company newsletter - keep in mind that you never, ever get a second chance to make a first impression. The image you present is the one you will have to live with, or live up to! Step ONE in the art of self-promotion is to do an honest self-assessment of who you are, what you have to say - and why anyone would want to listen to your story! Following a careful step-by-step process will help even the most timid become comfortable with the concept of self-promotion.   Women, especially, show far too much humility about their talents and skills. If we want people to value our skills, we must first show that we value ourselves -- by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to hire us, promote us, buy from us or invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us! Branding or self-promotion isn't a four-letter word. It is a valuable business tool that career women must add to their strategies for success. (from Marion E. Gold, award-winning author of "The Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU")</span>

                    <span>A good friend recommended this book to assist me in positioning my company and services in a new market. The authors make an excellent case for applying the techniques of successful product branding to yourself in order to stand out within a competitive field.<p>The authors present their material in a logical, well-rounded manner. First, they explain branding and give many good examples of successful campaigns. Then, they introduce a series of assessment tests to help you determine your strengths and passions and how these fit in with your personal brand. Finally, they provide examples of marketing yourself within this brand identity, again providing plentiful examples and case studies.<p>In all, Andrusia and Haskins present useful concepts in an thoroughly readable and accessible book.</span>

                    <span>This book reminded me of all the good stuff I learned about product management as an undergrad business major and taught me step-by-step how to  apply brand marketing to myself in the job marketplace.  All the friends  to whom I have recommended this book have thanked me heartily.  The advice  in this readable, friendly volume greatly facilitated my recent transition  to a new career.  All working people should read it, particularly those who  dislike self-promotion.</span>

                    <span>I sat down one Sun afternoon and read the entire book in one setting. It is truly a powerful secret weapon in today's competitive marketplace. The writing was superb, and very witty. I really enjoyed the way that Mr.  Haskins didn't make the reader feel inadequate, rather provided  empowerment.  It was like having a personal coach help you to reinvent  yourself and discover abilities and talents that you may have other wise  overlooked.  I highly recommend it for persons who are in business, or want  to shine in a presentation where branding is essential. I eagerly await the  next book.</span>
