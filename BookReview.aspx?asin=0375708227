                <span id="Label1">In <b>Masters of Death</b><i>,</i> Rhodes gives full weight, for the first time, to the Einsatzgruppen&#8217;s role in the Holocaust. These &#8220;special task forces,&#8221; organized by Heinrich Himmler to follow the German army as it advanced into eastern Poland and Russia, were the agents of the first phase of the Final Solution. They murdered more than 1.5 million men, women, and children between 1941 and 1943, often by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar.<br><br>These massive crimes have been generally overlooked or underestimated by Holocaust historians, who have focused on the gas chambers. In this painstaking account, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes profiles the eastern campaign&#8217;s architects as well as its &#8220;ordinary&#8221; soldiers and policemen, and helps us understand how such men were conditioned to carry out mass murder. Marshaling a vast array of documents and the testimony of perpetrators and survivors, this book is an essential contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust and World War II. </span>

                    <span>This chilling study brings home to the reader the reality of how the genocide of the Jews and others planned by the Nazis did not actually begin with the mass, "industrial" exterminations in the gas chambers of the Concentration Camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, Treblinka etc., but with small groups of murderers known as the "Einsatzgruppen". <P>Units which were formed by Himmler and Heydrich immediately before the invasion of the East/Soviet Union and which followed the advancing German Armies. <P>"In depth" is a term that is perhaps sometimes mis-used, but it is deeply appropriate when applied here to this disturbing, detailed study of what can only be described as "cold blooded murder" by these SS murder squads. <P>This thoroughly researched and extremely well written book is at times a "heavy" and "difficult" read. Nevertheless it is indeed a major contribution towards the study of the Nazi Holocaust which describes the construction and utilisation of these Nazi murder squads. <P>Units cited in this work as often consisting of many professional, "educated" men such as lawyers, doctors, architects etc., and who participated in an acutely "personal" manner of murder where some 1.5 million men, women and children were barbarically executed by shooting. <P>The bodies of their victims described as then being disposed of in "killing pits" (often anti-tank ditches, natural ravines or freshly dug pits). Many of the mass graves each containing many thousands of innocent victims, frequently shot one by one and buried layer upon layer. Many of these graves are still marked as memorials to this day. Photographs of some are included in this book. <P>One such massacre described in the book is that at Babi Yar. A ravine where Jewish men, women, and children were systematically machine-gunned in a two-day orgy of execution. <P>Here the Jews in their thousands, with such pathetic belongings as they could carry, were herded into barbed-wire areas at the top of the ravine, guarded by Ukrainian collaborators. There they were stripped of their clothes and beaten, then led in irregular squads down the side of the ravine. The first groups were forced to lie on the ground, face down, and were machine-gunned by the Germans who kept up a steady volley. Their bodies were covered with thin layers of earth and the next groups were ordered to lie over them, to be similarly murdered. To carry out the murder of 34,000 human beings in the space of two days in such a manner is difficult to comprehend. Indeed, much of this book is so disturbing that it is frequently only possible to read in small sections at a time.<P>Photographs are provided showing how some of the 1.5 million innocent Jews and innocent Poles and Russians were marched to such "pits" as these before being lined up and summarily executed. The task of these Units was to kill the Jews on the spot - but not only Jews; communists, Gypsies, political leaders, and the intelligentsia were also killed. The book also describes the beginning of the use of mobile gas "killing vans" where the victims carried in sealed areas to the rear were subjected to the vehicles' exhaust fumes.<P>The graphic detail provided in this work is in itself difficult to read and might upset many readers, but the author makes no effort to trivialise the suffering of the utterly defenceless victims and the cold blooded barbarity of their executors.<P>Many eyewitness accounts and testimonies of those who participated in the slaughter have been uncovered and are used to provide an essential reference and authenticity to the context of this presentation.<P>Early on in the book the writer provides a commentary on the nature of violence and how these "ordinary" men became capable of carrying out such atrocities. The study further documents the impact of these mass murders on the individual perpetrators and the ensuing psychological traumas that many endured. Some readers might disagree with the conclusions drawn here or like myself feel uneasy with the section of the book which tries to fathom the mind-set of these murderers.<P>The study makes specific mention of how Adolf Hitler cherished a fanatic hatred of the Jews and how he personally ensured that the highest priority was placed on their total elimination. The book also analyses how Hitler also intended to enslave and destroy with privation the far more numerous Slavic peoples as well. This is an extremely powerful book and a necessary addition to anyone's library on the Holocaust. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>Richard Rhodes has dealt with violent topics in the past but nothing matches the horrors committed in this book on such a personal level. Masters of Death (The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust) will bring the reader quite close to the horrificly committed mass murders from both the perspectivie of the killers and the victims (of those very few who managed to survive). There is a little pyschobabble near the beginning mixed in with small bios of Hitler and Himmler that does not entirely hold together but it is minimal and, in no way, interferes with the important story told here. The author shows how the killing of Jews in Eastern Europe developed the methods and hardened the men, by making horror routine, to the Holocaust that followed of whiich these first years of killings were a part. This book is an important addition to Holocaust literature by an accomplished writer. This book is both very hard to read and difficult to put down.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book on an occasion when my choices were to wait or to wait while reading and no other available book exceeded that rather low standard of appealing to me more than this one. I was therefore surprised to discover that this is a quite good book. There is enough gore to satiate the most fiendish of ghouls while providing analysis sufficient to challenge the intellect. But I come not to praise this book, but to criticize it. <P>In a prior review, Mythbuster notes the error of stating that it was the US that declared war on Germany rather than the reality that Germany declared war on the US. When I read Mythbuster's review, I believed he was excessively nitpicking regarding a collateral issue but I was wrong. The author argues that it was the US's decision to declare war on Germany that fulfilled in Hitler's mind the precondition of the Holocaust that the Jews plunge the world into another world war and thus decided Hitler to exterminate not only the Eastern Jews but also the Jews of Western Europe. Although the author does not so argue, this error allows the argument that it was the United States rather than the Nazis who caused the Holocaust. While such an argument may be clearly facetious to the objective reader, the Holocaust deniers are well known to misquote or quote out of context Holocaust experts in their quest to absolve the Nazis of guilt. The author has thus added an arrow to the quiver of the pseudo-historians.<P>Further this error on such a basic point causes one to question the veracity of details provided elsewhere in the book. Part of the strength of this book is the insight into the details of the lives and crimes of perpetrators and victims, but can we believe them? For example, Himmler is presented as being so traumatized by Hitler's order to exterminate the Eastern Jews in the spring of 1941 that he was forced to his bed by stomach cramps but can we rely on both the author's statements of fact and then his interpretation of those facts? <P>As prior reviewer Barron Laycock notes, this book assumes rather than argues the functionalist rather than the intentionalist view of the Holocaust. That view will certainly anger some. (See Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners for a good argument of the intentionalist school.) The purpose of this book, however, is not to argue either the functionalist view or the intentionalist view, nor even to provide a history of the Holocaust. A major theme, if not the major theme, is the socialization of violence. Some of the theory is so obvious that one wonders why it must be stated but other aspects of the theory seem more grounded in speculation than in evidence, still more so once one gets to the error I have discussed in some detail above and which impeaches the credibility of the author enormously. <P>Overall, this is a very interesting book and but for that one error, I would have given it five stars.</span>

                    <span>I can't even begin to tell you everything that I learned from this book. "Masters of Death" was my text book for my "history of the world wars" class last semester. This book gives you an indepth look into the beginings of Himmler's S.S and their chilling crimes on humanity. "Masters of Death" is a well researched text that gives an uncanny perspective into the final solution with out beging repeative or dull. This book is full with eye witness acounts, survivor testimonies and statments from S.S officals. Backgrounds of S.S big wings like Himmler, Heydrich, and Eichmann are also included. This book doesn't pull any punches. It gives you exactly what happened how it happened. Be prepaired to read things that amaze and sadden you. This is a powerful book and you'll remember what you read long after your done. I highly recomend it.</span>

                    <span>Masters of Death is the most harrowing book I've ever come across. Many parts I had to repeat several times as I really couldn't believe what I'd just read. Some of the photographs are intensely distressing - beware, there are images you will never delete from your mind once you've seen them. I read the book for the reason that the author said he wrote it - to in a small way bear witness. Because the victims deserve their story to be told. Because although they died silently, the world should not be silent about their deaths. <P>I was in mild shock when I finally finished reading. It was like emerging from an alternate evil universe. We use the word 'evil' too lightly these days. No horror writer could even start to imagine the scale, the scope, the terrible individual detail of these crimes. <P>The magnitude of other mass killings during WWII - the millions later in the gas chambers, the suicidal infrantry assaults by the Red Army against the invading Nazis, not to mention the massive losses still resounding from WWI - for a while obscured the actions of the Einsatzgruppen. Only twenty thousand people shot here, thirty thousand people shot there. Many, many unnamed Babi Yars. Mass graves, unexhumed to this day, all over Eastern Europe. A method called 'Sardinenpackung' is perfected to fit bodies most efficiently into mass graves - a Kepler Conjecture for the evil universe. But each victim is shot singly, personally, up close - Adolf Eichmann, big picture logistics man for the Reich, is disgusted when brains splatter his coat as he inspects an execution. <P>Some very discordant things hang in the air after this book. Not a few of the Einsatzgruppen members are distressed by having to kill babies and children, notwithstanding Hitler's rationalization that the children will just grow up to avenge their parents. Impersonal gassing techniques were then developed to prevent the child-murderers suffering psychological damage from their crimes, although Himmler used such distress to back up his assertions that the SS were really decent human beings at heart - there was just this 'Jewish Problem' and, you know, somebody had to do it. Heinrich Himmler, unfit weakling and squeamish runt, the very last person to be championing genetic quality, went unpunished, as did the vast majority of the Einsatzgruppen. Taking the coward's way out, he took cyanide when captured and was dumped in an unmarked grave. "It was no killing pit, but it would do."</span>
