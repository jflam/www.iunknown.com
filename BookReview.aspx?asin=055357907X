                    <span>This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Joe Torre, through his life's journey, is in my eyes the King of the Hill.  All the things he went through in life that he conquered make him the man he is today, and what a gift the Yankees got!  <p>For everyone who said 'Joe who?' when George hired him as manager, I hope you read this book and find out the man behind #6!</span>

                    <span>Chasing the Dream is the best book I've ever read.  It let's people know that goal reaching is possible, if you work for it. I now know that I can't procrastinate practice.  If I want to achieve my dream I must work for it.  Most people believe that goal reaching is impossible, but since I've read this book, my dream is coming closer, and closer to being achived. I defiantly would like to thank Joe Torre and Tom Verducci for making my dream possible and encouraging me to get on the right track.  Thanks a million and one.  Hopefully you'll see me in the 2008 Olympics for softball (i'll be the one pitching in the final games for the USA team) :)</span>

                    <span>Joe Torre does an outstanding job of re-creating the 1996 World Series in stunning and emotional detail. He proves that baseball managers are as much team psychologists as they are the men who make decisions on the field. Clearly for Yankee fans, this book will nevertheless appeal to all baseball fans and readers.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a must for die-hard Yankee fans and admirers of Joe Torre.  Joe speaks about his life and the 1996 World Champion New York Yankees in an critically honest and emotionally revealing manner. Joe takes us on his journey in such a way that you feel as if you are side-by-side with him every step of the way.  His roller coaster journey of the highs and lows of the 1996 baseball season compounded by personal tragedy, and the miracle of his brother Frank's successful heart transplant are especially riveting.  I loved this book!</span>
