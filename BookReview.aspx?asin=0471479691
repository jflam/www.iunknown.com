                    <span>Weiss' book is a must-have for those entering, or considering, the consulting business. This is a sophisticated guide, written in an understandable way, that a new or experienced consultant can use to get a consulting pracitice launched. 
<br />
<br />Weiss covers the waterfront, as they say. His advice includes how to finance a business, where to locate a practice, how to use your expertise to create a market for your practice and how to set your fees. It's all here.
<br />
<br />The appendix includes references for trade associations, sources for advertising and a sample magazine query letter.
<br />
<br />Weiss explains his concept of "marketing gravity" to help a consultant attract new business. It's a tried and true approach, which helped Weiss build his own career. This is a book by a genuine, beeen-there and done-it consultant. The book is devoid of fluff and heavy on usable advice.

                    <span>If you've already read Getting Started in Consulting, chances are you've re-read it several times and checked out some of Alan Weiss' other books.  If you haven't read any of Weiss' books - and are a Consultant or are thinking about becoming a Consultant - this is a good place to start.  Although this book covers some common ground with Weiss' popular "Million Dollar Consulting", there's enough unique information in each to warrant reading both.<p>The book starts out auspiciously in "Chapter 1 Establishing Goals and Expectations: You Will Be What You Decide to Be, Nothing Less, Nothing More".  To support this thesis, Weiss points out that despite experts' warnings about much hard work and travel a consultant must endure for a maximum of a $300K income, he runs a 7-figure practice from his house with no staff or office.  "The problem is that if you educate yourself incorrectly at the onset, you're vulnerable to successfully meeting the exact wrong set of expectations." - Written like a true consultant.<p>The first order of business is to manage your financial situation - be prepared for a slow first year.<p>He presents the Ten Traits - "ideal consultant behaviors and attributes as they apply to a solo practitioner, based on my observations of success and failure over 27 years.... If you have a reasonable chance of performing well in these 10 areas, you've got an excellent shot at making it as a consultant.  Eight out of 10 might do it.  Less than that and you may be setting yourself up..."<p>Other important areas covered in the book are:<br>Why collaboration is often a bad idea.<br>Your office space, office equipment, and software<br>Legal, Financial and Administrative<br>The essential components of marketing and selling<p>In finding the right buyer, don't get stuck with the gatekeeper.  A number of very useful techniques are presented to identify and get past the gatekeeper, among them the simple test "If you and I reach agreement today, can we shake hands and begin tomorrow?"<p>Closing the Sale actually begins much earlier than you would think.  By the time the proposal is presented, the sale should have already been made.  The relationship building process provides the foundation for the "conceptual agreement on outcomes"; the proposal is just a formality to acknowledge that agreement.<p>Weiss explains why your proposal should be simple with no "legalese" and short (2-3 pages).<p>The key to a high-dollar practice is using a win-win pricing model where the client participates in establishing the value to the organization of what the consultant will provide.<p>Although the section "Forty Ways to Increase Your Fees" is very enticing, it's generally 40 tips to support the results-based approach, although a number of the suggestions could be used to increase the contract amount by expanding the scope/results..<p>In the latter part of the book keys top maintaining a successful practice are presented along with ways to achieve passive income which can in some cases lead to more active income business.<p>If you've read through this review to this point - why aren't you reading the book?</span>

                    <span>I have been preparing to walk away from a six-figure job and launch a consulting practice for almost a year, and during that time I read every book I could find on that profession.  Not that I believe that reading a book is all one needs to do to qualify; rather, it would be foolish not to perform as much research as possible before taking the plunge.<p>Alan Weiss' books offer the most practical, best-written and truly valuable advice I've found.  And this one is the most wide ranging for kicking off a new full-time practice.<p>And I suspect that like most works that run counter to conventional wisdom, the majority of readers will not perform the necessary "background" marketing activities, will not make their proposals the logical culmination of a collaborative sales process, and will not base their fees on demonstrated value rather than billable time.  All the better for those of us who do.<p>I followed Alan Weiss' guidelines and donated a nine-hour training program to a major non-profit group -- which will not only help some people who desperately need it, but also put me in front of a formidable board of directors for some potentially significant engagements.<p>Win-win, anybody?</span>
