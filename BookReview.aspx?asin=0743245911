                <span id="Label1">Lou Gehrig started his professional baseball career at a time when players began to be seen as national celebrities. Though this suited charismatic men such as Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, Gehrig avoided the spotlight and preferred to speak with his bat. Best known for playing in 2,130 consecutive games as well as his courage in battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a disease that now bears his name), the Iron Horse that emerges from this book is surprisingly na&#239;ve and insecure. He would cry in the clubhouse after disappointing performances, was painfully shy around women (much to the amusement of some of his teammates), and particularly devoted to his German-immigrant mother all his life. Even after earning the league MVP award he still feared the Yankees would let him go. Against the advice of Ruth and others, he refused to negotiate aggressively and so earned less than he deserved for many seasons. Honest, humble, and notoriously frugal, his only vices were chewing gum and the occasional cigarette. And despite becoming one of the finest first basemen of all time, Jonathan Eig shows how Gehrig never seemed to conquer his self-doubt, only to manage it better. <p>  Jonathan Eig's <I>Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig</I> offers a fascinating and well-rounded portrait of Gehrig, from his dugout rituals and historic games to his relationships with his mother, wife, coaches, and teammates. His complex friendship with Ruth, who was the polar opposite to Gehrig in nearly every respect, is given particularly vivid attention. Take this revealing description of how the two men began a barnstorming tour together following their 1927 World Series victory: "Ruth tipped the call girls and sent them on their way. Gehrig kissed his mother goodbye." Eig also shares some previously unknown details regarding his consecutive games streak and how he dealt with ALS during the final years of his life. Rich in anecdotes and based on hundreds of interviews and 200 pages of recently discovered letters, the book effectively shows why the Iron Horse remains an American icon to this day. <I>--Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>This is an amazing book.  Eig has done a ton of research (check out the list of primary sources in the back!), and lets you see Gehrig as a man, not just through his stats as a baseball player.  After reading this book, I really felt like I had some insight into Lou Gehrig's personality, his upbringing, his motivation, and especially his courage as he faced a slow death from ALS.  By seeing Gehrig as a complete person, including his faults, I believe Gehrig becomes even more of a hero.
<br />
<br />This book is very well written and could be enjoyed by baseball historians, casual fans, and those who might only know the name Lou Gehrig.  I'm proud to have this book on my shelf next to great baseball writers like Lawrence Ritter, Robert Creamer, and Harold Seymour.</span>

                    <span>Lou was brought up in the early 1900's-1910's in the (then)German immigrant section of Yorkville-NYC. His father appears as a ne'er do well, his mother a hard worker doing about anything to keep her family going. In fact, many of Lou's siblings died  of childhood diseases now hardly ever killers. So Lou had more than the usual obstacles to overcome. Fortunately, Lou's mom got a job working as a housekeeper at a Columbia fraternity, which helped Lou into the Columbia extension school program. Definitely not a great scholar, Lou was a record smashing player at Columbia, at first shunned by scouts because he had a tough time hitting a curve ball, a problem Lou worked on, and eliminated. Shy and introspective,somewhat of a mama's boy, the portrayal in THE MOVIE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES seems very close to the mark! When Wally Pipp, a very formidible Yanks 1st Baseman, was injured, it seemed clear as day that Lou would take over for a long time, 2130 games to be exact! The "Quiet Man" of the great Yank teams of the 1920's and 1930's proved to be the perfect man for the job, a nice foil to the wild and crazy Babe Ruth! Lou's long career and life are beautifully done, through his famous LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE speech, and his sad and slow death of  Lou Gehrigs Disease.A perfect biography, and with a photo of an upcoming singer/actor/autograph seeker named Frank Sinatra with Lou from the 1939 World Series. Needless to say, how many Pro Athletes today have the character of LOU GEHRIG!  </span>

                    <span>This book is a marvelous, life-enriching reading experience, and a sports classic that should stand for years to come. I read a childhood biography of Gehrig by Van Riper at the age of 8 or 9 that left me hooked on reading in general and Gehrig in particular, and this is the bio he has deserved and I have longed for, for years. Highest recommendation!</span>

                    <span>This is what baseball should be all about. Completely steroid-free. A classic. One of the baseball books that I highly recommend this year. Ironically, another is BLOOD FUED: The Red Sox, the Yankees and the Struggle of Good vs Evil. Two great summer reads!</span>

                    <span>Author Jonathan Eig has written a nice tribute to the player they called "The Iron Horse", Lou Gehrig. Gehrig would have stood out in his life and career, anyway, but his tragic, early death made him that much more of an attractive and historic figure in baseball.
<br />
<br />The first two thirds of "Luckiest Man" describe Gehrig as a shy but pleasant sort of person....the antithesis of Babe Ruth. That the two men ever got along is astonishing. Gehrig's closeness to his mother is revealing, but not surprising, given the make-up of his character. Yet Eig's narrative here is ploddy and uninspiring. Turning the pages in this part of the book is not something one does grippingly.
<br />
<br />However, the final chapters of "Luckiest Man" suddenly come alive as Gehrig begins to confront his disease and his destiny. Eig's narrative changes....the sentences become longer and his words take on a propelling force. The author's description of "Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day" at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 fills in many of the gaps for those of us who have seen the few snippets of film from that day. Best of all, Gehrig's conversations and  letters to his doctors at the Mayo Clinic, especially Dr. Paul O'Leary, have a poignant quality and Eig begs the question, "to what extent did the doctors tell Gehrig that his demise was most likely to occur?" and "how much could Gehrig surmise about his own condition?" These questions make a central, compelling case to read "Luckiest Man".</span>
