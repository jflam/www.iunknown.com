                <span id="Label1">Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the  stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <I>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</I>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p>  A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <I>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</I>, first published in England as <I>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</I>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> and  <i>Harry Potter and the  Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. (Ages 8 to 13) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>The Harry Potter Series are excellant books that I would recommend to anyone, any age.  The story is not only entertaining, but you can learn a lot too!  You see true friendships.  People change friends all the time, but Harry Potter shows us how important it is to have people close to you.  You always need someone to trust, back you up, and confide in.  Harry Potter also teaches us bravery.  Harry risks his life for the lives of others.  He is dependable and honest without being fake.  Today, on television, the "hero" is always portrayed as someone who doesn't make mistakes and gets everything they want.  Harry Potter shows us a real hero in a young boy who learns from his mistakes and has suffered personal loses.  Everytime I read this book, I learn a new lesson that I can use for the rest of my life.  </span>

                    <span>J.K. Rowling will be one of the best known authors for centuries.
<br />
<br />If you wonder why I say that, you may not have read any of the Harry Potter books yet.  The first book in the series will get your attention in the first few pages, and won't let go.  An orphaned child is introduced...one that survives what killed his parents...is ill-treated by the relatives that are supposed to care for him...only to find he is being looked after by those that live in a world apart the entire time.
<br />
<br />He does find friendship, love, purpose, and adventure beyond his expectations...and takes part in a battle between good and evil...a battle that will define his life from that point.
<br />
<br />There are many that put Harry Potter down, as a series, because they believe children should not be exposed to sorcery, witchcraft, etc, but this series no more indoctrinates a child in witchcraft than Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  It, in fact, is somewhat reminiscent of the grandeur and moral dilemma of that classic.
<br />
<br />You will be the better for beginning, and continuing with, this series...and it's for kids of ALL ages.</span>

                    <span>accurate.  As a young-at-heart 65 year old woman who grew up being read to, and ultimately reading from, ALL the OZ books and who discovered the Tolkein Stories in when I was 35 years old, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE these Harry Potter stories.  I have the Audio CD of Book #1 and I would listen to it, while curled up with my cat for a nap in the afternoons.  We both looked forward to the experience, and I've missed 'our Harry' since we've finished the last CD.  I thoroughly recommend this story of persons of ALL AGES.  One can never been too old to enjoy good imagination and story telling.  Thank you Ms. Rowling.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book in Ireland where the title is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone makes more sense in overall mythology than the Sorcerer's Stone, but I suppose that the American publishers were afraid that Americans would not understand. How patronizing -- the book has legs like a centipede and wouldn't have any difficulty under the other name. It is formulaic, definitely, but that does not diminish its excellence. The story is wonderful and the formula works like a charm. Part of the charm is in the details -- like the list of stuff that Harry has to take to school. Among other things, he needs a cauldron, pewter, size 2. A reader may then imagine a whole line of cauldrons, sizes 1 - 10, made from diverse materials such as cast iron, bronze, pewter, brass, and stone. The mystery grips yopung and old alike.  I can't wait to read Harry Potter and the Secret Chambers, and the following novels in the serries.</span>
