                    <span>I bought this book a few years ago, and I was like, wow! now I get to learn all about trigonometry and inequalities and polynomials! gee whiz! but reading it, I found that the explanations weren't deep enough to actually TEACH me the concepts, that there weren't enough excercizes for people new to the algebra, and it wasn't until I finished my Algebra 1 class last year that I could fully understand the topics covered in this book, because I had learned all of them during the year(i.e. polynomails, quadratic equation). Looking back at this book, I think, however, that it is a good review book, in part because its coverage of topics is so superficial. So, if you've seen the stuff in this book before (algebraic expressions, equations, exponents, roots, logarithms, polynomails, inequalities, permutations, combinations, binomial therom, plane,solid and analytic geometry, parabolas, conics, trigonometry of degrees, radians) then you'll understand them, but if you haven't, go buy another book with better (and more) excercizes, more accurate answers to them, and better explanations.</span>

                    <span>I began this book in the fouth grade. I wanted to excel in mathematics and geometry. Answers were somewhat accuarate; when they were not I was utterly perplexed. <p>The Algebra section was clear; I often needed to re-read sections to understand information expressed.  Geometry was almost clear,  again I needed to re-read and was sometimes confused. Analytic geometry was  very puzzling- I needed adult assistace. Trig was very clear, and I now  have a good grip on trig. Readers for this book should consider buying  another ^workbook^ as to achieve stronger levels of understanding from  practice. Being determined to understand, this was essential.</span>

                    <span>I am willing to give this book three stars because it provides a good review of high school math.  I bought it as a warm up for future studies on Calculus and for preparation for the GRE.<p>However, there are several  wrong anwers that I have seen in the book.  I am grateful to the Princeton  Review for confirming these mistakes by e-mail for me.<p>For those of you  who decide to get the book, here they are:<p>1) page 26, #7, x= -10/3 (not  10/3)<p>2) page 28, #5, should be -3x squared -2x +1 over 2x squared  -2x<p>3) page 120, exercise 8.4, #1, should be 64 (not 32)<p>Part of the  problem here may be the fact that the author, Marcia Lerner, only has a  Bachelor's degree.  The publisher, Princeton Review, should consider hiring  people with at least Master's degrees in the future.  "Math Smart  II" is marginally acceptable as a learning tool.<p>I did find that it  was more helpful in studying for the GRE math section than the Princeton  Review's "Cracking the GRE CAT."  That's because with that book  (and some other GRE books), the idea is to teach you the best strategy for  answering the questions rather than making sure you understand all the  concepts behind the answers.  So in that aspect, "Math Smart II"  can be of help for GRE test takers.</span>

                    <span>I love using this book to present my daughter with sample problems for test review or when I think the school is not teaching at the level of my expectations.  My daughter is in 7th grade, I think this book may be  elementary for high school students, however.  Still could provide good  review problems at test time.</span>

                    <span>This book provides the basics required for higher level mathematics. It breaks down the concepts so that they can be better understood, without simplifying them beyond use. Good for a high school review, and preparation  for pre-calculus. The style of the prose is easy going, upbeat and contains  even a hint of humor, which makes understanding the sections more  enjoyable. It should be noted that a mathematical background, pre-algebra,  is assumed, and answers are not given for all questions. Not meant for  those interested in reviewing pre-calc or calculus.</span>
