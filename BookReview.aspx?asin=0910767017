                <span id="Label1">Entrepreneurial daring, irrepressible enthusiasm and a dash  of good luck gave America its first 24 hour sports network in 1979,  This  book is about the agony and the ecstasy, the excitement, effort and  frustration that led to the launch of the Worldwide Leader in Sports.  <P>A $9,000 credit card advance, a landfill in Bristol, CT, new satellite  technology and a father and son's unshakeable belief in the insatiable  appetite of America's sports fans came together to fuel an incredible  journey....a journey  that culminated in ESPN's inaugural show at 7:00 PM  (EDT) Friday, September 7, 1979.</span>

                    <span>This book is a grand slam, buzzer beater, hat-trick of a story. Not only a great sports read about the birth of ESPN (the worldwide leader in sports), it also tells the tale of how dedicated entrepeneurship can lead to great success. It shows how a vision or concept for a product or service can be acheived through the hard work of a few individuals. It is a true American story, for only in America can a business like ESPN be started, nurtured and grown.<P>This book is more than a great sports or business story. It also tells the tale of the individuals involved in the story and makes you want to find out more about them. It is a great read which I could not put down and I often still refer to it in my business life. This book has served as a great inspiration for me as an entrepeneur, and should do likewise for others interested in seeing their vision become a business success.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading the birth of ESPN immensely. It is great to see two guys go from being a play by play man and public address announcer to high rollers in the business world. This is truly an American success story. Bill and Scott have proven that the "American Dream" is still possible.</span>

                    <span>"As a fan who has never known the world without ESPN, I was both fascinated and amazed to learn that it all began just over 20 years ago. I thought it had been around forever! Apparently there wasn't much to cable television back then. Guys like Rasmussen and other cable pioneers were real believers and thanks to their efforts we have 24 hour sports, news and movies today. Reading about the people who made the decisions, the people who didn't believe it would work and the frantic efforts to get ESPN up and running is not only informative, but entertaining.<P>A look at the September 1979 program schedule in the book is a real eye-opener. No NFL, MLB, NBA or NHL back then. Irish Hurling, Austrailian Rules Football and Kick Boxing were regular fare. The NCAA was a somewhat tentative partner with tape-delayed football games every night of the football season. Wow, how the world of TV sports has changed over these last 20 years. <P>If you enjoy reading a good tale this is your kind of book. Adversity, disappointment, joy, frustration, anxiety and elation all come through. This book is a must read for anyone who claims to be an avid ESPN fan."</span>
