                <span id="Label1">As William A. Kappele reminds us in the introduction to  Rockhounding Utah, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Accordingly,  he gives us "just the facts" that rockhounds need to know to find their  way to the best collecting sites in the Beehive State and what mineral  samples, rocks, and formations are to be found there.  Still, most  readers will find between the lines that Kappele can't quite squelch  his enthusiasm for the grandeur of Utah's exposed formations, its  canyon walls etched with fossils, and the spires and arches of the  Needles District in Canyonlands National Park. Kappele, who has  traveled the western United States for 30 years in search of rocks,  gems, and other lapidary pleasures, brings his experience to bear on  Utah's 54.4 million acres, providing detailed descriptions of 86 sites.   Each description includes concise information on the material to be  found there, the tools to bring, the best season to visit, the vehicle  to drive, or when a remote find suggests it's time to lace up the  hiking boots.  Readers can glean new insights into the obsidian of the  Black Rock sites, jasper at Hell's Backbone, petrified wood at Bullfrog  Turnoff, and fossils of sea lilies along the Wasatch Range. May your  journeys be fruitful and your bag be heavy on the way home.  Somewhere  in that bag among your rocks, we hope you haven't forgotten your copy  of Rockhounding Utah.</span>

                    <span>I found the book to be very useful in finding sites to look for rocks and fossils during a recent trip to Utah. The directions to the sites were clear, and advice on conditions helpful. All of the sites I visited (10-12)were as described and productive, particularly when viewed as jumping off points to explore. The only thing I would ask for are more sites and a wider variety of things to look for. Two weeks more of vacation would be nice, as well. While I'm asking, gas money and a mailer to avoid carrying 25 lbs. of rocks home on the plane...</span>

                    <span>I found this book very useful in exploring the different sites in Utah. I have only been to a few sites but was not disappointed in the results. One should read the Forward/Intro section. It has good tips on the Utah and it's climate that literally could be a life saver. <BR>The author has put a real effort in listing the different sites and given good directions. I like the site format including the elevation and the best time to collect. I used it to visit Utah in early March and petrified wood from sand creek. I have given the book a four star rating due to it's age. It was published in 1996 so it's seven years old at this writing. the Utah sites still seem to be intact compared to the sites in New Mexico and Colorado. As I have suggested in my other reviews I would like to see GPS Coordinates for Main turn offs and the initial starting points at a collecting site. The forest service/BLM has a habit of closing roads. and there are Vandals that deface signs right when you need them the most. I also use the GPS Data for mapping software at home before the trip. preplanning at home beats driving 10 miles of washboard and dust on the wrong road.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very helpful in finding rock-collecting sites in Utah. It has directions to the collecting sites, information about near by attractions, tools needed, elevations, driving conditions and best time of year to go. I use the book religiously when I'm out and about. I give it a 4 star rating, and could have been a 5 star rating had the pictures of the rock specimen been in color, instead of black and white =)</span>
