                <span id="Label1">Never Be Boring Again is unlike other books on presentation skills because it focuses on strategic storytelling for business professionals. It targets speakers, trainers, entrepreneurs, salespeople and executives and teaches them how to choose, craft and deliver a story that makes a point, teaches a lesson or sells a product. It introduces a breakthrough approach from a dynamic new voice.</span>

So much more than the others that are very basic and all common sense.  This has 'stuff' you can use!</span>

                    <span>People love stories. That's why the 'Chicken Soup for the Soul' books are so popular. But even better than reading a great story is the experience of seeing and hearing a story performed by a skilled story teller.<p>Doug Stevenson knows how to make a story come to life, and in 'Never Be Boring Again,' he shows you how you can do it, too. He makes the process (almost!) painless, even if you are not a natural story teller.<p>This is not a book about how to give a speech. It is a detailed how-to about making powerful connections with your audience through vivid and engaging stories. And it's not just 'rah-rah.' Doug walks you through the nine steps of story structure to help you craft stories that will engage listeners and get your point across.  He shows how to incorporate The Phrase That Pays-a message that your listeners will remember and take with them. Then, Doug helps you use your body, voice and emotions to deliver a presentation that will hold the attention of any audience.<p>If you have ever watched a gifted speaker hold an audience in the palm of his hand, and wanted to know how you could do that, too, this is the book you have been waiting for. Don't wait any longer. Put Doug Stevenson's powerful Story Theater Method to work for you.<p>Cathy Stucker<br>Author, Speaker and Consultant</span>

                    <span>Doug Stevenson's book "Never Be Boring Again" makes a pretty bold claim.  One thing that I learned in my childhood is if you are going to make a bold claim you had better be able to back it up because someone will call you on it.  Then again you can get away with making a claim like that when you can back it up and Doug Stevenson does exactly that.  If you've done much public speaking at all you know that it is easy to tell if you have an audience eating out of your hand or if you are losing them.  The problem is finding a way to consistently keep your audience interested.<p>This is the same problem that has been around forever in the theater industry.  How do you get your audience involved in the story?  Well, actually that is the answer.  People get involved in stories.  Lists of numbers are useless unless they can be converted to an illustration that points out their effect.  Using his "Story Theater Method" as the base on which to build, Stevenson takes the reader on a trip into the world of preparing powerful, effective presentations that lead people to action.  Stories involve the audience and once it is involved the audience will pay attention.  When the audience pays attention they remember the phrases you use and your "phrase that pays" has the effect you desire.  <p>I had the opportunity over the last few weeks to try a presentation to various groups.  So, I tried to redo part of it using the techniques in the book.  The bottom line was that a great deal more of the people remembered much more of the presentation in the group where the techniques were used.  They also asked more and better questions because they had been listening throughout the presentation.<p>"Never Be Boring Again" deserves the highest recommendation that I can give and should be required reading for anyone who is not a hermit because we are always speaking to an audience, even if it is just one person.</span>

                    <span>This book gots me going in the right direction from the very beginning.  It not only describes what to do, it showed me how to do it to make my presentation better.  The clear and concise descriptions, through the use of examples and stories, made it  easy to relate to.  The book provided the steps needed for me to develop and craft my story.  Then I learned how to make it come alive.  The book is an excellent teaching tool for those of us who love a "show me how" book.  It's easier for me to make the connection with my audience now that I understand how to do it.  The added value I received of developing a powerful presentation was well worth the investment of time to read it.</span>
