                    <span>I'm now placing my order for my sixth consecutive yearly training diary. It's easy to use, attractively designed and there's plenty of room for recording your daily runs. I use all the charts in the back: the week-by-week mileage chart, the training mileage graph, record of races, pr chart. The pacing charts and race time comparison and predictor charts are indispensable (yes, you can find this info on the web, but it's great to have right here in the book for when you are traveling). <P>Every runner should keep a log like this. It helps keep you motivated and see your progress.</span>

                    <span>Finally, a logbook that has charts for the slower runners of this world! Somebody finally realizes that not everybody runs a 9:00 minute mile! Thank you!</span>

                    <span>I was very disappointed with the Runner's Training Diary, particularly with the "log" portion of the book. The design seemed dated and too confining. I never had enough room to write much, and it was visually unpleasant with its boxes of various grey shadings for the different categories. I did find the articles and charts generally useful, but to me, the "log" portion is the heart of any logbook, and I ended up ditching my Training Diary and bought The Ultimate Runner's Journal, which was much more flexible, has a much "cleaner" design, great articles, and included color pictures to boot!</span>

                    <span>Over the years I have used a number of different types of journals to log my workouts (including electronic logs), and this one is far and away the best I have found. I am going on my 3rd volume in a few weeks. I love the flexibility and ease of use of the training diary section, and the wealth of helpful information for pacing and training included in the back.</span>
