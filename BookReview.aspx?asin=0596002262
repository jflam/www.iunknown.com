                <span id="Label1"><i>Enterprise JavaBeans</i> was recently voted "Best Java Book" by the  editors and readers of Java Developer's Journal. Readers of JavaPro named  it the "Best Java Book for Experts." And Amazon.com included it in the  Top Computer Books for 2000. Now the best only gets better! In the new 3rd  edition, <i>Enterprise JavaBeans</i> has been completely revised and updated  with a thorough introduction to the new 2.0 version of the EJB specification.  Significantly different from the earlier version, the 2.0 specification  introduces three dramatic improvements: A completely new version of  container-managed persistence; local interfaces; and a totally new kind  of bean called the "message driven bean." Enterprise JavaBeans, 3rd  edition, provides a thorough discussion of these changes, along with an  architecture overview, information on resource management and primary  services, design strategies, and XML deployment descriptors.</span>

                    <span>I'd tend to agree with an earlier reviewer that this is a much overrated book. The explanations are too verbose and repetitive to the point of being a little irritating. The book starts with a rather shallow overview of various distributed object architectures (CORBA, COM) and component transaction monitors(MTS and the CORBA component model), followed by two reasonably well written chapters on EJB architecture - the next three chapters are hands-on stuff where you have to wade through tedious and lengthy explanations to get at the key ideas involved in developing session and entity beans. The chapter on transactions contains some useful information, but again is characterised by agonizingly verbose explanations(for a much better and concise review of transactions in EJB, refer to the transactions chapter in the J2EE Blueprints book authored by Nick Casseem and others - if you want the nitty-gritty details refer to the specs). The chapter on design strategies is disappointing - it hardly provides any useful strategies or tips except the idea on business interfaces which tries to maintain a clean separation between the container methods and the business methods by providing a placeholder for the business methods in a separate interface. For a more relevant overview of EJB design strategies, see the 'Architect's corner' article on Java Report issue of September 2000. <P>To sum it up - the chapters on EJB architecture are quite ok but the rest of the material can be compressed in half the size of the book. As of now, this one has to do in the absence of any other decent book on EJB in the market.</span>

                    <span>This book gives an excellent overview of Enterprise JavaBeans and their applications. At all times the author does an effective job of relating to the reader the concepts behind this new methodology. Even performance issues involved with the utilization of Enterprise JavaBeans is discussed briefly in the book and both versions 1.0 and 1.1 are covered. The reader is expected to be an expert in the Java programming language, and have familiarity with the JDBC API or SQL. <P> 	The author begins Chapter 1 with an introduction to distributed objects, server-side components, and component transaction monitors (application servers). Enterprise JavaBeans is defined as a server-side component model for component transaction monitors. The standard 3-tier architecture is illustrated, along with definitions of stub and skeleton, and the RMI protocol. Effective diagrams and Java source code are used to describe the distributed object model. The chapter ends with a defense of using server-side components and the author employs an imaginary business application as an illustration of the concepts. This example is expanded upon throughout the rest of the book. <P> 	The architecture of EJB is covered in Chapter 2, with entity beans and session beans the two main components. The author carefully distinguishes between these two bean types. The remote interface, the home interface, the bean class, and the primary key are all described in detail and the author shows how to build a bean with relevant Java code. Deployment descriptors, which enable customization of software behavior at runtime, and JAR files, used for packaging Java classes, are both treated in detail. The author is careful also to distinguish the differences between 1.0 and 1.1. <P> 	The resource management capability of component transaction monitors are discussed in the next chapter. Application performance is critically dependent on this capability, and the author stresses the benefits of using EJB servers to meet the heavy load requirements while still maintaining optimum performance. State transition diagrams are effectively employed to explain instance swapping, the activation mechanism, concurrency, and persistence of beans. Security of EJB is also discussed with authentication, access control, and secure communication being supported. <P>	In the next chapter the example business application is used to guide the reader through the actual development of an entity bean and a session bean. Again, two different versions of the beans are developed, depending on whether 1.0 or 1.1 is used. <P>	JNDI is used in the next chapter to give an overview of beans from the clients perspective, and allows the application to view the EJB server as a collection of directories. After locating and obtaining the remote reference to the EJB home using JDNI, a remote reference to the bean can then be obtained. State transition diagrams are again employed to illustrate the Java RMI serialization and remote reference. <P> 	The author returns to a more detailed discussion of entity beans in Chapter 6. He outlines the advantages of using entity beans instead of accessing the database directly. Container-managed and bean-managed persistence are thoroughly treated, and the author shows how Create methods come into play for both of these beans. A nice state transition diagram is given for the life cycle of an entity bean along with a detailed description on what causes transitions among the different states. <P>	Session beans are then the topic of Chapter 7, and the author discusses when to use session beans versus entity beans. In addition, the other properties of session beans are discussed and the lifecycles of both a stateless session bean and a stateful session are given in terms of state transition diagrams. <P>	Transactions are discussed in the next chapter, with the concept of declarative transaction management discussed, which allows the transactional behavior to be controlled using the deployment descriptor. The author details the advantages of employing declarative transaction management. Effective diagrams are employed to illustrate transaction attributes. In addition, isolation and database locking is discussed in detail along with explicit transaction management. The later is used with the Java Transaction API used by EJB to deal explicitly with transactions. A very useful state transition diagram is given for the transactional stateful session bean. <P> 	The next two chapters are written from a design perspective, and discuss how to solve particular design problems, working with specific databases, and XML deployment descriptors. These chapters are specialized discussions and are geared toward those who are actually involved in the designing and coding of EJB applications. The author does address how to improve performance with session beans, treating in particular the network traffic and latency issues, and resource consumption. Method calls on a remote reference will initiate a remote method invocation loop, which will send streamed data from the stub to the server and then back to the stub, and thus consume bandwidth. Network traffic will mushroom as more clients create more beans, update their states, and request information. Reducing the EJB network traffic is a challenge to the application developer and many proposals have been given on the Web and in the literature for how to best do this. Network modelers have to pay particular attention to these issues when EJB is being deployed in an application to be run over a network. <P> The last chapter covers the J2EE with discussions of servlets, application client components, and connectivity. <P> There are very useful appendices inserted at the end, especially Appendix B, which gives the state and sequence UML diagrams for all of the bean types discussed in the book. Appendix D is also useful since it discusses the new features available in EJB 1.1.</span>
