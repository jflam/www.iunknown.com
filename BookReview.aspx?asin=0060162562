                    <span>I got this book at my local public library from a general search I was doing in the catalog. I enjoy books in the vein of neurological anecdotes like those of Oliver Sacks.<P>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and decided early on the I would be sure to write a review to share this find with other readers.<P>I was thrilled by this book. Each of the cases presented is well written and interesting. He tells the story of his acquaintance with a subject or theme, events surrounding the case, what conclusions he considered, what diagnosis he chose; also includes historical information on many neurological diseases covered.<P>The author manages to include a distinctly human touch without straying long from the science. A bonus was the "author's notes" at the end of each chapter. These included things like follow-up reading, post mortems, related tales, retrospective comments.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Klawans articulately presents several more neurological case studies in this follow-up book to Toscanini's Fumble. Not all of them involve his own patients - some discuss historical figures such as Isaac Newton or the biblical figure of Joshua. Dr. Klawans' thorough studies and insightful commentary make this enjoyable reading for medical professionals and laymen alike. I think it slightly better than Toscanini's Fumble, even though both are occasionally given to hubris and a little too much self-certainty. The chapters are not too long and the writing is crisp, so this would make a good Christmas or birthday present.</span>
