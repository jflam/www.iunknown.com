                    <span>Another great treasure of poems translated by Bill Porter. I believe this could be the best of the lot. These poems are tough, gentle & uncomprimising. I've gone through them several times always at ease and also alert.They truly come from the void, the Tao, whatever that is or isn't. Like notes from shakuhachi: soft ,dim slow quick, sloping, climbing. This man was a teacher of many and yet also a true recluse shutting or opening his brushwood door. I wish as many people were interested in such things as the usual pop culture non-sense. Oh well this stuff is not called esoteric for nothing.</span>

                    <span>I have owned this book for about three years and I still enjoy reading from it.
<br />Mr. Porter (Red Pine) really puts his heart into his work and this is another brilliant example. </span>

                    <span>From the books of Zen I've read, it always seemed to me that only the  ancient writers have had the most impact. See if you will agree by reading  this insightful book. It also includes a fascinating biography of this  humble man.</span>

                    <span>Red Pine(the translator) is an american with years of study in Taiwan.  His translations(the poetry in this volume a superb re-working of his earlier version)are like a clear window through which we can see the  day-to-day living of a fully enlightened zen master.  This volume includes  considerable additional poetry and a number of "teachings" copied  down by his students. If you are interested in Zen this should be an early  addition to your shelf. If I could keep only l book on zen it would be  this(or even just the poetry) as it not only says everything necessary  about zen but allows you to watch it being lived out.</span>
