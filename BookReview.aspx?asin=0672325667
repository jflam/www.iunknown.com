                    <span>When I started to discuss the topic of regular expressions to my students I noticed some fear and eyes starting to glaze over so I went and purchased a copy for every student in my class.  It was small and affordable. Now I have a class room of students that are on their way to being savvy programmers or at least ones smart enough to keep a copy of this book nearby whenever arcane syntax like an RE passes their way. I highly recommend this book for folks learning all about regular expressions.</span>

                    <span>It was is good for me, but great for explaining regular expressions to our customers. It reads easilly enough that we can allow end users to use Reg Exps in settings; minimizing how much monkey code we had to write to allow end users to search for patterns in text (their barcodes).
<br />
<br />However, one of the credit card algorithms (Discover I think) does need to be updated to accomodate a new series of numbers. So verify the CC patterns before you use it in your ecommerce exception handling code, you could P.O. a potential customer...</span>

                    <span>Regular Expressions is a mechanism for working with strings and text. It's a powerful language for different kinds of matching within the text. For example to match e-mail address one could use the following RegEx: (\w+\.)*\w+@(\w+\.)+[A-Za-z]+
<br />
<br />For a person not familiar with Regular Expressions it probably looks complicated. This book educates how to build regular expressions like that and other kinds, and it does it very well.
<br />
<br />The book quickly explains fundamentals, and starts teaching Regular Expressions from the easiest examples, building up to more advanced topics gradually. The chapters are structured as lessons that allow developers to get up to speed with Regular Expressions quickly, at the same time the book doubles as a handy reference.
<br />
<br />Advancement of .NET technology, which includes built in support for Regular Expressions, opens up new possibilities for programming with languages that previously had no Regular Expressions support, or such support had to be obtained through third party libraries, often limited. That's why Regular Expressions are as popular as ever, and this book does a great job brining developers up to speed with this exciting and time saving tool.

                    <span>If you haven't used regular expressions in a while and need a quick refresher or you're just starting out then buy this book! It's quick and easy to read. Once you're done with this book then you'll be immediately productive for the task at hand. You'll even be unintimidated by those higher level books. This may be a small inexpensive book but it offers so much and is worth more than you'll pay. Ben Forta writes this book in a manner where his examples can be used by many programming languages. He discusses the nuances of each language and even provides a link to a user friendly regular expression tester for each language which can save you a lot of time.</span>

                    <span>Regular expressions come up in many popular editors, search engines,and parsers. Knowing regular expressions can make your favorite tool even more of a favorite. Knowing them as a programmer can also make you a more productive programmer. Instead of writing your own parser, simply use a regular expression with your favorite programming language such as PERL, PHP, Java, Python, etc.<p>This book is a very handy guide to get you up and running quickly<br>with regular expressions. It's not comprehensive but it's likely to tell you just what you need to know 90% of the time. It quickly, concisely covers the basics: pattern matching for single, multiple, or sets of characters, repeats, certain types of characters such as digits, the nth occurrence, and nesting. The book has examples of everything it covers with a thoughtful analysis.<p>As a surprise bonus, this book comes with two appendices. It tells you how to use regular expressions in popular tools and languages such as grep, MySQL, and Java. It also gives the pattern matches for common items such as zip codes, phone numbers, IP addresses, e-mails, comments, and credit card numbers. I recommend this book to anyone who ever needs to find a string quickly out of a bunch of text.</span>
