                    <span>Wow, this book took me way back to the 80's. It also has a strong positive message that our youth need to hear and read about cause they are our future and that street life ain't gon get where ya think ya want to go.  Congrats! Jihad for a book well wrote, I know it is hard to put ya self out there but you you did a dayum good job. It also shows that this is just the beginning so keep'em comin no turning back now.

                    <span>I think Street Life is such a good book. After I read that book it made me stop and think. One message that he sent out was never giving up. I had to let my boyfriend and my couisn read the book because they are doing  the same exact thing  did Jihad did. They think its all play and games when its not. Jihad your book is real and you are the best, Dont stop doing what you do best and dont let no one put you down at all.</span>

                    <span>I had the pleasure of hearing Jihad read from his book "Street Life" at a book club gathering in Oakland, CA.  The reading was so enthralling that I had to purchase his book.  I was not disappointed.  I finished it in a weekend.  As I read it, it reminded me of Sistah Souljah's "Coldest Winter Ever."  Most definitely, elements of street life are glamorized in our society.  But, Jihad keeps it extremely real.  The good and the bad.  The money and the mayhem.  The life and the loss.  His book is not only for those hardheaded kids who think that life in the streets is their destiny, but also for those kids who think that they are better than their peers.  It's a reality check for us all.</span>

                    <span>Street Life is a VERY INSPIRATIONAL...REAL...IN YOUR FACE journey of LIFE in the HOOD.  This book is DEFINITELY a MUST READ for the kid that has a GLAMOURIZED perception of Living Life in the FAST LANE.  STREET LIFE should be RECOMMENDED reading for any HARD HEAD youth that needs to be SCARED STRAIGHT.</span>

                    <span>I thought that Street Life had a good start to it as well as a good message to young black men of what will inevitably happen to them if they choose the street life.  This book also had pretty good jokes from the main character.  The reason I gave the book 3 stars though is near the end of the book this thing just went all over the place.  I know the author was trying to send a positive message out but I started getting confused because I was like "ok has this book turned from fiction to nonfiction, is the author writing about himself or what?"  It's ok to take pieces of reality and put it into fiction but this just got crazy.  Although I was disappointed towards the end of the book, I would still recommend at least borrowing this from someone and reading it if you don't buy it yourself.</span>
