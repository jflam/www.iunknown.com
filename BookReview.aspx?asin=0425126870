                    <span>Like others, I too would agree that this book should be spiral bound. It is rather difficult to mix a drink and try keep the book open. Even with that said, this is a great book with tons of recipies! Before I bought this book I didn't know how to make any mixed drinks and now I do. This book is not only great for bartenders, but anyone who likes to drink or have friends over for a night of fun. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best informational tools related to the art of bartending. The book is very simply laid out.Recipes are listed alphabetically not outlined by their base spirit. This resource is a fixture (that is used by both employees and adventurous customers) in our bars and danceclub. Buy it, you won't be dissappointed!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a must have! The entire book is layed out perfectly! The recipies are very easy to read and they're well layed out. They're alphabatized as well as the index and the glossary. The table of contents breaks the book down into catagories from stocking your bar, party drinks, to nonalcoholic drinks. Beginning with a list of mixers, 'Odds and Ends', measurements in ounces, standard bar measurments, and garnishes. Included is a section on 'Bartender's Secrets' that gives tips and tricks the professionals use to make drinks such as choosing glassware and how to open a bottle of wine. <P>One very important point discussed is the importance of being responsible while drinking and also on being a responsible bartender. Included is a body weight chart giving the ratio of weight to the number of drinks a person consumes and how long it takes the body to matabolize it.<P>One of my favorite parts is the index because it makes the art of bartending professionally or unprofessionally much simpler taking a lot of the guess work out. If you don't know what to make with that bottle of flavored liqueur or you want to use some wine just go to the index and it will give you a list of drinks that can be made using whatever kind of alcohol you have. For anyone watching their calorie intake the book also includes an Index of Low-calorie Drinks.<P>I agree that this book would greatly be improved if it were spiral bound and was somehow protected so it would avoid liquid damage. I wonder....since it's so thick, making it a bit bigger, allowing more space for text and minimizing the amount of space the recipies take up on each page, in turn minimizing the depth, would make it easier to spiralbound it. Other than that this is an outstanding resource guide!</span>
