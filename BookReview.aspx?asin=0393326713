                <span id="Label1">The result of months of intensive investigations and inquiries by a specially appointed bipartisan panel, <I>The 9/11 Commission Report</I> is one of the most important historical documents of the modern era. And while that fact alone makes it worth owning, it is also a chilling and valuable piece of nonfiction: a comprehensive and alarming look at one of the biggest intelligence failures in history and the events that led up to it. The commission traces the roots of al-Qaeda's strategies along with the emergence of the 19 hijackers and how they entered the United States and boarded airplanes. It details the missed opportunities of law enforcement officials to avert disaster. Using transcripts of cockpit voice recordings, the report describes events on board the planes along with the chaotic reaction on the ground from nearly every level of government. Going forward, the commission calls for a comprehensive overhaul of what it sees as a deeply flawed and disjointed intelligence-gathering operation. The creation of a post for a single National Security Director is recommended, along with the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center. The report finds fault with the approaches of both the Clinton and Bush administrations but, because they were a bipartisan panel and the problems described are so systemic and far-reaching, they stop short of assigning blame to any particular person or group. Credit must be given to how readable the report is. At more than 500 pages, the writing is clear and forceful and the information is made more accessible since it is fre from election politics and rancor. While the commission notes that future attacks are probably inevitable, a coordinated preventive effort along with a clear plan to respond with efficiency can offer Americans some hope in a post-9/11 world. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>The Warren Commission is officially off the hook about their lies on the Kennedy Assassination. 9/11 as told by mainstream sources is the biggest joke and should never be believed. The unrefutable documented facts show that there is something wrong with this report. If people don't take time and dig for the truth it's their own fault. Just don't be the one that falls into that naive batch. In the memory of the over 3000 dead on 9/11 and the countless civilians murdered by bombs in Afghanistan and Irag, along with the brave military who are fighting and dying, we can do better than a disgraceful report like this. Check the websites that are mentioned in some of the reviews here and get educated on the unrefutable documented facts.

                    <span>A lot of thought and effort went into this report and the results are impressive and without bias.
<br />
<br />The 13 chapters of this document can be broken down into three categories:
<br />
<br />The first describes the events that unfolded on September 11th, 2001 from the air (Chapter 1) and the ground (Chapter 9). These two chapters are real page-turners and describe the tragic events comprehensively and in vivid detail. These two chapters should be read by all Americans and anyone effected by the tragedy.
<br />
<br />The second category deal with the U.S. Government agencies responsible for fighting terrorism and the intelligence that they have gathered on Al-Qaeda (unfortunately most of the information was obtained after the attack). These chapters were a little tough to get through and understand completely. This is not, however, the fault of the Commission, but a symptom of how Byzantine and bureaucratic our government really is. There was, however, a lot of interesting and thought-provoking information contained in these chapters. For example, Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden were top priorities of the Clinton Administration, but Clinton consciously did not publicize their efforts in order to prevent Al Qaeda from gaining in popularity. This secrecy, coupled with bureaucracy, lack of inertia, and fear of retribution prevented any action or results coming from their talks and planning. These chapters also debunk several commonly held conspiracy theories including hijackers meeting with the Iraqi government and Saudi nationals being granted exemptions from flight restrictions.
<br />
<br />The final category contains the conclusions and recommendations. It is quite clear that a complete overhaul of the intelligence and counter-terrorism units of the government is required. The recommendations presented here are comprehensive and well thought out, but also require significant funding and resources. Hopefully, they will not fall upon deaf ears.</span>

<br />Guess all of those good, common folk(and millions of others)are merely a bunch of easily led, voice-hearing, looney UFO conspiracy wingnuts, right?

                    <span>What most people who read this report do not realize is the degree to which the truth escapes any mention.  Aside from the fact that the Executive Director of the Commission (not its chair but the guy who oversaw all the real work) is an associate of Condaleeza Rice, now her leagal counsel at State, the book omits a significant amount of important information.  Two deserve immediate mention, 1) six of the supposed hyjackers are in fact still alive and most have been interviewed by major media in Europe.  This report does not even acknowledge this point.  2) Building 7 collapsed for no apparent reason.  Never before in history have steel framed buildings collapsed, and so all three are suspicious.  But building 7 was not even hit by a plane, it just had a few small fires and then came down, as if by a controlled demolition.  The lease holder even claimed this was what happened in a TV interview and then changed his story.
<br />
<br />This report is simply a cover up.</span>

<br />Critiques of the 9/11 Commission report
<br />
<br />Questions left unanswered
<br />
<br />by Jonathan Gramling
<br />
<br />The events of September 11, 2001 - the crashing of hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the crashing of a fourth plane in a Pennsylvania field - continue to reverberate through and change American society as the U.S. engages in an unending war against terrorism. During the ensuing 3-4 years, the U.S. has engaged in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, dramatically increased its military spending, and curtailed civil liberties within its borders.
<br />
<br />While most Americans - and the 911 Commission Report - blame the events totally on al-Qaeda and feel that the U.S. government was unaware that the attacks would occur, a vocal minority of individuals continue to raise unanswered questions about 911. On April 18, Dr. David Griffin, author of "The New Pearl Harbor" and "The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions" and one of the leading critics of the 9/11 Commission Report, will speak at 2650 Humanities on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus.
<br />
<br />When asked about the commission report during a telephone interview with The Madison Times, Griffin responded "I have one little problem with the 911 Commission report. It is a 567-page lie."
<br />
<br />While one may not agree with Griffin's conclusions that the U.S. government purposely allowed the events of 9/11 to happen and helped facilitate it in order to galvanize the will of U.S. citizens as the Bush administration expanded the American empire and secured American hegemony as the world's only super power, it is evident that Griffin raises some interesting questions.
<br />
<br />Take the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, for example. While the official version is that the initial impact coupled with a widespread, intense fire caused the structural steel to weaken and the floors of the towers to eventually pancake down on top of each other, Griffin has some questions. "Here you have an anomaly that never before in history have high-rise steel frame buildings come close to collapsing because of fire," Griffin said. "Yet three of them miraculously did it on that day. Furthermore, there have been fires that have been far more intense that filled the whole building and went on for many, many hours like the recent Madrid fire and they don't collapse. Yet here, we have very small fires that are only in a few floors, particularly Building Seven - you only had fires on the seventh and twelfth floors - they were relatively small fires, yet here comes down this 47 story building at 5:30 in the afternoon, having never been hit by an airplane."
<br />
<br />Griffin went on to discuss the steel columns within the core of the towers that structural engineers say bore the weight of the buildings. "The major part of the weight was born by these really massive steel columns," Griffin said. "And they went all of the way up. Well, they would have been sticking up in the air a thousand feet even if all the floors had pancaked. So, what does the 911 Commission do? They just deny the existence of those columns."
<br />
<br />Griffin and others have found significant discrepancies between the facts and the theory that Flight 77, a Boeing 757 crashed into the Pentagon and slid all the way into the interior of the building. "My own view is still that the evidence is just overwhelming that whatever it was that hit the Pentagon, it was not Flight 77 because it couldn't have been if it wasn't a Boeing 757," Griffin said. "There are many lines of evidence supporting that. What does the 911Commission do? It simply ignores all of this. Now what could they have done? They could have subpoenaed the videos that the FBI confiscated from the service station across the freeway from the Pentagon five minutes after the Pentagon was hit. Wasn't that alert. There are several other videos from hotels around the Pentagon. The Dept. of Transportation had video. There are all sorts of videos that could prove the government's case if it's true that it was Flight 77, or at least that it was a Boeing 757. But the 911 Commission doesn't even raise that. So you would think if the story were true, they would have done that. But they didn't."
<br />
<br />Finally, when Flight 93 crashed in the Pennsylvania field, Griffin contends it did not crash as passengers and terrorists fought for control of the plane. According to Griffin, it was shot down. "Maybe it was shot down after it appeared the passengers were going to get control of it and maybe bring it in for a safe landing, in which case, everyone would be alive," Griffin said. "First of all, the commission simply ignores all the evidence that I reported in The New Pearl Harbor that suggested the plane had been shot down. Secondly, they changed the timeline. That's just one of many examples of how they radically changed the previous timeline that everyone had lived with for almost three years."</span>
