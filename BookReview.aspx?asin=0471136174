                    <span>This book gives a good basic understanding of what coffee is all about.  I especially like the specificity of information about coffees from different areas in the Regional Character chapter.  For example, discussing Costa Rica's two best growing areas and how the coffees differ.  I also found the opinions of which coffees are worthy of their price helpful.  I read the Perfect Cup first and am glad I did because it was a good coffee overview for me.  Coffee Basics was a great second book for me because I was looking for more specific information about coffees of each area.  If I hadn't read Perfect Cup first I think the break down of info. on each type of coffee/regional character would have been information overload for me.  If you are new or relatively new to the coffee world and are excited about learning more and more about the subtlties and nuiances present in that cup, I highly recommend you read this book.</span>

                    <span>This is not exactly a great book, but then again, not exactly a bad book.  It covers much about the industry of coffee and goes over the different regions that produce coffee.  It describes what is and how to brew a perfect cup of coffee.  <p>But I get a feeling of being rushed from one tidbit of information to the next.  Just while I am almost within grasp of a certain concept or am about to form a picture of what it is trying to say it ends there without further detail.  But it does repeat key information more than once throughout the book so you do walk away with greater knowledge than before.<p>If learning about coffee was compared to eating out, this book is best suited as either an appetizer or a desert.  Appetizer to whet and get your brain ready to learn more about coffee, or as a desert, to catch up on and review over learned knowledge.<p>I guess that's why it is called "Coffee Basics" after all.<p>"A Perfect Cup" is a better selection in that it contains more information and better elaboration although that book is slightly dated being published in 1994.  But coffee has been around way before 1994 so does it really matter?</span>

                    <span>Great introduction to coffee - how to brew a great cup, a little bit about the industry, the different growing regions, how to buy good coffee, how to taste coffee, information about how coffee is processed. Not too complicated, easy and interesting reading. I definitely recommend this one if you're looking to learn the basics.</span>

                    <span>I have read a number of books on coffee, but Knox and Huffaker's book is simply the all-around reference on coffee. While other book publishers include snazzy photo plates and recipes to sell their expensive books, this  book gives tons of useful information on what goes into a wonderful cup of  coffee. The experience and the passion that the authors (who are industry  experts) have for the bean shows throughout. Because of this book, I was  able to significantly enhance my family and friends' coffee drinking  experience. Whether you're a novice coffee drinker or a seasoned espresso  barista, this is one book that should be in your reference shelf.</span>

                    <span>Mr.Knox tells full stories based upon his own experiences in the industry. And I am getting  improved taste of my own brewed coffee with dozens of stories to share with my friends in  Tokyo. Skepticism about our roasters  has been cleaned by this book. First time I am totally touched by this book  in this category.Thanks.</span>
