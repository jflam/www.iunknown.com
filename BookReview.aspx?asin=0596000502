                <span id="Label1">An increasing number of shops are putting clustering and load-balancing technologies into place so as to provide high availability and an economic way to scale server capacity. The slender <I>Server Load Balancing</I> explains the state of the art in multiple-server technologies implemented at Layers 4 and 5 on the OSI network model. Though author Tony Bourke includes a fair bit of good information on configuring four commercial load-balancing solutions, the most valuable part of his work is his high-level discussions of how load balancing fits into a larger network environment, and his explanations of the relative merits of alternative approaches to the problem. A comparison of flat-based solutions with designs based on Network Address Translation (NAT) is part of this book's value; further appeal takes the form of dozens of network diagrams that document typical working solutions. <p>   Bourke shows his familiarity with real-life design constraints by documenting various load-balancing solutions and pointing out what each can do for an organization--he points out that a host that implements a NAT-based balancing solution can double as a firewall, thereby saving some money that would have been required for a dedicated security device. He also provides introductory material on the competing solutions' administration interfaces, enabling implementers to get a head start on their work without wading into vendor documentation. <I>--David Wall</I><p>   <B>Topics covered</B>: The problems presented by requirements for high availability and failover, and the solutions that server load balancing can provide. In addition to general information on flat- and NAT-based load balancing solutions, this book documents strategies for implementing Alteon WebSystems, Cisco CSS, F5 BIG-IP, and Foundry ServerIron. </span>

                    <span>This publication is good for an quick introductory view of server load balancers. Users of load balancing products from certain manufacturers will benefit from the configuration options discussed in the final section of the book. For a more in-depth discussion, I would recommend Kopparapu's text "Load Balancing Servers, Firewalls, and Caches".</span>

                    <span>I expected a lot more from this book that while admittedly was the first that covered the topic, but did not really explain things in detail. Half of the book is on configurations that you can download from vendor web sites and the real design issues are never really addressed. The author runs a web site on teh topic and also is a known expert so this made the book more dissappointing.<BR>The first O'Reilly book I have ever regretted buying.</span>

                    <span>This deals mainly the web based load balancing. This is the simplest solution since the sessions only last for ms. It has a good hands on approach to router configuration and network design but lacks hardcore application design that this topic deserves.<P>There is no discussion on complex systems which require sessions to last for days and how to distribute state between multiple servers. There is also no discussion on locking mechanisms, determining load, primary/backup determination, latency across WANs, distributed objects, DB failover, server synchronization, heartbeat implementations, shifting load for scheduled down time, or dynamic router configuration or alternative scheduling mechanism apart from round robin. <P>I think the title "Web Server Load Balancing" would be a more appropriate title and if that is what your goal is then this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>This was actually a very good book. It really explains the background behind server load balancing very well. However, the book only emphasizes hardware solutions for server load balancing. It doesn't discuss any of the software solutions, such as Windows 2000 or IBM Edge Server.<P>The only reason why I rated this book relatively low is that much of the theory behind server load balancing can be obtained for free from various web sites. <P>If you're only looking for information about the concept of server load balancing, then you're better off getting the info from web sites for free. However, if you're also looking for great tips on the various load-balancing hardware solutions, then it's worth purchasing this book.</span>
