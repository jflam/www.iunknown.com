                    <span>Do you constantly worry about your financial future? Are you willing to take the steps that free you from these worries? Are you not an organized person when it comes to your finances? If you answered "Yes" to all these questions then reading the 9 steps to financial freedom will be of immense assistance to your personal and financial future.
<br />
<br />In the initial chapters, Suze asks you to ponder a number of questions on the purpose, honesty, responsibility, respect, trust etc among you, your loved ones and your money. Along those lines, Suze also gives insight has to the legal issues involved in creating everything from a simple Will, Trust and doing taxes etc. She even dedicates a chapter to debt management.
<br />
<br />Suze dedicated several of the pages to strategies for creating wealth in the long term through investing. She discusses Mutual Funds, 401K and other retirement plans, Index funds, stocks. She also compares all the above among themselves and from the point of view of taxes. Finally, Suze reaches the spiritual world such as charities to answer the issues of financial freedom per se.
<br />
<br />On a final note, the book is intended toward novices and people who do not have any or much knowledge of the investment and legal issues related to the financial world. If you already are well organized financially, I do not think you will gain much out of the book. Nevertheless, it is good read and well written with a simple language and lucid style.</span>

                    <span>I enjoy reading Suze Orman's columns, so I thought I'd see what she says in some of her books.  I consider myself pretty financially savvy, so I wasn't expecting to pick up much I could really use from this book.
<br />
<br />But I was wrong.  The first two of the nine steps ask us to examine our first impressions of money from our childhood and then our fears about money.  The third step asks us to really look at where our money is going, by looking at two years' worth of bills, credit card statements, and other papers.  These seemed pretty basic to me.
<br />
<br />Then we get to Steps Four through Six, where the more practical advice is given.  I found it interesting that estate planning was before anything else, but when Ms. Orman explained why, it made perfect sense (people before money -- take care of those you love).  Step Five is learning to make your money work harder, and Step Six asks you to trust yourself more than you trust others.  I got real actionable advice from each of these chapters.
<br />
<br />Steps Seven through Nine are where some people might tune out; they have to do with the spiritual aspects of money, including the benefits of giving.  Even if they sound kind of woo-woo at first, if you think about them, they do make sense.  If you regularly give money to worthy causes, for example, you are connected to something bigger than yourself.  This will make you more engaged in general, and could conceivably affect your own bottom line in a positive way.
<br />
<br />I liked both the practical and the spiritual aspects of this book.  Of course, when making your own financial plan, you should heed Ms. Orman's advice:  do your homework, consult experts, and then listen to your own voice.</span>

                    <span>I am a financial advisor and counselor and I have run across many so called "experts" in the financial world.  Never in all my time have I found one more consistently at odds with reality than Suze Orman.  Reader beware: there is just enough truth in Suze's advice to make it half-way believable but rest assured if you follow her advice consistently, you will end up in a much greater mess than you may already be in.  Examples of TERRIBLE Suze Orman advice:
<br /> 1.) buy your vehicle brand new and on credit.  (many Americans do this but no financial advisor in his right mind would ADVISE you to do this.  Your new vehicle will lose an average of 60% of its value in the first 2-3 years leaving you holding un upside down car note rendering you tied to this car for better or worse).  Buy your car at least two years old and preferably with cash.
<br />  2.) Buy no-load mutual funds.  Study after study has shown that more than 90% of your investment performance can be tied not to the specific investment you make, but to Asset Allocation.  When you buy a no-load mutual fund what you are really buying is a no-help mutual fund.  Unless you are well versed in the proper asset allocation based on your specific time horizon and risk parameters, this is a stupid piece of advice.  P.S. studies have also shown that those who work with an advisor on their investments typically net more than twice that of their "do it yourselfer" counterparts.
<br />
<br />The list could go on and on but what it boils down to is that Suze makes ridiculous amounts of money telling people how to ruin their finances.  If you want strong financial advice, you aren't going to get it here.  I hope you will heed my warning.  If not, you will remember it looking back.</span>

                    <span>Suzy should stick to just financial planning.  She should not try to be a preacher nor a psychologist.  Here's a sample of her junk, "Analyze the fears within you.  Write down your earliest dealings with money and you will see why you are the way you are..."  "To get money, you must first part with it, then money will find you"   "Money has a power, if you don't respect it, it won't respect you"  Come on!!!  I give this book 4 stars for the solid financial planning.  I learned about trusts, wills, insurance, index mutual funds and no loads, saving for the 401K.  Unfortunately, I give it negative (-3) stars for the eastern religious themes and general bizare moral relativism.   </span>

Try also Surviving Financial Disasters, for those who are truly looking to get out debt. Also The richest man in Babylon.</span>
