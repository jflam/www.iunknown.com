                    <span>this book follows a "problem/solution/code" format that really helps to cut down the amount of fluff you always get in other books. it covers a wide range of subjects (including "beginner" topics) but in a very efficient way. even though all these topics could be dug up thru web searches, the quality of info here is far more consistent and reliable. i hope to see more books take this approach. </span>

                    <span>This book remains at my fingertips at all times. It's perfect as a reference for those little problems which we, as programmers, face every day. <p>Some examples of problems which the book covers are:<br>- Prevent People from Decompiling Your Code<br>- Sort an Array or an ArrayList<br>- Store a Serializable Object to a File<br>- Instantiate an Object Using Reflection<br>- Synchronize the Execution of Multiple Threads<br>- Use XML Serialization with Custom Objects<br>- Apply Windows XP Control Styles<br>- Reuse Data with the ASP.NET Cache<br>- Show a Dynamic Print Preview<br>- Calculate the Size of a Directory<br>- Download a File over HTTP<br>- Communicate Using TCP<br>- Host a Remote Object in IIS<br>- Restrict Which Users Can Execute Your Code<br>- Create a Cryptographically Random Number<br>- Use an ActiveX Control in a .NET Client<br>- Create a Windows Service<p>This is only about 5% of what the book offers. If you've ever wondered how to do any of the above or have ever needed to reference a short snippet of code for any of the above then this book is for you. The code snippets are all full complete programs so there's no confusion as to what references were used.</span>

                    <span>I too feel compelled to disagree with the 'Bad Review' that dismissed this book as being for beginners and just a repeat of the MSDN material.<p>I've been using .NET C# for years and I am not not a beginner to OO and have been a professional programmer for more than 20 years.  I've spent many hours in the MSDN help files and searching the internet for esoteric answers.  This book contains many succinct solutions to everyday problems.  It's not supposed to be a `big picture' book or only focus on the esoteric.  Sure, some of the recipes do qualify for trivial. <br> <br>Before I bought it I was able to scan the table of contents and see solutions to tricky problems that I had solved and many others that I had interest in or could reasonably see needing.  By scanning the solutions I was familiar with, such as cryptography, threading, and networking, it was clear the authors had a clear understanding of the problems and were able to boil it down to real solutions for real problems.  While MSDN does contain many good examples, many times it misses the mark when it comes down to relevancy for solving a real problem.<p>If you are like me, and want solutions at your finger tips, and are willing to pay a little to save a lot of time, this book is a great tool to have available.</span>

                    <span>This book is in my favorite format for development titles: a "cookbook."  When you have a specific application requirement to implement, check out this book first before you reinvent the wheel.  Jones covers topics such as:<p>- delay signing an assembly<br>- creating an animated system tray icon<br>- performing screen captures<br>- protecting files with symmetric encryption<p>and much more.  The C# Programmer's Cookbook is already one of my favorites.  Note that it is aimed more at the intermediate developer, but .NET coders at any level will find useful explanations from this excellent publication.</span>
