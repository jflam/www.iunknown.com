                    <span>This is an excellent academic account--and, at the same time, most enjoyable reading for a scholarly work--on ethnic succession in organized crime. Italian and Jewish gangsters supplanted German and Irish hoods during Prohibition. The Italians outlasted the Jews and are now being supplanted by other ethnic groups. Working largely from FBI files and contemporary news accounts, Fried examines the why and how of it all, tracing Jewish organized crime from the early New York street gangs through such powerhouse mobsters as Waxey Gordon, Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, the "Cleveland Four," headed by Moe Dalitz who later migrated to Las Vegas, and the legendary "Chairman of the Board," Meyer Lansky. One wishes there had been more emphasis on other Jewish mobsters such as Dutch Schultz, Jake Guzik, Charlie Birger, Kid Cann, and the Purple Gang but the rise and fall of the Jewish gangster seems to have been much the same story anyway throughout America and I don't think it's been told better anywhere.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who has looked into American 20th century "Leftist" urban politics has undoubtedly run across Albert Fried's name before.      In this wonderful history, he expertly tells the story of emerging urban  Jewish culture at the turn of the century and of how one segment of this  culture then quickly evolved to succeed in the wilderness of the Lower East  Side, Manhattan.  All of the major gangster figures are covered in detail  and a number of "lesser known" gangsters (to those who are not as  expert in this subject) are revealed to have been important local figures  in their day, as well as meaningful players in a larger coherent  socio-political story.  I emphasize "story" because to me that is  what this book really is: Fried clearly has a passion for his subject and  his city and as a result, the book reads like a wise Jewish grandfather  passing down his legends.     Anyone with an interest in gangster culture,  its relationship to local, state and national politics, the history of New  York City, and/or the history of American Judaism as developed through the  New York Secular movement MUST read this book!</span>
