                <span id="Label1">In <I>Playing for Keeps</I>, David Halberstam takes the first full measure of Michael Jordan's epic career, one of the great American stories of our time. A narrative of astonishing power and human drama, brimming with revealing anecdotes and penetrating insights, the book chronicles the forces in Jordan's life that have shaped him into history's greatest basketball player, and the larger forces that have converged to make him the most famous living human being in the world.  <P> From <I>The Breaks of the Game</I> to <I>Summer of '49</I>, David Halberstam has brought the perspective of a great historian, the inside knowledge of a dogged sportswriter, and the love of a fan to bear on some of the most mythic players and teams in the annals of American sport. With Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls he has given himself his greatest challenge, and produced his greatest triumph. The book is rich with Halberstam's professional signature: incisive, carefully woven human portraits of the major figures. We see the various players and teams the Bulls must overcome on their long, hard journey to six world championships, including Larry Bird and the Celtics, Isiah Thomas and the Pistons, and Magic Johnson and the Lakers. We get a rare insider's view of the dynamics between Jordan, the star, and the others who played critical roles in the championship seasons, including the shrewd, thoughtful Phil Jackson, the enigmatic Scottie Pippen, and the curiously shy Dennis Rodman. In addition, we see the bitter divisions between players and management on the Bulls, and the NBA's interior pressures and conflicts as basketball grows during Jordan's reign into a phenomenally successful big-time celebrity sport. This book is, as well, about fame in America, the forces that create it and its consequences. Among other things, we see how David Falk and Nike launched the campaign that sold Jordan to the world, abetted by a small Oregon ad agency, Wieden and Kennedy, and a struggling young Brooklyn filmmaker named Spike Lee. <P> The product of tireless on-the-ground reporting suffused with the wisdom and imagination of one of our greatest writers, Playing for Keeps is a book that, in defining Michael Jordan, also helps to define America in the Jordan Era.</span>

                    <span>This book is the best Jordan book I ever read. Lots of great details about JOrdan was included. This is also my first time reading David Halberstam's book. After I read "Playing for Keeps Michael Jordan and the Wolrd He Made" I think I will read more books by David Hablerstam. This book not only showed about Michael Jordan's life but also mention about how NBA change over time in the 80's and the 90's. This book is just amazing so i highly recommand people to buy this book and read it!</span>

                    <span>This book doesn't just tell you why Michael was such a great athlete, it tells you why. From his ultra (and I mean insane) competitiveness to his landmark athleticism. I began to understand that Michael Jordan is an argument for theism. There seems to be no way Jordan could have existed without God specifically forming him to be a basketball player. Many people talk about Jordans jumping ability but few speak about his olympic-type speed. Combine that with the ulitmate desire to win and you have a guy that could remain the greatest ever for a LONG period of time.<br>But David Halberstam is in no way offering a book full of praise to Michael Jordan. There were times in the book where I felt almost sick to my stomach reading how incredibly psycho Jordan can be. But you come out realizing that Jordan is indeed the best and there is good reason for it.<br>What I like most about the book is that it reads at times like a scouting report. It tells of Jordan in high school when he was cut from Varsity. He dominated on JV, and when he moved up to Varsity, he dominated on varsity. Scouts are quoted in the book as saying that Jordan was the best high school player they had ever seen. So he wasn't as much a late bloomer as a well-kept secret. Then it goes into college and we know the rest of the story.<br>This is most informative and intelligent book on basketball I have ever read. Highly recommended.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a book about a nearly textbook case of a type A personality. Michael Jordan is the consummate perfectionist and competitor. From his early days as an unknown kid at Laney High in Wilmington to his days with Dean Smith at Carolina to his days of scoring championships and NBA titles with the Bulls, this book has the entire history, and it makes fascinating reading.<p>What comes through much more clearly by putting his entire history together than it does even in watching a game like the one he scored 40-something against Utah when he had the flu, is how intense a competitor Jordan is, how he needs to win, how if you think you can beat him you are, you have *got* to be wrong. Golf course, basketball court, baseball diamond, wherever, Michael Jordan had to be the best. Combine such a drive with a good understanding of certain dynamics and a 6'6 frame with only 4 percent bodyfat, and you've got yourself a ballplayer. <p>Occasionally I was bored by some of the more financial aspects of Jordan's career, but the light that it sheds on the intensity of his personality is illuminating.</span>

                    <span>When David Halberstam undertakes any subject, you can be absolutely sure that it will be exhaustively researched.  Having read several other books by Mr. Halberstam I can tell you that once again that he maintains his excellent standards.   He is more than fair to all parties concerned.  Mr. Halberstam takes us to the board rooms, playgrounds, press rooms, restaurants hallways, corridors and offices where things were set in motion.  <p>This book covers so much more than Michael Jordan and the Bulls. He brings to light so many different people and faithfully traces the current sports scene and it's precipators to the source.  He does all this in a fascinating manner.  <p>This was compelling reading.  He covers angles missed entirely in other sports books.  You are introduced to the major and the bit players, who are no less compelling.  <p>If you enjoyed "The Fifties" and "Breaks of the Game"  and are a sports fan. If you want to really know things got to where they are now. This is the book to read.     <p>Mr. Halberstam is one of the literary treasures of our time.</span>

                    <span>Any Jordan fan will enjoy this wordy tribute to His Airness. Halberstam loses a star for some stupid factual errors, which are unforgivable for a journalist to make. The most annoying example was his description of the final game of the Bulls 2nd championship where Paxon hits the 3 for the come-from-behind win. Halberstam inexplicably re-writes history and omits Horace Grant's block at the buzzer to preserve the win. Nitpicking aside, I highly recommend!</span>
