                <span id="Label1">In <i>The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit</i>, authors Ralph Kimball, Laura Reeves, Margy Ross, and Warren Thornthwaite present a structure for undertaking the awesome task of implementing a data warehouse. As part of a rather select group of professionals actually experienced in building data warehouses, the authors attempt to convey their expertise about how to approach the job. The book focuses on the "Star Lifecycle"--a high-level project-planning approach to evolving existing information systems into an ever-changing data-warehouse solution. <i>--Stephen Plain</i></span>

                    <span>Our organization has implemented a very successful Data Warehouse, due largely to following the design and deployment principles from Dr. Kimball's two textbooks. The key to a successful Data Warehouse is providing all business users an easy to use and high performance queryable system. The dimensional design is, without a doubt, the defacto standard for Queryable Data Warehouses, and the author does a superb job motivating its use and explaining how to develop your integrated, dimensional data warehouse. In addition, the author gives valuable advice on many, many other aspects of the process, such as assessing your readiness for proceeding with a warehouse effort. This book is a "must read" for anyone involved in a Data Warehouse project. You will have an excellent chance of succeeding with even a most complicated Data Warehouse System if you follow the wisdom in this book.</span>

                    <span>My experience has been in project management and data modeling. This book was an excellent source of information for project management issues, lifecycle concerns and warehousing particulars.<P>With a background in logical data modeling (with its normalization and entity-focused approach), I was able to utilize this book very effectively in the implementation of my first "true" data warehouse (as opposed to the "faux" warehouses that the customer labeled as such simply because of the large number of entities in the RDBMS). The conceptual difference between logical modeling and data warehousing was well explained, with numerous pertinent examples. The full SDLC for the warehouse is covered equally as well.<P>A note on my "4-star" rating: I'm reserving 5 stars for the book I write! This book is a good value.</span>

                    <span>Sorry to say! But I'm a student specializing in Data warehousing and Ralph Kimball is certainly not getting to any point in The Lifecycle Toolkit!<P>1. He gives to many unstructured examples!<BR>2. He never gets to the point!<BR>3. Ralph restates and contradicts himself again and again!<BR>4. He could have summarized the book in 100 pages ( but then would not have made any $$$)<BR>5. The book might just discourage most people from Data warehousing!<P>And the list can go on and on! <P>Sorry Ralph better luck next time</span>

                    <span>You won't find anything better on DW Project Management.<BR>Covers everything from introduction to the subject, essential concepts through to recommended and proven industrial practices with checklists. You MUST read this book from cover to cover before attempting to start a DW project. It could make the difference between project success and failure.<P>If you are going to be involved in implementing a DW rather than only managing the project then it's definitely worth getting one of Kimball's other books (DW Toolkit/Data Webhouse Toolkit), which cover lower level aspects of designing and implementing a DW, although there is some overlap.</span>

                    <span>PROS<BR>- Offers invaluable advice based on the authors' experience so that you don't need to re-invent the wheel or make the same mistakes they made (and subsequently learned from).<BR>- Most useful for Project Managers/DBAs; less so for Data Modellers.<P>CONS<BR>- I purchased this book on the assumption that it offered a comprehensive treatment of all stages of the Data Warehouse project lifecycle (as the cover would lead you to believe). However, it does not offer a comprehensive treatment of Dimensional Modelling. For this, the book actually assumes you have read Kimball's former book - "The Data Warehouse Toolkit - The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling" (which provides a full treatment and practical examples for several industry sectors). <BR>- I did not like the writing-style. If the authors would have omitted all text like "we believe.." and "in our experience..." I'm sure the book wouldn't have used 800 pages.<P>CONCLUSION<BR>This book has remained by my side throughout the project lifecycle, giving great guidance and pointers to help manage the project optimally.<BR>However, if you are responsible for Data Modelling, you will also need to buy "The Data Warehouse Toolkit", thereby doubling the overall cost.</span>
