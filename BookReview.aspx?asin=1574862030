                    <span>This book gives you 8 different rooms to choose from.  Some of them include a "Princess Room" that is full of pink and frills.  It gives you good ideas to update your childs room with out having to purchase alot of expensive furniture.  It seems to concentrate on refurbishing basic furniture with paint, material and embellishments.  The Nautical themed room could be used for a boy or girl with just a few changes in color and accessories.<br>The Cowboy room is ideal for "Buckaroos" of all ages.  This could be used for a todler now, and as he matures could easily be updated with more elaborate accesories.  The twin bed that is made out of a tree with the bark still on it is unique.  Another room excellent for a boy or girl is the "Bug Room."  The most creative item in this room, I think is the room screen made out of recycled screen doors.  The colors are lovely opaque blues and greens.  This room is accented with butterflies and dragonflies.  This book is not your typical decorators book that gives you just pictures to go by.  It give you the patterns (many in color) and instructions to help you create a room that will please your child for many years.  Other themes included are "Wild Kingdom,"  The "Chicken Coop," the "Magical Garden," and "Memory Lane" that is  filled with nostalgia.</span>

                    <span>If you're searching for a book full of unique ideas for kids' rooms, you will be sadly disappointed as I was.  I found the ideas to be mediocre and seen before almost everywhere.  If, however, you are seeking simple, cheap, easy to do ideas, that you've seen before, but didn't know how to accomplish, then buy this book.  The instructions seem to be very clear and easy to follow, with most of the ideas requiring very little materials or skill.  In fact, many of the ideas begin with ready-made furnishings (i.e. tables, chairs, bedding, curtains...).  The book does contain detailed patterns, but you probably have the equivalent in your clipart files.  In short, this book is good for the person who has NO ideas about decorating for kids, and who can't replicate ideas without some instruction.  It's a beginner level basic book.</span>

                    <span>This book was just what I was looking for.  I have been hesitating about redecorating my children's bedrooms because I didn't know where to start.  Not only did it give me great ideas but it inspired my own ideas.  <p>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who's children are out of the 'little kiddie' stage and are becoming individuals.  It's great for doing rooms for children ages 5 to about 11 (give or take abit).  In addition there's a cute scheme for a toddler's room with little chicks.  Definitely a 'thumbs up'!</span>
