                <span id="Label1"><I>Reading the Bible Again for the First Time</I> is Marcus Borg's  follow-up to <I>Meeting Jesus Again  for the First Time</I>. Like his earlier book, this one is written for lay  people whose faith has been frustrated by their misapprehension that  fundamentalism's claim to be the one true faith is valid. Borg, a professor of  religion at Oregon State University, describes an alternative to  fundamentalists' so-called "literal" readings of scripture. (He believes that  such "literal-factual" readings do not live up to that description, and that the  limitations of such readings have alienated many people who would otherwise  remain part of the church.) Borg calls his alternative "historical-metaphorical"  reading, a way of "taking the Bible seriously without taking it literally."  <I>Reading the Bible</I> begins with a history of recent conflicts regarding  biblical interpretation. Borg navigates the minefields of his subject with  sensitivity and precision, explaining, for example, the important distinction  between evangelical and fundamentalist readings of the Bible. He then offers  historical-metaphorical readings of some key texts from both the Hebrew Bible  and the New Testament. Throughout, Borg writes with calm assurance and respect  for those who would disagree with him. <I>Reading the Bible</I> is a credible  guide to the project it names. It is a faithful exercise of reason, undertaken  to help Christians hear more clearly the many voices recorded in the Bible.  <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After reading Borg's book I came away tremendously disappointed with how poorly he reasons for his particular point of view and would not recommend this book to anyone seeking scholarly information on reading the Bible. 
<br />	His book is divided into three main sections: the first deals with foundational issues on the subject and the fact that we all read the Bible through various lenses. This is the most important section of the book as the other two stand or fall on the integrity of the first. His second section deals with the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the Old Testament, and his last section deals with the New.
<br />	In the first section, Borg discusses four different reasons why the modern culture has departed from traditional interpretations of reading the Bible. As I see it, his fourth reason is the most specific in dealing with how he will treat Scripture throughout the remainder of the book so I will limit my comments to it. 
<br />	He states that postmodernity has taught us that "metaphors and metaphorical narratives can be profoundly true even if they are not literally or factually true" (p. 17). But what is important to remember here is that, as Christian philosopher William Lane Craig has said, a metaphor must have a literal meaning in order to make any sense at all. If I were to say, "It's raining cats and dogs outside" then, unless there is a literal truth behind the metaphor, i.e., it's really raining hard outside, then the metaphor is meaningless. 
<br />	The problem with Borg's interpretation is that he rarely, if ever, gives any literal meaning behind the metaphor. Thus, his metaphors are meaningless and Borg's interpretations are meaningless as well. 
<br />	For instance, Borg claims to believe that Jesus rose from the dead and that he is our Lord today. However, in Borg's view, there is no post-Easter Jesus; Jesus' body was simply a rotting corpse. But unless Borg can give a literal meaning for his belief that "Jesus rose from the dead," his own beliefs are not metaphors, they're nonsense! 
<br />	Another very important point to mention is that Borg reads the Bible with a relentless anti-supernatural bias.  He asks, "...do virgin births, multiplying loaves and fish, and changing water into wine ever happen anywhere?" Borg answers this question by saying, "...what I cannot do as a historian is to say that Jesus could do such things even though nobody else has ever been able to. Thus I regard these as purely metaphorical narratives" (p. 47). 
<br />	So Borg makes it clear that the plain meaning of the biblical text is not his primary method of interpretation, but rather, it is an anti-supernatural presupposition he brings to the text which determines how he reads it. Yet, remarkably, this methodology he employs is blatantly contrary to the advice he gives his students on how to interpret a biblical text. He says, "I often tell my students that reading well involves listening well-seeking to hear what the text is saying to us and not simply absorbing the text into what we already think" (pp. 30-31).
<br />	But is Borg following his own advice here? Since he admits that he follows a principle of hermeneutics which overrides a clear reading of the text, i.e., his own anti-supernatural presuppositions, then it certainly seems he is not. This leaves the reader with the glaring notion that Borg really hasn't thought out his conclusions too neatly!
<br />	Borg also has a major problem with the Christian exclusivism taught in John 14:6: ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me."
<br />	In his view, Jesus is not saying that faith in him is the only way to get to heaven, but rather, that we must all die to an old way of being and be born into a new way of being-as Jesus was-to get close to God. Since all religions of the world incorporate this belief into their doctrinal system, then Christ's way can be known in every religion.
<br />	Not only does Borg believe that all religions contain the pathway of Jesus to get close to God, but he also considers it strange we ever thought otherwise. Regarding this he says, "...as if one entered new life by believing certain things to be true, or as if the only people who can be saved are those who know the word `Jesus.' Thinking that way virtually amounts to salvation by syllables" (pp. 216-17).
<br />	The most blatant problem with this belief is that it is self-refuting. First of all, even Borg believes that the way of Jesus entails our death to an old way of living and our subsequent birth to a new way of living. But in order for this to happen we must believe in certain propositional knowledge as well: namely, we must die to an old way of living and be born again to a new one. Also, Borg decries the traditional Christian position as being a "salvation by syllables" but Borg is doing the very same thing. His belief in a new life also requires uttering syllables and so if uttering syllables is so utterly detestable, then Borg falls on his own sword!
<br />	However, is there anything really wrong with propositional knowledge of God being required to help us draw closer to him? At first blush, it almost seems foolish to simply ask the question as it becomes impossible for us to describe God-let alone believe in his existence-without propositional knowledge. It seems that Borg's view would mean that it should be possible for even a man like Adolf Hitler to become a saint in heaven because the belief, "we cannot get close to God if we brutally torture Jews," requires  propositional knowledge of God. Would Borg ever dream of saying that the above statement is "strange" because it both requires we believe certain things to be true and also requires us to utter syllables and because of this, we can then treat Jews any way we want? 
<br />	The fact is, propositional knowledge of God is required in order for us to grow closer to him and Borg's assault on it is what seems strange. If Borg has a problem with the integrity of certain propositional statements, then he should attack that statement in particular and not retreat into both self-refuting and ridiculous attacks on propositional knowledge in general.
<br />	In short, the God that Borg wants us to conceive of in this book is a God who, ultimately, cannot be described by propositional statements, but only experienced. Since Borg makes the propositional statement that God only works through natural means, he makes God's existence superfluous as there does not seem to be much of a difference to Borg in whether God truly exists or not. 
<br />	But because Borg believes that Christ can change lives even while stripping him of his divine authority to do so, he turns Christ into nothing more than a crutch. And since any other crutch is just as good as our crutch, Marcus Borg has turned Christ into a placebo-with no real power to do anything outside of the believer's imagination.
<br />Thus, the conclusion of this book is not informative or enlightening in any way as propositional knowledge is required to actually inform. Rather, it seems that Borg's conclusion is incoherent.

                    <span>Most people seem to either hate this book or love it. I think I do both; but I realize the parts I love are those I agree with and the parts I "hate" are those in sharp conflict with what I thought was true. At the very least this book will make the Christian think, if he is willing to stretch a little. Personally I still like to think that Jesus will come again, and I certainly believe that life on earth will end sometime in the future. And I believe in prayer, which is not addressed sufficiently in this book.  Professor Borg's most important writing is his Epilogue, where he summarizes the whole thing as " Love God" and "Love your Neighbor". As Jesus stated and showed, any way you turn it, that is what it is all about. </span>

                    <span>This really is an extraordinary book.  Since I'm not a biblical scholar (except in the sense of being an occasional amateur one) I can't sensibly talk about the depth of the scholarship.  It does seem very impressive.
<br />
<br />
<br />The book is a very easy one to read; Borg is an excellent communicator and manages to cover a great deal of material in a very accessible manner.  I found it at times rather confronting, because it made me re-evaluate a number of issues to do with my faith that had been left undisturbed for years.  That was especially so of the conclusion which is a very stirring, and confronting, call to action.
<br />
<br />One particular problem that I had with the book was that Borg seems to view Jesus as a man who knew God intimately.  I'm still not completely clear how exactly how the human Jesus relates to the divine Christ.  But to take away a star for that would be overkill, especially as the problem is probably mine.</span>

                    <span>I like everything this book says.  I like Mr. Borg's heart.  But, by the end of the Hebrew Scriptures section I had to admit that Borg had been pretty intellectually dishonest.  Borg does a great job covering the anti-empire voice of scripture in the books of Moses and in the Prophets, but he all but ignores the rather pro-empire historical books like the Samuels, Kings and Chronicles.   There is a dynamic tension in scripture between the voice that Borg chooses to hilite in this book, and its spirited opposition, also found throughout scripture.  Borg would have significantly strengthened his case if he addressed the books less compatible with his thesis and put them within a context of dynamic tension with the books he chooses to focus on.  I find this particularly unfortunate because we live in a time when a voice like Borg is most needed.  The unfortunate truth is that too many conspicuous silences lead me to believe that Borg is not being completely honest.</span>

                    <span>This small book is a high-level overview of the philosophical divide between literalist "Bible-believing" Christians and those who believe that biblical precepts should be believed but interpreted metaphorically. In addition, Borg presents the basic thesis of the "Historical Jesus" movement.  
<br />
<br />The book is a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the core debate. However, those who have already read some of the other books by Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan may find this work elementary and sweeping.    
<br />
<br />Although a challenge to established religious dogma is always controversial, what is not is Borg's ability to break down sophisticated concepts into user-friendly language and to fluidly compress vast material into a manageable but comprehensive summary.  In this, he offers new hope to those alienated from the church by providing an alternative path back into meaningful and authentic spiritual inquiry.
