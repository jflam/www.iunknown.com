                <span id="Label1">While the Ken Burns PBS machine kicked into high gear to promote the filmmaker's stylistically familiar 2002 hagiography of American literary and humor icon Mark Twain, veteran actor Hal Holbrook took a much more personal route, exalting Twain's legend worldwide for 50 years via his remarkable one-man stage show, <I>Mark Twain Tonight!</I> Indeed, Burns wisely incorporated Holbrook's legacy into his own film. But as longtime admirers of Holbrook's show will attest, the performances culled together here (from three Holbrook-Twain show albums) for their CD debut represent something more artistically transcendent than mere performance. They're exhaustively researched, cleverly edited, and shrewdly supplemented, and Holbrook does more than offer up dramatic readings of Twain's words; he eerily breathes life into the cantankerous, complex Missourian until the actor virtually disappears behind Twain's raspy voice, insightful vision, and razor wit. Ranging like a hungry coyote on topics from political shenanigans to smoking, hypocrisy, and the nature of man and his God, Holbrook gives us a restless, conscientious Twain--and some insights as uncomfortably timely in the 21st century as they were in the 19th. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I> </span>

                    <span>This is not the version that I loved back in the seventies.  It doesn't have the "Interview" or the story about the "bevy of nude young native ladies" and how he sat on their clothes... so they wouldn't be stolen.  Its as if someone removed some of the finest and most funny parts of the original LP and replaced it with something more politically correct.  I feel rather [like soemthing's missing].  You may feel the same way if you ever heard the original selections.  Too bad...</span>

                    <span>Hal Holbrook's one-man show "Mark Twain Tonight" took Broadway by storm in 1959. Eventually, three records were issued of the material Holbrook alternated in his performances. I bought all three, and have been waiting many years for a CD version. Finally, Columbia/Sony/Legacy (whatever they want to call themselves) have issued one CD with material from each of the original LP's represented. People who like this kind of performance will argue as to whether the selections on this disc are really the best choices, because we each have our favorites. Some monlogues are laugh-out-loud funny, some philosophical, some sad, some even bitter. Holbrook knows his Twain, and Clemens/Twain was all of those things mentioned above at various stages of his long and complex literary and lecturing career. "Mark Twain Tonight" may not have been the first "one-man-show" created, but it became clearly the most successful...Holbrook is still doing it about 20 times a year, more than 40 years later. I saw him in 1964 and it remains the most enthralling single evening of theater I have ever seen. If you like Twain, or good acting, or Broadway history, buy this disc. I just did.</span>
