                    <span>Readers should be aware that this study was first published  in 1953, and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago.  We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled "The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950") have been thoroughly discredited.  The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision).  Even the very language is dated, with its grandiose, sweeping style, capitalization of popes, etc.  This book perpetuates a great many old myths, making the job of historians of religion just that much harder.  There are now much better books on the market.</span>

                    <span>This work is an important 20th century contribution.  An outstanding two-volume series!  <p>Of all the histories of Christianity, this one is very clear and engaging to read.  I love his writing style.  It is really,  really worth every penny!</span>

                    <span>Latourette does a masterful job of presenting a comprehensive history of the Christian religion in a readable form.  This is an overview of the subject from the time of Christ to just before the Reformation (Vol. 2  picks up after 1500).  Latourette doesn't just focus on the Western world  or on institutional religion, but on Christianity in Asia, Africa, and the  Middle East, some of the personalities behind the history, and on popular  movements within Christianity (some of which - such as monasticism - became  institutions in their own right).  This is an excellent scholarly overview  on an enormous topic that makes it interesting for the average reader.</span>

                    <span>This work is generally known as a modern classic of Church History. If you are looking for a basic, comprehensive survey of Christian Church history, this is it. If you want something easier and faster than LaTourette, I  would recommend Bruce Shelley's "Church History in Plain  Language". However, LaTourette is superior. If you want something more  comprehensive than LaTourette, I would recommend the 5 volume set by  Jarslov Pelikan.</span>
