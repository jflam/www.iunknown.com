                    <span>It is a cult not much unlike the "groupies" that follow the Grateful Dead around the country and call that their home.  Warren St. John's book is based on his investigation of the cult that literally follows the Alabama football team in their recreational vehicles (RV's).  I was actually hesitant to read this book at first because I was afraid that finding out how fanatical these people are would frighten me.
<br />
<br />After giving some background information, St. John tells the story of his experience inside, as the subtitle of the book puts it, "the heart of fan mania." His "journey" took place in the 1999 football season.  
<br />
<br />First he must contact an RV fan who will be hospitable enough to let a stranger come along with them for the ride to the games.  He is invited by Chris and Paula Bice, two Alabama fans who live in South Carolina and go to the games in their RV.  The writer later got an RV of his own.  He describes that process too.  He also explains how the practice of using RV's evolved into being.
<br />
<br />The story includes each Alabama game that season and brief descriptions of each game are included.  As an avid SEC football watcher and a person with a great memory, I remember many of the games he describes and enjoyed reading a writer's perspective on them.  Also included are descriptions of the unique character of each SEC town they visited. He captures the feelings of the RV fans after each game about as well as an author can.
<br />
<br />Since I, like Warren St. John, grew up in Birmingham, Alabama and since he is the same age as I am, he has the same memories of Alabama football as I do.  These memories, which include the late career and death of Bear Bryant and are mentioned in the "Introduction" of the book, strongly resonated with me.
<br />
<br />This book has stories that will make you cry tears of laughter.  The reader will also enjoy the tailgate with the RV families provided that reader is willing to hop aboard.

                    <span>This is one of the most fun and humorous books I've read in quite a while.  It's very simple:  Warren St. John, a NY Times writer who's also a die-hard Alabama football fan, tags along with the 'Bama RV tailgating crowd for a season and finds out first-hand that this is truly a whole world in itself.
<br />
<br />You'll meet a wide and diverse range of fans, most of which have been described in detail previously here.  Of course, there's the couple that missed their daughter's wedding, the woman who defied doctor's orders and went to a game despite still being heavily sedated shortly after a medical procedure, and the guy awaiting a transplant who ignores his doctor's orders and goes to away games anyway.  The book is chock full of examples of fans overflowing with passion for Bama football, and you'll see plenty of entertaining ways in which this passion is demonstrated.  St. John also does a great job describing the game-day scene, both outside the stadium as well as on the field and in the stands.
<br />
<br />You'll also learn a thing or two about the ticket-brokering business, and laugh at how St. John doesnt hesitate to poke some fun at himself throughout the whole process.  Overall, St. John does an excellent job portraying the passionate RV crowd as its own colorful society, seemingly with its own rules, regulations and hierarchy.
<br />
<br />A great read and I highly recommend it to any die-hard fan of ANY sport</span>

                    <span>St. John's book, tracing his interaction with Alabama's famed Crimson Tide football team for a single season, distinguishes itself from other fan-books in that the author maintains an ability to laugh at himself and not indulge in the all too easy mocking of others who share his passion for college sports.  
<br />
<br />A quick, well-crafted and enjoyable book.</span>

                    <span>First, a disclaimer:  This reviewer is a die-hard Florida Gator (and he's hard-dyin' today, after our New Year's Eve humiliation at the hands of Hurricanes in the Peach Bowl), which undoubtedly colors my opinion of this book. That said, I'd recommend "Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer" to any serious college football fan, if only for a reality check.  And for anyone who wishes to understand college football fandom -- especially in the South -- this is a good starting point.
<br />
<br />Marino Casem, longtime coach at Mississippi's Alcorn State University, made the oft-quoted observation that "Football is, in the West, a cultural experience; in the Midwest, cannibalism; in the East, a tourist attraction; but, in the South, football is a religion, and Saturday is the holy day." "Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer" is an Alabama fan's attempt to fathom that religious experience by following a group of RV-driving Crimson Tide faithful on their season-long pilgrimage to stadiums around the Southeastern Conference.
<br />
<br />The religiosity of Alabama football fans is a special case, even for the South.  There are no major league pro teams in their home state for Alabamians to worship, so the Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers are the icons in their sports universe; and if the South at large is "Christ-haunted" (in the words of Flannery O'Connor), Alabama also is haunted by the spirit of Paul "Bear" Bryant.  Elevated to Christ-like status in his 23 years as head coach in Tuscaloosa (22 winning seasons, 13 SEC championships, six national championships), Bryant`s shadow has darkened the tenure of every succeeding University of Alabama football coach since he retired at the end of the 1982 season and succumbed to a heart attack just a month later.  As with Steve Spurrier at Florida, Bryant raised expectations of consistent victory to unrealistic heights among his fans.  As a boy, Alabama-born Warren St. John had the privilege of meeting the Bear, and he appreciates the mystique that Bryant still generates in the Heart of Dixie, as well as the heartbreak that Tide fans have experienced when succeeding coaches fail to continue Bryant's winning ways.
<br />
<br />It's interesting that St. John chose to make his Crimson Tide pilgrimage during the fall of 1999, when Bama was reeling from two disappointing seasons and a sex scandal that involved head coach Mike DuBose.  Perhaps St. John needed to see the truest believers (as opposed to fair-weather fans) up close, before the Millenium.  (Why did he wait until 2004 to published the book, though?  As it worked out, the Tide wound up 10-3 in 1999 and beat Florida for the SEC championship.  They haven't done as well since then.)  Whatever, St. John's account of his adventures with the Tide's RV camp followers, while not especially insightful, is amusing and an excellent read (mostly).  If you are a serious college football fan, you'll probably recognize many of these people (despite a few grotesques St. John wrote about), and perhaps yourself.  If you're not one of the faithful (and I mean to college football), you can still laugh and feel smugly superior to we poor believers in God's chosen game.
<br />
<br />Since it's about the 1999 season, there are some anachronisms in the book.  For example, the University of Florida no longer allows fans to leave home games at halftime and re-enter the stadium after a few drinks.  There have been a few coaching changes in the Southeastern Conference since 1999.  But the book's major weakness is St. John's attempt to incorporate academic analysis into what should have remained a straightforward chronicle of Alabama football fandom.  The book reads extremely well until those sections where St. John cites this authority or that scholar about sports fans and sports loyalties.  Then the book comes to a dead stop.  Really, you can skim these passages.
<br />
<br />Neither St. John nor anyone else should be surprised to find white racists among the faithful of the Tide or any other SEC team.  Racism twisted everything in the South, and still does, only less so. There's still a good book to be written about the transformation of Southern college football since the 1960s due to racial integration of the teams and universities, but that's not what St. John was trying to do here.  "Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer" is one literate fan's effort to understand and explain the religious experience that is Crimson Tide football.  He is honest enough to conclude that, like many adherents to the true church, his loyalty to Bama (rather than, say, Auburn) is largely irrational.  Like all faiths, it just IS - but it gets us through the day, and the season.</span>

                    <span>What makes rational (or seemingly rational) people to put part of one life on hold during the fall to follow another life on the road RVing across the south following "their" football team? I don't know if you will come away from St. John's book knowing the answer, but you'll have a great trip along the way. There are sports fans in the world, and there are college football fans, but the southern college fan is a breed all unto itself. Life in the fall takes on a new dimension following teams to their weekly Saturday matches. The author's journey begins with the story of a couple who missed their own daughter's wedding because it conflicted with an Alabama Football game (they made the reception). And with that story the door is opened to  world of colorful characters, each expressing his or her devotion to 'Bama football in their own way, but while each story is unique, they all make up the sea of red to be seen in Bryant-Denny Stadium on those glorious Saturdays. The book is an enjoyable armchair ride in the tradition of the best travel writing of Bryson and others. It looks at how deep the legacy of Paul "Bear" Bryant runs to this day, over two decades since he coached his last Alabama football game. The book is a portal into a world most of us see at a distance at best. Roll Tide!</span>
