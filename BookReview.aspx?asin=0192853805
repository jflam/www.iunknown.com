                <span id="Label1">Steve Bruce conveys the essence of the field of sociology in this fascinating volume.  A well-known populizer of the discipline, Bruce presents here an introduction to a way of thinking that will appeal to anyone interested in deepening their understanding of modern society.  <P>Bruce reasserts the value of sociology as a social science, as a framework of understanding the human condition that grounds its explanations in reliable observations of the real world. Drawing on studies of social class, crime and deviance, work in bureaucracies, and changes in religious and political organizations, Bruce explores the tension between the individual's role in society and society's role in shaping the individual.  Sociology: A Very Short Introduction demonstrates the value of sociology as a perspective for understanding the modern world.</span>

                    <span>I was interested in discovering more about this subject and having read the volumes on British Politics, Psychology and Buddhism I decided to read this. Unfortunately it is not the best in the series - it fails to group its ideas into a particularly memorable structure, leaving the reader with disjointed thoughts but little essence of the main points of the subject. Nevertheless, as always with this series, a good way to get into a topic you don't know much about. The use of anecdotes and examples is engaging but occasionally seemingly off-point. Nevertheless, eminently readable. 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>David Ross (in another review) is accurate and forthright. Bruce's read is indeed willy-nilly and impressionistic. These characteristics are the fault, but also the tool, of his writing many short such summaries. Someone who has only briefly visited the discipline for a writing assignment cannot be expected to know, for example, that there is already a body of theory (developed by Donald Black) which does what Bruce implies is either impossible or uninteresting: provide scientific order to a vast array of variation in social life without regard to individuals as such, and without the use of anything remotely psychological.<P>Befitting a "very short introduction", the reader should not be relied upon for much more than a brief glance. However, it does provide the glance, and even does so continuity as well as both humor and grace. While the coverage is lacking, the verbiage is pleasingly precise.<P>Don't read this to *complete* your investigation into sociology. But don't back away from it as a very short introduction. That is all it is, and all it was meant to be.</span>

                    <span>Steve Bruce's introduction to Sociology is concise, yet covers the major ideas, problems, and architects of a discipline that seeks to be empirical, but suffers from being categorized outside the natural sciences.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book based on the fine coverage given to other topics in the series, Literary Criticism and Politics, and am rather disappointed with this selection. The author favors an extensive use of conversational examples, a strategy I would otherwise find appealing if not so interruptive, over any narrative or memorable structuring of the topic. The concerns of sociologists are introduced willy-nilly, and the reader might be convinced that the reason sociology is not a science per se is not that there are difficulties with experimentation and reproduciblity, but that sociologists lack a game plan entirely. If you seek a book that will help you speak about sociology with any insight, look elsewhere for something less impressionisitic.</span>

                    <span>This book does what many full length sociology text books do not: it summarizes the sociological perspective in an intelligible and exciting manner that both novices and experts alike will find enjoyable. Bruce uses simple language and provides highly accessible examples to give the reader a quick tour of some of the basic goals and tenets of sociology. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach an introductory course in sociology, or anyone who wants to know what sociology is all about.</span>
