But with her best friend, Suze, engaged, how can Becky fail to notice that her own ring finger is bare? Not that she&#8217;s been thinking of marriage (or diamonds) or anything...<br><br>Then Luke proposes! Bridal registries dance in Becky&#8217;s head. Problem is, two other people are planning her wedding: Becky&#8217;s overjoyed mother has been waiting forever to host a backyard wedding, with the bride resplendent in Mum&#8217;s frilly old gown. While Luke&#8217;s high-society mother is insisting on a glamorous, all-expenses-paid affair at the Plaza. Both weddings for the same day. And Becky can&#8217;t seem to turn down either one. Can everyone&#8217;s favorite shopaholic tie the knot before everything unravels?</span>

                    <span>The Shopaholic series is one of my favorites. Sophie Kinsella has created a hilarious and neurotic character in Rebecca Bloomwood. I couldn't wait to read Shopaholic Ties the Knot, hoping to read more shopping misadventures from Ms. Bloomwood.<P>When Luke proposes, Becky couldn't believe her luck. After all, getting married is the perfect opportunity to go shopping and, more to the point, sign up for various wedding registries. However, things take a rapid spin toward potential disaster. Becky's mother wants the wedding to take place in England, whereas Luke's mother wants the wedding to be held in New York. Should Becky have a traditional English wedding or an upscale extravaganza in New York City's Plaza Hotel? With Becky's signature self-deprecating humor, she tries to disentangle herself from quite a dilemma. There are some fun twists in the novel.<P>As previously mentioned, the Shopaholic books are all memorable. Even though the third installment is more focused on the wedding dilemma than on Becky's uncontrollable shopping addiction, the novel is hilarious nevertheless. I hope Ms. Kinsella writes another one. I'll read each and every Bloomwood adventure that's published!</span>

                    <span>Becky is having the time of her life. She's now sharing an apartment and a bank account with Luke in NYC, and she can finally manage with the money she has to satisfy her inner shopper. She has a fashion designer living next door, a perfect job as a personal shopper in Barneys, and the only problem she now has is Elinor, Luke's mom.<P>Then Luke proposes at Suze's wedding and Becky gets in trouble - can she choose between the backyard wedding her mother and Janice, her next door neighbor, are planning, and the dream wedding Elinor insists on hosting? How can Becky choose just ONE wedding dress?<P>This book was as fun and entertaining as much as the first two books were. Sophie Kinsella was smart enough to shift the focus from Becky's shopping dilemas to something else. By having tied all the story knots successfully (including Tom & Lucy Webster and Alicia), and by having a preview of a book about a different character, I suspect that this is the last we're going to hear about Becky B. (at least for a very long time). It's always good to quit while you're ahead, and I'm glad Sophie Kinsella won't push the "Shopaholic" series into being a never ending & boring series...</span>

                    <span>This is the second book that I've read by Ms. Kinsella and yes, I'm very much aware that I'm doing it out of order but I still find Becky Bloomwood to be a great and quirky character.<P>Since I've yet to read the first in this series I have not really had anything to judge it by. I found this story to be another light read that does not require brain surgery. For those that keep comparing this author to Helen Fielding I say Stop. This is unfair to both author's since they have each carved out rather unique, funny, and likable characters. Brigit is nothing like Becky except they both come from England! Move on.<P>I have found that there are really few "Chick-Lit" books out their that I find worth reading. Those that I do find I crow about! Becky is a ditz, Luke is a prince (okay I would like if there was just a little more to this romance but hey beggers can't be choosers!) and I thought the way he proposed was so sweet and romantic! Becky's life is funny and who can't at time relate to her? <P>For a light read that will help pass the time Ms. Kinsella is an author that I would highly recommend!</span>

                    <span>Becky Bloomwood shows us that she is incurable. For all of her efforts toward self control in Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, she seems to have made little progress on the fronts of truth-telling and money management. This tale has too many turns and begins to get uninteresting. If Becky weren't almost like a friend, one might consider giving up on her and the book. Good ole' Suze never fails her friend Becky and supports her until the end. I'm anxiously awaiting the September 2004 release of Shopaholic and Sister as, from what we've been told, Becky doesn't have a sister.</span>
