                    <span>Not a bad book on OOP concepts, especially for beginners.
<br />
<br />If you have that mental block, ya know, where you just can't think in OOP then you might want to pick this book up. This book is a nice and easy read, also, it's a bit short so you could easily get through it in just a few nights. Although most of the code is in Java, this book doesn't require you to know Java in order to understand the concepts he presents. 
<br />
<br />Although this book is very short, there is a whole slew of duplicate information. I don't know how many times aggregation and composition are defined. In fact, there was one instance where I was reading a chapter and I thought for sure I already read that chapter previously; well, it just turned out that I was reading duplicate information. Also, while you are reading he introduces UML diagrams and as you come up on them he explains what they mean, then later on you find a whole chapter dedicated to UML diagrams that he has already explained before. He didn't introduce new UML concepts or anything, he just explained how each diagram works... just like he explained it when they were first introduced in previous chapters.
<br />
<br />Even though this book has a truck load of duplicate information strung throughout, it's still a good read that will help certain concepts become clearer.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book if you need a refresher or are new to the OO world.  Most of the examples were good.  A few were just more confusing.
<br />
<br />It's a good short introduction to OO.  </span>

                    <span>Briefly:<br>If you've learned an OO language like Java or C#, forget this beginner's book.<p>Review:<br>The Object Oriented Thought Process is a beginner's book, and does not relate advanced concepts of OOP or in depth examples at all. Most of the book consists of a good explanation of the basic OO concepts you'll find in Java and C#. However, if you've already programmed in an OO language, you will already know 95% of the information presented here.<p>Weisfield's intention was to write a book for those who _haven't_ dived into an OO language, as he makes clear in the introduction. However, for some this book may appear to be a more advanced OO design book. It is _not_. For a more rigorous exploration of OO concepts, see Object Oriented Design in Java or Java Design.</span>

                    <span>I felt like this whole book could be condensed down into about 40 pages of useful material, but they needed to justify the price with a thicker book.<p>For those with even a basic understanding of OO principles, this book will be a painfully slow read.  If you see it in a bookstore, just scan the Notes, Tips, and Cautions (marked by small vertical grey rectangles) and ignore the rest.<p>If you are new to programming, and coming from a completely different field, it "might" be worth a read.</span>

                    <span>This book is a brief introduction to object oriented principles.  It may be helpful for readers trying to get their heads around the idea of OO programming.  There are a few warnings I'd pass along to other readers, though.<p>The discussion of association, aggregation and composition is confusing and unconventional.  Weisfeld says that association and aggregation are forms of composition.  I had been led to believe that composition is a special form of aggregation, and that association is a more general circumstance that may or may not involve a "has-a" relationship.  Weisfeld didn't mention what I think is a good sign you're working with composition rather than aggregation: when the 'part' object goes out of existence when the 'whole' object goes out of existence, you're probably talking about composition.  If the parts persist after the larger object is disbanded, then it's aggregation.   <p>The author drops in tips about how OO principles apply to popular languages like C++ or Java.  Most of these are reasonable, but a few seem suspicious.  For example, the author states that, "In Java, the default type of access is protected.  Protected access means that only classes in the package can access the attribute or method."  Actually, the default access type in Java is 'default.'  The definition given for 'protected' is in fact a definition of default, so maybe this was nothing more than a big typo.  I just wish the book had been reviewed by experts in the languages discussed.  <p>The book is a quick read.  The reading would go a little more smoothly if the book had been edited more carefully.  There are some redundancies and bumpy passages, especially later in the book.  The chapters on objects and the web, software components & enterprise computing are at a very high level, but that's OK if they help the novice put the technology in perspective. <p>Overall, this is a useful intro to the subject.  A decent value as well.</span>
