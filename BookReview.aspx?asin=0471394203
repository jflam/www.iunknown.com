                    <span>In the acknowledgements Mr. Derman thanks his editor Pamela van Giessen for letting him write this book explaining what it is like to be a quant (i.e. quantative analysist) and I want to extend my gratitude as well. I am a physics student with a personal curiosity in the relatively new and burgeoning field of econophysics (the application of physical principles to understanding economic phenomenon) so it was in this train of thought that I picked up this book. There is no doubt about the modesty, intelligence and sense of humor of the author, his ability to bring out economic concepts to the level where the layman can understand what is going on was greatly appreciated. What I also found fascinating was his take on the academic struggles that post docs and soon to be PhD graduates undertake when it comes to obtaining satisfying work, sadly it is more true today than ever! 
<br />
<br />While the book simply and humorous explores his struggles from post doc to the "lesser" world of applied physics then to finance what I found most enlightening was his methodology in doing research and attempting to build a new model or correct mistakes in an older one. Here in lies the true value of physics the approach to problem solving so often hidden and not explicitly espoused in Physics classes and he shows how this approach helped him (and anyone who diligently applies it) will get results regardless of field and endeavor. This to me is the true measure of the book and makes this an excellent book on finance and physics. Thank you Mr. Derman.

                    <span>The book starts with some promise, as a young physicist discovers the harsh reality that awaits the merely bright, but not brilliant in this field. You keep reading, as you expect (both from the title and from other reviews), to find interesting reflections on physics and finance. You won't.
<br />
<br />As the author moves from the physics Olympus down to the plebeian world of software, and finally finance, he discovers there's intelligent life there too! Along the way it seems we should hear about every person he met in his professional life, even in failed job interviews.
<br />
<br />Where are the reflections on finance and physics? I found none (unless you count as such the few technical comments and diagrams, which are obvious to those who are already aware of what he is saying, and incomprehensible to the rest). The only reflections are about his feelings regarding career changes, insecurities, promotions, pride, etc. As he drones on it gets harder to care for his story. Rather disappointing, even as an autobiography.</span>

                    <span>i finished this book at one sitting. i felt relieved and comforted to know my young, talented husband isn't the only who's going through this hellish post-doc procedure. for the past six months, we've been up and down with sense of hope and  disappointment at the same time. my husband got four offers but none was attractive enough for us leave the City we love so much. finally we are now deciding to look into finace. dr. durman went through what we are going through right now except that he did three post-docs. the thing is the story is still depressing. he describes on one of the first pages of his book that a quant job is looked down by traders and sale people and and the quant people are excluded from becoming a partner of a firm because its vague characteristics of the job description. i wish badly that dr. durman wasn't too honest about this part for the sake of my husband who's trying hard to put a mindset of academia behind to move on. anyway, anybody who's thinking of switching from physics/math ph.d to into finace, this book is a must. in a lot of ways, you'll be comforted</span>

                    <span>In the first half of this book, the author compares his shrinking ambitions as a theoretical physicist to the time decay of a stock option.  In the second half, he mentions how he had to accommodate himself to the sentiment expressed in Alexander Pope's couplet -- "I am His Majesty's dog at Kew; pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?" -- as an employee in the corporate world.  In the first half he writes openly about his feelings, family, and thoughts about life.  He becomes more circumspect when he gets to the part about his employment with Goldman, Sachs.  I'm not sure why this is.  He passes over 9/11 with hardly a comment about how this event affected him.  But most readers are probably mainly interested in what he has to say about quantitative finance.  I enjoyed his descriptions of people, such as: "Everyone was disproportionately fearful of Downs.  He seemed to regard social intercourse as a competitive Olympic event, perfecting his own jiu-jitsu style of converstation that aimed to quickly unbalance his opponent.  He accomplished this by making aggressively oracular and cryptic statements on whatever topic was under discussion." </span>

                    <span>One may argue that my review is a bit biased due to my association with the author.  But in all objectivity, in his autobiography, Dr. Derman exhibits his aptitude for telling a good story.  It's the story that starts with a young emigre who commences on a journey in academia and eventually leads to the paths of programming and finance.  Even when he is speaking of techical terms, he writes with the grace of a story teller.  This finessese allows the reader to easily grasp complex concepts quite easily. Yes, the same theories that other quants (the pedantic ones) flounder to explain, are easily taught in this book.  This man is as great a writer as he is a scientist, as he is a Man.  Anyone can appreciate this book.  I highly recommend that it be added to any finance professional's library.</span>
