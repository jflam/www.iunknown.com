                    <span>Florida was the last of the five National Book Award nominees that I came to read, and while it broke the trend of the books getting worse as I read, I  have to say, as I've said of the others, that I'm not quite sure why it received such high honor.  But if the five as a whole were weak, Florida at least is one of the two best in that weak group.
<br />  Like the other decent nominee, Madeleine is Sleeping,  Florida is more a collection of vignettes than a single run of novelistic narrative.  Though less surreal and playful than Madeleine, the two also share a highly poetic prose, and both display a strong talent for language, if not story or character.
<br />  The vignettes are the first-person narrative of Alice Fivey, who loses first her father when she is quite small, then her mother (to a treatment facility known as the Sans) when she is about ten. She is first shuttled off to her Uncle Billy's and Aunt Frances relatively strict home, then to the rich estate of her grandmother ("Nonna"), aged, speechless, stroke-impaired.  We dip in and out of her childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood as she moves toward a more independent life and yet remains tied to the family, especially circling around an uneasy relationship with her mother who now lives in California.  Her two most intimate relationships are with the family chauffeur/servant Arthur and a high school teacher, Mr. Early.
<br />  The prose is at times strikingly beautiful and usually has a spare loveliness to it that carries the reader along.  The vignettes are small, the book slight, and while the prose isn't simple, it's a relatively easy and quick read.  Style is the book's strong suit.
<br />  My biggest problem with the book was a lack of engagement.  The structure doesn't allow for much of an intense impact as it glides so quickly from scene to scene, not letting anything linger too much, a problem Schutt sometimes overcomes with strong finishing lines at the end of sections.  The character, for me, never truly developed into a real person or a fully detailed one, except a few times in her interactions with Arthur. As her older family members (mother, uncle, aunt) and others important to her life (Arthur, Mr. Early)  spiral down into aged frailty and/or death, there is sadness, but it is more general and abstract than particular.  I didn't feel moved by or for this narrator or these characters; I felt moved by the general sadness of the human condition.  One could have substituted any characters and it would have had the same effect.  Since I am also moved by the sad plight of the human condition by phone commercials, I can't give the writer too much credit for making me sad towards the end.
<br />  I would have liked a stronger sense of individuality, a more precise and intimate sense of character(s).  But the book's structure, length, and voice didn't really allow for it.  Since it's such a fast read and the prose is at times nicely poetic, I wouldn't recommend against reading it; it's a nice evening spent.  But there is so much out there that is as well-written, or more moving, or more stimulating/thoughtful that I can't give it a strong recommendation either.  I would, however, give Schutt another chance with her next book in hope that her language use is better served by her story/characters.</span>

                    <span>       A series of  reminiscences  and sketches rather than a novel. Alice's father is killed when she is is five (or seven, I wasn't sure). Her mother has obnoxious lovers and  suffers a vaguely described mental illness which results, for some reason, in her spending years in a mental hospital. Alice is brought up largely by her aunt and uncle and spends time living with her decrepit grandmother. 
<br />     Alice seems lonely (no school friends are ever described) and forms bonds with the family chauffeur and and her English teacher, who both die. (I was reminded a little of Lemony Snicker's disaster-prone Beaudelaire children). Later she connects up again with her mother. Alice's boy friend resembles one of her mother's, and parallels are drawn between the behaviors of the three generations. She never talks to any of her mother's doctors or discusses her diagnosis and treatment.       
<br />       As an account of growing up with a mentally ill mother it suffered in my estimation because I had recently read Virginia Holman's superb "Rescuing Patty Hearst."  There is some fine poetic writing, perhaps overly poetic. The opulent surroundings in the Midwest and Arizona are well described but I felt that the wealth of the characters detracted from realism. Everyone is filthy rich. They make their money the old-fashioned way; they inherit it. They drift in a never-never land, where money problems may involve the dreadful prospect of selling great grandmama's pearls.
<br />         It's only 156 pages, eked out with blank pages and single sentence chapters. It seems that this is a graceful and elegant literary short story writer who has yet to make the transition to the major leagues.

                    <span>In blissful prose that demands attention, Schutt is ruthless, brutal and passionate, as she tells the story of a motherless daughter. From the beginning I am in tears, so deeply does this small novel reach into the hidden places of my heart. Even while the author's transcendent words fill me, my mind reaches to my own mother, in her final days railing against a world she refused to relinquish.<p>Alice, namesake daughter, is a child born to survive her environment, with a mother who seeks emotional safety in confinement to a sanatorium. There follows a series of homes, but never one of her own and a need to find comfort in a world bereft of comfort, after her father's death and mother's virtual abandonment.<p>In her ensuing sleep-over life, little Alice must always ask, "may I...?", remain unobtrusive, be pliant, flattering. Moving from her Uncle Billy and Aunt Frances' possession-filled, strict-ruled, child-proofed home to her Nonna's luxurious estate, Alice spills her heart out to an old woman who can barely move, rendered speechless by a stroke. Her sleep-over life motherless and rudderless, Alice grows up with a vengeance, scraping a private existence from the leftovers of others.<p>Meeting her mother again later in California, the two women move cautiously around each other. In prose that reads like poetry, Alice describes this mother in a series of stark, hurtful observations and the realities of her own life as the generations turn full circle, Alice the woman, a mother almost indistinguishable from the silent Nonna.<p>Women of a certain age, and there are many, will find this part of the novel exquisitely painful, full of recognition. Florida reflects a validation of women, their ability to survive the direst of circumstances. Here is understanding for the terrible errors made by family, both intentional and unintentional. In the end, Alice's mother is "an old woman, made innocent". So are they all, their frail bones leached of ill intentions, forgiven by years of attrition. This slight book contains the experience of a lifetime, ridged with sorrows and shallow joys too meager to squander. Florida is a rite of passage and an exorcism of grief; I am in awe of this author`s talents. Luan Gaines/2004.</span>
