                <span id="Label1">For the general book lover, someone whose ardor for the printed word has led to stacks of yet-to-be-read volumes on floors and other surfaces, here's a great, enjoyable way to keep track of them all. This comprehensive kit draws upon the expertise of one of the world's greatest libraries, the only facility of its kind with both world-class research and circulating collections. It includes a CD containing custom software to organize and record your book collection by title, author, subject, location on your bookshelf, and numerous additional useful categories. Also included are beautiful bookplates, an instruction manual, and an instructive volume on creating and organizing home libraries, written by an experience librarian. The 96-page book celebrates the myriad of joys of being a book lover, and addresses such issues as evaluating and organizing a collection, and keeping it in place with bookends and shelves; caring for books, and the art of loaning books that are actually returned.</span>

                    <span>Unless you're a data-entry maven, the software is worse than useless. Why waste hours of time entering the info for your books, when the technology exists to simply enter the ISBN and get all the relevant data? (see www.bookcrossing.com to see how easy this could be)<P>The "shelf feet" info was somewhat confusing, suggestions for classifying by genre was vague, and the material could have been presented in a much more logical fashion.<P>Layout of the book also lacks...although non-fiction isn't necessarily as compelling as fiction, this really puts me to sleep.<P>There is some good information in here, but overall it is a dissappointment. I am only hoping that it doesn't take potential librarians and turn them off from the whole idea. This book reads like a marian-the-librarian steriotype. Libraries can be vibrant, alive and FUN. This book is none of the above.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>My main problem with this set is that the software, while simple and attractive to use for recording one's personal relationship with one's books (in addition to some standard cataloguing data, there are categories like how you acquired it, its physical condition, your rating of it, whether or not you've read it) and some practical details like which shelf number it's on and to whom you may have loaned it, just isn't powerful enough to solve the problem I bought it for, which is to make it possible for me to really search my collection effectively. To do this, I would like to record not only titles, but what Kathie Coblentz calls "other access points", which could be the names of authors whose essays appear in a collection, for example. It's also the case that, while you may record several authors for a book, the search function will only find an author in the position in which you entered it, (so you may have to do several separate searches to find all the books on which a particular person's name is listed as author). So this won't save me the trouble of setting up my own database, as I had rather hoped it would.<P>The book is more helpful, with sections on figuring out ways to group books together into categories, how much shelf space you need for each category, a system for numbering shelves so that you can use the software to know where in your collection to find them (more useful if you have the luxury of making these shelves be partially full, so that you just add books to existing space, rather than moving categories around when you add new bookshelves), preservation techniques, and tips for culling the collection. <P>The largest piece in the set is the ring-binder with a number of landscape-oriented brown sheets of paper, for you to print out your booklist. Again, this is probably more useful for the person who wants to lovingly look over the data about their books than for someone who is adding new books all the time and will put such a list out of date regularly. <P>So if you're seriously looking to bring a large set of books under searchable control and are comfortable using software, this is probably underpowered for you. But for the book-lover whose books are treasured objects (someone who collects first editions when they find the ones they want, for instance) and who is comfortable enough with a computer to enter some data and print it out in order to then be able to handle a physical list of their books, this is a nice gift set.</span>
