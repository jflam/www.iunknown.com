                <span id="Label1"><I>Survival in Auschwitz</I> is a mostly straightforward narrative, beginning with Primo Levi's deportation from Turin, Italy, to the concentration camp Auschwitz in Poland in 1943. Levi, then a 25-year-old chemist, spent 10 months in the camp. Even Levi's most graphic descriptions of the horrors he witnessed and endured there are marked by a restraint and wit that not only gives readers access to his experience, but confronts them with it in stark ethical and emotional terms: "[A]t dawn the barbed wire was full of children's washing hung out in the wind to dry. Nor did they forget the diapers, the toys, the cushions and the hundred other small things which mothers remember and which children always need. Would you not do the same? If you and your child were going to be killed tomorrow, would you not give him something to eat today?" <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I> </span>

                    <span>I can't stand publishers (who could it be but the publisher? no honest translator would dare) who change perfectly good titles in an attempt to pander to a certain market--in this case to the mass market for Hollywood Holocaust fare like __Sophie's Choice__ and __Schindler's List__. Nobody who knows Levi would need a title like __Survival in Auschwitz__ to know what his book is about, and those who don't know him are likely to be put off, as I was for a long time, by a title cooked up by a bunch of idiots in a marketing department. 
<br />
<br />I recommend reading an edition that translates the original, much more evocative title word for word: __If This Is a Man__. And don't forget to read __The Truce__ as well. Its last chapter is all the more powerful after a reading of both books. </span>

                    <span>Following the Auschwitz anniversary, I decided to read a lot more about the holocaust than I knew. Survival in Auschwitz by primo Levi was one of the books I read and loved.  I consider it to be one of the most  well-written, touching and compelling memoirs about the holocaust. Promo Levi is an excellent writer, with deep, lucid and compelling prose and insightful writing style. This book is one of the most influential books of my life. 
<br />
<br />After reading this book, I can't imagine any person not honestly feeling for humanity, and becoming compassionate no matter what the circumstance is. This well-depicted book is a recommendation for those interested in the plight of mankind in wars and other man-made and natural disasters. Read it and you will rave and pass it on to your friends. This is a well recommended Holocaust book along with PERIODIC TABLE, DISCIPLES OF FORTUNE, NIGHT </span>

                    <span>Reading this novel for a college course, I expected the brutality I remembered from Elie Wiesel's Night (also an excellent book).  Levi conveys the horror of Auschwitz without the level of gore one would expect.  The writing itself is contemplative and concise.  The reader is inspired to go beyond the words Levi presents when he describes the barter system of the camp or when illness swept through the masses.  Levi describes less of the slaughter of Auschwitz, but the effect had is incredible.  The writing may seem to explain just the basic facts, but it presents more emotion than I ever thought it could.  </span>

                    <span>This book is a pregnant reminiscence of life in a German concentration camp during World War II: naked struggle for survival, hunger, brutal egoism, breaking of mental resistance by forcing the execution of senseless repetitive tasks (cleansing), treating of the inmates as a herd of cattle or as pure numbers, public executions.
<br />
<br />Primo Levi analyzes the different more or less successful strategies of survival: organizing (stealing, smuggling, barter) or long time planning for a privileged position.
<br />
<br />The living conditions were terrible: bitter coldness, physically (climate) as well as mentally (one was ruthlessly left to only one's own devices).
<br />Also the Matthew effect played in full: 'who haves, shall be given; who doesn't have, shall be taken'.
<br />Yet, notwithstanding these soul-destroying circumstances the author didn't loose his faith in humanity, because of a few unselfish deeds by some inmates.
<br />
<br />Primo Levi wrote this profound human document as a sinister warning, for those inhuman racist treatments could happen again.
<br />
<br />Not to be missed.
<br />
<br />I also recommend the works of Jorge Semprun and Imre Kertesz about the same themes.</span>

                    <span>Primo Levi's recollections of "life" in Auschwitz is a truly horrifying and enlightening account.  Life must be in quotation marks, because even though Levi survived the horrors of the concentration camp, his time there was certainly not living - only dying.  Levi begins his introduction by warning the reader that these memories may not flow in order but are recorded the way he remembers them irregardless of continuity.
<br />
<br />An Italian Jew, Levi was an outlaw when captured in his mid-twenties and deported to Auschwitz.  His recall for the tiniest details is amazing, but he credits the fact that he was always thinking as his main means of survival.  He describes in vivid detail what it was like to be in the railroad cars transporting them to the camp, the selection process and what one acclimated to life inside the barbed wire fences.  As a higher number, Levi is inexperienced and must learn how to endure being treated worse than animals by the Germans and his superiors.  He vivdly describes his trials in working and living, fighting over and for every little thing that could help him survive.
<br />
<br />Levi concludes his autobiographical account with a chapter that reads like a diary entry, reviewing his last ten days in the camp after the Germans had fled, before the camp was liberated by foreign armies.  Perhaps at times it seems that Levi is detached and lacks emotion in his writing - he doesn't allow himself to think too long about these people he misses, who were brutually snatched away from him forever.  Rather, he is straightforward in recording the facts as he remembers them, as horrifying and unbelievable as some of them are.  
<br />
<br />The afterword, in this edition, by Philip Roth allows the reader a chance to "interact" with Primo Levi.  Roth asks him about his experiences and the influences behind his writings, which are mainly all autobiographical.  Levi acknowledges that he is truly lucky - his family survived the Holocaust when others didn't.  He hasn't forgotten his trials and experiences.  They have shaped his entire life and ways of thinking.</span>
