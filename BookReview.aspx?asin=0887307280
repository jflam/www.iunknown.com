                <span id="Label1"><p>An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.</p> <p>Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business -- from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed -- and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business.</p> <p><em>The E-Myth Revisited</em> will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</p></span>

                    <span>I found it really useful. I have a Real Estate Business and have 2 employees. We all are sellers and I was a sort of Sales Manager, seller, director...
<br />It was frustrating not having a record of the clients who called to the office in order to follow up their requirements, not to mension the fact of not knowing other seller's client's requirements and having several sheets of paper with data of the houses we were trying to sell in several desks in the office.
<br />After doing something about the mess we had, starting to follow a system and given specific tasks and formats to fill now we are organized to work and a much better follow up of our clients.
<br />The following step is to establish a broader system in order to be able to let the business running by itself, a business not requiring me stay here all day long. And, now after reading the book, I know how to do it.
<br />The only thing I didn't think is right in this book is that Gerber assumes that a seller may follow a system, not necessarily caring about the feelings of clients, and yet be a good seller.

                    <span>This book is an excellent book for changing mind-set of business owners. The book starts by describing many problematic areas that small business owners may have especially those owners whose background are not in the business but more technical oriented. Then, the book stresses the importance of developing a solid system, where the business process are well designed, and thought-of.
<br />
<br />As a business owner myself with a technical background, I found it to be a fun book to read. It requires technician-type owners to think more on the business side rather than technical side. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a mind-set change.
<br />
<br />However, this book focuses more on business systems, processes and management, it does not provide systematic suggestions or solutions on marketing or sales, which I believe small biz owners need most. Also, this book uses too many stories to illustrate just one idea, which is too wordy. 
<br />
<br />All in all, this book worth its value. With its price just a little over ten bucks, this book can change the mind-set of a technician-type biz owner, and possbily benefit or even re-shape the course of your business in the future. </span>

                    <span>This is a well written book!  It's like a novel, you just can't put it down, because you want to know what'll happen next.  The author uses a style of making a specific point, and then provides a continuing real world story where he discussed these points with a real entrepreneur.   
<br />
<br />Now if only Mr Gerber would write a book on finding an idea to start your own business! LOL</span>

                    <span>Gerber's book E-Myth Revisited is an extremely valuable book that should be read by every small business owner. Here's why: In my work as a consultant and mentor for small business owners, I see first hand, every day, the cost of trying to run a business without understanding the fundamentals. I see one business owner after another who is stressed out, overwhelmed, and working for less than minimum wage. 
<br />
<br />Gerber's whole point is that you have to look at each piece of your business to find ways to make it work, developing systems so you're not constantly putting out fires and reinventing the wheel. It's about recognizing that your business will grow and preparing for that ahead of time, anticipating the changes. That enables you to grow the business the way YOU want it to grow as opposed to having it spiral out of control. 
<br />
<br />Gerber's premise is that by building value in your business, you create a saleable entity. In his opinion that is the reason to have a business--build it, then sell it. I think that's a matter of personal choice. However, it certainly makes more sense to build a healthy, flourishing business than to struggle along with a pale, sickly business, regardless of what you do with it in the future.
<br />
<br />E-myth changed the way I look at my own business and has definitely helped me when I'm stepping into a new client's business to quickly figure out where the problems are. The quicker I can find the problems, the quicker I can provide the solutions. 
<br />
<br />Gerber's book oversimplifies. It has to. He has to break through all the swirling chaos of day to day small business ownership and get down to the underlying causes. Read the book, think about it, see how it applies to your own business, then apply it in the ways you think will be most helpful to you. This is not a quick fix, it's a "here are the problems, some solutions, now apply it to your own situation" fix. The most powerful part is that by making the more mundane things in your business simple, you have time for the really important functions like marketing, strategy, and business development.  </span>
