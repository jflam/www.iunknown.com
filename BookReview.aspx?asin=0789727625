                    <span>From a theoretical perspective, this book has an excellent coverage of Flash MX including almost everything you would want to know about ActionScript. This is the scripting language to bring control to your Flash MX work. <p>This book is best if you are an intermediate to advanced Flash MX user. It is also perfect if you have a Computer Science or Engineering background and are looking to ramp up on Flash MX really fast. If you are a beginner, I strongly recommend another book to get started in Flash MX. And if you are someone who likes to see a lot of examples while learning, you will be thoroughly disappointed with this book. The closest thing the book has on examples is the Flash at Work sections at the end of most chapters that are aimed to give you a sneak preview of how the experts in the field work with Flash. The CD-ROM has the files you need to work through these special sections in each chapter. Even then, the explanations of these files are mostly limited to 2 pages per chapter.<p>In terms of completeness, this book has a thorough coverage of Flash MX. The book has a semi-textbook format where the chapters need to be read in the order presented. If you do that, you won't have any trouble understanding the terminology or the concepts. Ignore what the book claims about being able to read the chapters independently, I believe that's the best recipe for confusion. The book has a very pleasing format with a good use of the color light orange throughout the book. I especially enjoyed the writing style which is very precise with almost no errors.<p>The book's 670 pages span 30 chapters and an Appendix (that covers Accessibility Guidelines). These chapters are divided into 6 major sections - Flash Environment and Tools, Animation and Sound, Adding Advanced Interactivity with ActionScript, Advanced ActionScripting, External Communication with Flash, and Output Options for Flash. I spent most of my time with the first two sections to get a handle on what Flash is all about and how to use it. I then spent some time going through the next two sections which focus on ActionScipt which is JavaScript modified for use with Flash MX. These two sections form the core of the book with a good coverage of ActionScript from a programming perspective. The authors explain almost everything you need to know to program in ActionScript including good programming practices. <p>I am now on the lookout for a companion book that is full of practical examples to supplement this book so that I can become an expert through practice...Bottom line - DON'T get this book if you are a beginner, dislike pure theory, or love a book with lots of examples. But if you have been in the IT field for a long time and feel comfortable learning a new software program explained in a text book format, GET this book without hesitation.<p>Enjoy this reference book on your way to becoming a better Flash MX developer!</span>

                    <span>This book does cover a lot of material for Flash MX.  By reading through this book, you will see what Flash can do, but not really know how to do it.  There were many times I would look up XXXXX and the book will say <p>"Flash MX can also do XXXXX, this really helps."<p>But it is VERY brief on how to do it.  So 5 if you just want to see what Flash can do or have experience with it and need to refresh your mind.  1 if you don't know anything about Flash and using it to learn.</span>

                    <span>As a new Flash MX user, but an experienced programmer and graphic designer, I found this book difficult to follow.  There is a lot of Flash terminology that is used by never explained.  Also, the authors jump into small details of Flash capabilities without providing an overview of them first.  For example, the Movie Clip is described as the most important and commonly used type of object in Flash.  But the authors never tell you what a movie clip is, what its basic features are, the variety of ways in which they can be used, and how they related to other objects in Flash.  They immediately jump into the details of the movie clip class methods.  Unless you already have an intermediate level of Flash experience, this book leaves you saying "What are they talking about?" a lot.</span>

                    <span>A great book for me! I'm an intermediate user -- been using Flash 5 for about a year and wanting to learn the new features in Flash MX and get into more advanced techniques. This book is especially in-depth on ActionScript, from the basics on up -- it's got about 200 pages on design, and about 500 on ActionScript. Great sections on the drawing API, the Math object, event-based scripting -- all of ActionScript, really. Helped me understand classes and inheritance, too!</span>
