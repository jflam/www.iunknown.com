                <span id="Label1">Someone once said that more books have been written about Abraham Lincoln than any other person in history save Jesus and Shakespeare. Indeed, it is impossible to understand the Civil War without getting to know the complex figure of the 16th president. More than any other biographer, Stephen B. Oates brings the plain-talking man from Illinois to life as a canny politician, a doting husband, and a determined wartime leader. Oates has an appealing appreciation for Lincoln's majestic control of the English language, his raw humor, and his undeniable heroism. The final pages, covering Lincoln's death and his legacy, are graceful and moving.  </span>

                    <span>The title of the book is nonsense. Abraham Lincoln is the most misunderstood figure in American history. He was an individual from humble beginnings who betrayed his nation for greed and power. As an attorney, he represented corporations and the wealthy and powerful. As President, he defied the Constitution and law by forcibly preventing the Southern states from lawful secession. Of course, he also illegally imprisoned newspaper editors, conscripted the poor and immigrants (while permitting the wealthy to buy their way out of service), suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus, manipulated the freeing of the slaves only from those states which seceded, promoted racial discrimination and their return to Africa, and was primarily responsible for the death of more than 620,000 of his countrymen. Everyone should read "The Real Lincoln," a book which contains the true facts about this dictatorial fool. In other more civilized nations, slavery was abolished by payments made by the government to the slave owners, acknowledging their prior lawful property rights. It was the law and government which permitted slavery. Lincoln did not argue against slavery. To the contrary he only "freed" the slaves when he was losing the war. Then he committed countless war crimes by burning and destroying entire cities and murdering civilians. A war built on lies? Does it sound familiar? Our historians are not worthy of the name.</span>

                    <span>I sure wish I had read this book when I had to take American History in high school. This makes the civil war in general, and Abraham Lincoln in particular, come so alive. The novel format is perfect, with it's short sections and chapters. You learn history without feeling like you need to memorize dates and battlefield movements. 
<br />It brings home the point that we were very fortunate that Lincoln was our President at that time.
<br />Strongly recommend this book.

                    <span>I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years.  Many Lincoln scholars consider WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE by Stephen B. Oates one of three BEST one-volume biographies of Abraham Lincoln ever written to date.  The other two are LINCOLN by David Herbert Donald and ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A BIOGRAPHY by Benjamin P. Thomas.</span>

                    <span>"With Malice Towards None" is a very creditable work and a fine attempt to explain the author's view of Abraham Lincoln.  Oates views Lincoln as a genuinely good man, highly ambitious, self-made, and first and foremost: a politician.  Like all politicians who are heads of state, Lincoln had to grapple with the issues of his day.  In his day, however, the issues were unusually intractable, difficult, and complex, such that the nation was unable to solve them through established institutions.  It took an actual Civil War to decide whether slavery in America must go, whether America is first and foremost a union of united States, or whether it was a Union of essentially sovereign single states.  These were and are great issues, and the greatness of Lincoln is that he stood in the center of these issues, spent his entire presidency grappling with them, and ultimately, it was his unswerving leadership, not perfect but great, that ultimately led America to resolution of these issues.<p>Oates shows us that Lincoln was a politician.  He wheedled, compromised, and was carried by great events as often as he shaped them.  This does nothing to take away from the man who, along with Washington, ranks as doubtless one of our two greatest presidents. While opposing slavery, Lincoln was ready to compromise with it, at least sometimes to some extent.  Oates does a good job of explaining this in a non-revisionist way that shows respect to Lincoln and to history.<p>Oates' writing is clear, and his research thorough.  This is not a perfect book in that it is not a complete view of Lincoln.  No 400 or so page book about this complicated man could achieve that.  On the other hand, Oates portrays Lincoln brilliantly, and with insight, as a gifted leader and politician in an incredibly difficult time.<p>I would have enjoyed more discussion of some of Lincoln's more extreme actions, his bending (some would say breaking) of the Constitution, and the extremes to which he went to achieve ultimate military victory for the North.  Oates does touch on this, but more would have been welcome.<p>An excellent book about a difficult and complex subject.  Recommended.</span>
