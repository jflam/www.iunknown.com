                    <span>By way of profiles of a dozen or so people, this book chronicles the so-called dot com boom in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1990s. It was an exciting time for the computer industry. Venture capitalists were throwing money every which way, and even a paltry idea could make someone with computer know-how quite rich.
<br />
<br />I found this book fascinating for all the wrong reasons. I picked it up in a used book bin for a couple of dollars and devoured it, marveling that people used to live this way.
<br />
<br />Bronson describes a handful of self-styled entrepreneurs. Reading this book, it's easy to see why the dot com bubble burst. None of these people are particularly interesting to anyone whose interests don't lie in the computer field. They are all single-minded: they like computers and, even more so, they like money.
<br />
<br />The author seems enamored of the Silicon Valley, but reading his account, you wonder why. There is no community in the Silicon Valley. The subjects of this book toil away at their computer projects without any regard for the life around them or the community they live in.
<br />
<br />I would glady read a sequel to this book. It would make fascinating reading if Bronson were to look up the subjects of this book and find out what they are up to now. Did they learn anything from the dot com demise? Has their narrow outlook on the world expanded any?
<br />
<br />These questions could well be asked of the author as well. This is an insular little book, but a fascinating record of the times.</span>

                    <span>The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful.    After that, the format became a bit tired.  The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over.  It just became boring after a while.  Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy.  From there, proceed with caution.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book; I liked the way Bronson chose the themes for each Chapter, such as The Enterpreneurs, The Programmers, The Salespeople etc. It did show both how many of the people in Silicon Valley 'live on another planet', and it also showed how they've transformed this planet for many of the rest of us. <br>I particularly enjoyed the Chapter dedicated to the IPO of Actuate, not just because I'm an Actuate customer, but because until now I hadn't fully understood how IPO's happen, and now I feel I do (that Chapter in isolation would have rated a 5 from me).</span>

                    <span>The economic and cultural situation in the San Francisco area around the turn of the 21st century has been described as being similar to that of the 1850's gold rush in the same area. Now that the boom is over, Po Bronson's book is just as entertaining as Mark Twain's tales of the gold rush days. As another "one who was there", I recognize the heady atmosphere, the excesses that seemed reasonable at the time, the temerity with which a bold few reached out to grab everything they could.<p>One anecdote early in the book really hits home with me. Bronson mentions an article about Siebel Systems, one of the darling stocks of the 1999-2000 boom. He relates how, after the article first appeared, he received an e-mail from a Siebel employee about how working for the company was ruining his life. When I read the book, I was working for Siebel Systems and its stock was flying high. I laughed at Bronson's story. A year later, working for Siebel had ruined my life, and I left the company in early 2001... <p>That's just the perspective of one disillusioned employee of one company, but the same story was repeated all throughout Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley, and the rest of the dot-com universe. This book gives you a great picture of life during the boom. For the "after" picture, just look at today's headlines.</span>

                    <span>That's what [Amazon.com] tells me when I pull up this book.  And that's pretty much all you need to know.  Bronson's book (which, in fact, is not a book but rather simply a bound copy of articles you've probably already read before) is like a rapidly-decaying museum piece.  More than any other, Bronson is symptomatic of the superficial, star----er writer who glommed on to the Silicon Valley late-90s, Internet-fueled craze as a way of elevating himself from his former persona.  [In this case, 'bond salesman.']  <p>Read Michael Lewis' "The New New Thing" instead for a definitive account of the same era.  Compared to Lewis, Bronson is typing with boxing gloves on.  It's been all downhill since 'Bombardiers.'</span>
