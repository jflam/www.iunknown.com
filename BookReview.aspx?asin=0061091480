                    <span>My mother recommended this book to me- she had an old 1970s edition, when it was first released.  It soon fell apart because I read and lended it to so many people, so many times.  This is an incredible book that states in simple, beautiful terms the intrinsic ability for everyone to control how they feel, love themselves, and LOVE LIFE!  If you ever find yourself apologising for no reason, allowing others to manipulate you, or feel depressed based on externalities, Wayne Dyer describes specific steps one can take to never be bored or out of control again, ironically by realizing so much of life is OUTSIDE of our control, and thus the only thing we can control is our reaction to life.
<br />
<br />"Get busy living, or get busy dying"
<br />- The Shawshank Redemption
<br />
<br />Highly recommended self-help and self-esteem builder- this book will, if not change your life, teach you steps to take control of it!  :-)</span>

                    <span>Human beings differ from other animals in that humans need to achieve "emotional/spiritual/psychological" maturity in addition to physical maturity. While all one needs to become physically mature is to survive a few years, emotional maturity CANNOT take place unless one takes the initiative to look into oneself. It is easier to point the finger away from us.
<br />
<br />When we have a flu, we take some steps to address it. We may rest for a whole day, then decide to take some medication, and then, if necessary, see a doctor. In other words (1) We are good at sensing that we have a physical problem (2) We know that we need to do something about the problem (3) We first attempt to solve the physical problem ourselves (4) If that fails or if incapable or ignorant of the problem, we don't hesitate to seek outside help (e.g. doctor).
<br />
<br />It is ironic that at the emotional level, we may even not reach the first step, i.e. recognize that there is an emotional weakness! Children may have a chance to get exposed to values such as courage, self-respect, compassion, truthfulness, accommodation, etc. However, if a physical adult recognizes that he/she is an emotional child (i.e. lacking some basic qualities in sizable measure) and needs help, there are very few sources available. Dr. Dyer is a gift to that person.
<br />
<br />Dr. Dyer does a superb job of:
<br />
<br />(1) Helping us understand the problem ('erroneous zone').
<br />(2) Offering concrete steps to work at the problem in our daily life.
<br />(3) Presentation style: His way of driving home a point by using metaphors and a touch of sarcasm makes it very easy for the reader to assimilate the subject matter.
<br />
<br />As with any book on personal development, reading the book is only the starting point. One has to put in effort. As John Bradshaw says, "It will work if you will work." Pick the top 2 or 3 erroneous zones, chip away at it, and discover yourself blossoming.
<br />
<br />"Your erroneous zones" is a book as well as a timeless reference manual.

                    <span>This book is one of the best books, perhaps even the best book I've ever read in terms of gaining control over one's life. It is truly empowering in the best sense of the idea. It comes down to the fact that you are a "choice making individual". No matter what the situation is that comes up you can still choose how to react to it. <p> To illustrate... I used to believe that I had certain tendencies (like "worrying" about all the "what ifs" for example) that were somehow out of my control. The idea of buying into the idea that some things were just "family traits" that I was helplessly born into, that "we come from a family of neurotic people who worry".<p> I have a particular favorite story which is on the audio tape version of the book (I can't remember if it's in the printed version of the book.... the audio seems pretty much like he's extemporizing on the principles outlined in the book). He tells of how he was in a restaurant and the manager/owner of the restaurant is getting very upset and emotional at an employee. Dr. Dyer says to the guy something like "Look at yourself, you're going to give your self a heart attack by the time your fifty" to which the gentleman replies "I am fifty two and I had a heart attack two years ago" to which Dr. Dyer says something like "Then why do you do this to yourself ? " to which the fellow says "What do you want from me.... I'm Italian !" ..... as if that was an explanation for why he was getting himself all worked up.<p>  Wayne really helps one realize that they don't have to "buy into" feeling like they are helpless victims of their cultural background, family dynamics and, Genetic tendencies etc. While these may all seem to be the same thing there are in fact subtle differences between them.<br>  <br> I have recommended this book and it's audio version for countless people who have felt "out of control" of their emotions.<p> The ideas in this book really work if you are willing to finally let go of the mental crap in your life that is holding you back from being happier and healthier in every way. This is not to put on Rose Colored glasses, but to be able to "catch yourself" before you go into reacting the way you "always do" and really asking yourself if it is necessary.<p> Of course there are things in life where "worry" (for example if a loved one is ill) might be an unavoidable and compassionate emotion. But I'm talking about the sort of "worry" that is about things that "might happen". How many people spin endless tales of woe that will never come to pass.<p> Regarding Waynes other work, much of it has gone the way of the worst sort of New Age thought.<p> While I personally think that there is much New Age thinking that can be beneficial (especially in terms of having people more accepting of others rather than being narrow minded and bigotted),  often it seems to be used to avoid having compassion (as in the idea that "Everything is perfect" so why help starving people). <p> This being said, "Erroneous Zones" is still one of those books I will always recommend and re-read (or listen to) when I find myself slipping into old mental habit patterns.<p> Another book along these lines that I also highly recommend is "Full Catastrophe Living" by Jon Kabot Zinn.</span>

                    <span>In my personal development quest, Wayne Dyer is one of the best.  Many people consider his (and many others) methods to be "too simplistic" or they say that if you're already satisfied with yourself, by all means skip this book, but if you are human, and are not perfect, you will find something very useful in this book, whatever it may be, to assist you in becoming the person you want to be.</span>
