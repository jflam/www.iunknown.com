                    <span>i am a former student of dr. jaisingh's at morehead state university, in kentucky. the course required two texts, a) a boring $100 "math" book involving statistisc, and b) a colorful, less intimidating $17 book by our professor. as you can assume, dr. jaisingh taught in the same style as the book is written, and provides his classes with lecture notes full of definitions, projected studies, and examples on a university-supported website. this book did well in explaining and instructing elementary statistical methods and also, at least at our institution, our professor used MINITAB statistical software and TI-83 instructions to help us stay away from ugly equations; that $100 book collected dust in the closet.  all of his instruction, both written and verbal, influenced our end-of-semester final project, which was based on previous information from our class lectures and previous exams.  i feel informed, prepared, and confident enough to carry-on and use the information provided by dr. jaisingh to apply to future endeavors and tasks. easy to read, clearly labeled and outlined, and FULL of examples. could be easily used as a supplement or could also easily be your only need in elementary statistical education.</span>

                    <span>It is an "ok" book. I bought it thinking i would use some examples/problems in the statistics class I was/still am teaching.
<br />
<br />I never used it.  
<br />
<br />"Statistics for the Utterly Confused"  has several major flaws for a book that is suppose to be accessible introduction to statistics.
<br />Language is too "complicated". There is nothing down-to-earth about this book. Indeed, it looks like and reads like a wallstreet journal (newspaper).
<br />
<br />It covers topics well and it does not spend too much time on things you dont' need, but it is boring to read, not enough examples, and too many redundant questions. (same question first stated as multiple choice, then as short answer, etc... )
<br />
<br />chapters are NOT in the order that  i would have prefered, or the order that most statistics books use.
<br />
<br />and the Title: as everyone says, it is misleading and just plain wrong for the book.</span>

                    <span>In short, this book does an excellent job at showing you how to perform statistical operations. However, it needs much improvement in explaining what the statistical operations are used for, and what their results tell a reader.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I was having trouble understanding my college textbook. I don't see any difference between the two. If you are looking for a book with "human" language that will break down concepts for you, this is not it.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book to help me in the second part of a two part course. The info in the book looks great, but unfortunately the info in the book stopped where I started at the begining of this semester. If you are looking for something to help with more in depth statitics,such as ANOVA analysis, then this book would not be of much help.</span>
