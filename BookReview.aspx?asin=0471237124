                <span id="Label1"><I>The Art of Deception</I> is about gaining someone's trust by lying to them and then abusing that trust for fun and profit. Hackers use the euphemism "social engineering" and hacker-guru Kevin Mitnick examines many example scenarios.<p>After Mitnick's first dozen examples anyone responsible for organizational security is going to lose the will to live. It's been said before, but people and security are antithetical. Organizations exist to provide a good or service and want helpful, friendly employees to promote the good or service. People are social animals who want to be liked. Controlling the human aspects of security means denying someone something. This circle can't be squared.<p>Considering Mitnick's reputation as a hacker guru, it's ironic that the last point of attack for hackers using social engineering are computers. Most of the scenarios in <I>The Art of Deception</I> work just as well against computer-free organizations and were probably known to the Phoenicians; technology simply makes it all easier. Phones are faster than letters, after all, and having large organizations means dealing with lots of strangers.<p>Much of Mitnick's security advice sounds practical until you think about implementation, when you realize that more effective security means reducing organizational  efficiency--an impossible trade in competitive business. And anyway, who wants to work in an organization where the rule is "Trust no one"? Mitnick shows how easily security is breached by trust, but without trust people can't live and work together. In the real world, effective organizations have to acknowledge that total security is a chimera--and carry more insurance. <I>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>When I picked this book up, I thought it was going to be an apologia from Mitnick for his prior life's work: cracking into supposedly secure phone and computer systems and networks. I read the book just before Hallowe'en, and that was appropriate, because the stories Mitnick recounts are really scary. Instead of wasting words explaining his own actions, Mitnick gives scores of fascinating examples of how most "security" proved to be simply non-existent. In the end, all security systems depend on humans, and therein lies the weakest link. The books shows how easy it is to gain people's trust- over the phone- and by getting them to reveal little bits of seemingly harmless information, gaining complete control over any data the con man (or woman) wants to get.<P>The book sets out security policies, and there's also a whole chapter on security training. One of Mitnick's recommendations is for companies to supply each employee with a copy of the book. Normally I'd dismiss this as blatant self-promotion. But believe me, in this case, the more people share the book's stories with each other at the water cooler, the closer the company will come to being a secure environment. <P>Mitnick makes it clear that everyone in the company has to be aware of security issues, and of the many types of attacks he describes so well, and know how to react to any demand for information, even from someone who appears to be an insider. By the time you finished the book, you'll be a believer, and you'll think two or three times before giving out information. And company security officers may want to stop simply sending e-mails about security, and get all employees (including the receptionists!) into classroom training.<P>The only problem I had with this book was Mitnick's use of the term "social engineering" to describe the manipulation of employees and security systems. Social engineering is what the conservatives accuse the liberals on the U.S. Supreme Court of doing. <P>But that's a minor item in an otherwise overwhelming and totally convincing book.</span>

                    <span>Story by story, Mitnick (once described as the FBI's "most wanted hacker") reveals some tricks-of-the-trade. Fair enough. But if you are expecting technical details about defeating system login controls or busting through firewalls, you will be disappointed. Mitnick's favorite hacking tools are the telephone, plus the experience and nerve to deceive unsuspecting members of the organizations he is attacking into defeating the controls from the inside. <P>Reading this book, you will quickly come to realize that Mitnick's toolbox is every bit as effective as the hacking and cracking technology ... and as you read further, it may dawn on you just how hard it is to counter the social engineering attack. After all, much as you might like to, you can't simply plug in a new program to security-patch your employees!<P>Mitnick's suggested countermeasures in section 4 of the book are fairly straightforward (a wide-ranging security awareness program and a decent set of policies) but implementing them effectively and persuading employees to pay attention requires those very social engineering skills described in sections 1-3. <P>I'm left with the distinct impression that Mitnick is teasing us by describing a few simple deceptions whilst keeping the best to himself. But think for a moment about the success of the "419" advance fee scams. Otherwise sane, intelligent individuals are evidently being drawn into parting with their hard-earned cash on the basis of these crude deceptions. The implications are truly frightening.<P>My bottom line: take this book on holiday with you. Once you start, you will not want to put it down and you can reflect on it at the bar. Free drinks anyone?</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on the positive reviews here at Amazon. I was very disappointed. The book is nothing but a collection of anecdotes most of which are very much the same. Over and over the same little story is told with very little value. I read half this book then just couldn't do it anymore. It was horrible. To top it off Mitnick admits that these stories are fiction. A collection fictitious stories on how someone might dupe someone else to get their password. This Mitnick guy is just using his name to sell books. The content obviously doesn't matter to him. The first few little stories are amusing and then disappointment sets in as the rest of the book is basically the same little stories over and over with a name change here and there. Complete filler. For those of you that think this is a computer book - it is not. Nothing about computers here. Its all about social engineering aka "con games". The writing seems to be targeted towards teenagers. That or Mitnick is very immature.</span>

                    <span>In The Art of Deception, Kevin D. Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the "human element." With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource getAbstract. directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody.</span>

                    <span>I'm a business person turned technical and have mixed opinions about this book. I would recommend it to people who have no awareness of how social engineering can compromise computer security above any physical security countermeasures. <P>It is repetitive in its warnings and examples, but one's reaction to that repetitiveness (boredom, apathy) only serves to illustrate how one can easily become a target of deception. One must analyze all social interactions within any high-security context to decrease security risk. This book emphasizes that a situation can actually be high-security without the average business person knowing it.</span>
