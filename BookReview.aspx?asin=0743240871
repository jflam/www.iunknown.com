                    <span>I read most of the reviews already posted, particularly the negative ones. I am not sure what people were expecting from Chris or the book but I found it to be an easy and enjoyable read. If I wanted a history textbook, I would have bought one. I wanted to read an optimistic, positive book about America that doesn't resort to the "liberals are traitors" thumping we hear from the Right. Chris mildy and briefly reveals his reservations about President Bush but he doesn't bash him. I don't expect Hardball to be sole source of political information, nor did I expect "Americans: Beyond out Grandest Notions" to be my sole source for American history. I probably won't refer to it again but it was a pleasurable read that stands way above the partisan name calling books we get from Coulter, Franken, Hannity, Limbaugh, and Moore. Casablanca may not be my favorite movie, but who cares? Some Americans identify with it. Chris did, and he's the author. I'm okay with that. Thanks for lifting my spirits Chris. America isn't as bad as some people say we are.  </span>

                    <span>I usually don't write reviews, and I am not much of a reader myself, but I am greatly disappointed in this book.  First, the book has the style of a high school paper.  The book has a lot of stories of individuals who kind fit the author's thesis, but no big picture analysis of America.  In the end this book says nothing. <p>The only reason why this book is so popular is because it says everything we want to hear.    It has the author's main points of "some basic-and sometimes contradictory-precepts, are pugnacious but anti-militaristic; they admire gun-slinging loners and heroic men of action, but love the little guy and underdogs; they are optimists with a manifest destiny and an eye for personal reinvention."  The book describes some Americans who were optimists.  But there are equally important Americans, like Alexander Hamilton, who are not optimists.   The book also claims that America loves the underdog.  Why are the Yankees so popular then?  Or that we are reluctant to go to war.  Iraq, Spanish American War, War of 1812???   There are a lot of reasons why America is such a dominate power.  In my opinion, the reasons why America has dominates is because we have a lot of natural resources, a lot of freedom that allows us to go from rags to riches, massive immigration, and a lot of luck.  Rome lasted for over a millennium.  America has barely lasted two centuries, and our dominance is more recent that that.  I love this country; let's just keep things in prospective.</span>

                    <span>If you enjoy politics, American history, and movies, check out this read.  What makes America great? Chris Matthews tells us.  From the infinitely sagacious leadership of George Washington to the tantalizing, yet almost palpable, American dream symbolized by Jay Gatsby to the idealistic moral indignation of Jefferson Smith, Matthews smoothly runs the gamut of the great American landscape.  Matthews exalts such seemingly common men as Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Harry Truman who exhibited, in what was no accident, truly uncommon leadership.  <p>Lincoln was said to have rebuked those who complained of Grant's heavy alcohol consumption.  Find out what he drinks and give it to the other generals, the president told them.  "I can't spare this man.  He fights." <p>Truman, sworn in to office as Vice President just 3 months prior to assuming the Presidency, was, as Matthews states, "a regular fellow who just as easily could be standing behind the counter when you went to buy a new pair of socks," became an extraordinary leader in a time of extraordinary crisis.  Truman, along with Lincoln, had the guts to do what he thought was right.  In using the atom bomb to end WWII Truman, in effect, avoided a million American casualties in an ensuing invasion.  The result was a dismal 23% approval rating when he left office.  As Matthews so aptly states, "Tough decisions don't always make friends."  History, however, would be a better judge; Truman now is rightfully revered as one of the greatest Presidents of the 20th century.  Matthews, being intellectually honest, honors the maverick leadership of John McCain and the eternal optimism of Ronald Reagan as well.  Overall, a fun and stimulating read that I recommend you check out.</span>

                    <span>Okay, so what makes the audio version of a book better than the bound version?  Why, the reader, of course!  How about if the reader is the guy who actually wrote the book?  Even better, right?  Suppose the guy has a highly rated show on MSNBC?  Hmmm...intriguing.  If you're a Hardball fan, you've come to expect a certain delivery from its mildly quirky host, Chris Matthews.  Here we have a gathering of Matthews' favorite moments in American history.  They may not necessarily be your favorite moments, but who cares?  It's just fun listening.  Matthews succeeds in bringing historical perspective and American attitude to what he considers to be important moments in cinema, politics, and events, which have shaped our country and its development.  He could have continued with the idea, and possibly have written ten times the volume of work, but he kept it short and sweet.  Here's the beauty of the concept.  Sequels, sequels, and more sequels.  Matthews has left the idea wide open for endless opportunities to add to the collection.  I for one will be there to purchase every audio CD version as it becomes available.  When you listen to Matthews reading his own stuff, you can occasionally catch a glimpse of the emotion he wants you to feel.  Probably the same emotion intended during the writing process.  He tried to keep it subdued, and during the first disk he appeared to consciously keep it under the speed limit.  But with everything he does the intensity level creeps up on you, and he takes it up a notch.  You really can't help but get into it.  Why is Chris Matthews so successful, well respected, and yes feared by certain political and media figures?  Because they don't take the time to research what his passions are before they appear on his show.  My advice to guys like Kerry, Dean, and Gephardt is simple.  Read or listen to Matthews' book before going on Hardball.  If you're not good at thinking on your feet or taking the control away from the host (good luck), then you run the risk of being eaten alive like one Dennis Kucinich.  Now the guy won't even appear on Matthews' series of shows from the Kennedy School of Government.  Have a nice life, Dennis. If you're a guy like Joe Biden, however, who happens to be one of the guys that Matthews can't seem to touch, then you don't need the prep.  Kerry should have read this book.  I'm typing this before the Howard Dean show.  Can't wait for the fireworks.  They really need to let Chris moderate one of these debates.  Wouldn't that be fun?  One day MSNBC will smarten up and put Matthews up against O'Reilly.  Anyway, you won't be disappointed with the book in any version unless you can't stand the guy.  But if you're not a fan of his stuff then what are you doing even reading this review? I'm not trying to be a Chris Matthews suck up, or maybe I am, but I happen to like the guy.  His idealistic albeit liberal approach reflects true patriotism.  It is not only patriotic to question one's government, but it is every American's duty and responsibility.</span>

                    <span>I bought and read this book based on the rave reviews given to it on the Don Imus radio show. What a HUGE mistake!<p>The book is, quite simply, "history for dummies". If you know absolutely NOTHING about American history, then you might enjoy this book. Matthews simplifies everything and accepts at face value the myths and inaccuracies of American history usually  taught to grammar school students. Quite simply, the book has no depth. (And I suspect that Matthews' knowledge of American history has no depth either!)<p>As a Civil War "buff" of some 40 years (with a keen interest in America going back to colonial times), perhaps I was expecting too much from Matthews. I did not expect a comprehensive history in so short a book, but I expected some substance -- but there was none. If I were Matthews, I would be ashamed to have my name associated with it.<p>Save your money!! This book is garbage.</span>
