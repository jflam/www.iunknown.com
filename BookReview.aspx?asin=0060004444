                <span id="Label1">Dick Morris is one of America's sharpest political minds. As a professional consultant, he has helped candidates from both parties understand public opinion and win elections--most notably President Clinton in 1996 (an experience Morris described in the bestselling book <I>Behind the Oval Office</I>). He is also a founding father of "triangulation," a strategy Clinton employed to great effect; according to Morris, George W. Bush also uses it quite well. "The identification of certain problems with certain parties or factions opens up a magnificent strategic opportunity: the chance to solve the other side's problems," writes Morris in <I>Power Plays</I>. In other words, if public concerns about welfare dependency drive voters toward the GOP, then Democrats ought to confront this issue head-on. "Solve the problems that keep the other side in business, and it will go broke. Give them what they want and they will go away." <I>Power Plays</I>, however, is not simply a primer on triangulation; it is an analysis of how various political strategies have helped and hindered candidates. Morris writes at length about determining when standing for principle works and when it doesn't, as well as a number of other approaches, including "divide and conquer" and "reform your own party." This is a first-rate book for readers who enjoy the gamesmanship of politics. </span>

                    <span>When you talk about political pundits, you talk about Dick Morris.  After all, it's Dick Morris - need I say more.  Didn't think so.  Dick Morris has proven himself amongst preeminent political gurus of the last quarter century through his skillful handling of Clinton's ongoing improprieties in The White House.  Although he was let go by Clinton, Dick Morris shows little or no ill will towards his former boss.  He tends to lampoon Al Gore moreso and his total fiasco of a campaign in 2000.  From his unique insights into Watergate to his visceral reaction to Hillary's lewd advances toward him, this shocking tour de force is any political pundit's book du jour, if you will.  I was contemplating giving it 4 stars due to his lack of dirt on Clinton, but then I remembered one thing: It's Dick Morris.  5 Stars.</span>

                    <span>Morris examines why various political leaders, particularly reformers, won or lost.  He looks and the strength and weaknesses of these leaders, what they did, the opportunities taken and those missed.  This book is essential not only for those in politics, but anyone who is looking for a fresh look at leadership in general.  Most of the books I read go on a bookshelf once I am done - this one is right behind my desk, as I find myself referring to it often.  Truly an excellent book.</span>

                    <span>Morris is an intelligent and astute political advisor, but this book is dull, repeats itself and really has nothing to say. The new prince was an exciting piece of political writing, this is dull and dreary. Morris has nothing really to say and is only at his best when dealing with contemporary politicians such as Al Gore. He loses himself in chapters on DeGaulle and other leaders.</span>
