                    <span>I was a twenty year old who aspired to achieve. I had all the hopes and dreams imaginable. I had the fire in my belly and was confident that I would make it big when I grew up. Someone had given me Roberts Rules as a  Christmas gift and somewhere around the end of January I decided to read  it. Well MR. Roberts Rules have inspired me to get going in my quest for  success. Although I have not acheived my ultimate goals I have conquered  many. Some say you have to see it to believe it. I say yes but in the  meantime Read this book. An be on your was to SUCCESS!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I had no idea who Roberts was when I picked up his book. But good gawd I am impressed! This guy is ballsy and brash and inspiring. He belongs in my book on P.T. Barnum, "There's a Customer Born Every Minute." I  admire him for coming out of nowhere, with nothing, and making millions  with sheer balls, hard work, and plenty of honesty. An absolutely terrific  book! Reading it feels like being at a high action boxing match or  basketball game. Riveting!</span>

                    <span>The book has its moments but it clearly hasn't told me anything new.  This is basically a mainstream success story and it doesn't guide me into a new direction.  Next?</span>
