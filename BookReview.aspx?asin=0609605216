                <span id="Label1">"Our innate idiosyncrasies are actually more endearing to others than our most glorious personal achievements," writes author Veronique Vienne in this pretty little book, with its intriguing, sepia-tone photographs by Erica Lennard. Vienne offers 10 meditative essays about how to be successful and happy without being perfect. Quirkiness, after all, is creative. She encourages you to "find solace in your shortcomings and even celebrate your most embarrassing lapses." The essays include "the art of making mistakes," "the art of looking like yourself," "the art of having nothing to wear," and "the art of being neither rich nor famous."  Vienne envisions a world where people could bump into furniture and forget to return phone calls "without getting unduly annoyed with themselves," never consult shopping lists at the checkout counter, and "only carry bags you could use as pillows." This is a delightful book, but there's a major problem: anyone over 40 will have trouble reading it. The small, brown type on gray pages is artsy to the point of being barely legible, even with reading glasses. Buy this for a youthful reader!  <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>In the second "Art" book by Véronique Vienne, the author again teams up with photographer Erica Lennard to produce a wonderfully worded and illustrated compilation of poignant views on style, mannerism and (im)perfection. It's not overly analytical, and there is much more here than the "I'm OK; you're OK" theme. I would recommend this book to anyone.<P>In just ten short chapters, Ms. Vienne employs great wit, clever mataphors, and strikingly up-to-date commentary about how we should be celebrating the gap between the ideal for which we are striving and the reality of our true selves. A great example of some witty incongruity comes from a chapter entitled "The Art of Having Nothing to Wear." "Think about it this way: Radiocarbon in fabric has a half-life of 5,730 years--give or take 40 years. The style of an outfit is subjective, elusive, and volatile, with a half-life of less than two months." I have to applaud a writer who can link science and fashion in such an ingenious manner.<P>Rather than being overly analytical, this book creates an ART (key word) out of what somebody, somewhere, thinks are our shortcomings. Among other topics, the chapters touch on the acceptability of being shy, disorganized, or silly (my specialty). The "un"-this, the "not"-that or the "dis"-whatever parts of ourselves really aren't so bad if we view life's contents from a less serious, more quirky perspective. Cultivate a weed, and sooner or later you'll get a flower out of it. A famous actress (Elizabeth Taylor, I think) once said that a face is not beautiful without flaws. Ms. Vienne is telling us that, given a lemon, we can make ... lemon soufflé!<P>As in the previous "The Art of Doing Nothing," Ms. Lennard's sepia duotone photos provide a tranquil beauty that offsets, yet complements, the spirited tone of this book. The "art" in this book will grow on you.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book, like the other Veronique Vienne books! In a time and culture that makes you feel like you have to be everything to everyone, and look good in the process, this makes you want to be yourself and remember that people don't like perfect people anyway!! They like people who are like themselves!! Don't you love hearing from other people, "oh my gosh!! i do that too!! i thought i was the only one who does that!!" its about quirks (and how beautiful it makes us as an individual) how imperfections make you unique, and that we should have a sense of humor about it... cause no one is perfect, and the most interesting people to me are the most "imperfect." Now if you will excuse me, i have to go watch threes company on nick at nite.. (see? i watch it too!) :) PS... the pictures in the book are amazing as well and really adds something to it.</span>

                    <span>I received this book as a shower gift for the birth of my third child from an aunt who has 5 children herself. In it, she wrote: "Imperfection is the most you can strive for, Insanity is what you try to avoid." Having 2 little ones in diapers and cribs at the same time I now know what she means. I loved this book because it make me feel like it was okay to not only be myself, but to celebrate it and enjoy it.</span>

                    <span>I got this book looking for some occasional inspiration on self acceptance. While there's some value in the essays, quite a bit of the text is rather inane. A fairly substantial portion of the essays are geared toward women, a fact not mentioned on the cover of the introduction. On the other hand, the photos are really quite interesting.<P>Retail selling price is a bit high for a 96-page book.<P>Still, it's perfectly acceptable as a coffee table book and worth purchasing if you can get it at a discount.</span>
