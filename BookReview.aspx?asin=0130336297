                    <span>This book by Marketing Guru Philip Kotler is a Bible you must read before starting your career in Marketing. 'Marketing Management' mainly focuses on strategic decisions of a marketer, such as positioning, segmentation, startegies at different stages of product life cycle, brand building strategies, etc. It is better to finish 'Principles of Marketing' first to understand the strategies in marketing management. 
<br />A joy to read, with great case studies and online companion site.</span>

                    <span>No doubt this book is a classic in Marketing - most any MBA program in the world has this book as required, if not optional, reading.  If you're taking an academic Marketing class, you'll probably be required to buy this, and rightfully so.  If you need a desk reference on Marketing, again this will be a good read.
<br />
<br />That said, it is a very long and detailed read that covers Marketing definitions, Marketing gurus, Marketing tactics, Marketing strategy...  The whole 9 (or 10?) yards.  In being everything to everyone, the book loses some of it's strength.  If your interests are less broad and academic, the book is too broad.  Interesting in improving your advertising?  There's more precise books out there.  Interested in applied Marketing Strategy?  Again, there's more focused books available than even just reading Kotler's sections.</span>

                    <span>It's not an easy task to thoroughly review and summarize such a vast discipline as Marketing. Prof. Kotler's book is definitely the best choice for those wishing to start learning Marketing from scratch as well for those experts wishing to review or deepen their knowledge through the extensive bibliography which is provided. The reading is easy and enjoyable, thanks to pictures, examples from everyday's life and common Marketing mistakes that make you master the art of observation and strategy. It would have been useful to dedicate a chapter or two to quantitative analysis methods, such as the usage of statistics and so on, but such a miss is easily forgiven once you get through the text and get caught by the Author's style.</span>

                    <span>Great text for marketing basics. If you need a place to start this is it. It delves into a variety of topics and covers the extensive ground of marketing management. Should be great for students and professionals because it has many real life examples. It is very general, not industry specific. So, if you're looking for marketing specifically for hospitality and tourism for example, Kotler co-authored a textbook on that too. (another great book on that topic is Heads in Beds-hospitality and tourism marketing). A great book on branding is Keller's Brand Management.</span>
