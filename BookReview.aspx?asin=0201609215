                    <span>Are you tired of spending hours of your time searching for 3d documentation on the net? Are you tired of searching for books? Are you tired of spending $50 on a book only to find out that it doesn't cover any  of the subjects you were hoping for? Introduction to Computer Graphics  covers every aspect of 3d theory to get any beginner started. It is true  that some of the math requires more than high school education, but that  didn't stop me when I read it in 9th grade. And if I can understand it,  pretty much anybody can. If a person reads this book straight through, he  not only will learn nothing but will have wasted his time too. Why? Well,  half the book is full of mathematical equations and formulas. The author  basically thinks like this: I supply you with the formulas and why they  work, you figure out how to put it in your program. Although I'm not trying  to attack the way the author wrote the book and a lot of his formulas come  with C++ code, there's some stuff he doesn't explain like: HOW TO PUT IT  ALL TOGETHER! A book like this could be classified as an excellent source  of reference.  The reason that this book stands out from all the rest is  that information isn't hidden in the words. It's all straightforward  explanations and formulas with a lot of graphics to reinforce the reader's  knowledge. Also at the end of each chapter the author gives you a number of  exercises to do for those people out there that got too much time on their  hands. All together I loved it and I learned a LOT of valuable information.</span>

                    <span>This is the 3D programmers bible for 3D graphics.  It is far from a breeze to read as the nature of the beast is not an easy subject.<p>One of the most wonderful things about this book is that it supplies an extensive  bibliography about each subject covered.<p>It isn't a "how to"  for DirectX or OpenGL it's more of a "here are the equations" for  3D in pretty much every aspect.<p>You have to have it.<p>You don't? Buy  it!<p>Expect to brush up on your maths tho! (unless yur a math head :)  )<p>Regards,<p>Ian</span>

                    <span>There are plenty of equations and theory for the mathematician, but even better for folks like me (hackers), there is a nice sprinkling of C code and example images.  If you need the most comprehensive reference, go with the unabridged version ("Computer Graphics:  Principles and Practicies", all 1175 pages of it!), but if you are looking for an introduction, I would recommend this book.</span>

This new introductory text to computer graphics is an adaptation of Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice,Second Edition, which remains the most comprehensive and authoritative work in the field. While retaining the currency and accuracy of the larger book, this abbreviated version focuses on topics essential for all beginners in computer graphics and provides expanded explanations for readers with little or no technical background.
     Worked examples have been added to illustrate important concepts and techniques, and program code has been
      written in the C language to enhance the book's usefulness. In addition, the book contains an extensive illustration
      program, with more than 50 full-color images.

                    <span>This would be an excellent book if it weren't for the annoying printing errors in the highly useful 'Geometrical Transformations' chapter. Especially considering that the book is aimed at students this is a real shame. Anyone interested in this field - including students - should consider forking out another $20 and get the more comprehensive "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" which contains the same chapter on geometry but without the printing errors</span>
