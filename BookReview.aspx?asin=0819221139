                    <span>Not to diminish any one area...but, it all speaks to me. There is nothing that Jane or Pat wrote that I did not feel God's presence in. The entire book is beautiful. It's filled with the Holy Spirit and it makes you want to come back and read more. It's a work of art that is aesthetically pleasing, spiritually uplifting, cultural,...and entertaining!!! Both Jane and Pat are very gifted writers and scholars! Thank you for your gift to society! You are both wonderful spiritual leaders!!!

                    <span>One look at the Table of Contents of SHE WHO PRAYS: A WOMAN'S INTERFAITH PRAYER BOOK, and you know you're in for something quite different. The book is a collaboration between two very Spirit-filled women. This is no ordinary Prayer Book! Where, for instance, can you find prayers for 'Round People in Square Holes'? And the Weekly Collects written by Harris-Watkins are simply brilliant. However, to me, the truly astonishing quality of this Prayer Book are its depth of Spirituality, Mysticism, and Vision. The words coming out of the minds of these two women, and the way they have set them down on paper, have got to be Cosmically Inspired!

                    <span>Given the sad present condition of the Episcopal Church in the USA, the publication of this book should not be surprising. The book is put forth by an Episcopal author as an alternative "prayer book" using "feminine images of God." Perhaps half of the text is unobjectionable, drawing on some Psalms and other Scriptures for readings. The Church Calendar (p. 102) is largely made up of Christian figures. But these orthodox citations are placed among a collection of non-Christian gods, feminist heroines and pagan conjectures, suggesting that all of them are equally valid. (Examples: January 14, 15, 22; February 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, etc. ad nauseum)
<br />
<br />I take particular note of "A Rite To Redeem Eden's Goodness" (p. 164) and "A Ritual of Joining Two People Into A Covenant Relationship" (p. 160). The rite to "redeem" creates a complete substitute for the sacrifice of Jesus Body and Blood in the eucharist, re-enacting the eating of the "apple" that introduced sin to mankind. ("Taste and see that you are good" -- !!! p. 168) The "covenant joining" rite is written to avoid any limitation of the "two people" to a male-female marriage covenant. 
<br />
<br />An "alternative Lord's Prayer" by Jim Cotter is used repeatedly (p. 24, 30, 159, etc.). Cotter is a founder of a Gay and Lesbian Christian Movement in England (there is no identification of him offered in this book). The Lord's Prayer from Scripture is never used, presumably because it speaks of God only as a Father, and this book has a strident feminist agenda.
<br />
<br />A new series of Collects (p. 166 ff) addresses God variously as "Heavenly Mother-Father," "Motherly Father," "Holy God of Inner Vision," "Mother Spirit," and in one case adopts a Muslim mystic's designation "God of the Beautiful Names." These are sprinkled among more orthodox titles, again suggesting they're all acceptable and appropriate - but also clearly shoving any unique Christian claims off the table.
<br />
<br />Elsewhere the book offers prayers to Bast, the Egyptian Cat Goddess (p. 14), Arianrhod, the Moon Goddess of Wales (p. 24), the White Buffalo Calf Woman (p. 26), Pele, Goddess of Volcanoes (p. 40), Lilith (p. 45, "I was the first woman, created before Eve"), even to Thunder (p. 37) and Trees (p. 50)!! 
<br />
<br />This syncretistic embrace of any and all religions is made explicit (if you haven't gotten the point already) in a "Service of Reconciliation" (p. 175 ff) which includes prayer for "the followers of the religions of the world and for those with no religion" (p. 178) in which various cults and heretical sects, including wicca, are lauded for their contributions.

                    <span>I've shared this with friends, and used it for my morning quiet time.  It's been a comfort, despite having more Mother God stuff than I'm used to.  The prayers for women from so many different places and faiths are great. </span>
