                    <span>I read this book 10 years ago and found it to be absolutely life changing. I had never understood how to make negative events in my life a challenge and an opportunity for positive change. I am once again in a situation having to turn bad things into good and have revisited this book. I got on line to see if it was still available so that when I recommend it in a counselling group I'm participating in, I can tell them where to find it. This book helped me changed my life from mediocre to wonderfully rich.</span>

                    <span>I bought this wonderful book many years ago, and have recommended it to countless people. Susan Jeffers does a truly remarkable job to help you recognize the doubts, insecurities, the "chatterbox" in your mind, and helps you to face your fears squarely so you CAN move beyond them. <P>Written with heartfelt and genuine compassion, this book is outstanding for anyone who feels fear in the constant change of life. Fear CAN be overcome. Jeffers provides wonderful exercises, analogies, and charts with great information such as: "Seven Ways to Reclaim Your Power" which are (quoted from the book) Avoid casting blame on an external force for your bad feelings about life... " Avoid blaming yourself for not being in control..." "Be aware of when you are playing the victim role..." "Familiarize yourself with your biggest enemy - your Chatterbox..." "Figure out payoffs that keep you stuck...(so you will be) able quickly to become 'unstuck'" "Determine what you want in life and act on it..." <P>Jeffers provides wonderful tools to help you have a balanced life, in all areas in the chapter: "How Whole is Your 'Whole Life'". Her "say Yes to Your Universe" topic is entirely helpful to keep you in the moment, where you are empowered to move forward with acceptance. You ARE in charge, no matter what circumstances are facing you, you do carry the ability to determine how you are going to respond to it, by either "playing the victim" or moving forward as you CHOOSE to. <P>I absolutely love the page in the back of the book "The Choice is Mine" where she gives great one line awareness of "When I am Tuned Into My Chatterbox" and "When I am Tuned into My Higher Self" (I'll just give you the first line) "I try to control" "I trust." <P>Susan Jeffers' work is authentic and invaluable. If you feel fear in your life, this book will help you move forward. <P>Highly recommended! Barbara Rose, author of, 'Individual Power' and 'If God Was Like Man'</span>

                    <span>I was fired from my job, which was my greatest fear. A friend told me about Feel the Fear, it has really helped me deal with my thoughts about what to do with my life after being fired. Another book that helped me is Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life by JoAnna Carey.</span>

                    <span>It seems too strange to see those raving possitive reviews, <P>After reading over 100 self help books and 3 books related to overcomming fear. I think this book is very simple and does not really have anything powerful insights. <P>For example if you want to do some affirmations everyday or hype yourself up that you can "do it anyway"... than this book is for you. <P>I personally recomend the "sedona" book. it will set you free and let you deal with fear in a much more unique and effective way.</span>

                    <span>Again..."The best self-help book I ever read" but this time I truly mean it. This book has changed my life for good. Can't say more because I have no time. I am going out to confront my fears and enjoy my life to maximum without breaking someone's heart or breaking the law.<BR>Hope to meet as many of you as possible, there.</span>
