                    <span>As the title of this book indicates, "Pure Javascript" covers everything about JavaScript in depth even better, from my point of view, than O'Reillys JavaScript: The Definite Guide.<P>I like the book also because its index indicates all the JavaScript syntaxis. Hence, when someone is programming and forgets the exact word, it is easy to look for it quickly, instead of wasting time browsing through all the book. Another positive aspect, is that the introduction of the book is pretty well organized (Shows you when to use JavaScript, its origin, operators, variables, fuctions, server-side JavaScrit, etc.) and gives you a concise idea of JavaScrpt capabilites.<P>However, the downside is that the book is not for amateur programmers since some terms are not explained in detail (the book states that it expects people who has experience with C, C++, Java or Pascal)<P>Overall: It is a MUST HAVE book for a serious JavaScript programmer, it is worth every penny you invest on it. But I'd recommend easier books first if you are a firt time programmer.</span>

                    <span>Simply, this book is the best reference you'll find on javascript, it covers every single aspect, including server-side, javascript 1.4 and jscript 5.<P>But, this book isn't for beginners, it will not teach you how to write and script, it asumes you already know what "<script>", so if you don't please look for another book, or maybe you could read some web tutorial and use this book as a reference, which is excellent, every function is there, with an explanation, an example, and wich browser support it (or language version).<P>The only compliant I have about this book is the size of the pages, they are "small" in width, with no typos wich makes somewhat difficult to read, the pages almost have no margins and the titles are only on bold (maybe if they where underlined...). If the pages were of the "normal size" the book will be less thick and easier to manipulate. But this isn't very important right?</span>

                    <span>I've got mixed feelings about this book. I bought it as an update to the first edition, and the information between the covers is very useful in itself. However, the information I really need -- the DOM reference -- has been relegated to the CD-ROM. The reason that I buy reference books is so that I don't have to keep toggling between my code and an on-line reference. The DOM material runs to 400 pages - too much for me to print out. Perhaps Sams could have turned the book into a two-volume reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is a good reference for those with a decent know-how of Java, Cobol, C, or C++. The best thing about the tome is that it has a neat dictionary styled reference of methods, objects, properties, and not-real-world-enough example code bits. Those who want advanced stuff should refer the CookBook or the Visual QuickStart guides, and of couse beginners are better off with the Thau book or some such.</span>

                    <span>I am an experienced Cobol programmer but new to JavaScript. This is an excellent reference for all the items and elements used in JavaScript. The examples of item/element usage are great. There is only one drawback....the reference number of some of the code listings do not match the reference number on the CD. I notified the Publisher about this and have received no response to date.</span>
