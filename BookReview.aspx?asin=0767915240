                    <span>Peter Stark takes common sense and turns it into "common practice." Just knowing a technique is not enough -- you need good examples and you need to learn how to counter tactics when used against you. This is both a good review of negotiation skills, as well as a primer for those who are negotiating for the first time. Check this book out -- your only disappointment will be in not using the suggested strategies.</span>

                    <span>Negotiation is a major part of my day-to-day job and recently I was completely "out negotiated" by the manager of a printing company in our area.  It was still a 'win-win' but I conceded more than I needed to without gaining anything in return.
<br />
<br />As a result, I thought I better sharpen my skills and bought this book after it was recommended to me.
<br />
<br />The ONLY Negotiating Guide You'll Ever Need is great!  Not only did I finish it in a single day, but I was amazed that I saw word-for-word several of the tactics that had been used by the printing company manager (and many other decision makers over the last 10 years!).
<br />
<br />Next time I will be ready!

                    <span>Typically you get what you pay for.  I have a den full of books that I paid over $50 for that I reference frequently and I have many books that I paid under $20 for that I look at and cringe when I think of the time I wasted reading them.  This is an inexpensive book that gives valuable advice and examples that can help improve your negotiation skills immediately.  I read it twice and plan on referencing it often.  I circulated it to my purchasing department and made them read it (well at least they all claimed they read it).</span>

                    <span>Don't be a win at all costs Shark or a bottom feeding pushover Carp, but be a cooperative win-win Dolphin....this is the thesis which this book is based on. I don't think it offers much value. <p>The last 100 pages are dedicated to hypothetical negotiation situations and the canned responses one ought to give. Most of it is common sense. For example, when someone gives you an ultimatum, you should counter it by postponement and hope the other side changes their mind. I wouldn't exactly call that negotiation astuteness, but it doesn't cause harm either.</span>
