                <span id="Label1">Though it drinks deep of its subject, Karen MacNeil's <I>Wine Bible</I> deftly avoids two traps many wine books fall into: talking down to wine novices or talking up to more experienced enophiles. The book avoids these traps through MacNeil's obvious, and infectious, love of her subject, which comes out in almost every sentence of the book, and which lets her talk about wine in a way that combines the good teacher, the trusted friend, and the expert sommelier. As director of the wine program at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley, California, MacNeil is one of the world's true experts on wine. After reading a chapter on the Burgenland, for example, you've learned about the region's sweet wines while feeling like you're actually there, toasting a glass of Cuvee Suss with the author. It is this passion that leads to describing an Italian riservas as "mesmerizing" and a Cabernet Sauvignon as having "texture like cashmere." <p>  <I>The Wine Bible</I> is broken into countries, hitting all of the major wine producers and most of the minor ones. Each section gives detailed descriptions of the country's wines (with chapters on individual regions when necessary), highlighting specific wine producers and individual wines, as well as talking about local foods, customs, and other tidbits that add to the reading experience. MacNeil begins her journey through the world's wine with an invaluable section on "Mastering Wine," which lets a reader get ready before uncorking separate sections. <I>--A.J. Rathbun</I></span>

                    <span>The Wine Bible by Karen MacNeil is the perfect introduction to wine for new wine drinkers or a springboard for those wanting to explore deeper into the fascinating world of wines! Ms. MacNeil takes you through the introductory levels of wine making, wine regions and wine procedures (ie temperature, pouring, glasses, storage, etc) in a friendly teacher tone, not a snobby looking down your glass tone so often found in wine books. Her writing style is light, relaxing and friendly throughout the whole book. Each chapter is sprinkled with excellent little tidbits on everything from information on the former owner of a vineyard to what may cause your wine to take on a offensive smell! After the introductory sections, Karen takes you into each of the world's major wine producing regions giving you the skinny on their history, their terrior, their wines and some of the better producers (in the recommendation section). I am stationed in Germany and have tried four of her German wine picks, all of them were perfect! Expand your knowledge of the worlds favorite drink, raise a glass and say "Cheers!" (or Slainte`) to Karen MacNeil's Wine Bible!</span>

                    <span>The spine on my worn copy of the Wine Bible is cracked and its pages are dog-eared, even though I think the book has several notable shortcomings. As I write this, I find myself in the unusual position of criticizing the thick volume even though I turn to it for information on a regular basis.<P>My biggest complaint is that I feel the book doesn't really know what it wants to be. On the one hand, it is a comprehensive reference book that in many areas goes into more depth than other general wine books. But it falls short as a reference book because it lacks the scope of books like The World Atlas of Wine or The Global Encyclopedia of Wine, which cover more up-and-coming wine producing countries, more specific producers and, especially in the case of The World Atlas of Wine, are enhanced by beautiful photographs and maps. Though the Wine Bible is substantial (it weighs in at a hefty 910 pages) its design is more compact than the other books I mentioned, and so might make a better travel companion for someone visiting multiple wine producing regions in a single trip. But the lack of good maps makes a supplemental book necessary. <P>Additionally, the book can feel like a disjointed collection of articles that ought to have been better integrated before publication. Often, the same information (referring to multiple or confusing names for grape varieties or regions, or quality standards in specific countries) is referred to parenthetically several times, often in quick succession -- something unnecessary, especially given the book's excellent glossary.<P>But despite these criticisms, I find myself referring to the book repeatedly. Part of the reason for that is author Karen MacNeil's pleasing and unpretentious writing style, which somehow manages to please wine lovers of many different levels of knowledge. Ms. MacNeil's passion for wine comes through in the text and her knowledge of the subject is extremely impressive, with her descriptions often compensating for a lack of quality photos. And though I would like to see more wine producing areas covered by the book, the regions she does address are covered extremely comprehensively. The quality of information is also very even: before travels to these areas I have read the book's sections on South Africa, the Mosel, Loire, Ribera del Duero, Languedoc, as well as everything on my adopted home country, and could not detect any ebb in Ms. Mac Neil's enthusiasm or knowledge.<P>After some thought, I settled on four stars for this review, despite the complaints I have. The book is just too useful and too skillfully written for fewer stars. The next addition, I feel sure, will earn five on my improvised scale.<P>Once you have moved beyond the most basic level in wine knowledge, this is an important book to have. If you can buy only one book on the subject, this is not the one I would suggest -- The World Atlas of Wine gets my vote for that honor -- but if you were to limit your collection to two books, then I think this is a serious candidate for that second position. Once you've got that much covered, I'd lean toward a book that focuses on your favorite wine producing region or another specific aspect of the subject, like tasting or wine production.</span>

                    <span>It was certainly a surprise when my wife presented me with my copy of Karen MacNeil's The Wine Bible. She had been doing some Amazon gift shopping for a friend and took the opportunity to give a gift to her husband as well. Seems she had recently attended a cooking demonstration at one of Manhattan's great restaurants, Tabla, and Tracy, the sommelier, suggested that The Wine Bible was one of the most comprehensive and up to date books on the subject. One does not digest 910 pages in a sitting, but a perusal of several known wine areas, and a careful review of the indexes indicate that this is a book to be reckoned with. You won't find every wine, but those you do are sure to please. Written with clear, unpretentious prose, this book is one you will be happy to have on your reference shelf.</span>

                    <span>I'm not going to go much in depth about the specifics of this book since I feel other reviewers have already done that. All I want to say is that this is precisely the book I was wanting to find on wine.<P>I was, like possibly most people who would buy this book, not totally in the dark regarding wine; but I didn't know there was this much to know about it! Karen MacNeil does a great job of presenting a huge amount of information clearly and specifically.<BR> <BR>The book is never boring. I managed to finish it all in a one week vacation in Huatulco Mexico (not the best place to look for the wines mentioned in the book). Got the best tan I've had in a long time!</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent reference for admirers of fine wine.<BR>The author sets forth a series of distinguishing characteristics<BR>which set apart great wine from the imitations. These particulars<BR>are variety, integration, expression and complexity. Wines<BR>evolve from a process of picking, crushing, fermentation,<BR>barreling, filtering and bottling. An experienced wine taster<BR>utilizes a systematic approach consisting of sipping, smelling,<BR>swirling and setting apart outside influences from the<BR>evaluation. The book provides classic wines on a country-by-<BR>country basis. For instance, French Beaujolais wines are<BR>described in the preferred mode of St. Amour or Chenas.<BR>The Cote d'Or is highlighted as the most important wine in the<BR>burgundy family. Important historical data is provided.<BR>i.e. The Swiss are famous for their white wines.<BR>Purchase this work if you plan to entertain a guest list<BR>from all over the world. It is a good investment.</span>
