                <span id="Label1">The composer, pianist, and headgear eccentric Thelonious Monk is one of the few musicians whose touch can be recognized from almost any three-second sample of his work. Who else could have dreamed up the majestic oddity of "Round Midnight" or "Well, You Needn't" or "Ruby, My Dear" or "Pannonica"? Who else could have duplicated Monk's distinctive attack at the keyboard, with its clenched harmonies and rock-skipping runs? At least one major biography has been in the works for the last 20 years, but now Leslie Gourse--who has also written books about Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole--has put together a graceful, intelligent narrative. <I>Straight, No Chaser</I> is notably light on musicological analysis, and the author never quite delivers on her promised revelations about Monk's final decade (during which he withdrew into both musical and verbal silence). But Gourse has done some excellent spadework, interviewing Monk's family, musical associates, and longtime manager Harry Colomby; her preliminary portrait is a fine one.  </span>

                    <span>Attention T.Monk fans! This book has lots of info on Monk. It is written in a very interesting way. Much of the info is from personal interviews,  which means that there are many interesting and funny facts and stories.  There are some great photographs of Monk with other jazz pioneers such as  Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie etc. It also has a sessionography, index,  list of compositions, and videography.  A must read.</span>

                    <span>This book has gotten unjustified bad press.  The author accurately captures the "real" T. Monk.  She traces Monk's development and commitment to jazz over his career.  The author had access to Monk's family  (e.g., Toot his drummer son), friends, supporters, and the musicians that  knew him. What I particularly like about the book was her treatment of  Monk's mysterious pathology.  Monk was a very strange guy.  Various  psychiatrists discounted him being schizophrenic and bipolar.  The  concensus was that he chemically ruined his brain over the years.  He also  cultivated an image of eccentricity. During the last six years of his life,  he got up, put on a suit and tie (he was always sartorially snappy) and  then laid in bed all day.  This is a very good book and provided an  insightful picture of this eccentric musical genius.</span>

                    <span>Leslie Gourse and her team have done a book  of merit, an investigation of true achievements, but one that lacks passion, and previous knowledge about the central theme: the life and music of Thelonious Monk. Nevertheless, this book is as close as one can get to the personal life of the high priest of bebop, but not to his musical perspectives. The author misses her point absolutly in avoiding a serious treatment of the music of one of the true geniuses of american music.</span>
