                    <span>A very clear book applying SPIN Selling techniques. No fluff, no extraneous threads leading you away from the primary focus. The techniques can be applied far beyond sales, and utilized in a broader sense to persuade as opposed to the narrower definition of selling.</span>

                    <span>I don't sell, but I set appointments for salesmen and I've had a limited amount of success by using the techniques in this book. I admit though I'm new to the Spin Selling technique and have used it only for a month. The book shows you a way of dealing with what are commonly called "stalls" in sales terminology and how to convert those stalls into sales or moving the sale one step forward with a face to face meeting with the prospect. When I say "limited amount of succes", I mean that although I'm setting the same amount of appointments, my sales have gone up. I might have even dropped in appointments but still the sales went up. The book provides exercises through which you ask yourself questions that focus on how your product can solve your customers' needs and on questions you ask your customers to make them desire your product. You have to do all the work. There is no secret to sales and the spin selling fieldbook will give you the foundation from which you can build a career in sales.</span>

                    <span>I have been in sales for 10 years. I have sold stocks and mutual funds, sponsorships to events, booth exhibitions and now am selling enterprise internet-based software. This Fieldguide is an AMAZING resource. It tells you ideas and notions then asks you to apply them to a specific sales situation you are currently facing.<P>I was sceptical at first, but have read a chapter a day and have already noticed a difference in the conversations I have with prospects and customers. I leave a call or meeting with a commitment from them to take a buying action - leading me closer to a sale. I highly recommend this book.</span>
