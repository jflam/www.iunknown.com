                <span id="Label1">This volume contains new translations of four of Pushkin's best works of fiction. The Queen of Spades has long been acknowledged as one of the world's greatest short stories, in which Pushkin explores the nature of obsession. The Tales of Belkin are witty parodies of sentimentalism, while Peter the Great's Blackamoor is an early experiment with recreating the past. The Captain's Daughter is a novel-length masterpiece which combines historical fiction in the manner of Sir Walter Scott with the devices of the Russian fairy-tale. The Introduction provides close readings of the stories and places them in their European literary context.</span>

                    <span>If someone comes to me and asks what I think true Russian <P>spirit is, I would say, "duel" is. Russian duel is very reckless<P>and even absurd because the percentage of survival is only 50%. <P>Each load their gun and go to the opposite end and they shoot <P>from distance in turn until either one is shot.<P> In the book, German,the main character, is a half-bood of <P>Russian and Germany. Due to his birth,mixed with German blood, <P>he is usually very realistic and doesn't believe in magic or <P>tricks. In numerous gatherings German never participates in the <P>card games but always watches people play. When he hears that <P>an old woman knows how to win the game he sniffs and ignores <P>it. But ironically it is he who arrives at the gate of her <P>house. However, it is not his intention but he himself is <P>dragged by some magical power. <P> As quite an ordinary and poor man, German believes in <P>diligence and reason, but not fantasy or fate. That's why he <P>never participates in any games. Their game is like a duel. The <P>players say some number and they take cards until either of <P>them get to reach the number and he wins. Then a new game <P>starts as if they already forgot about the former game. Usually <P>the loser loses a huge sum of money, which means that the <P>winner becomes enormous rich. In other words, the game actually <P>changes their lives in totally different ways.<P> Everyone who has read this book would never forget the last <P>scene of the Queen of Spades. Perhaps she really does say so, <P>or he only dreams or imagins. No one knows except Pushkin. <P>Bytheway, he is not telling something moral to persuade or <P>teach us. All he shows is something like Matrix, I guess. Maybe <P>the whole story is just a trick or magic or some parts are. The <P>judgement is up to the reader. We all are German in a way.</span>

                    <span>I had been happy to read about a supposedly unabridged and very inexpensive edition of "Queen of Spades" and the Belkin tales, as (as a college instructor) I often assign "Queen of Spades" in courses on opera or Petersburg, or in which one would not neces sarily need the student to order a whole compilation of Pushkin's fiction, such as Norton's very solid COMPLETE PROSE TALES.<P>However, this edition is *far* from unabridged. The editor has taken it upon himself to cut not only ALL the epigraphs from ALL t he stories (an absurd economy which distorts the tone of these parodic stories) but also fails to provide the two-page "From the Editor" frame without which the purpose of the Belkin tales is obscured.<P>I would not recommend this edition even to the casua l reader who wished to get the true flavor of Pushkin's Sternean, self-referential prose works.

                    <span>This book is a nice (don't forget cheap) adaptation and translation of Russia's most celebrated author, A.S.Pushkin. I imagine that other editions (hardcover and so on) are extremely expensive, so this book is a good introduction into the works of a classic and exceptionally talented writer. I have read much of Pushkin in Russian language, so I can honestly say that this book is true to the originals and it is worth spending your $3 on. NOTE: To people, who know that Pushkin is considered greatest RUSSIAN (emphasis on "russian") writer and expect to find real Russia in his writings: you won't find much of it here, for the fact that Pushkin wrote mainly about his upper-class contemporaries, who (pretty much like Pushkin himself) lost touch with real Russia, hence the revolution awhile later... If you want to feel some of Pushkin's russian spirit, you should try reading his poetry instead of the short stories.</span>

                    <span>Many critics have commented on the short, somewhat tragic life of Alexander Pushkin. He was an outstanding poet as well as a short story writer later on. This Dover edition of one of his most famous short story, along with several others, is an economical and excellent way to get yourself acquainted with one of the earlier Russian masters of literature. The short stories are memorable for their simplicity in style and tone, yet poignant and emotional.</span>
