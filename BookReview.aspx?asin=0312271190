                <span id="Label1"><div>It is 48 B.C. For years now, the rival Roman generals Caesar and Pompey have engaged in a contest for world domination. Both now turn to Egypt, where Pompey plans a last desperate stand on the banks of the Nile, while Caesar's legendary encounter with queen Cleopatra will spark a romance that reverberates down the centuries. But Egypt is a treacherous land, torn apart by the murderous rivalry between the goddess-queen and her brother King Ptolemy.<br><br>Into this hot-house atmosphere of intrigue and deception comes Gordianus the Finder, innocently seeking a cure for his wife Bethesda in the sacred waters of the Nile. But when his plans go awry, he finds himself engaged in an even more desperate pursuit - to prove the innocence of the son he once disowned, who stands accused of murder.<br><br>The judgment of Caesar will determine the fate of Gordianus's son; the choice Caesar makes between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy will determine the future of Rome's empire. At the center of these two dilemmas, Gordianus becomes the unwitting fulcrum that will shift the balance of history. Witness to the death throes of the old world, he is to play a critical role in the birth of the world to come.<br><br>Drawing scrupulously on historical sources, this is the most ambitious novel yet in Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series. Saylor presents a bold new vision of Caesar and paints a compelling and original portrait of Cleopatra, amid bloodshed, battles and storms, in a setting of Egyptian magic and mystery.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Saylor has written some superb Gordianus mysteries, but The Judgment of Caesar is not among his best. Though certainly enjoyable at times, the "mystery" is weak: in fact, it barely exists. And there was, for me, the uncomfortable sensation that my old friend Gordianus the Finder was turning into Zelig, popping up at every significant historical event of the last years of the Roman republic. The odds were really being stretched when Gordianus could be at Pompey's beheading as well as at the presentation of his head to Caesar. And the unexpected resolution of Bethesda's illness seemed unlikely in the extreme, especially from an author who never shirked from the reality of the more tragic sides of life in the ancient world. Gordianus himself was often strongly buffeted by the fickle winds of fate in earlier books; he now seems to be having an almost unseemly run of good luck, including having his wife come back from the dead. I hope Steven Saylor returns to the more rigorous style and plots of earlier works.</span>

                    <span>When a storm blows his ship off course, Roman investigator Gordianus is captured by the one man who most hopes to see him dead--Pompey the Great. Before he can carry out his threats, however, Pompey himself is killed by the Egyptian king, Ptolemy and Gordianus makes his way to Alexandria just in time to see Julius Caesar taking control. Caesar intends to secure Egypt as a base, ensure that Pompey's allies cannot use it agaisnt him, and then move on but the conflict between Ptolemy and his sister/wife/rival, Cleopatra threatens Caesar's peace. <P>Cleopatra and Ptolemy both use every persuasion possible to encourage Caesar to chose them as the singular ruler of Egypt. In the course of this persuasion, Gordianus's estranged son, Meto, is accused as an attempted assassin and Gordianus realizes that he will lose his son forever if he doesn't do his best detecting ever. Unfortunately, if Meto isn't the poisoner, either Ptolemy or Cleopatra probably is--and Caesar is unwilling to allow either of them to be accused. <P>Author Steven Saylor spins a convincing and gripping tale of Egypt in the dying days of the Roman Republic. Egypt's wealth makes it a treasure that Rome must have, but its mysterious religions and its concepts of god-king make it anathema to republican Romans like Gordianus. Saylor deepens the mystery and the reader's emotional involvement in the story by making Gordianus a fascinating and complex character. His love for his wife (despite an affair), his torn feelings for Meto, and his wish for the republican virtues of a vanishing Rome engaged my sympathies and increased my investment in the story and in Gordianus finding a solution to what seemed an insolvable problem. Indeed, the actual Judgment of Caesar comes down to solving the unsolvable. <P>Saylor's strong writing and fascinating insights into history add to the book's appeal. THE JUDGMENT OF CAESAR is a winner.</span>

                    <span>Julius Caesar, who fancied himself a direct descendant of Venus, the goddess of love, was, his soldiers sang, "every woman's husband and every man's husband." His well documented bisexuality affected his judgment as he vacillated between the two sibling contenders to the Egyptian throne, fifteen year-old Ptolemy and twenty-one year-old Cleopatra, his sister-wife, who were worshipped by some but not all Egyptians as the living embodiments of the divine Isis and Osiris. As if this motif is not sufficiently dark, the author-narrator overlays an elaborate apologia for homosexuality in general and for pederasty in particular that is inarguably subcultural (pages 151-2). Relieving these somber aspects is a universality of theme and plot so applicable to our terror-prone times as to constitute a parable, just as Biblical accounts of conflicts between Syrians and Jews remind us of current events in the mideast. A few quotations employing Shakespearean chiasmus and Orwellian new-speak will suffice to demonstrate these parallels. "I come not to threaten Egypt, but to embrace her." (Compare Antony's ironic assurance to the Roman mob: "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.") "The whole world shall be unified under Rome, and Rome shall be unified under Caesar, but, for that to happen, Egypt [read Iraq] must be pacified and brought under Caesar's sway." "Cleopatra has promised to give Caesar a son [who will] found a dynasty to rule the whole world forever," and when she becomes pregnant Caesar "has no doubt that it is his," ignoring her various trysts with others. But, the narrator's son, Meto, wonders, "What if the life of anyone - even an enslaved captive - mattered as much as anyone else's, even Caesar's?" (Remember the post-9/11 military overflights above Washington, D.C., which continued long after those over New York ceased?) When Caesar is in danger of being defeated by Ptolemy's forces, the narrator salutarily observes that "the death of the so-called great [men, especially those whose hubris encourages sycophants to declare in their approving presence that they were divinely chosen to lead] is often more squalid and terrifying [Mussolini comes to mind] than the deaths of their more humble subjects."</span>

                    <span>I've read all Saylor's books since "Roman Blood" over a decade ago, and have watched him deepen in texture and subtlety in the process. His marvelous fictional detective, Gordianus the Finder, is a Roman private eye in Rome during the time of Julius Caesar and the late Republic. Saylor has always been (unlike many others in the "Roman gumshoe" novels, now so popular) meticulous in his research and takes a given historical set of facts, then plays with their possibilities without straying from history as we know it. However, of the history we do know, there is much that can be questioned, and no one is better at finding out the truth than Gordianus.<P>I have noticed, particularly since his "Last Seen in Massilia," that Saylor seems to have lately gone beyond simply writing a good historical mystery, which may account for some reviewers' who don't like this book for precisely the reason I find it one of his best.<P>Saylor no longer hangs his entire plot around a murder, but has branched out, as his fictional characters have developed, into a more mature and complex web. At the same time, the actual historical period he's entered is one of the most amazing periods in all world history - the Civil War brought on between Caesar and the Republicans, after Caesar crosses the Rubicon. Many long books ago, Gordianus' adopted son, Meto, became a staff aid to Caesar when he was just another ambitious general in the provinces. Now, of course, it's 48 BC and Caesar, having destroyed Pompey's armies, rules the Roman world. Personal events bring Gordianus and his wife, Bethesda, to Alexandria just at the time that Pompey has fled there after his defeat by Caesar at Pharsalus, seeking to grasp Egypt's riches to save his cause. Caesar follows hot on his heels, with much the same plan. Gordianus, Meto - even Bethesda - are caught in this web of shifting allegiance, lies, betrayal, high politics, and stunning world characters; thus this book becomes much more than just a simple murder mystery. Gordianus is strengthened in his character of the staunch Republican who prefers truth to diplomatic truths and integrity to self-aggrandizement - but you will see what it brings him in this new, raw, Roman world.<P>I've studied much about Alexandria in Caesar's time, but I recall no book that made me 'see' its magnificent streets and temples, its tempestuous mobs and tortuous rulers, as clearly as Saylor does in "The Judgment of Caesar." Just as his plots are much richer than before, so the very title speaks to many facets of the plot - the most important being, how Caesar's judgments, large and small, right or wrong, are now capable of changing the Roman world. Whether adversaries succeed in twisting his judgment, is part of the fun of the story. The murder is integral to the story and I found it well written and well solved; but it's only one of the pleasures of this book.<P>I've written at length on Caesar, Pompey, and Cleopatra in my own web site, but Saylor also finds a fascinating twist in his view of King Ptolemy - and deftly weaves that into the facts of history as we know it, as if he was painting in the backdrop for historical characters to strut before. <P>I would highly recommend this book for those who want a good touch of mystery, but far more well-written fictional history. Saylor just gets better.<P>S. Cross<BR>Web Author, Julius Caesar: The Last Dictator</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed several of the earlier books in this series, both because the mystery was well thoughtout and because the sttings were interesting in their own right. But as the action has become more intwined with historical figures, the mysteries have suffered and the prose become, like most novels revolving around historical personages, very stilted. <P>Having the protagonist in the room as Cleopatra is unfurled from the rug really was over the top. An earlier poster used the Zelig analogy and that came to my mind as well. The historical events and personalities seem to be acting as a crutch more than as a setting.</span>
