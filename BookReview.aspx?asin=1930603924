                    <span>I had heard about the Zone program, but was a bit intimidated on how to use the information pratically.<BR>I'm not much into cooking, and less into cookbooks. <BR> <BR>The "Zone perfect cookbook" is differant than anything I've come across before. It is beautiful to look at, and you don't have to be Martha Stewart to figure out how to make the recipes. I could relate to Kristy Walkers personal process of finally finding a healthy way of loosing weight easily.<BR> <BR>I've started actually enjoing cooking. <P>I highly reccomend this book for cooks and non-cooks alike.</span>

                    <span>I have to admit, I didn't actually cook anything out of this book, so I can't comment on how anything tastes. I was so dissapointed in that the recipes didn't include any nutritional information other than the 'balanced portion' block information. Also, most of these recipes are for 1 serving! Some of the dinners were calculated for 4 servings, but they were in the minority! I'm just not interested in multiplying the recipes out every time I need to make a grocery list or prepare a meal to figure out what I need. I was looking for a way to prepare zone meals using food readily available in grocery stores (had to look up what steel-cut oats were), and not by adding zone perfect protein powder to everything. I normally use cookbooks by Oxmoor House (Southern Living, Cooking Light), and for now I'll continue to do so. This one's getting returned.</span>

                    <span>"As a health practitioner and advocate of Zone dieting for over 15 years, one of the most difficult tasks I face is getting my clients to comply to a low glycemic diet. Food is truly our best medicine, and Ms. Walker's book offers a delicious yet simple approach to accomplish a healthy diet routine. The book's cuisine facilitates a vital diet for all body types and shapes. I whole heartedly recommend her book and approach to all of my clients and to all who wish to receive the gift of health through fine dining made elegantly at home."

                    <span>I was always so frustrated with the recipes in the Zone books because they were four block or balanced portions rather than three. Many of us need three rather than four blocks. These recipes have three balanced portions. Some of those recipes also included ingredients that I didn't think were very healthy. As a busy working mom, this cookbook has allowed me to create truly healthy, nourishing and oh so delicious meals in no time. My son loves the smoothie recipes too and frequently asks for one.</span>
