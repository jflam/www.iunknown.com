                    <span>I am very disappointed in this book.  As most of the information in this book is outdated, this book should be selling on ebay as a collectors item.  Much of the information that can be considered useful to the current ebay functionality is common sense.  That is, the book did not reveal to me anything that a second or third time user of ebay could not have figure out.</span>

                    <span>This book was probably very good in its day, but eBay has changed so much since it was published that it really doesn't hit things straight on. It has the basics of buying and selling, and is loaded with cute anecdotes. I've had gotten better information with the updated Dummies books on the subject.</span>

                    <span>If you have never been to eBay then this book is for you. It will give you the basics of buying, selling, and searching on eBay. If you have any experience at all either buying or selling, then you probably already know the things in this book. <p>I was pretty disappointed in how outdated the book had become in just a short year.  Ebay is always changing something, so some of the references are no longer valid.</span>

                    <span>The Official ebay Guide gave me the basics to everything about ebaying.   Answered many questions that I had from the past couple of years of ebaying  & now wanting to get a whole lot more.  This books raised many more  questions that the book could answer.  However it gave me the basics and  left me in search of more detailed information. So, the book is just what  it listed a Guide.  Now I look for the Handbook to ebay.</span>

                    <span>What a disapointment!  From the reviews I had read here, I thought this  book would be quite helpful.  I have some, but not extensive, experience on  eBay, and thought this book could jump me up a level or two.  Unless you've  never used eBay, and are really afraid of trying it without a printed  introduction, don't waste your money on this book.  You can learn  EVERYTHING in this book -- including how to create an effective ad using  HTML -- by simply clicking on links on the eBay site.<p>In sum, there's  simply no need for this book.  I'm going to sell my copy!</span>
