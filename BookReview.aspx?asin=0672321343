                <span id="Label1">As we've all become well aware lately, every complex system has flaws. When the complex system is a computer operating system, such as Linux, or a piece of software running under it, those flaws can provide black-hat hackers with the access they need to steal your data, damage your system, or use your computing resources as a base for attacking other computers. <I>Maximum Linux Security</I> reveals security holes in Linux and does so explicitly. You can follow instructions in this book and break into unsecured Linux machines in a variety of ways. The newest edition of this book includes newer information about Linux security exploits and updated links to information and tools.<p>  The anonymous author of this book has done a fine job of recognizing that his readers, despite the fact that they're probably pretty accomplished power users just because they're messing around with Linux, aren't really experienced with Linux or with computer security. He's careful to explain his subjects precisely. For example, he goes to considerable effort to explain how to set up user accounts properly (with emphasis on preventing obvious security holes), in addition to documenting offensive and defensive weapons like SAINT and Crack. Most entries on software include URL references to the latest versions, as well as cross-references to related programs. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Good Linux security practice, as well as specific malicious software packages and ways to defend against them. </span>

                    <span>I am a senior engineer for network security operations. I read "Maximum Linux Security" (MLS) to learn more about defending Linux hosts in hostile environments (i.e., the Internet). Compared to recent editions of "Maximum Security," MLS is more useful and accessible. I recommend this book as a supplement to "Hacking Linux Exposed" and "Real World Linux Security."<BR> <BR>MLS is less list-oriented than the typical "Maximum Security" book. Useful advice on practical security measures takes the place of exploit listings. While you'll find discussions of older vulnerabilities, the most ancient are isolated in appendix B. The appendix also offers lengthy, detailed command listings and glossaries, unlike any I've recently seen. <BR> <BR>The friendly tone of the book reminded me of a mentor speaking to a novice. Furthermore, the authors clearly know their material. For example, Linux frequently demands compiling tools from source code. Sometimes this process requires tweaking the code before running 'make'. The authors regularly give specific advice on the changes needed to get the code working properly. This attention to detail impressed me, and helped me run some of the example applications as I read the text. The authors also gave great clues on applying patches, a task required of every system administrator.<BR> <BR>Beyond its specific use as a Linux security text, MLS also lets readers learn of other resources useful to security practioners. I was pleased to check out the Linux Cross Reference project, where I can browse and link to several incarnations of the Linux kernel.<BR> <BR>On the negative side, the back cover advertises MLS as an "intermediate-advanced" text. While I thought the diagrams and explanations of the introductory chapters were well-done, they clearly depicted basic material. I also felt the discussion of intrusion detection failed to reflect front line experience with that technology and process.<BR> <BR>If you're looking for a more defensive-minded Linux security book, give MLS a try. Those with an offensive mindset (like penetration testers) should stick with the Hacking Exposed series. Readers looking for the high end of Linux security theory will like Bob Toxen's "Real World Linux Security."<BR> <BR>(Disclaimer: I received a free review copy from the publisher.)</span>

                    <span>I got this book a week ago and I have been reading it ever since. It is a very good book that gives you a good idea about Linux "do" and "don't" in term of setting up secured Linux server. I am kind of new in Linux, and this book does help me a lot to merge to open source.</span>

                    <span>This book really opens your eyes to the world of hacking (how to stop it). I presume the auther is a hacker and his insight and detail make this book a must for sysadmin. I recommend the book to basically anyone running Linux (or Unix) even beginners, because of it's great explanations.</span>

                    <span>Although not oriented towards Red Hat, this book contains many recomendations that have now been incorporated into Red Hat distributions since it's publication. However, this book contains advice and instructions to make them easier to understand and work effectivly. It also contains many system enhancements that havent been included in any distro. Any network manager or home user could put several enhancements into service, with very little work. In my opinion, the included CD by itself is worth much more that the purchase price of the book.</span>

                    <span>If you use Linux but do system administration only because you have to keep your system chugging along--this book is for you. It will help you understand the security impacts of your system administration decisions. The book is tome-like with 870 pages but is a fairly easy read for someone with even a bit of UNIX/Linux knowledge. You will learn alot about security and be entertained by the authors descriptions of how actual attacks on your system are performed in the real world.</span>
