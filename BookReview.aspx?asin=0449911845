                    <span>Harvey Mackay suggests basic details in this book, like being aware of how respectfully you address a someone else's secretary, but as simple as these suggestions are, they are critical. I read this book while I was on the public relations/sales team for the Marine Corps recruiting station in Kansas City. As a result of his principles of respect for people, care in personal committments and follow-through on obligations, I earned a quarter million dollars in documented free advertising per quarter for my firm. Needless to say, I won numerous awards and ample recognition from my superiors. <BR>Mackey's brand of professionalism -- of delivering what you promise -- is as effective and productive as it is simple. He does keep it simple, but this book is not short on value. After completing the Xerox School of Sales, I was assigned to work with the J.Walter Thompson advertising firm. This company adheres to Mackey's basic concepts. Later, I worked for a Japanese firm in Tokyo; again, they adhered to Mackey's concepts of sound business practices. Currently, I'm living in Cairo, Egypt, and I find that too few Egyptian companies adhere to Mackey's ideas of committment to customer service. They could definitely learn how to improve sales, keep old customers and earn new ones if everyone from the top executives to the clerks and receptionists read this book.</span>
