                    <span>    This book was a great read, and it was a blast reading about the great Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison's personality comes out in this book. He is a fun, flamboyant, in-your-face billionaire who knows how to enjoy the money he makes. Big houses, sharp clothes, fast cars, and hot women! Oh, yeah, he also built up a pretty good business.
<br />
<br />   Larry, you're the man!!</span>

                    <span>I found the book a fairly easy read.  It was informative and each quote was marked with a 'who said it' reference in the back of the book. The book paints a grand picture of Larry but also gives you the sense that you may not want to buy a used car from him. Overall the book gives you the insight that Larry got to be a billionaire due to a crafty ability to sell to people, and a complete determination to win. Many of the stories within the book are interesting and entertaining even if some of them may be fabrications of the people who told them. I recommend this book if you know anything about Larry and Oracle already.</span>

                    <span>Larry is the man. I admire the way mike wilson<br>portrays larry so candidly and shows that <br>ruthlessness and agressiveness are what larry<br>leveraged to success.<p>this book is compelling and chilling. lawrence joseph<br>ellison's ride to the top was not as easy like william gates<br>but he showed exemplary management skills and devoted his life<br>to Oracle and its growth<p>a must read for anyone who likes sheer brilliance<br>and vision<p>Larry portrays no emotions at all known to man except greed<p>and the desire to win at by making others fail.Lawrence Ellison<br>shows that even a second generation immigrant can reach the<br>highest levels of power in corporate america by sheer effort and vision<p>Business schools should make a case study of larry and his success story and this book is a good study into winning at any cost<p>If Larry were in Microsoft,it would be 10 times larger than what it is<p>The book also portrays the intense hatred larry has for william<br>gates,simply because gates didn't think larry was important enough. Gates bashing is also part of Larry's style<p>All in all I became a great fan of larry after reading this book.<br>But then again I am a fan of any book or movie that portrays the intense burning desire of man to succeed at any cost</span>
