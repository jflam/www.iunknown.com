                    <span>I've been using this translation since 1965 and have found no better. When I want to clarify something, I struggle with a Chinese language edition - my knowledge of Chinese is sufficient to know at least the 'raw' meaning of the characters. Some thoughts and discoveries I've had...
<br />
<br />1. D.C.Lau's translation comes closest to the actual Chinese most of the time. 
<br />
<br />2. I believe he does not consider himself a Taoist, and thus brings less 'pro' bias to his translation. Many other translations (not all) I've seen are written by 'pro Tao' folks who, to one degree or another, unconsciously bend their translations to agree with the 20th century cultural paradigm (values) in which they were conditioned. 
<br />
<br />3. It is not what a particular translation says, or how it says it, that is 'enlightening'. How you interpret what you read (hear or see) reflects who you really are at that moment. In other words, what you perceive the book to say is actually your own mind's reality. The notion that one translation or another is going to impart 'knowing' is wishful thinking.  The knowing lies in the eye of the beholder. Thus, the disclaimer in chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching, "The way that can be spoken of is not the constant way; The name that can be named, is not the constant name." This sentiment speaks to just how very inward and personal a Taoist journey is. For me, D.C.Lau's translation gets in the way of this journey less than others I've seen over the years.</span>

                    <span>The Tao Te Ching is one of those hyped-up texts that come about with the proliferation of the New-Age establishment. One can walk into most bookstores to be hounded by dozens of editions, finely illustrated, with plenty of white space, printed on unbleached, acid-free paper, almost saying "buy me, simplicity and enlightenment beckons". So, to cut away from the hype into reality, there are two issues - what's the actual text like and how good is this edition?<p>The Tao Te Ching is a very short text (I think about 5000 characters in Chinese). It is one of the primary Taoist texts but it has been used in many, many other contexts since. It's attributed to Lao Tzu, the sage of Taoism, although scholarly opinion about authorship varies widely. It opens with a line that can be translated as "the Way that can be named is not the Way," so it's quite impossible to convey the principles without breaking them. The general pop analysis is that it accentuates simplicity, intuition, the under-dog, adaptability, spontenaiety and harmony with the universe. And these all seem to be at least partially, true while of course missing the unattainable essence as all analyses of the work must. Some of the teachings are certainly radical in interpreted literally ("exterminate the sage...and the people will benefit a hundredfold"). <p>As to the edition, it has plenty of white space (this time, sarcasm aside, I think that's a very underrated aspect of works, especially translated ones). I've described the New-Agey side of the Tao's interpretation but there's also a dry and scholarly side which is concerned with manuscripts, variant readings and the like. This edition is a good introduction for someone with no ideological predisposition because it is quite in the middle, though a tad on the dry side. There are some explanatory notes but not to the extent of overwhelming the text. Basically, it's quite bare which is the point. If you're new to the text and are expecting profound insights of a new age, this is not the edition, as it presents the skeleton, and it's hard to process a skeleton into a profound insight.<p>An OK start if you want to see a fairly neutral translation before deciding if this is a mystical goldmine or accidental textual anomaly. But it seems there are better editions on both the scholarly and flowery ends of the scale.</span>

                    <span>The Tao Te Ching is a great book of early Asian Philosophy. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst translation available, which is regrettable because I love Penguin classics. Penguin is a great publisher of the classics. I would really like to see Penguin publish this timely classic by Stephen Mitchell, which most will now admit is the "best" translation of this great book.<p>Dr. Lau has a good "introduction" for the book but his "English" and word choice is rather poor and outdated. Comparing translations is good, since I have quite a variety of translations to look at. But for a really good translation, see Stephen Mitchell's version.</span>

                    <span>D.C. Lau's translation is as good a place to start as any if you're new to the Tao Te Ching, though his introductory essay might scare off some with its dry, scholarly tone.  I would suggest that you avoid reading it, unless of course you really want to hear his thoughts on the text.  Given the ambiguity of Lao Tzu's masterpiece to interpretation, translations of the Tao Te Ching are wide and varied.  Lau's is very much a Confucian-based interpretation.  Which is not to say it is not any good, however, be aware that you're essentially reading one school of thought on the text.  As for the text itself and it's meaning, it is difficult to explain.  The Way is the path to truth, but what has to be understood is that this path has no start or finish.  To put it another way, it is eternal and cyclic, much like the idea of Karma.  It's about finding the true nature of existence and in turn, non-existence.  Lao Tzu says, "Those who speak do not know; those who know do not speak".  So perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about! I guess the meaning of the Tao Te Ching is up to the individual to decide upon.  Regardless, D.C. Lau's translation is recommended.</span>
