                    <span>We all learned the basics of colonial history in school: the Mayflower; Jamestown; Tobacco; the development of New Amsterdam, Boston, Charleston, & Philadelphia; indentured servants; and French trappers / Spanish Conquistadores.  However, most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760.  Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians.
<br />
<br />Despite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew.  Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States.  There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies.  More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period.
<br />
<br />An well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about.  This is history that is hard to put down.</span>

                    <span>Traditionally, coverage of "colonial America" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.
<br />
<br />His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.
<br />
<br />Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.
<br />
<br />As the first book in the "Penguin History of the United States," Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come.</span>

                    <span>Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done.</span>

                    <span>Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.
<br />
<br />A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.
<br />
<br />Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.

                    <span>As an educator, I am often frustrated in my pursuit for new GOOD history books that I know will provide the information my students will need and is presented in a way that I know my students will be able to understand. Too many books either talk down to students or are so cerebral and sophisticated that they leave them dumbfounded or bored or both. Alan Taylor's look at pre-Revolutionary War North American continent is brilliant, engaging, and written with a flair that interested readers and students will embrace. 
<br />
<br />America's history began well-before the first Europeans arrived, and Professor Taylor goes to great lengths to reinforce that simple concept which most histories tend to ignore. Tracing back to the earliest settlers, Taylor evokes an era that is strangely primitive--strange in the sense that we are conditioned to conceive America as being born modern, as though the pavements, skyscrapers and railroads were already here when the Europeans arrived.
<br />
<br />Although a long book, it reads very quickly, and the maps and illustrations throughout are easy to read and, more urgently, relevant. I look forward to future installments in the Pengiun History of the United States series.
