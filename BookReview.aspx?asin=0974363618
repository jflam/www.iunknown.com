                    <span>I thought this was very a predictable book. From the first few chapters you could have it figured out. I was impressed with roy glenn's short story in girls from the hood so I got this book. But this was a Dissapointment, hope the next one i read is better.</span>

                    <span>Ilove the book because it keeps me guessing, and exited in my warm bed,and I want to know what'll happen next.I like the characters, Mike, Shy, Bobby, and Pam besides Mike is a vicious man at the same time he's a diplomatic man as well. I was impressed by the way he handled his business, and his girl friend's business matters.I also like the way he treats his mother, and how his life ends up made me go hmmmmmm.   </span>

                    <span>This book made me laugh, become angry, consider love & romance, trust and most of all it makes you think about friendship. I was impressed, to be a "Street Saga" that it did not have an overwhelming amount of cursing. The curse words used was done in an appropriate manner to give way for effect.  The sex that took place was describe in a very tasteful and romantice way. I was very pleased and look forward to reading other's by this author.</span>

                    <span>I had to ask when this was taking place?  1996.  So I'm like 8 years late reading this.  So maybe times have changed.  
<br />
<br />FINALLY someone would capture the reality of a WOMAN in this doggie dog world.  One that didn't rely on her womanly ways to bait a man, and DAMN sho' didn't need a man to bail her out.  If it's bodies to bag, then get it done!  Don't cry about it be about it!  I mean Cassandra Sims a.k.a Shy, a descendant of Chi-town she'd put the game on the map and let them know.  Check my stats, I'm all balls!  NO! Not this book, and NOT this girl. Shy with her dual degrees in management and marketing should have stuck to the books or waiting tables.  This fake drug dealer who came across more as a stranded damsel couldn't sense the deception from her own crew, so how would she be able to keep her game going?  
<br />
<br />ENTER VICIOUS BLACK!  World-renowned killer I mean every SHE-Hustla needs a gallant killer to step in and clean up what she messed up doesn't she?  
<br />
<br />Can you explain to me how a man can earn the tag as VICIOUS... yet he lets the entire world know where he is?  Who he's with?  And where he rest his head? "Real bad boys move in silence......"
<br />
<br />I mean I'm reading this and I'm like come on in the streets this man is VICIOUS!  The mere mention of him and his associates is suppose strike fear in your heart....PLEASE!
<br />
<br />GET OUTTA HERE!
<br />
<br />At best this is a clumsy boy meets girl book that has too many clich√©s.  
<br />
<br />'The club is dark, filled with smoke, and crowded.  They spot one another from across the room, her guys notice his guys and step to them.  Instead she dismisses the boiling drama only to go back the next day where they are formally introduced. Shy meets Mr. Black; that's Mike Black. He saves her life, and...and..."I loved you from the very first moment I saw those eyes." Our Vicious hero says to Cassandra, our damsel in distress. "So do I!" The mere weakling says as she tries to express herself. "Baby, it's not because you've saved me so many times, and I'm just a defenseless fake hustler who loves to eat it's just because!" They kiss hard on the mouth and make meaningless love over and over again as the bad guys are killed and they along with their friends and families live happily ever after.' After all they're billionaires. Do you hear PRINCE as the scene fades .....I WOULD DIE 4 U..... 
<br />
<br />Even with that said...I really like Roy Glenn.  He seems to be an impeccable person that uses very interesting words in this street saga, and for those reasons I'd read other titles.</span>

                    <span>I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS OFF THE HOOK.  I LOVED BLACK AND SHY TOGETHER.  I LOVED THE WAY HE PROTECTED HER AND TOOK CARE OF HER AND HIS FRIENDS.  I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MAN LIKE MIKE BLACK IN MY CORNER.  I LIKED FREEZE HE WAS ON TOP OFF HIS GAME.  THE BOOK WAS ALL THAT AND MORE.  I JUST ORDERED THE BOOK THAT IS A SEQUEL TO IS IT CRIME. I HOPE IT IS AS GOOD AS IS IT A CRIME.</span>
