                    <span>I consider this a great book for starting to work with ASP.NET Server Controls. I have the MS Press book also but it is just so deep right off the start that it was hard for me to follow. (Although now I refer to it more and more) I have referenced this book may times for creating my server controls and it has been very helpful! Maybe the key is purchasing all of the server control books you can find and taking the best of each but I would definitely recommend this book as a great starting point for server controls.</span>

                    <span>Wow. This book is really confusing! I bought this book last year when I started working on a large project using .NET. It's been over 12 months and I'm grown to love .NET---and built-up quite a bag of tools.<p>When I returned to this book recently to build my own custom controls, I thought it would be much more comprehensible than my first attempt. Unfortunately it wasn't. That is, until I read a few articles and an excerpt from Dino Esposito's book! Esposito's explanations were so much more clear and simple--while this book took that same subject and made it so complicated!<p>Don't buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the most disappointing technical book I have ever seen.<p>I started developing custom server controls in the earlier days of ASP.NET 1.0, when this was the only book available on the topic.<p>This book was of literally zero help despite being written particularly for the topic.  In fact, if anything, it was confusing and hindered my efforts repeatedly.<p>The book is a loosely related collection of materials written or assembled by the multitude of authors.  Some of the portions of the book seem almost directly taken from Microsoft's freely available documentation.  Not surprisingly, the weak points in the documentation typically coincide with the weakest points of the book.  In other words, the book is useless.  Wrox's own general ASP.NET book "Professional ASP.NET" and the various free online resources were of much more help in early 2002, and there are many more alternatives now.<p>By the time I was done with my first full-featured custom server control I realized that it was extremely unlikely that any of the authors had gone through the same experience prior to writing the book.  This made me approach the publisher with the request for a full refund, a decision on which was delayed until I finally gave up and regretfully threw the book in the garbage.<p>It is my understanding that the newer editions of the book have added some of the most glaring omissions (like a full chapter on generating client-side script, where the original edition offered nothing).  However, there is no fixing a house this crooked.  There are much better books available now, like "Server Controls" by Kothari and Datye.</span>

                    <span>As it is often the case with WROX books, this one is glued from pieces written by different authors. Reading their books is like having deja vues all the time. The synergy among chapters is quite poor.<p>Compared to Kothari's book this one merely scratches the surface and leaves a lot of important details by the side. If I hadn't read Nikhil Kotari's book first, I would've been completely confused by this piece. Don't get me wrong---the book *does* have valuable information for developing server controls *if you are not a beginner*.<p>Would I recommend this book? Only if you go through Nikhil Kothari's book first and then want to learn a few more tricks. Don't expect to be taught much from this book.<p>Overall, 2 stars for inadequate coverage and a ton of typos and errors in the samples and throughout the text. I really wish WROX quit releasing hodge podge books and did a better job at reviewing them prior to publishing.</span>
