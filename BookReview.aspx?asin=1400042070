                <span id="Label1">Anne Tyler's <I>The Amateur Marriage</I> is not so much a novel as a really long argument. Michael is a good boy from a Polish neighborhood in Baltimore; Pauline is a harum-scarum, bright-cheeked girl who blows into Michael's family's grocery store at the outset of World War II. She appears with a bloodied brow, supported by a gaggle of girlfriends. Michael patches her up, and neither of them are ever the same. Well, not the same as they were before, but pretty much the same as everyone else. After the war, they live over the shop with Michael's mother till they've saved enough to move to the suburbs. There they remain with their three children, until the onset of the sixties, when their eldest daughter runs away to San Francisco. Their marriage survives for a while, finally crumbling in the seventies. If this all sounds a tad generic, Tyler's case isn't helped by the characteristics she's given the two spouses. Him: repressed, censorious, quiet. Her: voluble, emotional, romantic. Mars, meet Venus. What marks this couple, though, and what makes them come alive, is their bitter, unproductive, tooth-and-nail fighting. Tyler is exploring the way that ordinary-seeming, prosperous people can survive in emotional poverty for years on end. She gets just right the tricks Michael and Pauline play on themselves in order to stay together: "How many times," Pauline asks herself, "when she was weary of dealing with Michael, had she forced herself to recall the way he'd looked that first day? The slant of his fine cheekbones, the firming of his lips as he pressed the adhesive tape in place on her forehead." Only in antogonism do Michael and Pauline find a way to express themselves. <I>--Claire Dederer</I></span>

                    <span>One standard I've set for myself after finishing a book...do I think about it in the days to come? This book has so many echoes of my life, and I think many middle-class American lives that I'm sure I'll be sifting it over in my mind for days to come. I love Anne Tyler and was stunned when I requested this at the library and got it right away. I couldn't put this down. Not all of it was satisfying, and sometimes, I wanted to shake one or more of the characters, but I think it truly reflected lots of ordinary lives lived in this time period. My parents, easily as mismatched as Michael and Pauline, married in 1943 right before my dad was sent overseas. So many of my friends grew up in families where marriages occurred under similar circumstances, and as I read this book, I thought about my family and my friends' families. I think my parents had more tolerance for each other than Michael and Pauline, but they gradually grew apart and each pursued separate interests, tho they remained married, and my mom remained a stay-at-home wife and mother long after the children left. The triumphs, tragedies, and the "getting-by" of life with the Antons seems like a well-drawn portrait of what life was like then and an honest reflection of relationships both then and now. I even read parts to my husband and asked, "Are we that mean to each other?" (Thankfully, he replied "no").I see Paulines and Michaels among our friends and acquaintances. No, I didn't like the events the story revealed, I didn't like the ending, I didn't like how much was "wrapped up" quickly in the final chapter. But I appreciate that this is the way life moves, sometimes, and it all seemed very realistic to me. Not always an easy read, but I really loved Tyler's prose, her insight into characters who couldn't see nearly that much for themselves, and her weaving of the various eras that the book encompassed. I've got to find a friend to discuss this with!</span>

                    <span>To me, this was a depressing picture of two mismatched people trying to make a marriage work. A lot people who marry young find out later on that they are mismatched, but I was worn out by Pauline's unrelenting determination to make everyone around her upset. Everything had to be her way. Everything that wasn't her way had an underlying message. Pauline is a scatter-brained fool who never grows up and never learns from her mistakes. After a while, I felt that I was re-reading "Breathing Lessons" by this same author, about another marriage where the wife was a controlling crazy person who keeps everyone walking on eggshells around. <P>The story follows three generations from Pauline and Michael to their grandchildren and how their choices managed to mess up all three generations. In this respect, I guess you could call this a "deeply perceptive novel." It's a novel where entire lives are condensed onto a few pages and it becomes painfully obvious how, even with the best of intentions, we pass on our best and worst traits to the next generation, and how they must deal with what they have been given, just as we all deal with what we have been given. It never ends and it's a part of life.<P>But I don't really see the point of dwelling on it and exaggerating it and making it seem worse than it is. Pauline was a shrew! Poor Michael, having to put up with her tantrums, pick, pick, picking at every word out of his mouth, name-calling and criticizing. Never knowing whether or not she would be loving or blow up in his face. Their poor children, trying to keep things peaceful so that Mom and Dad won't fight. And it marches unrelentingly on and on, from their dating and marriage during World War II through to the present, during which time they finally obtain the relief of a divorce and move on to different phases of their lives.<P>I didn't find the book dull, but it was unrelentingly depressing. I kept hoping that they would resolve their problems and turn out to be a happy old couple, but they don't. I give this book points for a good writing style and a story line that might make a good discussion for a book group. But I have to subtract for the depressing subject matter and the fact that this author has already written almost the exact same story in "Breathing Lessons."</span>

                    <span>Not since "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "The Bark of the Dogwood" have I so enjoyed a book. Ms. Tyler takes us on a journey through the marriage of Michael and Pauline Anton. Each chapter is a glimpse into a certain time period of their lives together. We discover how they met and the circumstances of their wartime marriage, how they adjust as a young married couple with small children and a live-in relative, later we see them deal with the thorny problems of the teenage years and so on and on. As a backdrop Ms. Tyler also deals with the doubts faced by both Michael and Pauline about whether they were ever really suited to one another in the first place. The answer is not a happy one but given the problems with their relationship over the years it is an honest and realistic one.</span>

                    <span>This was a fantastic book! Pauline and Michael had a very tumultuous marriage. This definately had an impact on the kids, especially Lindy. The author did an excellent job painting the picture so you felt like you were watching their life play like a movie. I think, after all that occurred, the marriage, the kids, Lindy leaving, the divorce, etc., Michael and Pauline really did love each other, they just were not good at the marriage thing. The title of the book is perfect. I would highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>Not being one to read a novel such as this, I was extremely hesitant to take on the subject matter. My fear was that I'd be preached to. But Tyler proved me wrong and I'll read anything else she's written, regardless of the subject matter--she's just that good. I think anyone will identify at least in part with some of these characters, but Tyler is showing us lives not spent wisely, by people who never move beyond "amateur" status as human beings. For those who would complain that Tyler is not giving any answers in this book, I think she is, but you need to fill in some of the blanks yourself. "The Accidental Tourist" provided deep satisfaction as a story, but if you dig beneath the surface, "The Amateur Marriage" might let you find the same kind of satisfaction in your own story. Love and happiness are not reached according to the paths followed in this story, but sometimes, seeing the wrong way to go provides insight into the right way. If you're looking for a book that satisfies, this is it, my friend.<P>Also recommended: BARK OF THE DOGWOOD</span>
