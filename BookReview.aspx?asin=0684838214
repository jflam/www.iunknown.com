                <span id="Label1"><P> In the introduction to this, the seventh collection of the newspaper and magazine columns, book reviews, speeches, and occasional writings of George Will, he notes the bemusement with which some may react to his choice of title. W. H. Auden wrote his poem <I>The Horatians </I>from which the following lines are taken: <I> 				 We can only 	do what it seems to us we were made for, look at 			this world with a happy eye 			but from a sober perspective. </I> <P> The poem was written in 1968. It was a year notable in the United States for assassination, riot, war, and political violence unseen for the preceeding 100 years. If humanity could be instructed to view that world with a happy eye, can America today do any less, faced with the clearest and most coherent expression of national unity since the Second World War?<I> With a Happy Eye But </I>. . . is both a clear description of the attitude that informs these collected pieces (and the attitude of their creator) and an admonition to Americans.</span>

                    <span>A nice collection of the articles of George Will. If you are a fan of Mr. Will's writing, you will enjoy this book.  If you are not familiar with his writing, this book would be a great introduction to his writing.<p>This book contains a cross section of how Mr. Will views America, from it's people to events, from controversies to it's pastimes.</span>

                    <span>Here we are treated to yet another book by George Will the most pompous political pundit to come down the pike in years. Will, a house puppet of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, takes time  to lecture us less intelligent ones on just what we should be thinking. It's nice of George to take time to help us out.<p>When vanity and self importance become, in effect, it's own substance then intellectually you have mind candy. This book is just that--a tribute to the power of believing one's own nonsense.<p>If you have a hobby of any type, then persue it and stay as far away from the latest "pronouncement" of his majesty Lord Will.</span>

                    <span>As an ardent reactionary, I used to be optimistic about the future of the conservative-liberal political wars.  My optimism was based on a Darwinian analysis.<p>I considered liberals in their natural state:  squeaky, bearded, granola-eating, ever-accommodating she-males and hairy, snarling, oppressive, leathery, liberated females.  I reasoned happily that conservatives would win because liberals would be incapable of reproducing, due to the absence of sexual differentiation.  They would not even have the opportunity to abort their young.<p>But now look at what's happening to conservatives - the same frightening trend toward androgyny that is occurring in larger society.  Conservatives have their own male-endangering dominatrices in the guises of Laura Ingraham, Kathleen Parker, Wendy McElroy, Peggy Noonan, Jessica Gavora and Suzanne Fields (to name just a few).  And the conservative roster of ineffectual males includes Sean Hannity...and George Will.<p>Will's brand of conservatism matches perfectly with his preening appearance and mannerisms and with the neutered condition that makes him popular as the unthreatening "house conservative" on the Sunday talk shows.  Really, he would not be out of place in 18th century clothing and a powdered wig.<p>Will has been around for a number of years so this volume entitled "With a Happy Eye" is just the latest addition to his substantial collection of wig powder.<p>He shares the proper and natural conservative distaste for Bill Clinton - dismissing him not as the country's worst president but as the worst man ever to become president.  Will's epitaph of Clinton might well match history's, but it's based solely on his aristocratic contempt for Clinton's vulgarity.<p>The episodes in this country's Clinton chapter caused a number of conservatives to invoke a number of manly and conservative values (duty, honor, principle) as a means of explaining their opposition to Clinton and Gore, but Will will have none of this.  He describes the core conservative virtue as "prudence, which means facing facts and understanding practicalities".<p>Disregarding the Burkean notion of society existing as a means of elevating its members, Will castigates conservatives who would "dissolve the people and elect another".  In other words,  the principal function of conservatives is to conserve existing evils introduced by liberals.  Elbert Hubbard was anticipating George Will when he described a conservative as someone too cowardly to fight and too fat to run.<p>Will is a baseball fan and that's another saving grace.  But he disdains the machismo of football as an example of two major flaws in American society:  violence and committee meetings.  Well, la-de-da.<p>And Will's horror of radical social innovation is selective.  He insists that the so-called "emancipation of women" - probably the most radical and unconservatively disruptive of all<br>"reforms" - is one of the country's finest ongoing social achievements.<p>If a men's movement ever got off the ground - and, here and there, there sometimes appear signs of one burgeoning - would Will display equal enthusiasm for the emancipation of men?  Would he even acknowledge the existence of the Matriarchy?  Or would he yet again switch gears and suddenly remember once again that conservatives are supposed to OPPOSE radical social innovation?<p>Well, he capitulates utterly in his discussion of female athleticism (which he FAVORS), suggesting that the competitive spirit that it nurtures (which he thinks is a GOOD thing) is responsible for the rise in the numbers of female professionals (which he ALSO thinks is a GOOD thing).  Hence, the rampant discrimination against boys in the classroom and the unconservative war against boys taking place in larger society never enter into his consideration of why fewer of them, relative to girls, are achieving.<p>In the end, even Will's distaste for Clinton-like vulgarity is selective.  He beams admiringly on one youthful female field hockey player who waxes vulgar over her performance.<p>You might think that the aristocratic foppish conservative would summon a measure of reprobation against such unfeminine expletive, but Will blesses her for her competitive spirit and gently expresses the hope and expectation that womanhood will nurture this spirit while smoothing away her crudity.  If Will really thinks that females are ennobled and uplifted by competitiveness and emancipation and if he thinks that they are purged of vulgarity by the advent of womanhood, he obviously hasn't met any competitive and emancipated women.<p>George Will is one of several reasons why this reviewer, forever a reactionary at heart, has become disillusioned with that passes for conservatism today.  It's becoming more and more clear that if the emancipation of MEN from female hegemony is to be the country's foremost achievement of the 21st century, the conventional philosophies offered up by left and right will have to be discarded and that something else will have to take their places.</span>

                    <span>I have never been a big fan of George Will.  I had only known him as the lone conservative at the end of Newsweek Magazine.  Then I saw him on Leno or Letterman and figured that someone that articulate saying things I don't like to hear must be worth reading.<p>I was right.  "With A Happy Eye But . . ." is a glorious romp through some selected republcan rantings worth reading.  Although I still do not agree with a lot of what he says, I did find that I agreed with a lot of it as well.  My favorite sections of the book (and he has several by topic) were Justice and Injustice, The World, and People.  I found those to be the most enlightening and most enjoyable.  His section on campaign finance reform was also eye opening but the jury is still out on whether he totally convinces me or not.<p>Be sure to have a dictionary handy because every third essay he indroduces a new five dollar word  that he will most likely use 3 to four times in other essays that follw.  He uses words and phrases like crackerjack prizes - until the novelty has worn off. <p>All in all, a satisfying read, absorbing, and contentious.</span>
