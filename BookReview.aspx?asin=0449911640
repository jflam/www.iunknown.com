                    <span>Seventeen years ago I was a seriously depressed young mother facing a devastating divorce when I happened to come across this book in a  pharmacy.  When I first opened the book and began reading, I had the first glimmering of hope that I had had in a long time, and this book eventually changed my life, much for the better!  Although Dr. Peale's way of writing would seem somewhat old-fashioned to modern-minded people, his basic message is of hope, and if you follow his instructions, you CAN change your life!  Dr. Peale encourages people to "expect a miracle" and "act as if" a miracle can happen -- and it CAN!  This book is a classic, I'm so glad to see Amazon is selling it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough!   Why not try it yourself, and find out?  You can buy a used copy of the original here at Amazon for .01 cents!  You have nothing to lose -- and everything to gain.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Peale begins by explaining the concept of imaging as a form of "mental engineering" which is derived from the term imagination. He goes on to add that "a long-held visualization of an objective or goal can become determinative." He says this process has worked for him. He cautions that this method is not some form of magic, that it opens doors, but once those doors open, it is up to the person to follow through with discipline, work, and persistence.<p>As a Christian, Dr. Peale points out that the power of imaging is secondary to a more important thought, that being that "there is an all-powerful Being in the universe who loves me and who is only a prayer away." He talks about a relationship with Jesus Christ being more significant than goal-accomplishment or any other thought, achievement, or creation seen or invisible.<p>This book will help you improve your quality of life because it contains so many truths. Through reading it you will gain a perspective that will help you to overcome the challenges you face. I recommend it highly.</span>

                    <span>This book showed me how to simply turn my negative thoughts into positive thoughts.  I have read many books on the subject of positive thinking and books of healing.  Mr Peale focused on the Love of our God and His Son,  Jesus Christ.  I have referred to this book so often that it has literally  fallen apart at its seams.  I will get another copy as I really do believe  in what Mr. Peale is saying to be the complete truth.  This  book is a must  read for anyone suffering from anything in life, so that means everyone  should read this excellent book.  I am almost fifty years old and I have  encountered some great problems in  life and this book shows me how to face  them. Mr Peale refers to Biblical passages throughout the  book all of  which are authentic, for I have checked.  This book is certainly one of the  best pieces of self-help literature that one could be fortunate to find.   Read it, you'll be glad you did. Patty Harman</span>

                    <span>I've read many self-help books, as well as various books which include imaging for goal setting, etc.  This was written by someone who knows what he is talking about, has had many years of experience with imaging. His  belief in what he is writting comes accross very intensely.</span>

                    <span>This book takes positive thinking to a new level. A picture is worth a thousand words. So results are fast track. This man (Norman Vincent Peale) would have ruled the talk show circuit if that was his desire, but his pleasures had more depth than the tabloid mentality. Bravo on one of the greatest books ever written</span>
