                    <span>This book is unique in its comibination of story-telling and fact-giving.  I really enjoyed the eccentric characters behind the chocolate industry, such as the retired Forrest Mars, Sr., who lives in a penthouse above his smaller candy company, where he spies on employees through a one-way mirror.  Or his son, who studied under the guy who makes Toblerones in Switzerland.  
<br />
<br />The behind-the-scenes look at the companies are equally intriguing.  Any candy company that has its own intelligence division must be serious business.  Brenner can then shift into the science of why people crave chocolate, and how the cocoa butter melts first to start the flow of chocolate over a happy customer's tongue, or how the Hershey company uses sour milk products for its distinctive flavor.  An enlightening book for sure.</span>

                    <span>This book was actually pretty interesting to read. If you've ever been curious about what the history is behind all those popular candy bars you eat, how they're made and who owns the companies, I defenetly recomend this book. The greatest thing about this book is that its not just some documentary rattling off facts about the topic, it tells a story, it'll keep you reading on, and it's all about chocolate. </span>

                    <span>The Emperors of Chocolate made my mouth water as i was reading it. It was very detailed and descriptive. The competition between the two companies was very dramatic and it captured my attention.</span>

                    <span>the book the Emporers of chocolate was very interesting, I was never previously aware that there were two companies who dominated the candy scene-Mars and Hershey. 8/10 of the top rated candy bars in America, fall under either of these two companies. Because these two companies are in a league of their own in terms of competition, the battle is fierce yet not seen to the public. Each company is very protective of their image, and that is what makes his book so interesting. You are taken behind the scenes and actually shown why. I thought it was very interesting that in the last 100 years that the amount of sucessful candy companies has dwindled from in the thousands to a mere 150. Who knows what this may be in the next 10 years, but this book helps show what may come in the future.</span>

                    <span>I am a chocolate lover! So, naturally, this book caught my eye from a list in my Economic's class. I was drawn into the book from the very first pages and it got more and more interesting as I read. I learned how Hershey and Mars chocolate companies started and how they run today. This book gives the reader an insight in the chocolate war between America's favorite candy companies. I recommend all to read this book, but only under one condition, make sure there is chocolate within reach.</span>
