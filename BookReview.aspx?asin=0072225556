                    <span>This book is so fraught with errors, both technical and otherwise, that I will refrain from listing them all here.  (I think another reviewer has already started that list...)
<br />
<br />With so many books on the subject available, why roll the dice on this one?  Caveat emptor - especially for those new to photography, but interested in building a good foundation for taking great photographs, digital or otherwise.
<br />
<br />Rick Sammon's Complete Guide to Digital Photography would be a great place to start.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book I have read on digital cameras. Dave has the gift of being able to explain things in very down to earth language. This book goes way beyond just using the camera, it covers editing, special effects, and many other subjects in the photography field. I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK and highly recommend it to anybody wanting the skinny on digital photography.</span>

                    <span>This book is basically has two parts.  The first talks about your camera, and the second shows you how to modify your digital pictures on your computer.  In my opinion, too many chapters are dedicated to the second part, and not enough to the first.  <p>As the owner of a new and expensive digital camera, I knew I needed help in using it.  The manual showed me what the camera could do, but not what I should do.  This book doesn't help me enough.  I need to find another book.<p>The discussion on photography is too sparse.  I think part of the problem is that the book is old.  Lots of features on my camera are not even discussed, presumably because they were not common when the book came out.  In addition, some topics are only glossed over.  <p>The chapters on using your computer to modify the images was of no use to me, even though it's more than half the book.  If I had known that, I wouldn't have purchased it.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for my husband for Christmas.  He just recently became entralled with his digital camera, but didn't know much about it.  He learned a lot: from what the different settings do to learning what is the best paper to print on.  He read it practically from cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>This book delivered exactly what I was looking for. I have had a digital camera for three years, and realized that my lack of knowledge in the basic principals of photography was holding me back. Not only did this book explain clearly and effectively the basics of photography, but it taught me to get the most out of my digital camera's capabilities. I was getting frustrated and now I am enjoying my camera again.<p>I also wanted to learn what to look for in a higher-end camera down the line, and this was covered as well. I understand how to weigh the different features against the kind of pictures I want to take.<p>Well written and useful. I recommend it.</span>
