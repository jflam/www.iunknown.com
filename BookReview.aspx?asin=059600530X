                <span id="Label1">The new 2.1 version of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) spec extends its support for web services and the Java Web Services APIs, expands its asynchronous messaging support, adds XML Schema for deployment descriptors, and introduces a new Timer service, which allows for scheduling EJB jobs. The essential--and award winning--book on EJBs, <i>Enterprise JavaBeans</i>, has been completely revised and updated in this new fourth edition, to provide the real-world, nitty-gritty detail developers need to master EJB 2.1.   Previous editions of this clear and engaging introduction to EJBs were voted the "Best Java Book" by the editors and readers of <i>Java Developer's Journal</i>, the "Best Java Book for Experts," by <i>JavaPro</i> editors, and one of the  Top Computer Books  by Amazon.com. The fourth edition lives up to--and surpasses--the excellent reputation earned by its predecessors.  This authoritative and thorough guide includes everything that made previous editions the single  must-have  book for EJB developers: the authors solid grasp on the complexities of EJBs coupled with his succinct, easy-to-follow style; hundreds of clear, practical examples; adept coverage the key concepts EJBs ; and diagrams to illustrate the concepts presented. It also includes everything you need to get up to speed quickly on the changes wrought by EJB version 2.1, an architecture overview, information on resource management and primary services, design strategies, and XML deployment descriptors.   In this edition, we're adding an EJB workbook for JBoss 4.0.  The workbook shows how to deploy all of the examples on the JBoss 4.0 application server.  It addresses an important problem with EJB: deploying the software on a server can be extremely difficult.  JBoss is an open source project that has become the most widely used J2EE application server.  Good technical authors may lay the facts before you, but great ones offer the distilled essence of their own experience and insight. Richard Monson-Haefel has provided just what Java developers need to know to harness the complexity of EJBs. What makes Monson-Haefel a master of technical authoring can be seen in his well-thought-out and logical progression of ideas, and in his examples practical, precise, usable examples, large enough to test key concepts but still small enough to be comprehensible taken apart and explained in the detail you need to deploy those principles in other situations.   If you work with EJBs--or want to--this book will earn a favored spot on your bookshelf.  </span>

<br />
<br />Instructional value of the book:
<br />4=I would recommend this book to someone interested in its topic.

<br />Reference value of this book:	
<br />4=This book has earned a valued place on my reference shelf.  	
<br />
<br />This book provides a good insight into enterprise java beans. although, this book is NOT intended to 
<br />
<br />be for beginners of Java, fundamental concepts of each aspect of EJB are explained.  the book assumes 
<br />
<br />a prior knowledge of java and assumes experience developing business applications.  after an initial 
<br />
<br />explanation of the conxepts, the book dives deep into the nuts and bolts of EJB.
<br />
<br />
<br />the author has taken the time to explain the concepts with sample code, schematic code, and screen 
<br />
<br />prints to explain the contents of the chapter.  the concepts of states and session in the context of 
<br />
<br />an EJB are well explained in this book. the book further explains the container-managed persistence 
<br />
<br />(CMP) and the relationships among those objects.  a sample reservation system is used to explain how 
<br />
<br />to use beans for an RDBMS encountered in the business world.
<br />
<br />the book also contains a workbook for JBoss and appropriate exercises for the contents of different 
<br />
<br />chapters applicable to JBOSS.
<br />
<br />this is a well written book and it has found a place in my reference shelf.

                    <span>I like my mix to be a combo of theory and technical step by step instruction. The first seventy pages are theory overkill, but you really get lost by page 99 where he lists four class files you are supposed to have written but he's only given you the CabinBean.class and two others that arent on the list. Very confusing. I am now looking at Applied Enterprise JavaBeans Technology by Kevin Boone.</span>

                    <span>The workbook is great and what can I say, JBoss is great. I've never implemented Entity Beans in any project so after performing the exercises on how to integrate them into JBoss, I see what a piece of crap this is, but this is not the authors fault.  O/R has them by you know what and specifications need to change to include them.  Wait, its coming in EJB 3.0. Can't Wait to see it. 
<br />  
<br />I dont understand one thing, and thats my ding for this book, and that it took the author 4 chapters to explain Entity Beans, to be re-implemented (Make your life and our lives easier - look at Hibernate) out in next release of EJB 3.0 specifications. And do a rush job on explaining J2EE Services ( Sessions as Endpoints ).   To me, it should have been reversed.
<br />
<br />Also, as indicated by the author, what a piece of crap the Timer Service is. Its like as if we needed another reason to crash the server.
<br />Chapt. 16 Transactions was very interesting and I was intrigued by it.  I would have dinged this book to 3 star rating, but his coverage on JMS ( Hurray to the Unified API ) and Transactions earned him the 4 star rating. 
<br /> 
<br />Also, it would have been nice to see versions of this book along with workbooks for other servers such as Weblogic or Websphere.  That way, one can choose which version to pick up.  As you know, just because you know how to do it in one server, means nothing to a stupid hiring firm, if you have not used the same in their server.
