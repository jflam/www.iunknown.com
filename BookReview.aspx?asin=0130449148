                    <span>I found this book to be an excellent introduction to J2ME wireless development.  The author's clear and consise writing style gets the reader up to speed almost immediately with a minimal degree of effort.  The fine examples and graphical illustrations couples nicely with the text.  I especially found the chapter on Internationalization particularly useful.  This is a good book for the beginning wireless developer.</span>

                    <span>Finally I learn this hard lesson: One who knows something DOES NOT necessarily know how to teach it.<p>I was attracted by the impressive background of the author, and it's part of SUN's Java series. But I am stunned by the poor quality of the book as a teach-yourself material. Come on, Mr. Piroumian, of course you know this is a book for Java learners, not a RFC, or API specification. But it reads like the latter.<p>I got my Java Programmer Certificate two years ago and consider myself an experienced Java programmer. But, I couldn't follow the book. It's that a hard and boring read. Those examples are dry, non-intuitive and useless in real world. After finishing the book, I still don't know how to do some quite simple tasks.<p>Very disappointed.</span>

                    <span>A good introduction to j2me, but the links to download the code samples don't work, they go to an under construction apge, and no one will reply to emails to say when they will be available.</span>

                    <span>I didn't find this book very helpful. What it refers to as "advanced topics" such as persistent storage and networking are basic concepts that aren't explained very clearly. Seems put together too quickly with only average coverage of j2me.</span>
