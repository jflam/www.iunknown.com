                <span id="Label1">Java developers typically go through four "stages" in mastering Java.  In the first stage, they learn the language itself. In the second stage, they study the APIs. In the third stage, they become proficient in the environment. It is in the fourth stage --"the expert stage"-- where things really get interesting, and <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery.   Crammed with tips and tricks, <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE.   Until <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i>, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error. But Java has grown to include a huge number of APIs, classes, and methods. Now it is simply too large for even the most intrepid developer to know it all.  The need for a written compendium of J2EE Best Practices has never been greater.   <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> focuses on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs. The J2EE APIs include such alphabet soup acronyms as EJB, JDBC, RMI, XML, and JMX.  </span>

                    <span>An appetizer that leaves you hungry for more.<P>Patterns and best practices have been around for a long time. They solve problem domains not directly addressed by the language itself ie., repeatable solutions to family of application development issues -- be it architecture, deployment or testing. For a complex platform like J2EE, use of best practices can make or break a project.<P>Just what the doctor ordered - Java Enterprise Best Practices is a collection nuggets of wisdoms. It is a compendium of idioms classified based on various enterprise Java areas written the most acclaimed authors in the field (Jason Hunter, Bret McLaughlin, Hans Bergsten et al). Ranging from most widely used EJBs to the latest additions such as JMX and JSTL, each chapter presents the reader with most widely accepted norms of using technologies such as - EJB, Servlets, JDBC, XML, RMI, JMX, Internationalization, JSP, JavaMail. Chapters on XML and RMI are the best of the lot.<P>I was surprised to note the omission of JMS, given that its popularity when compared with other things such as JMX or JSTL. The last chapter on performance tuning lacks depth and reads more like hastily scribbled notes. <P>Can best practices be argued? Absolutely! The first chapter of the book says just that. It is important to bear that in mind while you read through the chapters.<P>While a seasoned J2EE developer idioms may find a few things trivial, it is quite a good reference to keep handy if you are developing real-life applications. <P>Ajith Kallambella <BR>[...]</span>

                    <span>Jason Hunter has done it again. His servlet chapter is simply awesome. He offers some really juicy bytes of information. Give the man more chapters. The other chapters are good too. I would give the book five stars but the Performance chapter is worthless. That came as a surprise because I enjoyed Jack Shirazi performance book.</span>

                    <span>This book assumes you have prior knowledge of jsp/java. It's an excellent book especially for someone who needs to have some questions answered while developing an app, i.e how to perform connection pooling using JDBC 3.0. The information is short but precise ; at this level of development, this is what I need. Again, if you're looking for a detailed java book, get a different book. But if you're developing your first app and need a book that 'look over your shoulder', this is definitely the book.</span>

Especially if you have to discuss your technical decisions with your managers and the other team members this book will give you a sound basis for your arguments.<P>The book consists of many small tips and advices but don't expect any kind of reference implementation.<P>For me the most useful chapters were JDBC Best Practices (i.e. how to use Optimistic Concurrency and implement a Sequencer object together with a very illustrative activity diagram) and Enterprise Internationalization. You pick the gems out of the text and use them immediately.</span>
