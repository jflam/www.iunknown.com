                    <span>With combat scenes that make past works like Platoon, Hamburger Hill and more recent ones such as The Thin Red Line and We Were Soldiers look absolutely plain in comparison, Black Hawk Down achieves a new standard in war filmmaking, something I thought would be impossible after Saving Private Ryan.<P>Ironically enough, Black Hawk Down happens to be produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the man responsible for ... Con Air, but for him, this is probably just a fluke considering the release of Bad Company. For director Ridley Scott, however, the man is on a streak. With the enjoyable, epic story telling and exciting fight sequences in Gladiator, the stylish and suspenseful Hannibal, and now the brilliant battle scenes and military logistics of Black Hawk Down, he's added another successful film to his list, and like Spielberg, he could possibly become one of the few directors with complete creative control over his projects. There's no denying the man is an action genius, weaving together over a dozen skirmishes into one coherent, extremely long and violent battle sequence that will make heads spin and hearts pound. <P>This was the best film of 2001, with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings as its only true competitor.</span>

                    <span>Black Hawk Down is the film adaptation of Mark Bowden's mesmerizing chronicle by the same name. It recounts a 1993 incident involving U.S. Special Forces in Somalia, a routine half-hour mission that turned into the longest sustained firefight involving U.S. forces since the Vietnam War. A mixed group of helicopter-borne Rangers, Delta Force, and a few SEALs, supported by air cover and a convoy of ground vehicles, converged on a busy marketplace in downtown Mogadishu in a lightning raid to capture two top lieutenants of renegade warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. The raiders were blindsided when literally thousands of Somali fighters emerged from the surrounding neighborhoods with machine guns, rockets, and other sophisticated weapons. Two blackhawk helicopters were quickly downed by rocket-propelled grenades, the ground convoy got battered and lost its way repeatedly trying to rescue the downed crews, and the entire force on foot found itself under seige until it was finally rescued the following morning. The casualties included 73 U.S. fighters wounded and 19 killed, as well as 500-1000 Somalis dead. <P>Black Hawk Down has by and large received excellent reviews, and it deserves them. For one thing, the film balances a lot of difficult things well. It memorializes the heroism of the American fighters without glamorizing their struggle; it captures the savagery and squalor of the fight in paradoxically beautiful cinematography; and it conveys the confusion and complexity of the battle while making it (mostly) apprehensible. A note about that last point: it's still a good idea to read the book before seeing the movie if you have the luxury of doing so. Before it was over, the battle sprawled over much of central Mogadishu - a large city - and encompassed several different groups of men in different sites. Director Ridley Scott does an admirable job of making sense of it all, but it will still be clearer if you read about it in stupendous (but fascinating) detail in Bowden's account. <P>Having said the foregoing, let me warn you that this is not a movie for everyone - far from it. Black Hawk Down is an exceptionally violent film. Not grauitously so: the violence is entirely in keeping with the truth of the event, and supports the themes of the film. But it's not easy to watch, all the same. One scene involving battlefield surgery, especially, is probably a good opportunity for the squeamish to hit the concession stand for a while. <P>With material like this, the ideal of character development and strong individual performances goes somewhat by the wayside. There are necessarily too many faces, and too many events going on, for the film to linger for any length of time on one individual. (If you want character development, check out A Beautiful Mind.) Still, the performances here are quite good given their limited parameters. Josh Hartnett comes fully into his own as the leader of a Ranger squad (a "chalk") who fights to keep his team focused on survival. Among the other performances, I liked William Fichtner as a Delta Force sergeant who takes initiative at a critical moment in the fight. You may know Fichtner from ensemble parts in other movies, such as The Perfect Storm, where he played the edgy outsider Sully. <P>As a film and as a historical document, Black Hawk Down definitely deserves your attention.</span>

                    <span>It just doesn't get any better than this. I've seen this film 4 times & it never ceases to astound me. The acting is exceptional, Ridley Scott is directing here at the peak of his powers & Pietro Scalia should have received an Oscar for the outstanding editing job. The film itself functions more like a rocket ride than just a war film. The word visceral comes to mind. Violent? Frightening? Absolutely! But to demonstrate the true impact of war, for the soldiers & for us, there is no alternative. I noticed a fellow customer said this film is better than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; am I the only one who noticed the huge hole in that film's storyline? Move over THREE KINGS, FULL METAL JACKET, THE THIN RED LINE...BLACK HAWK DOWN may just be the greatest war film ever made. Why? Because a war film isn't just bullets & the terrible death of comrades. Ridley Scott has shown us the true horror. I know it will haunt my dreams......</span>

                    <span>I recently bought the DVD for this movie and I have to say that I'm blown away by the movie about the operation to capture Adid in Mogadishu, Somalia in October '93. This movie is very accurate in showing the realities of combat and I think that this is a movie that will really convey to people what it's like to fight and die not only for their country, but for each other.<P>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about what it's like in the heat of combat and the courage and fortitude of our soliders.</span>

                    <span>Prior to "Black Hawk Down", "Apocalypse Down" was hands down my favorite non-World War II war movie. Time and distance works wonders, and Ridley Scott proves he can film modern combat, like sci-fi ("Alien") with the best of them. <P>This is a post Private Ryan film, which means that the street combat scenes are jumpy, erratic, and extremely violent. But like Spielberg, Scott does not lose sight of character development, particularly Harnett's character who becomes marooned with his "stick" of Rangers overnight in the centre of Mogadishu surrounded by thousands of screeming, RPG-toting Somalis who can use cell phones to mobilize and direct their forces. The movie builds like "Alien", to the point where it becomes incomprehensible that anyone is going to get out alive. The movie does not take sides when commanders sacrifice four or five soldiers to save one - it just happens. <P>Some reviewers have referred to the book as a "novel" - it is not. This battle really happened, but once we left Somalia (or were pushed out, depending on your point of view) it got quietly shunted aside as a bad sideshow until Mark Bowden wrote his book of the same title, which is a MUST read for people who loved the movie (it goes into greater detail of the Ranger culture and background politics). Lots of lessons abound for our current escapade into Mesopotamia. <P>Sizemore, who is also in "Private Ryan", is by leaps and bounds the best hard-nosed NCO anywhere. Ewan McGregor, who has had to suffer through Lucas' recent disasters, gets to demonstrate his versatility. Harnett is terrific. <P>No review should pass up the incredible sound, which demands a 5.1 system and heavy on the subwoofer. The soundtrack (with the exception of the vaguely Celtic ooh-ahhs at the end) is the best I recall of any war movie.</span>
