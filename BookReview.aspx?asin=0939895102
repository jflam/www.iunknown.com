                <span id="Label1">Starting from scratch, Africa's Top Wildlife Countries answers such questions as: What safari options are available? What countries offer the kind of experience I am seeking? When is the best time to go? Covering Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Swaziland, Mauritius, and the Seychelles Islands, this is a complete guide for anyone planning a trip to Africa. Its user-friendly format makes planning a safari easy by highlighting and comparing wildlife reserves, depicting and describing types of accommodations and other major attractions. Jam-packed with information essential for the successful safari, this edition has been completely revised, and includes over 50 maps detailing countries and major wildlife reserves (including a new two-page Eco-Map depicting the primary vegetation zones, country, and park locations), 32 pages of color photographs, more than 125 black and white photos, 11 charts, and numerous illustrations. "A must for all safari goers traveling in any part of Africa." -- R. Michael Wright, President, African Wildlife Foundation</span>

                    <span>"One morning I just woke up and realized I wanted to travel around the world. And I decided, if I don't go, I'll always regret it, and if I don't go now, I never will." ~Mark Nolting<p>After traveling all over the world, Mark Nolting decided to return to Africa and travel from Cairo to Cape Town. He has been researching travel on the African continent for over 25 years and has even climbed to Uhuru Peak on Mt. Kilimanjaro.<p>To get the most out of any trip overseas, a travel book is essential. It is even more important when traveling in Africa, since a safari can be rather expensive. Especially if you want to stay in private lodges with swimming pools. <p>Do you want a private safari or would you rather travel with a group? Are you looking for gourmet European cuisine, local dishes or just wholesome fare? Are you looking for a romantic trip while staying in luxury tented camps or do you want to stay at a five-star lodge like Singita near Kruger National Park in South Africa. <p>In this new edition there are over 50 maps, helpful charts and over 32 pages of color photographs. <p>You will discover: <p>Where and when to see the best wildlife. <br>Where to enjoy boat safaris, night drives, hot-air balloon safaris, horeseback safaris, walking safaris, photo safaris and even canoe safaris. <br>The rainfall and temperature for different regions throughout the year<br>What to wear - very important to get a pair of earth-colored boots and a high-quality pair of binoculars. <p>Each chapter has a map of the area and a "facts at a glance" section. You will find information on the size of the country, population, capitals and official languages. Detailed information of each country is followed by information on the accommodations which range from deluxe to tourist class. There are pictures so you know what to expect. If you are looking for fields of flowers, you might want to head to Namaqualand from August to September. If you are looking for a dreamy tour along one of the most beautiful drives in Africa, you might choose the "Garden Route." You can stay in huge resorts or find isolation in a game reserve. <p>Once you decide what you want and where you want to stay, you can look up further information and plan a safari with The African Adventure Company.<p>The author dispels myths about travel in Africa and says one of the safest places in the world has to be in the African bush. You can also go to Africa for the mountain climbing, fishing, star gazing, scuba diving, snorkeling, whale watching and even white-water rafting.<p>You will find information on Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, Malawi, Swaziland, Lesotho, Seychelles and Mauritius. <p>Additional features include information on the Latin/Scientific names of Mammals & Reptiles, Suggested Reading Lists, Places and People Index, Animal and Plant Index, List of Maps, List of Charts and a List of Animal Profiles. <p>Mark Nolting is also the author of "African Safari Journal." He gives you all the secrets for enjoying your trip all the more. If you are looking for luxury, you might not want to make the mistake of booking a "full participation mobile tented camp safari." If you are honeymooning, your trip could turn into the ultimate Out of Africa experience complete with eating outdoors. I was impressed with the pictures of "Dining on a deck at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge."<p>After living in South Africa for 12 years, I can tell you Africa is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Everyone seems to speak at least three or four languages and everyone seems to speak English and Afrikaans. The food is also incredible with added variety and exotic flavors like guava and granadilla. <p>Being a "cat lover" at heart, we used to visit the game parks just to see the lions. This book brought back many memories and even the "memory" scent of the ocean. The areas around the South Coast (Coastal Forest) and Cape Town (Heathland) were our favorite holiday escapes from the area around Johannesburg, which is a Grassland (veld). A part of my heart will always be watching sunsets from the deck of a house at Cyara in Hekpoort, South Africa near the Magaliesberg Mountains where the Jacaranda trees burst with lilac blossoms.  <p>If you are dreaming of an adventure in Africa, this book will be essential. Mark Nolting has written a beautiful book based on his own exploration of Africa. He has also helped travelers plan the safari of a lifetime. After reading "Africa's Top Wildlife Countries," I'm convinced traveling with "The Africa Adventure Company" is the way to go! I was worried about traveling in Africa again, but after reading this book, I was very encouraged and have started dreaming of returning to my childhood home. <p>~TheRebeccaReview.com <p>Also look for the "African Safari Journal" to take with you on safari. It contains valuable information including a phrase book, safari diary, map directory, wildlife checklist and trip organizer. You can record the key events of your safari.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Nolting correctly assumes that wildlife will be one reason to visit Africa.  So he has organized his book so that you can find how when and where you can see wildlife under conditions that match what you want to know and experience.  For example, inside the front cover you can cross-check a month and location to find out when it is best to see animals.  Inside the back cover, you can check the frequency of animal viewing by animal type, location and month.  On page 43, you can see what types of safari activities are available where (type of driving, walking, canoeing and boats.  On pages 58-59, you can see what the temperature and rainfall are like in those months.  Elsewhere, you can find out which sleeping and traveling arrangements are less expensive, and what you get for paying more.  So, if you know what wildlife you want to see, you can narrow down your interests into a few locations and times of the year very quickly.  Then, you can focus your reading on what the locales, accommodations, and experiences are like there.  Although Mr. Nolting offers safari planning services, you could use his book to work with someone else . . . or to arrange your own trip.  <p>Each wildlife locale is filled with information about the topography, weather, people, wildlife, and personal safety issues.  <br>I especially liked how Mr. Nolting included descriptions of his own wildlife viewing experiences in the places where he has visited.<p>There's also lots of good information about accommodations, and explanations about the pros and cons of various types.  You can have luxury there (for a luxury price), or you can rough it like you would on a camping trip in the U.S. for very little money (after the air fare is covered).  <p>I found the general health information helpful too.  Where is malaria a problem?  Where do you need a yellow fever vaccination?  <p>What if you don't want to go on safari?  No problem!  The book describes beach resorts, scuba diving choices and how to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.  <p>There's even a bit of history.  <p>I was especially interested to learn about places I had not heard about before that are not crowded with tourists.  <p>I have read guide books to many other wildlife destinations, and I found this one to be the best I have seen for completeness and ease of use.  It made me feel confident that I could put together a wonderful trip to Africa.  I'm going to start saving my pennies now.<p>After you read this book, I encourage you to also dip into the bibliography to read some of the more than 100 books that can help you develop more specialized knowledge about your areas of interest.<p>Enjoy your safari, even if it's just one you dream about!</span>

                    <span>If you are even thinking about embarking on an African safari, you must read this book!  Not only did Mark's book convince me to go, I also used his travel agency to book my trip!  This book gave me the best ideas of what countries and game parks would best suit my particular interests.  It also provided many examples of different types of safari experiences:  from "roughing it" to luxury.  I chose to do a little of both.  It was the BEST and most memorable event of my life.  Mark has a way of making even the most timid traveler feel comfortable with such an adventurous trip before they even step on the plane.  I even had two of my own photographs published in this edition of his book!  I couldn't recommend this any more highly!</span>

                    <span>I found this to be a very helpful book for trip planning: when and where to go and getting an idea of what different kinds of safaris have to offer. A number of valuable charts regarding the best times to see certain  wildlife, climate, etc. The book is a good way to narrow your choices  before starting to collect brochures and get travel guides for individual  countries. The coverage will not replace good field guides or travel  guides---just get you ready for that stage. One caveat: I didn't care for  Nolting's snobbishness about the best way to travel (I managed to see more  than I might have on one of his "first class" safaris).</span>
