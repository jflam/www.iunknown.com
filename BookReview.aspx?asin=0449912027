                    <span>Dr. Peale talks about his internal struggle before he adopted the truths of "tough minded optimism." It was through observation that he discovered philosophy and generalizations didn't work in the real world of problems. The authentic faith as taught by Jesus Christ works! It doesn't ignore problems, it looks beyond them to solutions.<p>Odd that the same two philosophies that were around in the 1940s-1960s when Dr. Peale came to his conclusion are still in the arena today. Those of us who continue to benefit from Dr. Peale's excellent insight are grateful he made the right (and I mean that literally) choice. What he teaches works!</span>

                    <span>This book gives the account of Dr. Peale's conversion experience to a vital relationship with Jesus Christ.  His wife led him to the Lord, even though he was already a Methodist pastor.  Many people claim that he was New Age and an evil perpetrator of false religion.  The truth is that he was a master at applying Christianity to real life situations, when others were only interested in doctrinal correctness.<p>This is a great book and the title says it all: you have to be and remain tough-minded to shield yourself from all the negativity around you.  Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any virtue or praise, thing on these things. You are not going to help anybody if you have a sad, bad, negative attitude.  The world needs radically consistent happy and positive optimistic people or we'll go down the tubes.<p>Have a happy day!</span>

                    <span>If life has beaten you down, please order this book.  It's like sitting down with a wise and kindly friend -- the kind of person who has a way of making us see ourselves and our situation (no matter what it may be) in a fresh and hopeful light.  Norman Vincent Peale genuinely cared about his fellow human beings -- and tried to help them with simple, down-to-earth wisdom that has changed countless lives for the better.  No matter where you are in life, or what has happened to you, this book can help</span>
