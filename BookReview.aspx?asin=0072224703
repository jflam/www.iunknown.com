                    <span>I just got this book after reading "learn dreamweaver mx in 24 hrs"  and to compare the two books is like comparing apples and oranges. This book was nothing in comparison. I couldn't even finish reading it. Save your money, this book doesn't live up to the reader reviews or even its own editorial reviews. The book doesn't deserve the high rating it has gotten. That rating was one of the main reasons I chose the book and I found it very misleading.</span>

                    <span>So many computer books seem to be written without any concern for reader. Easily understood detail seems to be lacking. Gaining the knowledge sought typically requires re-reading a chapter or topic many times, then experimenting with pieces of information to garner how the item really works.<p>Not this one. <p>Mr. Meadhra  has provided a clear, concise presentation of the Dreamweaver MX product without the 'tech manual ' approach . Written in non-geek, understandable English, it easily accomplishes the goals of providing a MX quick start for the novice and intermediate user, and additionally, a product features and implementation tool for the advanced user.<p>From chapter one, then through the entire book, the material is covered in a logical, easy-to-understand manner. The sequence of material presentation follows the same steps the web page developer must use to get a project up and running. Chapters are laced with thoughtful illustrations providing a visual re-enforcement of subject being discussed.<p>Chapter organization is one of the items clearly planned. Each chapter begins with a one or two paragraph overview of the topic. This is followed by a couple of paragraphs explaining of the concepts behind the topic. (This point seems to always be missed in other writings). Then the topic is covered in detail.<p>Sidebars are used to provide HowTO, Tips, and Cautions. An absolutely great idea that helps avoid the dreaded 'I did what the book said but it doesn't work' syndrome. These items are highlighted throughout the book and are clearly presented.<p>One can tell Mr. Meadhra is a web site developer, he has all the bases covered.</span>
