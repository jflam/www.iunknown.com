                    </div>
                    <span>Author Bernard Malamud (1914-1986) wrote this semi-mystical novel in the early 1950's, when baseball was on top, TV was just starting, and players earned very modest paychecks.  It's the story of Roy Hobbs, an incredibly talented player from somewhere out west who through tragic circumstance doesn't reach the majors until he's in his mid-thirties.  Hobbs is a decent sort, but he finds himself overwhelmed by fame, manipulative owners, merciless sportswriters, and conniving women.  His career with the fictional New York Knights is meteoric but short, and filled with controversy and temptation.  Hobb's impact catapults his team into the pennant race, and the story improves as it unfolds.  
<br />
<br />The book has a symbolic, semi-mythical style.  The story was based partly on a 1949 incident involving Eddie Waitkus of the Phillies.  This book is also tougher and less optimistic than the 1984 movie starring Robert Redford.

                    <span>Baseball is in one sense just a game. In another for many I knew growing up in America it was a kind of religion. Malamud understands both these dimensions and in this work he plays on the sense of baseball as a kind of metaphor for all that is important in life. The story of Roy Hobbs partakes of many of the myths of baseball , the small- town boy who makes it big, the underdog who comes from behind, the hero of extraorindary powers who single- handed like the Babe himself takes a team and makes it into a champion and a legend. This is not my all- time favorite baseball book (That distinction belongs to two books largely  unread today, Zane Grey's ' The Shortstop ' and Charles Einstein's ' The Only Game in Town' )but it is a very good book that shows a real understanding of both the game of baseball and the game of life. </span>

                    <span>Wow...was I wrong!  Having seen the movie years ago and (I know I am in the minority) not loving it, but at least feeling happy with the end, I assumed that the book was somewhat similar.  The book is so very sad, but if you read (and you should), you will see that it stays true to Malamud's viewpoint all along.  The ending fits.  There is much symbolism and good vs. evil and all that good stuff.  In the end, it is an American tragedy, I think.  A nicely written and very sad look at sport.  And one that is still relevant today.  </span>

                    <span>Struggling to pursue a professional baseball career, Rob Hobbs, a character in The Natural, overcomes many obstacles in his first year as the Rookie.  Roy moves to the crowded and sleepless city of New York as he adapts to the celebrity lifestyle of parties and meeting new people, most of them being girls.  It is successful in creating a realistic setting through the use of hectic moods and a party-like atmosphere.  As Roy takes on new responsibilities, his main struggle is trying to balance everything while still playing a spectacular game night after night, a stability that not everyone is able to achieve.
<br />	Roy enters the baseball world with a great deal of early criticism but besides all that, he is an immediate success.  After finally gaining support of the coaches, teammates, and local fans, he begins to grow older and more experienced yet still continuing to pile on the pressure to do well.  In fact, they demand perfection.  The media is after him wanting to know all about his history, as Roy does not want the public to know about his personal stories.  As a leader of the team, he brings them up from last place to being in the World Series.  Roy has a passion for the game that no one could ever change, as I respect that in an athlete.  Throughout his injuries and slumps, he would still put on his glove and go out and play, which is very practical as that is the life of professional athletes.  Memo, one of Roy's friends, make a comment to him that could be used as the 
<br />theme of the book, which is,  "Experience makes good people better.... Especially through their suffering."  
<br />	I believe The Natural is an entertaining book for audiences of different generations as it interweaves a love story with an intense sports tale.  As stated earlier, Roy Hobbs is a fighter who wants to keep his past a mystery.  Readers from all backgrounds can relate to the struggles of the everyday perfection others expect out of you, and as we can see, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

                    <span>The book, The Natural, is an excellent book because of the valuable lessons that the reader learns from reading the book. Bernard Malamud creates very realistic characters in a realistic plot to teach the reader that you need to step up to the plate in order to be successful in life. In the beginning of the story, Roy uses his inexperience to strike out the Whammer, who at the time was one of the greatest baseball players in the world. Unfortunately, Roy is shot by a woman, keeping him out of baseball for fifteen years. When he returns to baseball at the age of 34, he joins the struggling New York Knights and leads them to win the pennant. The conflict in the story that makes it a good read is that Roy is very susceptible to women and this causes him to go into a slump. At the end of the book, Roy is now faced with a phenomenal rookie, who symbolizes Roy when he was young. Roy is unable to step up to the plate, and the rookie pitcher ends up striking out Roy, showing that Roy had given up on baseball and on life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it because it is not just about baseball, but it is about valuable lessons in life that Roy learns in order to be successful in the real world.</span>
