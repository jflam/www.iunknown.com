                    <span>It covers many topics around Visual Studio.net. Its coverage of Debugging(Chap 3), Macros(Chap 8) are good.<p>One missing piece is Web Services with Visual Studio.net. I didn't find any related information in it. Also, serveral times, when I needed some information about Visual Studio.net, I couldn't find it in this book. Though I've been using VS.net for several months, I never needed most of the information in this book.</span>

                    <span>I have to admit that when I picked up a copy of this book, I was expecting a rather out of date re-hash of much of Microsoft's Visual Studio documentation.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though Visual Studio .NET 2003 only recently became commercially available, this book is written for the new IDE (rather than last year's model).  The book goes through the basics of projects, debugging, and even macros (in addition to a wide range of other topics).<p>This book follows the basic flow a programmer would follow when setting up and creating a project in Visual Studio, which makes it easy to follow along (especially if you are new to VS.NET).  After a discussion on setting up a project (including the differences between the various project types), the reader is presented with a discussion on debugging tips and techniques (including debugging configuration in the project's properties).  Since web projects are a little different from creating a Windows application, there is a whole chapter dedicated to configuration and debugging of a web application.  Other chapters include a discussion on how to perform database work through the IDE, and instructions on developing installation projects.  <p>My absolute favorite chapter, however, was on Automation, Macros, and Add-ins.  In this chapter, the reader learns the basics of creating macros that integrate directly into VS.NET.  If you are familiar with recording macros in the Microsoft Office applications, you will be pleased to learn that the syntax and functionality is similar (although instead of writing macros in VBA, they are written in VB.NET).  There is then further discussion on automating the IDE to perform scheduled tasks (like automated builds).</span>

                    <span>The book deals with mostly an overview of VS .Net features.  They give a general guideline on how to write VS solutions / projects - components - scripts, amd how to debug programs.  I bought the book mostly since it's the only one I found that discusses VSIP.  I did not find a lot of information on VSIP 7 pages long chapter which barly discusses an overview.  The book authors tried their samples on both VS 2002 and VS 2003.  I would not recommend this book to people who are brand new VS users or experts on VS.  I would recommend it for some users how are looking for some extra shortcuts / functionality here and there.  I'm giving this book 3 stars since I would have expected a bit more in debth analysis and more samples.</span>
