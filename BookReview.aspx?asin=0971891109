Clark writes this book from her passion for teaching the everyday champions that we all are how to use food to help achieve our marathon goals.

                    <span>Nancy Clark has clearly written a book that will direct runners on the best way to set up your nutrition plan. I first read her article in Runners World Magazine in December 2002. It lead me to this book, and as a result I lost 13 pounds while training for a marathon. It is a common sense approach to eating for life. No protein overload! This is a must read for all runners!</span>

D.H., 44 year old Navy lieutenant, HI<P>"What impresses me the most about Nancy Clark's Food Guide for Marathoners are the author's credentials. Nancy is able to share her personal experiences and professional knowledge in a working reference for the everyday athlete. ... This book belongs right next to your training schedule and should be referred to just as frequently to achieve optimum marathon success." B.T., nurse and runner<P>"Nutrition has always been an area where I've had very little knowledge but always wanted to learn more. I need someone to spell out exactly what I should be eating. Nancy Clark's Food Guide for Marathoners does this for me!" B.W., Chicago<P>"Our Joints in Motion Marathon Training Team is offering your book as a fundraising incentive. Looks like a popular idea, because the members are working hard to meet fundraising goals!" M.G., Joints in Motion Coordinator, PA<P>"Nancy, thank you so much for writing this book for marathoners.
