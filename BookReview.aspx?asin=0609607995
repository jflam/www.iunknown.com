                <span id="Label1">Was IBM, "The Solutions Company," partly responsible for the Final Solution? That's the question raised by Edwin Black's <I>IBM and the Holocaust</I>, the most controversial book on the subject since Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's <I>Hitler's Willing Executioners</I>. Black, a son of Holocaust survivors, is less tendentiously simplistic than Goldhagen, but his thesis is no less provocative: he argues that IBM founder Thomas Watson deserved the Merit Cross (Germany's second-highest honor) awarded him by Hitler, his second-biggest customer on earth. "IBM, primarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler's program of Jewish destruction a technologic mission the company pursued with chilling success," writes Black. "IBM had almost single-handedly brought modern warfare into the information age [and] virtually put the 'blitz' in the <I>krieg</I>." <p>  The crucial technology was a precursor to the computer, the IBM Hollerith punch card machine, which Black glimpsed on exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, inspiring his five-year, top-secret book project. The Hollerith was used to tabulate and alphabetize census data. Black says the Hollerith and its punch card data ("hole 3 signified homosexual ... hole 8 designated a Jew") was indispensable in rounding up prisoners, keeping the trains fully packed and on time, tallying the deaths, and organizing the entire war effort. Hitler's regime was fantastically, suicidally chaotic; could IBM have been the cause of its sole competence: mass-murdering civilians? Better scholars than I must sift through and appraise Black's mountainous evidence, but clearly the assessment is overdue.<p>  The moral argument turns on one question: How much did IBM New York know about IBM Germany's work, and when? Black documents a scary game of brinksmanship orchestrated by IBM chief Watson, who walked a fine line between enraging U.S. officials and infuriating Hitler. He shamefully delayed returning the Nazi medal until forced to--and when he did return it, the Nazis almost kicked IBM and its crucial machines out of Germany. (Hitler was prone to self-defeating decisions, as demonstrated in <I>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</I>.) <p>  Black has created a must-read work of history. But it's also a fascinating business book examining the colliding influences of personality, morality, and cold strategic calculation. <I>--Tim Appelo</I> </span>

                    <span>When I saw this book's title, I was immediately intrigued to learn what IBM's role in the Holocaust was, and eagerly began reading.  Once I started the book I learned most of the facts about IBM's involvement in the Holocaust in the first chapter of the book with the author's introductory summary.  I continued to labor through further chapters of the book to learn additional details, and have come across a couple additional nuggets.  However, the majority of the information was summarized at the beginning.  
<br />
<br />This book is overall very well researched and documented, and this adds to its credibility.  In addition, the subject matter is fascinating and very important to know for a full understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust.  However, the book is not well organized, goes into excruciating detail about stock mergers and inter-corporate disputes, and although it attempts to be chronological, weaves in and out of chronology just enough to confuse readers who do not constantly note at what point in time the author is referring to.
<br />
<br />This book appears to have needed three things: (1) a more flowing narrative of the events discussed; (2) a good editor to take out superfluous detail or put it into the endnotes; and (3) a viewpoint that is less black and white, good versus evil.  
<br />
<br />In reference to the third thing this book needs, it appears from Mr. Black's prose that IBM's President, Mr. Watson, is the devil incarnate, and right up there with Hitler.  Mr. Black makes a credible argument that Mr. Watson was overly concerned with profit margins, and was a pure capitalist.  However, without more information about his personal life (all we learn about is his business life), I am not yet convinced he was pure evil.  Greed does not necessarily mean he is in the same category as a mass murderer.  In addition, while Mr. Black makes a great case that people at IBM should have known what the machines were being used for, he does not make a great case that they did know, for sure.  Granted, Mr. Black notes that IBM did not cooperate with his research, and it is possible that IBMers did not write down what they knew, specifically because what they knew was so heinous.  However, Mr. Black is prone to take an example and make a federal case out of it, without sufficient evidence to back him up.  For example, Mr. Black takes the fact that the word "jew" was not capitalized in a piece of correspondence to explain, without a footnote, that because "jew" was not capitalized, this meant that the author was anti-semitic and could not even bear to capitalize the word "Jew" because that would give too much dignity to the Jews, who were not, in fact, Germans.  I have trouble believing Mr. Black could gather all that from one piece of punctuation, especially without back up documentation.  These types of remarks take away some of the credibility of the book.  
<br />
<br />With that being said, I would suggest to anyone having an interest in the history of the Holocaust that they read this book, because I am unaware of any other source in which they can learn about IBM's involvement in the tragedy.  In addition, the book gives great insight into how the Nazis always had lists of Jews names, and could so efficiently execute the Final Solution.  This insight will help you understand other histories of the Holocaust more completely.  However, to learn this information you must wade through a good deal of excruiating detail and create the narrative in your own mind, because it is not laid out well by the author.  I hope in the future another historian with revisit the research of Mr. Black and try to compile a summary of the information provided in about 100 pages less than Mr. Black did.</span>

                    <span>Who would have anticipated that a speedy card-sorter, the Hollerith machine, would evolve into a tool of one of the most evil schemes of all time?  Yet, this patented machine, devised by a little-known man of German descent, made it possible to conduct a census in a short time period, and turned counting into a tool useful on a mass scale.  Black's book is a page-burner, containing information that will surprise the reader paragraph by paragraph.  In my generation, the "Do Not Spindle, Fold, or Mutilate" written on each IBM punchcard was the introduction to the computer and information age (and often the butt of jokes).  A scant 25 to 30 years earlier, similar punch cards became the currency on which the Holocaust was based.  A truly groundbreaking piece of research that, fortunately, has already appeared in German translation.  In the days where vast amounts of personal information are being reduced to a series of ones and zeros carried electronically and stored digitally, this saga may be the harbinger of horrors much worse than were conceived by the progenitors of the 1000-year Reich.  We should pay close attention to the uses of such personal information, lest humans lose complete control of their humanity.  Here we find a true fable (that's an oxymoron) with much more to teach than Aesop could have imagined.</span>

                    <span>To what end should profit be more important than morality? This is the main question readers should ask after reading Edwin Black's thoughtful, thorough look at IBM's economic history with Nazi Germany before - and especially, during - World War II. Although Black is not the most lyrical of writers, he does make a very persuasive case for IBM's primary role in mechanizing Hitler's Holocaust agains the Jews, Gypsies and other racial, religious and sexual minorities in Nazi-occupied Europe. One important unanswered question from World War II has been the extent of IBM's involvement in Nazi genocide; judging from Black's evidence that involvement was substantial, to say the least. Indeed, it is Black's premise that IBM's counting machines made it possible for Germany to perfect the crime of genocide as a mere matter of industrial mechanization. Black shows how IBM's Hollerith counting machines were used to identify, round up, and then deport hundreds of thousands of Jews from Poland to Holland into the Nazi regime's nightmarish network of labor and death camps.<p>Black's book is also a fascinating look into corporate politics. One wonders how much IBM's New York office knew of its German affiliate's activities. Without gaining access to IBM's archives, Black shows that IBM was aware and choose not to know, concerning itself only with the profits earned by Dehomag, its German affiliate, throughout Nazi-occupied Europe.</span>

                    <span>I am astonished that Holocaust research has advanced so far and no one has yet detailed or even mentioned the involvement of IBM in organizing the Holocaust--from identification to extermination, 1933 to 1945. Not until IBM and the Holocaust. Author Edwin Black has produced a powerful, gripping, chilling and magnificently documented volume. The correspondance of IBM officials juxtaposed against NYT headlines offers a horrid insight into their mindsets as they were designing applications to further oppress the Jews and help Hitler conquer Europe. The author's website is filled with worldwide praise for this work, and yet it stands alone. I can find no other follow-up volumes to this excellent book. ... I cannot recommend enough this important achievement. </span>
