                    <span>This book was not as easy for a me to understand as other books I have read. He goes really into detail on showing how to make sure your cash flow and the property is one you want to buy, but he doesn't do much to show or tell you how to buy homes as I had hoped.</span>

                    <span>  I have read all of the real estate investing books by Steve Berges, in addition to many others by other authors.  I have found that Mr. Berges is by far the best author on real estate investment, period.  If you haven't read "The Complete Guide to Buying and Selling Apartment Buildings," then you are doing it wrong. 
<br />
<br />  Mr. Berges' basic approach is to teach you what to look for, and how to analyze property before you buy it.  With this approach you will know how much money you will make in the end, before you have even made the down payment.  Berges explains this approach very thoroughly and effectively, with an informal, anecdotal style that makes you feel like you are discussing real estate methods with your rich uncle. 
<br />
<br />  "The Complete Guide to Investing in Rental Properties" is Berges' newest book.  Having read all of his previous books, I found this one to be a little redundant.  The first half of the book is a review of infomation found in more detail in his other books, and even includes excerpts from his other work.  But that allows the book to stand on its own.  The rest of the book is all new, and pure gold.  Mr. Berges discusses his techniques for managing property and tenants, increasing property value and reducing expenses.  
<br />
<br />  If you were only allowed to read one book on real estate investing, "The Complete Guide to Investing in Rental Properties" would be it.  However, then you would be missing out on all of Steve Berges' other books.  On the other hand, were you to have read the others, in my opinion you would not only have all the information needed to begin a successful real estate venture, you would also have a significant advantage over all those investors out there who have not read his work.
<br />
<br />  Given that this has been such a raving review, I feel I should head off assumptions that I work for Steve Berges, or the publisher, or even know him.  I do not.  I have only read many books on real estate investing, and I have come to recognize Mr. Berges' books to be the champions of them all.  You just have to read one to know what I am talking about.
