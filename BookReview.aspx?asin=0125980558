                    <span>Tries to do too much and fails in delivering a rigorous understanding of the subject and this utter lack of mathematical rigor is the main flaw of the book.  For a better understanding of stochastic processes consult the books by Karlin, Hoel and so forth.  However, it does have some nice problems and some good examples to work through.  I think that the author's other book, "A first course in probability" is much better.</span>

                    <span>This book tries to teach probability through examples.  Most would be too difficult to work out as homework.  This would be ideal for someone who wanted to get an understanding of Stochastic Process without investing too much time into homework.  If, however, you wish to work out the homework, you will be frusterated to find out that there are not solutions to problems in the back of the book (except about 10% of the problems which are more or less worked out completely).  If you are like me, you will want a book that gives answers to double check your work as you go along rather than the occasional complete solution.  It is surprising that he did not put this in this book since "A First Course in Probability" included answers to the odd problems in the back.</span>

                    <span>If you like to learn concepts through pure math without clear examples of how to apply the applications, then this is the book for you.  Absolutely dreadful!</span>

                    <span>Most books have a natural tendancy to concentrate on the context of the material into theory but this book was very well written by the author.  Not only are the defintions, concepts, and formulas structured into a flow of easy comprehension, but the detailed examples and solutions are an asset for any person interested in beginning their understanding of the subject with a solid and concrete foundation.  The reason why there are so many negative reviews about this book is simply because those people thought it would be a walk in the park without little effort.  In conclusion, the probability of one not liking this book is almost zero if they are willing to put in a litte effort instead of depending on spoonfeeding.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for a senior undergraduate probability course, it has many examples which provides good understanding.  But some results I think it would be too difficult for a 3rd year course to have their students to absorb the material.  Again, it is pretty pricy too.</span>
