                    <span>That's why there are only two stars!  <p>First idea, the shape of a single cupboard. The second idea, a way to add counter space over a toilet.  That's it. I guess I could have gotten both from any other magazine on the shelf for a lot less than I paid for this silly picture book filled with pictures of _pieces_ of bathrooms.  A more appropriate title would have been:<p>Bathroom Parts Picture Book<br>A guide to bathrooms for those who can't read.<p>The most I'll get from this book is the enjoyment my children will receive from cutting out the pictures for their paper dolls.</span>

                    <span>Being in the home improvement business, I felt odd needing ideas when it came time to upgrade the bathrooms in my own home. Perhaps making a living building the bathroom of everyone elses dreams helped to fog the picture of what I wanted my own to be. Taunton Publishing puts out a trade magazine that I swear by. So when I decided to purchase a book on bathrooms I thought I couldnt go wrong with this one. How wrong I was. <br> This book is little more than a collection of photographs of high end and ultra high end bathrooms. Here in my neck of the woods a complete bath renovation ranges in cost from between ten and fifteen thousand dollars for an average bath. Very few of the rooms displayed in this book would make that budget.<br> Aside from the introduction there is almost no text to assist the "reader" in understanding requirements or even necessaties pryor to planning a bath remodel. Perhaps the fact that I am in this line of work colors my opinion of the book, but if photos qualify as ideas, Id recomend picking up a few magazines on bath remodeling and get a fuller picture.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very helpful, as we are currently in the midst of re-doing 3 bathrooms.  For our large bathroom, we will incorporate a number of ideas that we hadn't thought of previously.  This book is exactly what it claims to be - an "idea" book.  There are tons of pictures, all beautifully photographed.  I usually get this type of book out of the library, but I'm happy I invested in this one.  It's definitely worth the money, and a wonderful reference guide.</span>
