                    <span>In the fist chapter alone it tries to define several terms and fails miserably. Later the book redefines the terms it defined earlier in the book. For example it first defines a resource as "assets, such as people, equipment, physical facilities, or invintory that have limited availibilities . . . " (Pg 9).
<br />
<br />In the next section it simply states "Resources are any consumables used on the project." (Pg 9).
<br />
<br />Define a term once and use it consistantly. 
<br />
<br />A lot of the terms it defines are long winded, and could be shorter. It almsot seems like the author was simply attempting to fill pages. </span>

                    <span>I find this book very practical. Project Management is a field where there are many concepts with dependencies on one another. The authors have managed to explain these concepts in a flow that is smooth and easy to understand, and yet with not too many words, i.e. clear and concise words. It surely gives a good foundation to someone who is learning Project Management.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>An excellent book on management of IT projects. The author discusses three different kinds of project management: Traditional, Adaptive and Extreme. The book is worth the purchase price for just the discussion on the Traditional project management method. The material about "Adaptive" and "Extreme" variations are icing on the cake.<p>What I like about this book is that the author effectively acknowledges the shortcomings of traditional project management and does not harp on its dogma. The material on adaptive project management offers a way out for those projects where the method of implementation is so unknown that traditional full-court project management practices will only hurt and not help. Much of the information on adaptive and extreme project management is similar to the "extreme programming" methodology, but specifically targeted towards a project manager.<p>I think this book is an excellent purchase. It is well written and succinct (unlike the 1000 pages of bullet-points from a competing author). Other reasons to purchase the book are its reasonable price and the fact that you get a trial version of Microsoft Project 2002 with it. <p>I wish the author had gone into greater depth about earned value. I have found earned value difficult to do without good support from the project management tool (calculating BCWS for example is tedious to do by hand); every time I tried to do earned value for a real project using MP98 or MP2000 the tool has crashed on me. <p>In summary I believe that this is an excellent book, and should be read by every project manager.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>There is a complete PM education in this fairly compact book. The third edition touches upon non-traditional project management. In other words, project management in real life as opposed to what is in most every textbook.<p>To me the value of the third edition lies in Robert Wysocki's recognition of projects where either the goal is clear but the methods aren't, or where even the goal is unclear. These types of projects seem to predominate in IT. This book is worth purchasing for the insight that the authors bring into the non-traditional non-textbook real-life projects.<p>The prose is clearly written and reads very tightly. Contrast this to the random collection of thoughts in Kerzner's book. This book is written for the practitioner, though someone taking a college course in project management would also benefit.<p>Excellent book, at an excellent price. You can't go wrong.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because I was looking for material to prepare the PMP certification exam. The book is easy to read and the concepts and key terms are clean and well explained. However, from my point of view, is too shallow to be fully "effective". I've been managing software projects for the last 6 years and, after reading the book, I felt that it didn't cover all my expectations, for example, treatment of Critical Chain Project Management is little more than a quote of its existence.<p>Anyway, if you are looking for an introductory book on PM I think is a pretty good book, but remember, to gain more in depth knowledge on particular subject matters you'll have to look at the references.</span>
