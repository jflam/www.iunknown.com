                <span id="Label1">Detective Lindsay Boxer and Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt are enjoying a quiet afternoon in San Francisco when a townhouse across the street explodes in flames. A sinister note signed "August Spies" is found at the scene of the disaster, and the body of an infant who was asleep in the house at the time of the explosion cannot be found. Soon a wave of violent incidents, all with links to political terrorism and involving "August Spies," sweeps through the city. An upcoming economic summit of the world's most powerful nations will surely be a target. And it's up to the Women's Murder Club to get to the bottom of the violence before it's too late. Delivering the breakneck pace and never-saw-it-coming plot twists that have made James Patterson the most addictive writer at work today, 3rd DEGREE is another searing and unforgettable thriller from the nation's #1 bestselling suspense writer.</span>

                    <span>Detective Lindsay Boxer is out for her morning jog when an explosion tears through the streets leaving a townhouse in flames and three people dead including the owner, an Internet millionaire. As Lindsay looks for any survivors she learns there was an infant in the house who has since disappeared and a mysterious letter has been left behind by those responsible for the explosion.<P>Another businessman is found murdered along with another message, this time a warning of what will come over the next few days. As Lindsay investigates the new murder, as well as the disappearance of the infant, her friend and fellow member of the Women's Murder Club, Chronicle reporter Cindy Thomas begins receiving email messages from the killers. The messages contain brief descriptions of what will happen and minor clues to who the victims will be. <P>Lindsay, along with fellow members of the Women's Murder Club; Cindy, Claire Washburn of the medical examiner's office, and Assistant D.A. Jill Bernhardt, must work quickly to find out who is behind the murders and why they are intent on killing someone every three days, but the murder of one of their own will send the other women on dangerous mission to uncover the truth about a friend.<P>Yes, a main character in the novel does die...but you need to read the novel to find out who. '3Rd Degree' is a great entry in the Women's Murder Club series. As always, the pages turn fast as each new surprise comes flying at you. Genuine characters combined with powerful plot twists make this an unforgettable reading experience and further proof that James Patterson is truly THE master of writing a suspense novel. What can be said about a James Patterson novel that has not been said before...the writing top-notch, the twists surprising, the plots original, the suspense thick and the pace lighting fast. Put this on your MUST read list!<P>If you like conspiracy books here are a few. Having read the TOP books in the Government Cover-up Genre; "Unconventional Flying Objects" (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years) by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill; my FAVORITE is "Alien Rapture" by Brad Steiger and Edgar Fouche (Top Secret Black Programs Insider) - (Great fiction-soon to be a movie); "Alien Agenda" by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs; and "The Day After Roswell," by Colonel Corso - I'd say these books are fun and a MUST READ also!</span>

                    <span>3rd Degree by James Patterson.<P>In this, the third book featuring the Women's Murder Club the story follows tough homicide detective Lindsay Boxer, as she struggles through a burning fire, apparantly started by 'August Spies' in an apparant terrorist attack. Starting a terrorism investigation, bringing in Deputy Director Joe Molinari of Homeland Security. Through all this Boxer also struggles through her deep feelings for good friend Jill Barnhardt, whose perfect marriage isn't so perfect after all.<P>This book truly was a matter of struggles. First you have to struggle with the slow pace of the book. It became almost painful to watch as Boxer was unable to put together simple concepts and come to clear conclusions.<P>The story, which actually became quite intereseting over the last 10 chapters, was stretched too thin. In fact, while reading this book, it felt as if Patterson just couldn't be bothered to write a compelling story. Rather, he wrote a novella length story and just fleshed it out, taking far longer to get interesting.<P>If you're stuck in an airport, with few other choices, you will want to pick this up. Otherwise, you should stick to more compelling stories.</span>

                    <span>If you liked the previous stories in this series (1st To Die and 2nd Chance), you should love this one. It has the same women, Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer, of the San Francisco police, Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt, Medical Examiner Claire Washburn, and San Francisco Chronicle reporter Cindy Thomas. It has Patterson's brief chapters, terse dialog, and headlong rush through a tale of danger and suspense, It grabs you in the first chapter. As Lindsay Boxer jogs past a townhome, it explodes into a mass of fire, killing a corporate CEO. Three days later, another executive is poisoned, and the police find that they face a gang of terrorists that promise to kill every three days. The terrorists are smart, clever, and ready to strike back at the police. From this recipe, we get an intense story that races to a climax.</span>

                    <span>This book was great. I have the unabridged CD. This really thrill me. The sound effects were awesome. Way to go James.<P>I was however so disappointed when we lost Jill. So now where do we go from here. We really got the 3rd Degree in this book.<BR>I love all the ladies in the Women's murder club. So now lets get to the 4th is a charm. I can't wait. I read 1st to Die and<BR>2nd Chance. So I had all the information on all the ladies.<P>Keep up the good work. I have most of your books in hardcover. And some of the books I also have on CD and tapes. I also like that in some of the audio books you have two readers. It adds much suspense to the story. I collect all your books. <P>Thanks for keeping me in suspense and this was a real page turner.<P>Thanks</span>
