<h3 class="title">Photo Triage</h3>

<p>Stop what you're doing and check out <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/1606-2-5234982.html">this video</a>. This is by far the most incredible photo cataloging software that I've ever seen. It looks like it's running on top of Avalon as well (either that or the <span class="caps">MSR</span> folks wrote to Direct3D). </p>

<p>The interesting thing is how it lets you visualize photos based on timelines, and allows you to assign metadata based on timeline groupings. Very compelling use of accelerated graphics.</p>

<p>In Joel Pobar's recent blog on new features in Whidbey's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joelpob/archive/2004/06/22/163206.aspx">System.Reflection</a>, he mentions that <code>MethodBody.GetILAsByteArray</code> is a <em>preliminary <span class="caps">API</span></em> for the power users of reflection. This is because the real <span class="caps">API</span> is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/phoenix/">still under development</a>.

<h3 class="title">Database unit testing</h3>

<p>I've implemented the manual unit testing solution that Roy Osherove describes in his latest article: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/dbunittesting.aspx">Simplified Database Unit testing using Enterprise Services</a>. For some of my tests, I would execute a <span class="caps">SQL</span> script to drop and recreate the database each time. In others, I would remove the records that I created in the <code>TearDown</code> method of my <code>TestFixture</code>.</p>

<p>I really like the idea that Roy proposes to leverage automatic transactions in Enterprise Services to avoid manually removing the changes made to the DB after each test. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaguiar">Andres Aguiar</a> correctly points out some dangers posed by side-effects caused triggers and identity columns in Roy's comments. </p>

<h3 class="title">Baby Boot Camp</h3>

<p>Inspired by being at <a href="http://sill-www.army.mil/">Fort Sill</a> for a week, we decided to begin "baby boot camp" when I returned. Matthew's sleep habits have been, um, not so good shall we say - and recently they took a turn for the worse. Carolyn's been worn down to the bone - especially having to deal with my being sick and then away for a week. </p>

<p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="120" height="240" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=iunknowncom-20&amp;dev-t=D68HUNXKLHS4J&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0449004023&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank"><MAP NAME="boxmap-p8"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="14, 200, 103, 207" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/iunknowncom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></iframe>    <br />
         <br />
p. On Saturday night we decided to let him cry it out. After reading from cover to cover Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child we watched for drowsiness signs, settled him down by a bit of rocking, put him into his crib, kissed him goodnight and walked out of the room. As expected, there was some protesting. But it only lasted 9 minutes before there was ... silence. After checking in on him and making sure he was sleeping soundly we declared victory - prematurely. </p>

<p>An hour later he awoke and protested for an hour and twenty minutes! That was really difficult to take, but eventually he settled down for another 3 hours. He awoke for two feeds - at 12am and 4am, protested 5 minutes and 30 minutes respectively before awaking at 7:00am - his normal wake-up time. He was his normal happy self in the morning, much to our relief! </p>

<p>Last night, he was even better. He slept from 8pm until almost 3am before he woke up to feed just once. After, he protested for what seemed like an eternity - another 40 minutes, but he clearly got more sleep on the second night than the first night.</p>

<p>Matthew's definitely learning how to fall asleep by himself, and he's also learning how to fall asleep after awaking in the middle of the night - we'll hear brief yelps occasionally, but they're becoming less frequent. With any luck, we should have a more rested family soon!</p>

<h3 class="title">Teaching can wear you down</h3>

<p>Two weeks of back-to-back teaching have taken their toll on me. I gave the first delivery of <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com">ObjectSharp's</a> new Best Practices training series last week to a full house in Toronto. I was battling some kind of weird cold bug all week, and was losing my voice towards the end of the week. A big thanks goes out to one of our other ObjectSharp partners, <a href="http://www.objectsharp.com/blogs/bruce">Bruce</a> for showing up on Tuesday in case I couldn't make it in - the mild fever I had the night before had me worried that things would get worse before they got better. Outside of my physical ailments, the class went rather well, and we have a great collection of customer kudos from our inaugural class.</p>

<p>Last week, I taught one of my final classes for <a href="http://www.wintellect.com">Wintellect</a> at Fort Sill, <span class="caps">OK. </span>It was my first time on an Army base, and I rather enjoyed the experience. I find it rather amusing that the Canadian got searched far less often (zero times) by the base MPs than the civilian contractor (twice) who arranged for the course in the first place! I found that some of the buildings at Fort Sill reminded me of high school, except for the fact that everyone was walking around in green Army / tan Marine fatigues. </p>

<h3 class="title">It's here!</h3>

<p>My Inspiron 8600 showed up today. After tearing open the package, I discovered to my <em>horror</em> that there isn't a trackpoint device (aka eraser head). I guess I had assumed that Dells would have a dual pointing device, but I was wrong. Fortunately, I've adapted rather well to the touch pad (much to my surprise) and I'm not hating it quite as much as I thought I would. The only thing that I don't like is having to shift my hand to reach the touchpad. With the eraser, your index finger is positioned exactly where it needs to be without requiring reposition your hand.</p>

<p>I immediately repaved using Windows <span class="caps">XP </span>Pro, and got my baseline image (Office + Virtual PC) installed. I'm copying the April <span class="caps">MSDN </span>Library onto the host, and will re-install <span class="caps">MSDN</span> in my guest OS's.</p>

<p>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to - it's a different layout from the Thinkpad. I miss the groupings of the function keys, and the Windows key is positioned exactly where the Alt key is on the Thinkpad. Overall, however, the action is pretty good - about what I had expected. </p>

<p>The display is incredible. I'm blown away by the amount of real estate that I now have. I'm still running fonts at 96ppi, and scaling them appropriately for applications that I care about (command prompts + TextPad + <span class="caps">VS.NET</span>). I don't mind having the menus etc. take up less space with the 96ppi fonts - I treat them almost like icons - they're not things you generally <em>read</em>. </p>

<p>One thing that I really like is the improved scrolling speed for ClearType-rendered fonts. My ThinkPad and it's crappy 8MB S3 graphics card was horrible at scrolling <span class="caps">HTML</span> help rendered using ClearType. </p>

<p>I like the fact that the <span class="caps">USB 2.0</span> port can power my external hard drive. On my <span class="caps">T23, I</span> had to connect to a <span class="caps">USB</span> card <span class="caps">AND</span> the <span class="caps">USB 1.1</span> port for power.</p>

<p>I'll have more impressions once I'm done installing software.</p>

<h3 class="title">Second spindle</h3>

<p>I picked up an external <span class="caps">USB 2.0</span> drive today in anticipation of my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000454.html">new laptop</a> arriving tomorrow. I did some quick-and-dirty comparisons of boot times for Windows XP running in a <span class="caps">VPC</span> session on my laptop from its internal <span class="caps">HDD</span> and the external <span class="caps">USB 2.0</span> drive (a 60GB Fujitsu 5400rpm drive):</p>


<ul>
<li>Internal = 75 +/- 1s</li>
<li>External = 50 +/- 1s</li>
</ul>

<p>The +/- 1s is the standard deviation from 4 repeated measurements. That's a nice perf boost. I can't wait to see how things turn out on the Dell.</p>

<h3 class="title">Fritz is an old-school writer</h3>

<p>I'm amazed that <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz/default.aspx?key=2004-06-06T21:09:01Z">Fritz Onion</a> still writes using pen and paper!</p>

<p>My current writing system is fairly minimalist - I use a Textile-style simplified markup language (not paying that angle bracket tax!) that is processed through a set of Perl scripts that generate <span class="caps">HTML</span> documents. <span class="caps">HTML</span> will replace PowerPoint eventually, and my Perl scripts will eventually generate either <span class="caps">PDF </span>(via <span class="caps">XSL</span>:FO) or <span class="caps">XAML. I</span> like my writing system because I no longer worry about formatting when creating content. </p>

<p>It's about eliminating mental friction, which is why I think Fritz writes with pen and paper. However, I still like being able to get stream of consciousness thoughts into a document by typing. </p>

<h3 class="title">It shipped</h3>

<p>My last two laptops were <span class="caps">IBM </span>Thinkpads: a 600E and a <span class="caps">T23. </span>Thinkpads are extremely well-built laptops and they hold up at least as long as their warranty. Once their warranty expires (3 years), things start breaking - displays, keyboards, and the TrackPoint among other things.</p>

<p>This time around, I couldn't go with a Thinkpad. They simply lag too far behind in features compared to Dells. So I'm trading <span class="caps">IBM</span> build quality for Dell features - I'm hoping I'm making the right decision here. But oh what features - the Dell web site just informed me that they <em>finally</em> shipped my new Inspiron 8600:</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="caps">WUXGA,</span> baby 1920&times;1200 15.4" wide-screen display</li>
<li>Pentium <span class="caps">M 745 </span>(that's the 1.8GHz, 90nm "Dothan" w/ 2MB L2 cache and 23W power dissipation)</li>
<li>2GB <span class="caps">DDR RAM</span></li>
<li>Hitachi 60GB 7200rpm disk</li>
<li><span class="caps">ATI </span>Radeon 9600 Pro w/128MB <span class="caps">VRAM</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The thing that I'm really lusting after is that display - it's about 150ppi which should make it a fantastic Longhorn machine. The 2GB <span class="caps">RAM</span> should make it an excellent <span class="caps">VPC</span> machine. I'm buying an external 2.5" USB2 <span class="caps">HDD</span> enclosure so I have an extra spindle to run <span class="caps">VPC</span> on. The big 72Wh battery combined with the same power dissipation as the Pentium <span class="caps">III</span>-M on my <span class="caps">T23</span> should result in about double the battery life.</p>

<p>It should arrive early next week. I can't wait ...</p>

<h3 class="title">Working as an IT Pro</h3>

<p>As much as I hate it, there are times when I have to don my <span class="caps">IT </span>Pro hat. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian</a> and <a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/">Craig</a> reported that they couldn't send email to my Exchange server. Ian was even kind enough to send me a detailed network trace of his Exchange server's attempts to communicate with mine.</p>

<p>A quick bit of poking around the event logs on my Exchange server quickly pointed out a potential problem: my <code>secedit.sdb</code> file was corrupt. Apparently this file contains Group Policy settings among other things. All attempts to repair this problem failed. What was strange about this problem is that <em>some</em> email made it through -email that wasn't sent from Exchange servers. </p>

<p>So I had to power up a decommissioned server, install Windows 2003 Server and Exchange Server 2003, configure it as a Active Directory Global Catalog Server, migrate my Exchange mailboxes, and reconfigure my firewall to point to the new Exchange Server. All told, maybe 5 hours of effort spread over 3 days. All because of one corrupt file. Wow.</p>

<p>A big thanks goes out to Ian and Craig for the heads up about the problem. Since my spam was still getting through, I assumed that all was well. This problem began nearly a month ago based on my server logs. I apologize if folks have tried to send me email and gotten bounced replies. If you're one of those folks, please re-send your message and I'll fast-track a reply back to you.</p>

<h3 class="title">I'm scaring myself</h3>

<p>I spent the bus ride into Toronto this morning reading the Root Kit chapter from <strong>Exploiting Software: How to Break Code</strong>:</p>

<p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="120" height="240" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&amp;l=as1&amp;f=ifr&amp;t=iunknowncom-20&amp;dev-t=D68HUNXKLHS4J&amp;p=8&amp;asins=0201786958&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank"><MAP NAME="boxmap-p8"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="14, 200, 103, 207" HREF="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm/privacy-policy.html?o=1" ><AREA COORDS="0,0,10000,10000" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/iunknowncom-20" ></MAP><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/rcm/120x240.gif" width="120" height="240" border="0" usemap="#boxmap-p8" alt="Shop at Amazon.com"></iframe>    </p>

<p>This chapter's author (I'm assuming it's Greg Hoglund of <code>rootkit.com</code> fame) details some very scary exploits that compromise the <span class="caps">EEPROM</span> on various hardware devices (video, network, motherboard <span class="caps">BIOS, HDD</span> controller). </p>

<p>The more I think about these exploits, the more I'm afraid of the combination of root kits and "Layer 8" social engineering hacks. It would not be all that difficult for a well-funded organization (crime, foreign government) to place systems administrators into targets that install root kits for future attacks against the infrastructure of those targets. The potential havoc that can be wrought from these types of attacks is downright frightening. </p>
