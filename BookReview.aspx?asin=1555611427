                    <span>This book is a real wonder. <p>In a very friendly way, and without resorting to any technology beyond sticky notes, it introduces several concepts of computer science and systems engineering.<p>It can be used as a brainstorming tool, but it can also be used by us programmers as a gift to the non-programmers in our lives. It can serve as an exposition of what it is we do all day when we aren't cursing irritating APIs and OS misfeatures. This is about the part of our jobs that we love and that we have so much trouble explaining.<p>I'm delighted it's still in print. I love oddball books in general, and this is a great example. It really delivers much more than it claims to.<p>Don't hesitate for a minute to buy this one.<br>--<br>mt</span>

                    <span>As an IT Consultant I am always looking for different methods to solve problems.  I found this book to be simple but yet valuable. <p>When I first started reading this book it took me back to a book called "Visualizing Project Management" where the authors Forsberg, Mooz and Cotterman use the process of "Cards on the Wall" technique to encourage group thinking and visually determine dependencies. <p>This book introduces an effective way to solve problems with Post-it® Note. It starts off by showing simple key principles: (1) Chunking; capturing small information of data, (2) Problem Patterns, arranging and determining relationships, (3) Guiding decisions and keeping clear objectives, and (4) the *FOG* factor (Facts, Opinions, Guesses). <p>The core of the book provides 6 easy to use methods: (1) Post up, (2) Swap sort, (3) Top-down Tree, (4) Bottom-up Tree, (5) Information map and (6) Action Map.  Note that "Information map" has nothing to do with Information Mapping®, which is both a registered trademark and different method owned by Information Mapping, Inc.<p>These methods are represented graphically with many examples to help you determine which method is best suited to find the solution for complex problems.<p>What I found most helpful in this book was the step-by-step procedures in every chapter.  Every method has a clear definition of what it is and how and when it should be used.  Grasping these methods will paint a clear picture towards the direction of a solution.  I recommend this book to those that are looking for an effective, yet simple, way of solving problems.</span>

I keep this book in my briefcase for use at any time - don't let the name of the  book fool you, it's about quick methods for problem solving using Post  It  Notes to help you.  I keep referring back to the book time and again.  I  highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>David Straker shows six simple problem-solving processes for use in groups.  He  uses the Post-it(R) Note at the center of his processes to allow quick posting of ideas and thoughts, rearrangement, prioritization  and mapping.<p>The book is a quick read and gives you step-by-step  instructions about using each process in a meeting.  Its illustrations,  while simple, are concise and informative.</span>
