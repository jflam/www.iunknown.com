                    <span>No where have I found such informative and correct information on use case modeling, this book can be read from start to finish by the complete newbie and then keep it as a biblical reference whilst working with projects.<P>I was completely mysified about many aspects of Use Case and now I know when to apply it, and when not to, how to apply it and how not to and if I do not know, I can always refer back to this book!<P>The forward by Ivar Jacobson assures good content to follow, the introduction to Use Case modeling left me stunned with all the stuff that I did not know or had not considered! The connection to requirements are explained and even help on how to group requirements as well as tracebility from them to the Use Case.<P>The writing style is something to be admired, something I have taken as the honest truth on how to write proper use case.<P>If you have many questions about use case left unanswered, this book has them all.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after attending a conference where one of the Authors of this book had a presentation. I was so impressed by his presentation that I immediately bought his book. It was well spent money for sure.<BR>This book not only explains what use cases are and how to model them in a very clear and easy to understand way, it also reflects on bad and good practices when writing use cases. I have been writing use cases in several projects and have had a lot of help from this book. I also frequently use the book as a reference when participating in reviews of use cases.<BR>This book is my guide in the early stages of each project when working with use cases.<BR>You can read it quickly and it will give you lots of advise.</span>

                    <span>Given the many misconceptions in the software community regarding what use cases are, and how to develop and apply them, Bittner and Spence present a clear, pragmatic approach to use cases that focuses on the process of synthesizing use cases rather than simply the analytics of syntax, semantics, and diagrams. More than ample time is devoted to use case structure, syntax, semantics, and style. A significant percentage of the book addresses the process and logistical issues associated with team development of a use case model. Comprehensive process discussions are included regarding discovery of actors and use cases,preparing and conducting a use case workshop, finding use case mentors, building a representative team of stakeholders, reviewing use cases, and applying use cases across the lifecycle.<P>Chapter 10, Here There Be Dragons, will strike a chord with every experienced use case practitioner. As a consultant that develops and reviews use case models for customers, I found this chapter to be on the money. Bittner and Spence identify many improperly-used modeling techniques that often plague organizations during their initial adoption of use cases. Specifically, the sections regarding overuse of extend, include, and generalization relationships deserves much attention.<P>The Use Case syntax and semantics presented in Bittner and Spence's book is based on the foundational work developed by Ivar Jacobson. Straightforward and useful examples are presented for all of the use case artifacts discussed in the book. Unlike other use case texts that emphasize use case structure, form, and analytically oriented techniques, this book presents sufficient attention to notational elements and invests significantly more in describing pragmatic activities focused on synthesizing use cases that can be effectively leveraged across the lifecycle.<P>I have recommended Use Case Modeling to my clients as both an introductory as reference book for any project using use cases. The writing style lends itself to the entire spectrum of stakeholders involved in use case development from end users, architects, project managers, and developers.<P>If you are currently employing use cases, or are considering applying use cases on a project, this book is a MUST HAVE. It de-mystifies much of the confusion surrounding the practical application of use cases, and should be put on par with the early Object Oriented texts of Booch ,Rumbaugh, and Jacobson.</span>

                    <span>This book is just brilliant. Easy to read and filled with gems of advice. I highly recommend this book for beginners, intermediate and even advanced readers.Gives the theory and applies it an ATM case study to illustrate all the concepts.<BR>If there is one book that you should own on use cases, this is THE one.</span>
