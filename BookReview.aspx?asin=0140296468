                <span id="Label1">As American capitalism undergoes a seismic shift, Michael Lewis, author of the bestselling <i>Liar's Poker</i>, sets out on a Silicon Valley safari to find the true representative of the coming economic age. All roads lead to Jim Clark, the man who rewrote the rules of American capitalism as the founder of (so far) three multi-billion dollar companies-Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healtheon. Lewis's shrewd, often brilliantly funny, narrative provides ahead-of-the-curve observations about the Internet explosion and how the success of Silicon Valley companies is forcing a reassessment of traditional Wall-Street business models.<br><br>Weaving Clark's story together with that of this new business phenomenon, Lewis has drawn us a map of markets and free enterprise in the twenty-first century and blown the lid off the changing economy.</span>

                    <span>Entrepreneur Jim Clark made so much money in the 1980s and 1990s, it's a shame he couldn't have used some of it to buy himself a clue. To everything there is a season, and Clark had to have magnificent tunnel vision in the late '90s not to see the leaves turning on the dot-com economic revolution he helped create and profited from.
<br />
<br />Author Michael Lewis is a little more on the ball in this prescient, engaging account of Clark's doings almost right up until the moment the music stopped. Not that Lewis was so blatant about predicting the bubble's bursting: He enjoyed rather exclusive access to Lewis and probably didn't feel like he could hang his subject out to dry. But the hints are there, and it makes for a juicy narrative.
<br />
<br />Lewis is a practitioner of what I call "Rolling Stone" journalism, a ramped-up offshoot of New Journalism where the emphasis is on pizzazz and flashy one-liner endings. The thing is he's really, really good at it. He makes some funny, sage observations that aren't the least bit disposable, however flip the delivery.
<br />
<br />"The 'business model' of most Internet companies was to attract huge crowds of people to a Web site, and then sell others the chance to advertise products to the crowds," he writes. "It was still not clear that the model made sense."
<br />
<br />Lewis focuses not on Clark's business or technical dealings but his nautical adventures as captain of the world's largest sloop, with which he plans to sail the Atlantic completely under the control of a computer, barring any major foul-up or else Clark getting bored along the way, both of which are highly possible.
<br />
<br />As Lewis tells the tale, Clark is both one of the world's most dynamic tycoons and one of its most conspicuous ADD poster children. He has some clever ideas, but leaves the detail work to his followers and is too quickly off to the next new thing: "A plan was merely a theory of how he might spend his day; at all times it clashed in his mind with half a dozen other theories."
<br />
<br />I don't read toadying in lines like that; I read a healthy level of friendly, persistent skepticism that becomes Lewis and behooves his subject. It's not that Jim Clark was some kind of space-age snake-oil salesman. He believed in what he was doing. He just couldn't stay interested long enough to save the situation when it started going south.
<br />
<br />The sloop story does take up too much of Lewis's narrative, and Lewis does seem to short-shrift the technical end of things, probably because he knows it will slow down his sprightly narrative. The biggest problem in this book is the absence of Clark from the center: Apparently he let Lewis hang around but didn't pause to answer many questions, though if the failure of his health-care venture is any indication it wasn't like he had anything better to do.
<br />
<br />This book is no "Moneyball," Lewis's book on building the Oakland A's franchise which is the best available narrative on baseball today. It's better then his overrated "Liars' Poker," though, and makes for an engrossing if shallow immersion in a world that was quickly coming to an end. This isn't the most historically significant voyage ever taken by a Lewis and a Clark, but it makes for an interesting ride.

                    <span>It is quite interesting to read a book about the dot-bomb era written during the dot-bomd era, after the dot-bomb era.  For some reason, I've always found Lewis' books rather boring, with flat characters, and lacking depth - and this book is no exception.  It is an attempt at a biography but the character it focuses on (Jim Clark), apart from a few idiosincracies, does not have any real profile or areas of interest as an inventor, entrepreneur or business man.  He was just a guy with ambition for money and the chance to show off the amount of money he could gather.  The book, therefore, runs out very quickly of material topics to elaborate on.  There is a fair amount of ramblings regarding venture capital and the funding of technological enterprises but there is very limited anecdotical comments worth pages and pages.  In fact, as someone who has been involved in raising capital for IT projects, nothing that the book describes is particularly odd or different from what happens in hundreds of boardroom around the world.  Overall, any reader interested in the ins and outs of the mid-90s' frenzy of the Internet business hype is recommended to look elsewhere in titles such as Dot Con, Dot-Bomb, or Burn Rate.</span>

                    <span>Michael Lewis is a genius. He is one of the smartest human beings out there, and his writing takes you on an incredible ride. This guy can write like an expert about finance, politics, technology, or sports. He sticks to a field for a while learns everything there is to learn and then writes a book about it, better than anyone who has spent their entire life to that particular field. 
<br />
<br />He has done it again with "The New New Thing". In his incredible journey through the Silicon Valley of the mid-nineties Michael Lewis shadows Jim Clark while he is out to change the world. Jim Clark is an eccentric engineer self-proclaimed technology messiah, who founded three of the most successful technology corporations: Silicone Graphics, Netscape, and Healtheon. At the peak of the dot.com era Jim Clark was worth over three billion dollars. Michael Lewis with his amazing narrative follows Jim Clark, from the time he was worth 300 million to the top of the hill. He digs into Jim Clark's past discovering the all-American dream success story of rising from rags to riches. 
<br />
<br />The journey is exciting and includes nose-diving airplane rides, venturing the high seas of the Atlantic Ocean with a bunch of nerds, and redefining the way VCs went about money. If you never understood in depth what happened in the infamous dot.com era this book would give you the best account.</span>

                    <span>When Lewis set out to write this book, he was attempting to expose and satirize silicon valley in the same way he had skewered wall street in his previous books.  In the course of writing the book, he is introduced to Jim Clark.  The New New Thing then becomes a hagiography of Clark's personality, ambitions, and achievements.  Though I found the book entertaining and well-written, I was disappointed that the author casts such an unskeptical eye on Clark.  Lewis saves his satire for the one person that most readers could empathize with - Allan (the Captain of Clark's boat) and an internet investor.  One quarter of the book is devoted to Lewis's time on Clark's yacht - this narrative is wholly gratuitous and lends little to the story other than to show that the author had unparalleled acess to Clark.  This book would be richer, if a preface was added.  Lewis wrote this book before the NASDAQ topped off in March 2000 - and one wonders if Lewis would assign Clark any responsibility for the hype that was created and the real life consequences for those who lost large amounts of money in the ensuing crash.</span>

Reads more like a biography and does not capture the wheeling dealing in Silicon Valley whcih the reader might have expected to see.</span>
