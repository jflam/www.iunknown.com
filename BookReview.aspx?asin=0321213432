                <span id="Label1">Sure, you can use Flash MX 2004 without being a master programmer, but as any Flash developer worth his or her salt will tell you, you're not tapping all of its power unless you're taking advantage of its scripting language "ActionScript 2.0" which offers a more robust programming model and better object-oriented programming support than ever before. Here to take the fear factor out of learning it are Flash veterans and best-selling authors <b>Derek Franklin</b> and <b>Jobe Makar,</b> who demonstrate that scripting is an instinctual process you already know by translating real-life activities into ActionScript scripts. In these pages, you'll find methodologies and techniques for building over 40 real-life Flash ActionScript projects, including sample games, --- applications, Web sites, and more. New in this edition are coverage of ActionScript 2.0, Web services, Components, Printing, Video, and more. On the companion CD, you'll find all the project files and images you need to complete each project.</span>

                    <span>I'm a professional graphics programmer, most recently via Java applets. I tried to learn Flash 5, and dropped it because I couldn't see doing real simulators with it. But with MX 2004 and ActionScript 2.0, the programming model is finally to the point where I can get all the power of Flash animation and vector art, small downloads and excellent browser support & deployability, without sacrificing object-oriented programmability, plus gain outstanding server-side integration capabilities. Still, I was finding it a really steep climb up the learning curve with Flash MX 2004. I'm not the only one - I've spoken to other Java & OO programmers who despaired of the paradigm shift to Flash. But then I got this book. Now it all makes sense. Virtually every one of the 50+ beautifully designed and programmed examples gives a huge leg up on the learning curve. I've been programming for 25 years, and this is one of the best programming books I've ever read. If you're a programmer, and want to learn Flash, get THIS book. :)</span>

                    <span>I have been working with Flash for some years now, and eveytime a new version comes out I buy a book that talks about the upgrades and new cool stuff etc. <P>Without a doubt this the the best training book I have read bar none. Each Chapter covers the subject indepth and in detail. The author goes step-by-step and explains every action and why it is done that way. Most books I have read are either heavy in theroy or heavy in the process (this step, next step), if you are an ActionScript novice or expert this book will give you the information you need.<P>If only I could find books like these in other software systems I work in.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a a book that teaches you all-inclusive how to program ActionScript2 resourcfully than that's the one you must have! I'm coming from the pearl/php/vb environment and it was a breeze working myself into the new Flash language.<BR>I may sound a little too enthusiastic... but this one I can recommend without any reservation.<BR>You're getting dirty hands from the beginning; every chapter tells you how to work with the source files on the CD to pull you thru. There are Examples for every aspect.<BR>While some people do not recommend it as a reference... well, so do I. But it is obviously not ment to be one. For a good reference you mitght consider buying the one from O'Reilly.<BR>Sorry... any grammatical errors in this comment are due to the fact that I'm Swiss.</span>

                    <span>This book contains a series of great tutorials on the most common ActionScript tasks you might encounter. It starts with the basics, so even the non-programmer should be able to get up to speed quickly. I also use it as a reference book sometimes, but I usually have to extract the info I need from one of the tutorials, making it hard to track down the one line of code I need. I usually use it by doing tutorials similar to projects I'm working on, so that I can immediately practic and apply what I've learned. The included CD is top-notch with all of the files you need for the tutorials and more. I highly recommend this book, although you might want to buy a reference book too (or just try the Flash help menu - it's vastly improved over previous versions).</span>

                    <span>In an attempt of cover "everything" the authors of this book did great disservice to his audience. I found the content to be much too broad-base while it's depth was much too shallow. As is usual with most computer-book "authors," Franklin and Makar jump around a bit and sometimes leaving the reader up in the air. It is intended to an intermediate audience yet it has chapters that are much too basic and chapters that are much too advanced. Further, I found many instances when the authors were making assumptions on the skills of the reader. It's not a bad book, but there's quite a bit of room to improve.</span>
