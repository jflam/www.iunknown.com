                    <span>In the introduction, the authors mention that many people read the first-person narratives of their type and those of their friends and family's and feel that the descriptions are right on -- well, that's my experience too. I have never gotten excited by romanticized type descriptions found in most books about the MBTI, and even David Keirsey's type descriptions in Please Understand Me_ often seem to be a bit too much the product of the author's imagination, but this book is based on actual interviews with people of all 16 types.  And it shows in the descriptions, which are the most balanced, fair and unbiased ones I've ever run across.  I originally got into type
<br />theory in order to better understand certain family members who are way different than me, and I'm finding this book very useful and practical.

                    <span>The descriptions in this book are too vague, so for someone who is new to typology, it could be daunting identifying with one the types by reading this book. If you already know your type, the information in this book is limited and not completely accurate. I suggest "Do What You Are" as an alternative choice.</span>

                    <span>Having a career interest in psychology, I have read a few books on the subject of personality type, and I found "Descriptions for Self-Discovery" to be a good purchase for the small price.  The book provides fairly small, two page descriptions of each personality type, briefly detailing the traits.  A good deal of information is stored in the two-page synopsis, but there is no functional analysis of the types, so look elsewhere for deeper textbook-style reading.  I also found that people tested for the first time reacted well to the short and descriptive type-models, and were interested in learning more after being "primed" with the information in this book.  A good aid for counselors aiming to deepen initial interest and active participation in self-discovery with patients.<p>This book is not a reference for psychologists, but is well worth the small price for its unique and easily digestible type descriptions.</span>

                    <span>With the explosion of new books on type in the last few years, you might wonder what more could be written to be put into an introductory booklet on the sixteen types. Well, Linda Berens and Dario Nardi have done just that.  As a student of David Keirsey, Dr. Berens has long been an advocate of the  concept of temperament and has been a key force in having the concept  become accepted in the Manual for the new Form M of the MBTI. Dr. Nardi was  a collaborator with Dr. Berens on her previous booklet: Understanding  Yourself and Others: An Introduction to Temperament. <p>Imagine you are  shown an oval shadow. What do you think produced it? Depending on the angle  of the light, it could be a sphere, a cone or a cylinder. Now move the  position of the light on the unknown object. The shadow now might appear as  a diamond. With a few more clues you may determine that the object was a  cylinder. This is a metaphor for describing personality. When you are  helping people determine their personalities, you help them compare  themselves to patterns that have been found to apply to various other  defined personality types. The authors call them best-fit type patterns.  The descriptions are not composited based on preferences or temperaments  but are observable holistic patterns. They are also careful to show that  the concepts do not place people in a box, but rather give them a  vocabulary to understand differences and similarities. The graphics chosen  are simple but effective in demonstrating these concepts.<p>The authors  have used the Johari Window (a training diagram from the days of group  dynamics) to show that a description of the type is a combination of how  others see us and how we see ourselves. Next you are encouraged to read  over brief descriptions of the sixteen types, read the two page  descriptions of the types that seem to fit, and then choose the one type  that fits best.<p>People used to seeing the Myers-Briggs Type Table will  find the sixteen types arranged in a different pattern. Here they are  grouped according to temperament or in a Temperament MatrixTM. So, if you  have identified your temperament, you would start in that quadrant and read  those descriptions first to find the one most likely to match your  type.<p>The sixteen types are each described in a two-page format. On one  side is the objective description, including a short snapshot summary, and  then a longer portrait that describes the theme of the type and the type in  relationships. The other page describes how it feels to be in that type.  These descriptions are a composite of responses to the question What is it  like to be you? by four individuals (two men and two women) who have  identified themselves as that type. My wife and I both felt our  descriptions were quite accurate and insightful.<p>Having identified your  type, you are encouraged to further use the Johari Window to use it as a  matrix to identify new learnings about yourself, and to go on and take  action to further develop your personality.<p>The booklet has two  appendices: one elaborates on the theory relating temperament to type, and  the other provides notes for facilitators.<p>While it has some very useful information for  people trained in the use of the MBTI, they may want to experience the full  presentation by a TRI trained facilitator to fully benefit from the  material. This is a very worthwhile book to add to your MBTI library. But  be warned! You may feel that your presentations are somewhat lacking and  that you need to find out more about The Self-Discovery ProcessSM. You may  get so excited that you will want to see that all of your clients get a  copy of the book as well.</span>

                    <span>My Type is ESFJ - and your description of me is "spot on" .  I can't think of a thing that's missing from this booklet.  I really like your approach in describing the 16 types.</span>
