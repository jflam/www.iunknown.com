                <span id="Label1">Most people, acquainted with cryptology either through sensational cloak and dagger stories or through newspaper cryptograms, are not aware that many aspects of this art may be treated systematically, by means of some elementary mathematical concepts and methods. In this introduction, Professor Sinkov explains some of the fundamental techniques at the basis of cryptanalytic endeavor from which much more sophisticated techniques have evolved, especially since the advent of computers. The mathematical topics relevant in these discussions include modular arithmetic, a little number theory, some linear algebra of two dimensions with matrices, some combinatorics, and a little statistics. Also included are programs in BASIC developed by Paul Irwin for use in his course based on this book.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Sinkov has been-there, done-that. He was in the first group of three mathematicians hired by William Friedman of the Army's Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) back in 1930. After two name changes, the agency became the NSA, and Sinkov became the Chief of Communications Security, and later, Deputy Director for Production. <P>Using only high school math, the good doctor takes us on a tour of cryptanalysis that is remarkable for it's clarity and completeness. If you don't start with Sinkov's book, you're doing it the hard way.</span>

                    <span>This, along with the book by Helen Gaines, is one of the best introductions to classical cryptology, but if you want to go further into contemporary cryptology, you'll need a more recent book. I like Applied Cryptology by Bruce Schneier.<P>For by far the best book on background but not for mathematics, try The Codebreakers by David Kahn. <P>All four belong on any crypto bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>Sinkov's greatly consistent language is the first thing I have admired, second but not least the clear explanations, the algorithms and the attention that the book should be enough to make the average user understand everything.

A mathematical approach to cryptanalysis that is well thought out and easy to understand.</span>
