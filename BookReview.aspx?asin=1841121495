                    <span>And that's pretty much all this book does. And truly I'd be okay with that if it were at all well written or offered ANY real insight into his method. Y'know how reality shows always spend like one-third of their air time repeating stuff they already told you? This book is like that. 
<br />
<br />The King of Virgin is clearly a marketing genius. Surely there's another book that does him justice.</span>

                    <span>This book is a handy compilation of observations, hypotheses and speculations on the subject of Richard Branson. Author Des Dearlove freely and frankly admits his debt to several other writers who have probed the Branson story in depth and breadth. There is little if anything original to be found, aside perhaps from the author's style of presentation, which tries hard to be light and deft. Although the book carries you along, its biggest punch resides in the author's list of "10 secrets" of Branson's success. Readers who would like to know in the most general terms what Branson has done and how he has done it, and who are willing to swallow a few clichés in lieu of explanations, will seize upon this book.we think you will enjoy it and, after all, enjoying your work is one of Branson's great secrets.</span>

                    <span>I believe that Richard Branson is a unique character and that information about his life and business philosophies would make an interesting read. Thus I chose to read this book.<p>However I was somewhat disappointed. Although I did learn a few things and there were some interesting passages, a great deal of the book consisted of quotes obtained from OTHER biographers and journalists attempting to document Branson's life. <p>Each chapter concluded with a summary (read: repetition) of the information in that chapter, and dozens of other sections/quotes/anecdotes were obviously repeated in various chapters. Perhaps because of this, it only took me an hour to read the entire book (admittedly I am a reasonably fast reader). <p>One thing that I can say in its favor is that the book was structured well; there were 10 main sections, each devoted to a different "Branson philosophy" (for example, "pick on someone bigger than you"). <p>In short, although I did get some interest out of this book I am looking for another Branson biography to read because this one fell short of expectations.</span>

                    <span>I suggested that we choose Virgin as a company to research as an MBA Project.  Our group used this book as research material.  We found it wonderful, and uplifting, exactly what what was necessary for this project.  I would highly recommend it to others as well as the book "Losing My  Virginity".  Virgin is a company that should be studied by US  business'executives, its shows you can create an empire - differently!</span>
