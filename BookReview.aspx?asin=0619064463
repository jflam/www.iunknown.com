                    <span>This book tells it like it is and enables nontechies as well as the practitioner to see how the Zachman framework can be used with today's enterprise strategies. Although designed as a university text, I found this comprehensive book helpful in getting upper management to understand the need to invest in an architecture. The author shows how by using John Zachman's framework we can become more efficient and thorough in our analysis and design. The book shows how the framework can help an organization make better decisions by working through an enterprise solution cell by cell.<BR> <BR>This book is a must read for executives, manager, and all IT professionals because it explains that enterprise architecture is a business issue, it addresses all 36 cells of the Zachman framework from both a business and IT perspective, it acknowledges political barriers to progress in an organization, and it demonstrates how various construction techniques can be supported by the framework.</span>

                    <span>Assigned as reading in an MIS class, this book is an interesting read and helps define enterprise architecture and describes how EA contributes to corporate value. This book illustrates how to develop a broader perspective of architecture potential and also gives plenty of examples. Chapter 4 includes a number of practical examples of how to work with people who affect decisions on EA implementation. Enterprise architecture is rarely discussed in university management programs and yet there are many opportunities available to those capable of aligning technology and business requirements. Chapter 7 gives a detailed explanation of the Zachman Framework and includes definitions pertinent to a greater understanding of enterprise architecture. The book explains that all the cells of the framework do not have to be completed to make a difference for your organization, and shows how to begin an EA effort one step at a time. The articles on the cd included in the back of the book supplement the comprehensive topics covered in the book itself. I strongly recommend getting this book along with John Zachman's eBook if you want to increase your own personal influence and effectiveness at helping others in your organization understand EA concepts and begin to implement.</span>

                    <span>I have been a business systems analyst for many years and used some elements of the Zachman framework succesfully in fairly cutting edge projects. I was hoping to gain a deeper perspective across the whole framework (all 36 cells) to round out my understanding and to provide additional techniques and methods I could use.<BR>Unfortunately the book wholly failed to meet this expectation. I think it is worth 2 stars for introducing people to the overall concepts of the Zachman Framework, but don't expect any useful methods that can be applied in practice.<P>The Zachman Framework IS the defintive approach to enterprise systems architecture, but unfortunately there is still scant practical resources available for practicioners.</span>

                    <span>This is more of a "What" than a "How" book, and it does clearly [if somewhat verbosely] describe the Zachman Framework. It also provides implementation advice (the "How"), but that information is not as clearly laid out as it is in "Enterprise Architecture Planning" (ISBN 0471599859). <P>I like this book because it is business-focused, and painstakingly describes the Zachman Framework and how it clearly provides a multidimensional view of business-technology alignment. It also reflects the latest thinking with respect to the framework, including Zachman DNA (Depth iNtegrating Architecture), which is missing from "Enterprise Architecture Planning" I cited above. It also contains some unique perspectives that I haven't found in other books, such as how to use the framework outside of IT (Appendix C), and how to map careers to the framework (Appendix D). <P>What is missing from this book, and others like it, is a disclosure of the dark side of the framework if an organization fully commits to it. One such problem is once you've mapped your enterprise architecture to the Zachman Framework's matrix, a change in any cell will cause a ripple effect throughout the matrix. As time goes on this effect becomes a barrier to changes or requires high maintenance to keep the architecture in synch with the business and technology components. This does not diminish the value of the Zachman Framework as a way to view the enterprise, but should forewarn you that implementing it as a principle methodology is a step that should be carefully considered before committing. <P>That said, this book is one I would highly recommend to anyone who is considering the Zachman Framework, or who is seeking an approach to clearly viewing an enterprise from multiple dimensions in order to cut through complexity and see the big picture. I also recommend that you visit the Zachman Institute (see ASIN B00016NEXI) to see the latest work and additional information.</span>

                    <span>You will learn how to create value for your organization by systematically recording assets, processes, connectivity, people, timing, and motivation, through a simple framework. What's more, you will create a model that can grow and change as fast as the market evolves. Face it, we know we've got to start somewhere no matter what that first model is. <P>This book gives you solid information to convince the right people to make that investment. My company started when we closed one plant and had to restructure with fewer employees. All of a sudden we were faced with the reality that alot of information went out the door with the people who got laid off. <P>One of our employees handed me an article by John Zachman called "Conceptual, Logical, Physical",and also recommended this book that he had used in an introductory management information course. This book will make you look at your tasks and your people differently. We're reworking some of our systems now, but this time, we're building the models as we go along--one step at a time. This book will help you see how to map any attribute or problem to the Zachman Framework, and you can use whatever methodology to do it.</span>
