                <span id="Label1"><P> The old rules of decorating are dead, says style maker and TV personality Christy Ferer. Whether we've wanted to or not, we've staged a revolution -- a revolution in taste and in the way we live. In today's homes, anything goes, and we're all the happier for it. <P> In this exuberant and groundbreaking book, we discover what works and what happens to the way we live when all the rules are broken. Today we find that the dining room, once a place of fine linens and formal dinner parties, has become an office, a rec room, a space families live in every day. It's still beautiful, but who cares if the chairs match? Life has changed and, like everything else, the old rules sometimes just don't make sense. <P> This revolution in taste has opened the door to a million new possibilities. But where do we start? In <I>Breaking the Rules,</I> style whiz Christy Ferer shakes up the old assumptions and provides us with fabulous tips about:  <P> COLOR -- Common wisdom tells us to stick to neutrals for major areas and let brighter colors serve as accents, but Ferer shows us how green, blue, and even pink work as the new neutrals. <P> PATTERN -- Plaids with florals, checks with stripes? Heresy! Not so, says Ferer, who proclaims that patterns mix well when their colors are the same intensity. <P> SCALE -- We've all heard that in a small room we should keep the furniture small. But here, we see that oversize pieces can expand our perception of space. <P> FUNCTION -- The dining room for dining, the library for reading, the maid's room for the maid...whose house is that?  Every space serves multiple functions today, Ferer points out. If a dining room unfolds its cabinets to become a home office/media room, so much the better. <P> FURNITURE -- The bedroom suite and the matching Colonial living room are things of the past. Today, nothing needs to match -- and it's more interesting if it doesn't. An eighteenth-century sofa is only enhanced next to a 1960s coffee table. <P> This inspiring book illuminates these and other ideas with more than 140 extraordinary color photographs that take us into the living quarters of some exceptionally creative people, among them Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Bette Midler, Bill Blass, and Cynthia Rowley. In <I>Breaking the Rules,</I> Christy Ferer brings together fabulous ideas and a feast of dazzling photos as she walks us through the brave new world we've made for ourselves -- and shows us how much fun a revolution can be.</span>

                    <span>The points that the author makes aren't new (I have been reading similar tips about personal style and in the other decorating magagzines and books that I have bought for years). Even though the information is not new or original, I do like having this writer's quick tips close at hand for reference. The photos leave something to be desired, because so many of them are little closeups of objects when I would rather see whole rooms.</span>

                    <span>"Breaking the Rules" is not about anarchy, although it is a rebellion of sorts. It is a call to creativity in decorating our homes in a way that breaks the stagnant bonds of outdated rules and conventionality. "Don't be afraid to let your home reflect your dynamic personality", suggests authors Palazzo and Ferer, two very talented ladies. The book explores use of color, textures, patterns and encourages us to enhance all of those neglected spaces in the house. Mixing styles of furniture is encouraged. So is the use of garden furniture indoors, and overstuffed cushions and pillows. So open the windows, let the light come in, give your home a fresh new look - one that reflects your beauty, your inner qualities and all those fantastic decorating ideas you have been afraid to try. An excellent guidebook.</span>

                    <span>I like the premise of the book, but the end product looks too New Yorky and bicoastal. There are better, broader decorating books around that make the same "do your own thing" point while taking a broader, truly national approach in the choice of places that are pictured. I get so tired of buying great-sounding books only to see that the people who produced them are not well-travelled and have focused on New York and perhaps California. Disappointing. I wish they would show real homes that most of the country can identify with.</span>

                    <span>Oh,my! "Breaking the Rules: Home Style For the Way We Live Today" is one visually stunning book."Breaking the Rules" doesn't just rock, it roars.Author Christy Ferrer has taken those stodgly ol' decorating rules and chucked 'em out the well-appointed window.Every page of this book is gorgeous and delightfully iconoclastic.Featured items range from a mink and lucite stool, to an artfully displayed collection of gloves (which once belonged to the Duchess of Windsor),to Bette Midler's stove.These interiors are a fun, funky, ecclectic and joyfully eccentric mix.This is not the typical decorating book that serves up a style for you to copy as if you were some kind of decorating drone. "Breaking the Rules" is an inspirational guide for letting your creativity emerge, maybe even explode.Do you like shocking pink and lime green? Go ahead. Crack open a couple of paint cans and redo that boring living room!This book not only gives you permission, but may even serve as your muse. And, finally, bravely, in the face of all that is accepted and personified as "good taste", author Ferrer even dares us to: "Think plastic." This is truly "no guts, no glamour" decor.What a spirited and breath-taking piece of work! Christy Ferrer(with Risa Palazzo) has put together one heck-of-a book.I dare you to read it!</span>
