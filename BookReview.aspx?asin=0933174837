                    <span>Rosalind S. Wall was privileged to grow up on a rancho in Old Big Sur, way at the back of a canyon. Before the coastal Highway 1 was built, the area put a new definition to the word 'remote,' and Wall was one of many who refused to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the highway. Those people recognized that a whole way of life would disappear within a few years, and they were right.<BR>The first half of her book was most interesting to me. It deals with the historical colonial settlers of Mexican, Indian, and American heritages, how those three came together through business, ranching, and intermarriage to form the unique flavor and heritage of this special region. Wild regions tend to attract wild people, and Big Sur has always had its share of 'characters.' It still does. Wall recalls from her own memory many of these people and brings them to life for us.<BR>The second half of the book concerns her own life in Big Sur, and while very interesting, it doesn't have the same historical significance and broad scope of the first half.<BR>A great piece of writing for those who wish to get a sense of the way it used to be down in the Big South.</span>

                    <span>For anyone preparing to vacation at Big Sur, this book is a charming and compelling introduction to the "pioneers" of the coast, and to the Indians who preceeded them. In a warm, lively, personal and energetic style, Ms. Wall tells you fascinating stories of the 1800's and pre-Highway 1 Big Sur, always attempting to separate lore from fact, but reveling in both. She is also wonderfully sensitive to the "presence" and spirit of Big Sur, and tells compelling stories of protecting lights and "small brown people". From Pfeiffer to Jeffers, all the early settlers are here--by the end of the book, you feel like a compatriot in their histories. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know more about this fascinating area--I guarantee you will be informed, delighted and entertained.</span>

                    <span>This is my favorite book on the history of the Big Sur coast. It is written with a passion for the most beautiful place on Earth. It has wonderful anecdotes form the author's life in Big Sur and other stories about the interesting inhabitants of the area. This is one of those books you can easily read more than once.</span>

                    <span>Lillain Wall divides the book into two parts. The first chapters focus on the history of the Big Sur region; from Spanish Colonial days, through the American Period up the the construction of Hwy 1. She explains, in detail the conections between the significant figures in Big Sur history and how their lives affected the region.<P>The latter chapters focus increasingly on her own life in Big Sur. Wall begins with life as a child in the wilderness through the time of the construction of Hwy 1 to the rediscovery of the California Sea Otter. After this point Wall sadly leaves the reader without more insight into the modern development of Big Sur and with it the fates of it's characters.<P>Perhaps more time could have been spent on covering the whole Big Sur coast, but her insights into pre-highway life are very important to understanding the Big Sur of today.</span>
