                <span id="Label1">This grandfather of all people-skills books was first published in 1937. It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. <I>How to Win Friends and Influence People</I> is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to "the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people." He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and "arousing in the other person an eager want." You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, "let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers," and "talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person." Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book about the core(s) of human relations. In this text, you learn what techniques will allow you to communicate and make friends with anyone. If you are interested in learning the essential skills of friend-making/social excellence, this is the book for you. 
<br />This is also a fun history book because it was written a long time ago. Although the examples are outdated, the techniques are not. Further, the examples provide a slight glimpse into history-- so they are fun to read too. 
<br />I believe in these principles and know for certain that they are correct. The techniques discussed are simple social and communicative basics and, if mastered, will allow the reader to converse on hieghts and new abilities unheard of. 
<br />The writting style is slightly old but still simple and direct. It is easy reading with great examples which make it a fun read too.
<br />This door opens the door to communicating effectively with anyone, any place! </span>

                    <span>Just a joy to read, this book is truly a classic. With its timeless stories the author uses to illustrate the principles of getting along with others, this book should be requires reading for all human beings. Other self-help books I liked include "The No-Beach, No-Zone, No-Nonsense Weight Loss Plan, A Pocket Guide To What Works."

                    <span>Having chanced through these reviews again, I think I will force myself to re-re-read it again:-) My title says it all.
<br />
<br />I first bought this book in 1994, when I was 17. I was immediately hooked, and in applying the principles in the book, my relations with friends and acquaintances underwent a serious metamorphosis. To this day, I remember precepts such as "when you're tempted to react to something, ignore your initial feeling, and let it go". I have often failed at this, but times when I have remembered, a lot of animated anad heated arguments have been scuppered.
<br />
<br />Also, there is one particular anecdote about Abraham Lincoln having been upset with one of his subordinates whom he had asked--I believe it was his general--to do something during the 1861-65 US Civil War. His general came back with news that he had not done what he had been asked. Lincoln was characteristically subdued, but upset. He wrote a letter, put it in his drawer, and forgot about it.
<br />
<br />Later, he realised that it was a good idea that he hadn't sent the letter which was a rebuking one. Lincoln was able to resolve the issue, and reflected that had he been the man, he would probably have done the same thing. 
<br />
<br />Anecdotes like that remind us how critical it is to pause and reflect on issues, without adopting a knee-jerk approach. It can literally save a lot of trouble. Just for that, I would recommend this book highly. And yes, it *is* my second bible!</span>

                    <span>For those of us who work in psychology, there is often a tendency to look down on works that were created for the mainstream population.  They are sometimes dismissed as "pop psychology."  I believe that I regarded How to Win Friends... until I read it upon the recommendation of a friend.  I could not have been more wrong about a book.  Although Carnegie's title is often the target of derision, it is a deceptively deep and important work.  There's a very good reason why How to Win Friends... has been a bestseller for seventy years as the man shares essential truths with us about human behavior.  Every single one of us can profit from his advice.  His central ideas, such as that one should avoid arguments whenever possible, cannot be questioned.  The command that one should listen to others and let them talk about themselves is crucial to being liked.  A "simple" idea like that one is one that actually works.  I'm considering putting his nine rules for effective leadership on my wall so I can remember to generate enthusiasm in others and lead by example.
<br />
<br />I was really surprised as to how much this book matters and how much I learned by reading it.  Yes, some of the advice may be obvious, but it brings the correct way in which to interact with others to the forefront of the mind and that's why it's so valuable.  </span>

                    <span>This is a truly amazing book.  It changed my life.
<br />
<br />The thing that I really like about this book is that it teaches you to be a good person.  It teaches you to be real by being your best self.
<br />
<br />It shows you how to interact with people in a positive way for you and for the other person.  It is timeless, and I'll read it about once every three years for the rest of my life.</span>
