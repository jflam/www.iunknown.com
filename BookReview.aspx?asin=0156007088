                    <span>This was a required book for a class I'm taking on Religion and the Civil Rights Movement and this book has brought me to tears more than once. It's so beautifully written, with words that you can really feel coming from John Lewis. So many books feel like the children of editors more than writers, but this doesn't have that same feeling.
<br />
<br />It's just... Words really fail. To read about the movement in some dry history book can be traumatic enough, but to really see and hear and FEEL the words of the people involved is just heartbreaking. It makes you wonder just how such injustice could possibly have survived and I've fallen in love with all of these brave, wonderful people who fought for thier right to be treated as human beings. 
<br />
<br />I really can't say enough wonderful things about this book. It's a powerful, meaningful read and I love it.</span>

                    <span>All I can say is that I LOVE this book. It is a true and chilling first-hand account of the Civil Rights Movement. I suggest that everyone read this book. John Lewis is truly an American hero!!</span>

                    <span>after reading this book i have a much different view of the civil rights era. Mr. Lewis has revealed a fascinating view of the times as well as of himself. i have read several books about the so-called civil rights era and this is at the top. what makes it so good is that it is balanced and honest. buy it and you won't be sorry. even if you don't give a darn about this point in history, this is a wonderful story about courageous people and turbulent times. Mr. Lewis does not try to elevate himself above the many faceless people who gave their energy and their lives for what they believed in. one of my all-time favorite books period.   buy it, buy it, buy it!!!!</span>

                    <span>John Lewis was seemingly everywhere during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's.  From the Nashville Sit-Ins, to the Freedom Rides to the famous march from Selma and more. It is akin to someone having been at the Boston Tea Party, Lexington and Philadelphia on July 4, 1776.  Not only was Lewis there but he was an active participant, one of the many brave souls who risked injury, even death to bring down segregation.  Lewis knew all the key figures in the Movement, such as Dr. King, and was a leader himself.  Today, of course, Lewis serves his country in the House of Representatives.<br>It's hard to go wrong with such a compelling story to tell and Lewis doesn't dissapoint.  With the help of co-author Michael D'Orso, we learn not only of one person's participation in the Civil Rights' Movement, but gain insight into the  Movement as a whole.<br>Lewis is vastly under appreciated by Americans today.  Hopefully Waking With the Wind will help future generations appreciate John Lewis, an American hero.</span>

                    <span>John Lewis captured the Spirit of America and the true motivation behind the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement in "Walking With The Wind." This book allows the reader to not only experience the movement, but to gain a better understanding of the issues and events that have shaped American history in the last half of the twentienth century. Brilliantly crafted, this book epitomizes the "American Dream." Highly recommended to anyone interested in American history or modern day hereos.</span>
