                    <span>This is one of the best books on Unix shell scripting I have ever read. I immediately put a few of the scripts to work in our Solaris production environment. Be warned though; this book focuses entirely on the Korn shell. If you plan to write scripts using the Bourne, BASH, or C-shell you should find another book.</span>

                    <span>The breadth of real-world examples make the difference between this book and most reference texts.  It's true that it's written for korn, but I've had little trouble adapting for Bash; many of the scripts run almost unchanged and the ones that don't provide a useful opportunity for exercise in adaptation.  The authors prose is clear.  His attitude is a bit challenging; he says early on that that his intention is to teach you how to -solve problems- by shell scripting, NOT to present a ream of canned solutions. This is NOT a reference text for any particular shell, you'll still need plenty of O'Reilly books, a web browser & etc.
<br />
<br />This book has enabled me to write a major project using scripting as the glue to hold together a hefty mass of file-moving daemons, fax/paging engines, python UI code, PostGreSQL database engine, networking/email, SSH, and Expect scripts on a Gnu Linux platform.  I absolutely could not have done it without this book and I'm very grateful to Mr Michael for his work.  If a later edition could more closely serve the needs of the masses by presenting more Bash examples and maybe throwing in a CD it would be a 5-star text.</span>

                    <span>Mastering UNIX Shell Scripting is a must for all Unix Administrator. The beauty of this book is it teaches shell script with practical examples which are required in day to day life of a System Admin. Unlike many shell scripting book it just not talks about syntax but also explains whats happening behind the curtain.<br> Inspite of all praises the reason for giving 4 stars is due to the fact that its not meant for beginners. For serious shell script writers this book  deserve 5 star rating</span>

                    <span>We wanted to automate a couple of tasks at the Unix level.<br>So I went looking for a Unix Shell script book. This books covers learning by doing. Real Life examples can be used and are not of the "Hello World" type. By covering on skill at a time and building on the previous skill you can learn how to shell script quickly</span>

                    <span>If you are interested in Bourne or Bash shell programming, be aware that this book focuses exclusively on the Korn shell (ksh or "ksh93"). The Korn shell is a superset of the Bourne shell, but if you want to write scripts for sh (Bourne) or bash, another book might be more appropriate.</span>
