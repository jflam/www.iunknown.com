                    <span>Even though this book is 8 years old, it remains essential reading. It's extremely accessible, and can be read cover-to-cover, or used as a reference. There's a quiz in the back of the book to help you to actually retain the material. I've bought several copies, and I loan them out when I think the recipient will be receptive. (Some people are hopeless when it comes to good design.) This book is worth owning by itself, or as a primer to Robin Williams' other books.</span>

                    <span>I found this book when it was first published as "The MAC is..." and it has been my Bible ever since. I have given it out to everyone who has ever worked for me or with me. I am a trainer and in any class that has anything to do with typing it is standard reference material.<P>I cannot believe we still have 'teachers' teaching people how to type that do not adhere to professional typesetting standards. This book opened my eyes to the beauty you can create in the type written page. 'Corporate' people positively comment on documents that I have delivered as "elegant" or "easy to read" or "so professional" because I adhere to the principles set forth in Ms. Williams book.<P>I think this easy to read, well designed, and information packed book should be required reading for any person that touches a keyboard!</span>

                    <span>This and its companion "The Mac is not a Typewriter" are so important to everyone who writes a letter, types an e-mail, designs a sign, or creates a presentation. In short easy to understand lessons disguised as chapters, the reader learns everything that was lost when computers replaced typesetters. Though most Macintosh users are professional designers, they won't need this book, but for the millions of PC users out there, this is irreplaceable. I keep four or five copies of this book in my desk. Anyone I find that is breaking these rules and willing to learn how to make their published documents better, I hand them this book to read first. Don't try to learn it all at once. Read a couple chapters and master those skills, then read the next couple chapters. This book sits next to my dictionary and MLA Style Guide on my desk for ready reference.</span>

                    <span>I took great care to include two spaces after a period and before starting the next sentence. Williams explains why this in incorrect and why so many of us do it religiously, along with a host of other typographic rules. It's relatively short, the writing is concise and interesting and if you type on a computer you'll use what you learn from this book every day.</span>
