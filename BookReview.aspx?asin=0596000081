                <span id="Label1">Updated to cover version 2.4.x of the Linux kernel, the second edition of <I>Linux Device Drivers</I> remains the best general-purpose, paper-bound guide for programmers wishing to make hardware devices work under the world's most popular open-source operating system. The authors take care to show how to write drivers that are portable--that is, that compile and run under all popular Linux platforms. That, along with the fact that they're careful to explain and illustrate concepts, makes this book very well suited to any programmer familiar with C but not with the hardware-software interface. It's worth noting that the emphasis in the title is on "device drivers" as much as "Linux." This book will make sense to you if you've never written a driver for any platform before. It helps if you have some Linux or Unix background, but even that is secondary as a prerequisite to C skill.<p>  For a programming text--and one concerned with low-level instructions and data structures, at that--this book is remarkably rich in prose. You'll typically want to read this book straight through, more or less skipping the code samples, before sketching out your plan for the driver you need to write. Then, go back and pay closer attention to the sections on specific details you need to implement, like custom task queues. For coding-time details about specific system calls and programming techniques, count on the index to point you to the right passages. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Techniques for writing hardware device drivers that run under Linux kernels 2.0.x through 2.2.x. Sections show how to manage memory, time, interrupts, ports, and other details of the hardware-software interface.</span>

                    <span>[A review of the 3RD EDITION, 2005.]
<br />
<br />Device drivers will always be a small speciality in any operating system. Linux is no exception. While it grows strongly, most programmers using it simply can ignore issues of hooking up to various hardware items. Someone has already worked those out.  Well, here you are that someone and this book addresses many of your needs.
<br />
<br />The coding is in C. No fancy object oriented stuff for you. Many higher level OO programmers are simply unaware of the extra overhead it takes. But you need to maximise performance, so it is C for you. Plus, to understand much of the book, it really helps to have written some assembly code, because it makes it easier to understand many low level operations discussed.
<br />
<br />Prior acquaintance with the overall design of a linux memory manager and interrupt handlers is also good. The book explains well individual issues as they arise. But having a clear, top-down understanding of the linux kernel may give you more context to understand the chapters.</span>

                    <span>I used this book to write a device driver for my computer engineering senior project and found it to be very helpfull, but it could have been better.  Almost everything you'll need to know for 2.4 kernel drivers is in the 2nd edditon.  The organization of the book is more like a text book crossed with a reference book, but parts of the book attempt to be a tutorial.  Maybe the 3rd edition will be better organized.  I noticed lots of negative reviews on Amazon, but after reading some chapters on safari, the oreilly free book site, I decided to purchase it.  If you buy this book and don't have a solid background in operating systems, computer architecture, and microprocessor interfacing you probably won't have an easy time understanding several key topics well enough to successfully write a working driver.  Which will probably lead to you being mad and writing a bad review.</span>

                    <span>I can't understand the 5-star reviews of this book.  I wonder if anyone who gave the book 5 stars ever tried to sit down and actually write a device driver.  I doubt it.<p>The book suffers from two main problems:<p>1. Presentation is disorganized.  The book reads as if the authors sat down and planned out what chapters to cover.  That part is good.  It does NOT seem like they planned further than that.  The text within each chapter seems haphazard.  Disorganized.  Thrown together.  The authors have no concept of when to start a new paragraph, so topics are strung together piecemeal.  The whole book is confusing, making the reading of this book very frustrating.<p>2. The material is presented at a frenetic pace.  As I was reading the book, it felt like there was a conveyor belt feeding me information, getting faster and faster without a break.  The authors feel like they can throw everything but the kitchen sink at you in a very short time.  Information, minute details, big ideas, analogies, and code get thrown at you fast and furious.  It starts at chapter one and just gets worse from there, making the reading of this book downright difficult.<p>Difficult and confusing.  A good characterization of the book.<p>In summary, this book is NOT a tutorial.  It is NOT a guide.  Don't make the mistake of buying this book expecting a gentle (or even a not-so-gentle) introduction to writing device drivers.<p>IMHO, the market is still open for a good book on the subject of writing device drivers for Linux.</span>

                    <span>This book's #1 audience is the Unix device-driver writer who wants to understand how Linux's kernel, interfaces, and data structures work. #2 comes the journeyman software engineer who wants to look "below" the application layer, toward creating more efficient programs.<p>There are clear, *working* examples throughout the book.  Each chapter builds on the previous one.  Complex issues come late in the book, after the reader has had time to build a framework for understanding.</span>

                    <span>Few who have read previous Rubini guides will be in too much doubt as to the merit of this one.  I hadn't understood that the book actually dealt with software systems and hardware before I bought it, but I think it's a little bit harsh to critique the book on this basis, and am happy to give it the full five stars.  I know all I need to know about Linux and devices now.  Meanwhile, if anyone knows where to buy an automated Lino-cutter, I'd be grateful for your thoughts.</span>
