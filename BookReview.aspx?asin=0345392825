                <span id="Label1">At adolescence, says Mary Pipher, "girls become 'female impersonators' who fit their whole selves into small, crowded spaces." Many lose spark, interest, and even IQ points as a "girl-poisoning" society forces a choice between being shunned for staying true to oneself and struggling to stay within a narrow definition of female. Pipher's alarming tales of a generation swamped by pain may be partly informed by her role as a therapist who sees troubled children and teens, but her sketch of a tougher, more menacing world for girls often hits the mark. She offers some prescriptions for changing society and helping girls resist.</span>

                    <span>I'm a father of a 15 year old girl who has been going through some difficult times over the past few months. My daughter was a happy, well adjusted young responsible adult. In six months she changed friends, had trouble fitting in, her grades dropped, started experimenting with risky behavior and was just plan angry. All the time blaming her behavior on me and other adults. Growing up in a different generation, I had no idea what she was going through. My daughters second counselor recommended that I read "Reviving Ophelia". Mary Pipher's book described my daughter to a "T". If you work with adolesent girls or have one in your family, I highly recommend reading this book. I beleive trying to understand what our children are going through in today's society is the first step in helping them get their lives back on track.</span>

                    <span>Mary Pipher has brilliantly documented the typical American adolescent female experience. Her sensitivity, insight and love of adolescent girls is evident in the case studies that accompany topics such as family relations, sexuality, peer abuse, societal pressures,trash media values, anorexia, bulimia, etc. This book has sparked controversy among some because it portrays the adolescent female experience as one which is always wrought with pain and turmoil. This is not intentional. It just so happens that Mary works as a therapist with a population of unhealthy girls. She doesn't see too much of the healthy ones. They don't need her. In spite of this, she does tell some great stories of exceptional girls/young women who showed great courage and inner strength in the face of adversity. As a former psychotherapist who now teaches and coaches high school girls and young girls in basketball, I found the book immensely valuable in understanding behaviors, mood swings and conflicts that I encounter with my players....behaviors that previously made absolutely no sense. Since I was not a teenage girl, it is hard to understand what is going in the mind and heart of a teenage girl when on the outside, everything is seemingly OK. Better than anyone I have ever seen, Pipher takes you deep into the mind and heart of adolescent girls and explains what is going on. Her approach to therapy is also worth noting. Whereas lots of helping professionals spend lots of time trying to label a problem, Pipher immediately attacks a problem or dilemma by focusing on positive steps toward renewal or success. It is a strategy worth noting because it gives troubled girls an immediate positive perspective. If you love working with adolescent girls as much as I do or need to better understand adolescent girls as a parent or as a professional, this is a book that will give you tremendous insight.</span>

                    <span>As the title says, Reviving Ophelia does make some very good points (such as how the media feeds girls false images of beauty), but my biggest problem was how the book acted as if all girls become total headcases once they hit 13. I'll admit that my teen years were far from pretty, but you got to give girls a little more credit than that.</span>

                    <span>When I first read this book five years ago, my daughter was only eleven, on the brink of the age that author Pipher addresses here. At the time, the book was recommended in a circle of mothers as a must-read. Now I am revisiting it as the mother of a sixteen-year old daughter, and I find it just as relevant than I did on first reading. Sure life has changed from its first publication a decade ago, but the stresses of growing up and dealing with the cattiness of adolescent girls is both timeless and universal. Girls hurt - and hurt themselves - in different ways than boys. <P>Pipher does an excellent job demonstrating her points through case studies she has personally encountered during her career as a professional psychologist. By seeing how Pipher helped these troubled girls overcome with their lack of self-esteem and coping mechanisms, parents are given the tools to help their own daughters, hopefully before the problems become too large to be dealt with at home. The warning signs of depression, drug use, sexual activity, eating disorders, and more are outlined within the text, exposing the varied symptoms that take into account the individuality of each girl. The biggest lesson parents should take away from this book is this: these disorders and behaviors can happen to any family, to any child, even the most seemingly obedient and happy. Every girl, no matter how successful socially or academically, suffers during this transition period between childhood and womanhood. The question is always this: How much? <P>I advise parents to read this book before your child enters adolescence so you will be better prepared for this turbulent time. However, if you already have a troubled teen, it's not too late. This book is not a substitute for much needed therapy for the most extreme cases, but it offers parents the comfort of knowing that both they and their daughter are not alone in their struggles.</span>

                    <span>With the pressures to be like their pop idols, girls are more focused now on measuring up to external images, rather than going inside themselves, and honoring who they are meant to be.<P>Girls also struggle more now with opposing messages such as, "Be beautiful," versus, "Beauty is only skin-deep." <P>Other messages include, "Be smart, but not so smart;" and, "Be honest, but don't hurt anyone's feelings."<P>And they are taught "Not pleasing others is social suicide."<P>So, with more opportunities available to girls, today, thanks to our foremothers, many teen girls reject their authentic selves, and choose instead to play a role that keeps them lost in the images of their icons.<P>This is a great book, because dr. Pipher includes society input, mother/daughter dynamics, and other elements into explaining what is going on with today's "Ophelias."<P>And with the lessons in this book, we have the chance to influence girls to own their authentic selves, allowing others to be responsible for their own needs.<P>This book deserves to be read alongside "My Mother/Myself," by Nancy Friday, "Fear of Flying, by Erica Jong, and "Don't Play in the Sun," by Marita Golden.</span>
