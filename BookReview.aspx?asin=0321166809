                <span id="Label1"><HTML>As a designer himself, author <B>Jeffrey Bardzell</B> is keenly aware of the dilemma you're faced with today: With clients and users demanding more than the static, HTML pages that defined first-generation Web sites, you have no choice but to migrate to <I>dynamic,</I> service based sites. But that means a world of programming, servers, databases, and configuration options you know little about. Not to worry: <B>Dynamic Macromedia Dreamweaver MX: Advanced Training from the Source</B> has you covered. <P>Through the graphics-intensive, self-paced tutorials that form the heart of this popular series, Bardzell takes you through everything you need to know to start designing dynamic, database-driven sites using the powerful new tools available in Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. And unlike other books, this one assumes no prior knowledge of programming or database concepts, terms, and techniques. If you've ever created static HTML pages, you'll be able to dive right in with tutorials that cover configuration options, programming basics, Macromedia Dreamweaver MX's server behaviors, and connecting to databases-all in the context of overhauling a static HTML site into a dynamic, <I>maintainable</I> business application, with code you can use in your own projects!  </HTML></span>

                    <span>My first introduction to this series of books was when I took a Macromedia Director class for a "certified instructor". At first, I was disappointed in the fact that I would actually pay someone to go step by step through a book. In the end, I wasn't disappointed at all.<P>Typical to Macromedia Press, this book is meant as a walk-thru tutorial covering many of the features you need to get up and running. User Authentication, forms, Post, Cookies, etc. are all well explained and can be applied immediately to your own web applications - and all the code works!! No troubleshooting is necessary.<P>Although the book is designed to be a complete "course", it is a great reference and has the ability to use all the content or just 1 or 2 chapters. This book is a MUST if you are new to dynamic websites!!</span>

                    <span>From my experience with other "Training from the source" books put out by Macromedia Press, I had some high expectations for this book. It did not disappoint!<P>The author takes you through upgrading a fictional news site from standard HTML to an XHTML Dyanmic website. The two server languages that are used in this book are ASP and Coldfusion. For each sample of code in the book, the author provides you with BOTH code examples. Very nice!<P>I consider myself an intermediate level web designer, with a little knowledge on ASP and Coldfusion. This book has definitely help me understand why Dyanmic sites are going to replace standard HTML code. Although it is not bogged down with serious coding, it covers the most commonly used dyanmic procedures. <P>I do recommmend buying the regular Dreamweaver MX "Training from the source" book first if you are a beginner. Overall, this book is worth every penny!</span>

                    <span>Excellent book. I have taken advantage of these reviews for years now, I love Amazon for this feature. It is time for me to finally give back to you all.<P>I had a little html and asp, but I wanted to learn the best practices and techniques of ASP quickly. I needed it yesterday like always. This book allowed me to utilize Dreamweaver to its fullest and also create my own asp code to access my SQL Server 2000 data. I even implemented some of their page ideas into my site to save some time. The order that they teach the different skills is perfect, they build on each other and make it very simple and fun to do (that isnt easy with asp). I now use asp in all my pages on my site. I wish they had one of these for ASP.NET for my next step. The only complaint would be that it is a short book, but well worth it. This is a great beginner and intermediate book.</span>

                    <span>Great book. I've struggled through explanations of Dreamweaver asp pages and database interactions in a number of books and was never satisfied with what I was learning. I always felt they were making it overly complex. Now, after working through this book, I feel justified. They were making it overly complex ... and Bardzell makes it easy.</span>

                    <span>Jefferey Bardzell has done a masterful job of teaching how to use Dreamweaver, ASP and Microsoft Access to create truly interactive web sites. His presentation is very clear and the detailed examples are perfect. If you follow the book you will build a real world web site using most of the techniques you would ever need to build dynamic web applications. It covers communication between html pages and accessing databases on-line. He deliberately takes you through both hand-coding and using Dreamweaver.<BR>The editing and accuracy in this book is superb. For the one place where I encountered a problem there was a work around on the book's web site. This book is the real thing and definitely worth the money.<BR>To get the most out of this book, the reader should have some programming experience to fully appreciate the hand-coding examples. It is definitely not a book to start learning Dreamweaver.</span>
