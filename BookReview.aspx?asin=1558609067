                <span id="Label1">Web services are leading to the use of more packaged software either as an internal service or an external service available over the Internet. These services, which will be connected together to create the information technology systems of the future, will require less custom software in our organizations and more creativity in the connections between the services. This book begins with a high-level example of how an average person in an organization might interact with a service-oriented architecture. As the book progresses, more technical detail is added in a "peeling of the onion" approach. The leadership opportunities within these developing service-oriented architectures are also explained. At the end of the book there is a compendium or "pocket library" for software technology related to service-oriented architectures.<br><br>&#183; Only web services book to cover both data management and software engineering perspectives, excellent resource for ALL members of IT teams<br>&#183; Jargon free, highly illustrated, with introduction that anyone can read that then leads into increasing technical detail<br>&#183; Provides a set of leadership principles and suggested application for using this technology.</span>

                    <span>As a fellow author of a book targeted at managers, I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of their needs. Doug has done an admirable job of meeting these needs for Web services. This is a book for managers that want to have sucessful Web services projects.<P>Doug starts by motivating the need for Web services with a utopian view of a near future business trip. Then he gives a thorough account of Web services technology basics at a level that even managers whose technical days are long in the past can understand. He ties this account back to the utopian business trip, showing how Web services overcome the technical obstacles to making it a reality.<P>This book really shines in its extensive treatment of how managers can make their Web services projects successful. As a technologist, I have a tendency to underestimate the impact of "soft" project management issues, but Doug has not made this mistake. His years of experience clearly show through in his thoughtful and comprehensive treament of the forces pushing managers to use Web services, the potential obstacles to project completion, and how to overcome them.</span>

                    <span>Frankly, I feel that some reviewers misunderstand the purpose of this book. In my opinion, for the right person, this book is a gem! Any of us who have had the challenge of explaining new and difficult concepts to managers who left technology back in the COBOL days or never were technologists should be grateful. <P>As technologists, we forget just how much intimidating jargon we use and how many underlying assumptions we make when we explain things. As a software architect once said to me, "if I had more time, I'd make it simple." Clearly Barry has taken on the challenge of making it simple, and such efforts are incredibly valuable.</span>

                    <span>Throughout the book the author discusses on the same stuff repeatedly.....as multiple parts and chapters. It is a collection of Web services articles narrates the same story of how Web services technology will impact their business strategies and organization. The author written this book exploding a business article and explored his own meaning of Web services oriented architecture.<P>I am bit disappointed after reading the book as the contents does not make a case for a manager..... why you would ever build or use web services, what are its benefits and known issues of Web services, etc. Nevertheless, if you are looking for answers what web services really are (e.g. when to use them, etc.), this book doesn't provide those answers. Think twice before you buy...you may save your money.</span>

                    <span>This is management style book. It talks about all of the good things about web services. Yet it makes several crucial mistakes that clearly show that the author is by no means aware of what a service oriented architecture must provide. The crucial points that lead to failures using distributed architectures in the grand scale are not discussed. The whole problem is seen totally as a management issue. It is not. It is a vital technical challenge, and web services are by no means ready to take that challenge. Problems like transactions, security, undoability, Quality of service etc are not even slightly solved today. The savvy managers should read the book, give it to a savvy software architect, and afterwards discuss very carefully. Another annoying feature is that the author sees technical people as the ones being the greatest opposition to service oriented architectures. They can be, but the real problem are business managers and departments who do not want to be service providers in the first place because it means giving up some of their power and probably loose some of their workforce.</span>

                    <span>This book is exceptionally well done! I've written 3 books on Web development and I've written a number of articles on Web Services. I've also done a number of presentations on the subject at users groups around the country. I thought I understood the power and future of Web services, but Barry helped me understand the service-oriented architecture and how this what I really saw the promise in. Barry did an incredible job of bringing this topic all together. I found the book tremendously inspiring too! You won't be disappointed by the content in this book. You'll likely come away with 100 ideas too! Great job Barry!!! I can't wait to read your next book!!!<P>Brad</span>
