                <span id="Label1">The bestselling book announcing the arrival of the Net Generation--those kids who are growing up digital--now in paperback. Heraled by Library Journal as one of the Best Business Books of 1997, Growing Up Digital tells how the N-Generation is learning to communicate, work, shop and play in profoundly new ways--and what implications this has for the world and business.  <P> Growing Up Digital offers an overview of the N-Generation, the generation of children who in the year 2000 will be between the ages of two and twenty-two. This group is a "tsunami" that will force changes in communications, retailing, branding, advertising, education, etc. Tapscott commends that the N-Generation are becoming so technologically proficient that they will "lap" their parents and leave them behind.  <P> The book also demonstrates the common characteristics of the N-Generation: <br> acceptance of diversity, because the Net doesn't distinguish between racial or gender identities, curiosity about exploring and discovering new worlds over the Internet and assertiveness and self-reliance, which result when these kids realize they know more about technology than the adults around them.</span>

                    <span>This book will definitely appeal to young people.  The author creates the term 'N-Generation' obstensibly because Generation-Y was owned by another author.  The book creates a super youth culture that is underappreciated and misunderstood.  If you want to write a book that will appeal to young people and get a good rating on the college campus ... just trash the previous generation and the youth will scramble on board the turnip cart.  This book does a disservice to youth and to the previous generation by promoting stereotypes, underscoring obscure opinions, and understating the contributions made by the Boomers.  <br>The author should keep in mind that the N-geners didn't create computers and for the most part, they are clueless when it comes to coding.  They do not qualify as experts ... not by a long shot.  To encourage youth today to believe that they are experts in computers ... and the people who designed them are not ... is setting them up for real disappointment.<br>The author's opinions on TV and media are also absurd.  He creates a model in which the state of everything that is not N-Gen is fixed and unchanging ... while the opposite is true for his heroes.  Perhaps the most convincing argument that can be made against this author's opinions is that a good deal of his computer-based examples are already 'off-the-air'.  Moreover, his characterization of the pre-web media era as being fearful of the new technology is way off base ... and today's integration of technologies is proof of this.<br>The book was written to promote sales rather than good, usable, and thoughtful ideas.  Young people will adore this author ... not because he makes a good case ... but because he writes what they want to hear ... and makes them feel the way they want to feel ... like heroes.</span>

The author gives a look into the trends, ways, and lives of the N-Gen that is intriguing. Being one of this generation, it is like looking into my past and recalling my childhood.</span>

                    <span>Maybe my expectations were too high based on the reviews.  I found most of the information in this book to be news items. Also, anyone that follows technology in the news will not find much insight into this book.  The book is an overview of how the younger generation uses technology in their social lives, play and work.  If you are not very familiar with the internet and don't watch the news this book would be worthwhile.  However, anyone who uses the internet and keeps up on the news won't get much out of it.</span>

                    <span>Tapscott's compelling book provides us with an elucidating glimpse and revelation as to how the Net Generation's facility with the digital media is changing human interactions and impacting our future, with specific reference to education, business, economics, politics, and even parenting. These "bathed in bits" children, those between 2 and 22 in 2000, are characterized as tolerant of diversity, self-confident, curious, assertive, self-reliant, contrarian, flexible, and highly intelligent. These characteristics are a necessary consequence of their generation's exposure to the Net. The Net's structure has allowed for a more fluid interchange of information and interactive type of communication. In cyberspace, there are no hierarchies and the readily available access to information has created in its young netizens the quest to search for and be critical of information. This new information model is a digression and radical shift from the industrial, broadcast model that is top-down, linear, centralized, and passive. The new model is the antithesis of this broadcast model because it is interactive, distributed, and malleable. <p>"For the first time in history youth are an authority on an innovation central to society's development" (Preface, ix). Our children know a lot more than we do in terms of technology. According to Tapscott, this situation has created not just a generation gap, but a generation lap, akin to race track leads measured in terms of gaps that consequently metaphorically heightens the stark contrast of technological knowledge between children and parents. Because these children are born with technology, they assimilate them, rather than accommodate them, which is what adults do to cope with technological advances that often produces cognitive friction for them.<p>Whatever our station in life is or whatever role we play now, the N-Geners have serious implications for us. Tapscott mentions that they are "learning, developing, and thriving in the digital world. They need better tools, better access, more services, and more freedom to explore, not the opposite" (p. 7). Here lie the implications and challenges for us. For instance, in the workplace, these youngsters will function better in a decentralized, independent, collaborative, and innovative environment. In the educational arena, our old and outdated paradigms of teaching and learning need to change because these methodologies do not address the need of these people for more interactive and non-linear approaches to learning.<p>As a force of unprecedented social transformation, we can learn from the experiences of these N-Geners, and listen to their needs and concerns, if we are to proactively shape the technologically driven future we all will be heading to. Tapscott admonishes us by saying that the future is not something that is predicted, but is rather a goal to be achieved. In our hands as educators, parents, business people, politicians... lies the future. Will we choose to be prepared? Will we heed the "Call of the N-Geners"?</span>
