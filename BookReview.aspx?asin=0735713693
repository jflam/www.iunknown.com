                <span id="Label1">There are a couple of possible approaches to the problem of how to have fun and do useful work with your personal computer. One is to figure out what you need to know (program in Perl, use Microsoft Excel, whatever) and then set about teaching yourself how to do it. The other approach is more holistic, and involves attempting to absorb the diverse knowledge of a chosen guru. <I>Leo Laporte's 2004 Technology Almanac</I> fits the latter approach. It covers a broad spectrum of general-interest computing subjects, and is suited to a competent and curious, but not expert, reader who appreciates a pointer or two as he or she learns how to be a power user.<p>  As an almanac, this book organizes itself around calendar year 2004--there's one page for each day of the year. Each page makes fun reading, typically focusing on some aspect of configuring an operating system (Windows XP, Mac OS, and occasionally Linux), a piece of software, or a set of related Web sites. The nuggets of knowledge--contributed by people from Laporte's "Screen Savers" television program--make you want to try out whatever they're describing, so be prepared to install software and do some surfing! <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: General interest computing for people who are comfortable with their machines and want to become competent enough to teach others. Coverage ranges from adjusting Windows XP's behavior to your liking, to extending PDA battery life, to using the Web to find friends.</span>

                    <span>I read this book because I enjoyed Mr. Laporte's show. I must say this book is nothing like the show. It did not help me use the computer. Instead it tells people how Mr. Laporte feels a computer should be used. I emailed Mr. Laporte to ask for help ,but he has not answered to this day.</span>

                    <span>A book I'm having fun reading this year is Leo Laporte's 2004 Technology Almanac. This is one of those books you may not get something from every day, but on many occasions you'll find a gem that will make your life a lot easier. There's a page for each day of the year, and each month covers a different area of technology. Those areas are Make Your Computer New For The New Year; Games And Entertainment; Stay Safe Online; Manage Your Life Online; Merry Month Of May; Weird And Wonderful World Wide Web; Family Photography; Work At The Beach; Back To School; Control Your Email, Battle Spam; Troubleshooting; Leftovers; and Index. And in case you're wondering, the tips include both Mac and PC...<P>For instance, on January 3rd the coverage is on must-have system diagnostic tools. The four tools they feature are PC Pitstop, SiSoftware Sandra, WCPUID, and Motherboard Monitor. I was unaware of any of these package, and the SiSoftware Sandra package would help me clean up some things on my machine. If I had been looking for something like this, I might have been able to find it. But having a gem drop onto your path makes each day's reading something to look forward to. Heavy-duty geeks might think too much of this is "I already know that" material, but for average users and developers like myself, it's nearly as fun as a Dilbert calendar (and more useful to boot).</span>

                    <span>In response to the folks that have bombed this book. You are missing the point of the book and don't understand Leo's appeal. Leo, and his book, aren't for the Geeks or the Web savvy, both are for everyone else. Leo's whole career is about being inclusive of people that need help understanding the world of computers. This is a great book for those that need:<P>a. A hard copy reference. There are many of us out there that still prefer to read from paper.<P>b. A more direct source for useful information. Many people don't have the skills or the patience to search all over the internet for what they need.<P>c. An easy to read and understand writing style.<P>Buy this book for Mom and Dad, family members who need some technical help, or anyone that is more interested in learning to use a computer as tool rather than making the computer their life.</span>

                    <span>If you've ever seen "The Screen Savers" on TechTV, then you're probably familiar with the type of content offered in this very interesting book. If you don't have TechTV, then let me explain. The TV show "The Screen Savers" discusses various tips, tricks, and tools for improving your computing experience. This book is really just a collection of some of the best tips and tricks, which has been put into a tip of the day format.<P>Some of the tips you might expect include what you should look for in a DVD player, information about the CD-ROM burning tool "Alcohol 120%", and where you can get star charts for your PDA. While "The Screen Savers" always has something interesting to discuss, what makes this book great is that it's all written down. Rather than hearing about something cool on TV and forgetting about it a few minutes later, you can refer back to something you read earlier.<P>This was a surprisingly interesting and useful book. It was very entertaining to read and I was able to even use some of the tips! While it's definitely not a reference book, it is a fun book to have alongside the computer.</span>
