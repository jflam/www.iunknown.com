                <span id="Label1">Despite their myriad manifestations and different targets, nearly all attacks on computer systems have one fundamental cause: the code used to run far too many systems today is not secure. Flaws in its design, implementation, testing, and operations allow attackers all-too-easy access.  <i>Secure Coding</i>, by Mark G. Graff and Ken vanWyk, looks at the problem of bad code in a new way. Packed with advice based on the authors' decades of experience in the computer security field, this concise and highly readable book explains why so much code today is filled with vulnerabilities, and tells readers what they must do to avoid writing code that can be exploited by attackers.  Beyond the technical, <i>Secure Coding</i>  sheds new light on the economic, psychological, and sheer practical reasons why security vulnerabilities are so ubiquitous today. It presents a new way of thinking about these vulnerabilities and ways that developers can compensate for the factors that have produced such unsecured software in the past. It issues a challenge to all those concerned about computer security to finally make a commitment to building code the right way.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book that should be read by all software developers, script writers, system administrators, application designers, and system maintainers.  The book is short, to-the-point, and hits the important points as well as giving numerous real-world examples. It is easy to read, and not dependent on any specific software life cycle model or methodology--though it brings home the point that if you aren't following such a process, you'd do well to implement one.  This is a must-read and must-refer-to book that no organization that uses customized software or develops software in-house should be<br>without.</span>

                    <span>In the movie Seabiscuit, the titular racehorse doesn't appear on screen until almost an hour into the movie. Nevertheless, the wait is worth it, and the movie was a blockbuster. While no one would confuse this uplifting Depression-era tale with a book on computer code, Secure Coding shares a basic similarity with Seabiscuit: The former doesn't trot out its subject--an actual piece of software code--until page 76, and the result is outstanding nonetheless. <p>The similarity ends there. While moviegoers eagerly awaited Seabiscuit's appearance, security professionals might well dread the first appearance of code. Refreshingly, the book contains only seven pages of software code. <p>Similarly themed books spend most of their time in the nitty-gritty of actual code. This one is a horse of a different color, dealing with what needs to be done before the first line of software code is actually written. With the goal of helping developers create applications that are resilient against attacks, the authors develop the book around three categories of software development: architecture and design, implementation, and operations. <p>Above and beyond technical aspects of software development, the authors describe how serious security vulnerabilities leak into the software-development process. These include ignorance, psychological issues, and the short time spans allotted to the development process. <p>This book is a sure bet to help developers and project managers create secure software applications without bogging down in specific code.</span>

                    <span>In the 11th century, Moses Maimonides taught us that the highest form of charity is to teach a man to fish. If you give him a fish, he can eat today. If you teach him to fish he can eat forever.<p>In the same way, Mark G. Graff and Kenneth R. van Wyk have provided an excellent book that gives us a framework for thinking about security rather than trying to give specific rules that might have been invalid before the book came off the press. "Secure Coding" gives the reader the ability to envision, architect, design, code, and implement a security framework that truly meets the needs of its stakeholders.<p>The authors don't provide a cookbook. In their own words: "When you picked up this book, perhaps you thought that we could provide certain security? Sadly, no one can."<p>Instead, they deliver a robust mental model and a framework to understand security and to architect, design, develop, and operate secure systems. They present best practices in the field of security, the reasons for using them, and suggestions on deciding which practices are appropriate in your particular case.<p>Their approach is to realize that the objective is not to make a system totally secure, but to make it just secure enough. Deciding what is "just secure enough" is a business and not a technical decision. It is based on weighing risk versus cost.<p>There are substantial references throughout the book as well as an appendix of resources. The book is filled with examples of security failures and, more importantly, an excellent post mortem on each to show what could have been done to avoid the problem. The authors are extremely familiar with UNIX environments and this comes through in the examples. However, you don't need to be a UNIX guru to glean valuable lessons from the examples.<p>One key message is that security is not something you can bolt onto an application. You must take a holistic approach to the overall system in which the application is being used. It's worth noting that many secure applications become extremely insecure because of the system environment (including networks) in which they exist.<p>A second key message is that, while you can retrofit a insecure application, it is far easier and far less costly to incorporate security as an integral part of the entire development life-cycle including requirements, architecture, and design. The security architecture and design must be well-documented so that future maintenance does not inadvertently introduce gaping security holes.<p>The book is primarily intended for those who architect, design, and code secure applications. However, I believe that it is a must read for those who manage and those who implement secure applications and systems.</span>

                    <span>Some of the reviewers here are missing the point of this book. It's not a "secure code cookbook" in that it doesn't give specific code examples. Such things are quickly obsolete anyway.<p>This book teaches you how to *think* about security, how to think about and *design* code that will be secure. It isn't a "add this snippit of code to your input buffer validation function" sort of book. There are many of these books, and they're useful in their place, but this book writes about the design of secure code, not the actual specifics.<p>To continue the cooking analogy, this is a book on how to write receipes, not a book *of* receipes.<p>Disclaimer, I helped review this book - and I think it's the sort of work that has been sorely missing in the field (I was also given a free copy for doing the review work).<p>Jeremy Allison,<br>Samba Team.</span>
