                <span id="Label1">Praise for Scott Meyers' first book, Effective C++: "I heartily recommend Effective C++, to anyone who aspires to mastery of C++ at the intermediate level or above." -- The C/C++ User's Journal   <P>From the author of the indispensable Effective C++, here are 35 new ways to improve your programs and designs. Drawing on years of experience, Meyers explains how to write software that is more effective: more efficient, more robust, more consistent, more portable, and more reusable. In short, how to write C++ software that's just plain better.   <P>More Effective C++ includes:  <P>Proven methods for improving program efficiency, including incisive examinations of the time/space costs of C++ language features  <P>Comprehensive descriptions of advanced techniques used by C++ experts, including placement new, virtual constructors, smart pointers, reference counting, proxy classes, and double-dispatching  <P>Examples of the profound impact of exception handling on the structure and behavior of C++ classes and functions  <P>Practical treatments of new language features, including bool, mutable, explicit, namespaces, member templates, the Standard Template Library, and more. If your compilers don't yet support these features, Meyers shows you how to get the job done without them.  <P>More Effective C++ is filled with pragmatic, down-to-earth advice you'll use every day. Like Effective C++ before it, More Effective C++ is essential reading for anyone working with C++.</span>

                    <span>Just as well written as the original Effective C++, More Effective C++ contains a fine collection of C++ techniques.  It is quite a bit more advanced than the original so it will be most useful to software architectures and hardcore C++ developers.
<br />
<br />The items on efficiency are excellent and many of them apply to languages other than C++.  His discussion on requiring heap-based objects for objects that "delete this" is thought provoking.  I actually ran into a related bug soon after reading the item.
<br />
<br />Like usual, Meyers does an excellent job of building each item from the ground up.  This is particularly true in the item on Reference Counting, where he keeps the String class example as simple as possible until more details are needed.
<br />
<br />Anyone who has a solid grasp on C++ and wants to bring their skills to the next level should check out this book.

                    <span>I didn't expect this to be as good as the first book since we can assume the best 50 ideas went into the original, but I still found it to be useful.  What I like about both books is that the ideas are enumerated so that I can easily find them again.  There are lots of books with good ideas that I can never find again because I discovered them in some obscure chapter that I can't identify anymore.</span>

                    <span>While not as relevant as "Effective C++", this book has enough to offer to warrent it as a must have, especially in the later half of the book. Im not saying that the first halfs points are not relevant, but I myself found the topics in the Efficency, Techniques, and Misc. sections to be very good. This book is a definite must have for any Advanced C++ developer.</span>

                    <span>I find Scott's books to be very easy to read and also very insightful as well.  If you like reading about programming and C++ then you'll enjoy his writing style and topic selection.  Many of the code examples are a bit too simplistic and underdeveloped but they otherwise convey the message author intends.  I've read all three of his books and found this one to be the best one.  Although 50 tips may seem like a lot more than the 35 offered in this one, I believe you'll find this one to be more useful.</span>

                    <span>I don't know why most people adulate this book and even its predecessor. I read both this book - More Effective - and Effective C++. Ninety percent of the materials in this book can be found in Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language. This book is like a summary of Stroustrup's aforementioned book. After reading this book, I gained no new insights on C++ programming. If you really want a good C++ book, read Modern C++ Design and Exceptional C++. Don't waste your money on this Effective C++ crap. It's unoriginal and overrated. I wish that I can give this book zero stars.</span>
