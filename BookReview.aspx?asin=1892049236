                    <span>Ira Berkow did a great job writing about Hank Greenberg's life. He has written several books on sport figures. Because of his career as a sport writer and book reviewer I feel he did a nice job with interviewing people and getting information about Hank Greenberg. The book takes a great look at Hank Greenberg life with all his accomplishments. Not only should it be read by every Tiger fan but also every baseball fans in general. Although he missed time through injuries, military service, and early retirement, Greenberg still ranks as one of the most fearsome sluggers in baseball history. The powerful right-hander played only the equivalent of nine and a half seasons, yet produced outstanding career totals as well as exceptional season marks. A native New Yorker, Greenberg was the son of Rumanian born Jewish immigrants who owned a successful cloth shrinking plant. Hank graduated from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, the attended New York University on an athletic scholarship for one semester before beginning his professional baseball career. The 6'4 215 lb. Greenberg's athletic success stemmed from size, strength, and hard work, more than native talent. His high school coach explained: "Hank was so big for his age and so awkward that he became painfully self conscious. The fear of being made to look foolish drove him to practice constantly and, as a result, to overcome his handicaps." Greenberg also took a lot of cruel comments about his religion which made him even a stronger person. He played for the majors from 1933 - 1947 first with the Detroit Tigers and one year with Pittsburgh Pirates. One of the most important decision he had to make was whether to play on a Jewish holiday. He choose not to and that was a very important statement about his heritage. Hank Greenberg retired in 1947 and becomes a smart business man and an excellent Farm Director for the Indians. I feel Hank Greenberg was a success in many things in his life, a truly one of a kind man and a book everyone should read. I applaud Ira Berkow for his commitment to the book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great look at Hank Greenberg. It should be required reading for every Tiger fan and baseball fans in general. In addition to providing a look at the life of Hank Greenberg, along the way it chronicles the great Tiger teams of the thirties and forties. However this is more than just a baseball book. Hank discusses his career as a ballplayer/GM/Owner, the challenges of being the first Jewish superstar baseball player, and his decision to give four and a half years of his career to the military. Hank dictated the bulk of this book while sitting by his pool in his final years. Ira Berkow took the tapes, wove in some interviews with friends/family/teammates, and added some old newspaper accounts to create this wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ. AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE LIFE OF ONE OF GREAT PLAYERS THE GAME HAS SEEN. MR. GREENBERG PUT UP WITH A LOT OF ABUSE AND RIDICULE. BUT HE HANDELED IT WITH AUTHORITY AND GAINED DIGNITY. HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE SIMILARITIES THAT HE AND JACKIE ROBINSON FACED IS VERY INTRIGING. HIS TELLING OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH BILL VEECK IS ALSO WELL TOLD AND FASCINATING.<BR>A SMART BUSINESS MAN AND AN EXCELLENT FARM DIRECTOR FOR THE INDIANS SHOW THAT HANK WAS A SUCCESS IN MANY THINGS IN LIFE.<BR>A TRULY ONE OF A KIND MAN AND BOOK.<BR>A MUST READ FOR ANYONE.</span>
