                    <span>There may be more recent books focused on wine or beer, but this is the most comprehensive guide to alcoholic beverages in general. Tired of listening to a couple of colleagues discussing a subject that I knew nothing about, I read this fascinating book, and soon turned the tables: until I showed them evidence, they simply would not believe that Amaretto was made made from apricot pits rather than almonds! Many other products, like Spanish sherry, have interesting details and histories that I had never suspected. About the organization, roughly one-third is devoted to wines (a chapter per country), one-third to other alcoholic beverages, and one-third to technical advice and appendices on menu-planning, storage, vintages, etc. A highly enjoyable and informative book, very nicely balanced.</span>

                    <span>Meant principally as a textbook, _Grossman's_ is nevertheless imminently readable for fun. If you feel awkward in some social situations because you can't comment intelligently on fine drink, this is a good place to start. You'll come away from the book with a working knowledge of:<P> * world wine regions<P> * legal definitions of various liquor types<P> * liquor, beer and wine production<P> * principles of marketing and purchasing<P> * beverage service<P> * proper glassware<P> * liquor trivia<P> Certainly, this book lacks a contemporary voice. With an original copyright date of 1940, some of the text has remained unaltered for 60 years. It misses trends in recent American beer production, and doesn't give very complete information about emerging wine producers, such as post-Apartheid South Africa. But at its heart, this is a thoroughly objective textbook which has been written and continuously edited specifically to be brand-neutral. This makes it the pre-eminent textbook for use in a general survey course on liquor service, or an invaluable resource for anyone trying to gain a healthy appreciation for alcohol.</span>
