                    <span>Surprisingly, this is an incredible book. I take my MBA at University of Delaware. To apply how to use MS Excel effectively, this is the all-in-one book that can serve me for many classes such as Financial Reporting and Analysis, Data Analysis and Management Control, Financial Management, Marketing Management, Operation Management and Management Science, etc. The book is about intermediate level not too easy or too advance. 
<br />
<br />Before you buy other books in Excel, you should check the content first. 
<br />If the content focus on the function such as how to use date function, do not buy it. The content that you looking for should like this book. For example, the book should show you how you deal with balance sheet. Then, it explaints what Excel function can do for you.</span>

                    <span>This book is very good at showing some very powerful Excel tricks using very practical Finance examples.  I don't think any heavy Spreadsheet user or Finance Professional would regret adding this book to their library.</span>

                    <span>I have BA in Busines administration and now i start a course in accountancy.<br>I bought this book to refresh my knowledge in accountancy and because i use Excel almost for everything.<br>I think that this book is ideal for everyone who want to get an idea of what is accountancy and general business economics. Is very analytical and interpretive so it is understood for everyone who has not any previous experience in Business economics. <br>Although is very interpretive in acoounting - economic theory, I belive that substantial prior experience in Excel is required.<p>I'm not sure but I think that the examples of excel applications sometimes have some wrongs. i.e. The example on text refers to B4 cell, but indeed the information that refer to, are in C4 cell if you look better in a picture.</span>

                    <span>Carlberg puts together a very enlightening book with both high level and detailed information.  Starting with an introduction to each topic, he then gets into progressively detailed explanations and examples.  The beauty of this approach, of course, is that the reader can pursue however much he or she wants to learn about a particular subject.<p>For the "old hands at BA", beware, this is not an all-encompassing tome on the subject.  It is, however, a very good introduction into basic and intermediate analysis of business statistics.</span>
