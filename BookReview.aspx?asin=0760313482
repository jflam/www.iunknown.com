                    <span>Wow! What a wonderful book! David Borher has to be one of the most talented photographers I've seen in a while. The insight he provided on America's Special Forces was not only informative, it was ENTERTAINING. This is a book that everyone should own. People don't know enough about the special forces here in the U.S. In this book, Mr. Borher goes inside the different realms of the special forces of America and does a hell of a job showing us what it's all about! I can only hope he will put together another book in the near future, I know I'll be the first one in line to buy it!</span>

                    <span>To Lucky13, the info is straight from a textbook? What textbook on special forces do you know of? This book IS the textbook. As for your claim of several missing units, the only one missing is delta. <BR> Delta is a very secretive unit, no photos of their operators are allowed, and the unit itself is not publicly acknowleged by the DOD. If you want a book about delta, check out "Weapons of Delta Force" by Fred Pushies. It's got about all the info that there is about the unit. It also has photos of the equipment and gear that delta uses(being used in the photos by SF, Rangers, and SEALs).<BR> "America's Special Forces" is by far the best book available on the subject of US Special Operations units. A true classic.</span>

                    <span>I agree that is an informative book, and I also agree that it has the best photographs of any book on this subject. However, the photos are where I was a bit disappointed. I received the book in the mail and as soon as I saw the cover my heart sank. Having been in the military, the first thing that I noticed was the blank adapters on the weapons of the troops. Now, maybe I was deluding myself, but I was not prepaired for that. After going through the book, it seemed that all of the photos were of various stages of training in the special ops schools. Eventually, this bothered me less because, thinking realistically, how would they get photos of actuall missions and if they did, we would definitely never see them.<P>Overall, I recommend this book. The content is decent and the picutres are brilliant, I just had to prepare readers as picky as I am.</span>

                    <span>The illustrations are great. Nice shots of some of the SOCOM's best known vehicles. However, the information is straight from a textbook. No mention of several "special forces," especially the well know "Delta."</span>
