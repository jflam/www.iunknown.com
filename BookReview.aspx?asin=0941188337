                    <span>I ordered Digital Filmmaking 101 a few days ago. Since then, I live in a well-isolated world where only this book exists. And of course snacks and pops close enough not having to get off the couch. Not only does it give you essential information but keep you entertained through the last page. It's a great pick for your first book about filmmaking just as well as your next one for your shelf. Thoroughly walks you through the development of your movie from picking the perfect script, budget building, recruiting your crew, find locations. Even what business forms you should consider. To pre-production, casting the cast, production and post-production. And finally: distribution. In a nutshell, I can highly recommend this book to anyone with the dream of making their first low-budget digital feature film. It's a must read.<P>Good luck.</span>

                    <span>This is the book I've been looking for. If you are looking to make your first digital feature or short, this is the place to start. After purchasing 15-20 books on shooting film and video, this is the book I wish I had read first.<P>The book describes in plain terms (without being patronizing) what is needed to produce a digital feature. From finding scripts, to casting actors and crew, all the way through to post-production and distribution, this book will guide you all the way. It gives examples of special effects, breaking down your script and creating a shooting schedule, sample actor and location release forms, even inexpensive meal suggestions for feeding your cast and crew during production!<P>Dale Newton and John Gaspard know their craft. They've shot feature films in both film and video formats, and have many essential tips for the low/no budget filmmaker. The book is written with a sense of humor. The authors laugh at some of their mistakes while helping us avoid those same problems.<P>If you are a novice or budding filmmaker but need a little direction to get started, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>this book was both encouraging and discouraging. most of the book was encouraging, in the fact that it made me want to pick up a camera and start making a movie today. The most discouraging parts involving paying taxes, and distribution, was like reality hitting me in the face like a sack of bricks. overall, the book is very true to industry standards.</span>

                    <span>This book is a hoot! Read it before you read anything other than Rebel without a Crew. No other book makes digital filmmaking fun. The section on setting up a filmming spreadsheet alone is worth the price, although you'll love the sections on special effects problemsolving. There are a lot of books about the technical aspects of digital. (Digital Filmmakers handbook, etc.) But this one is about actually making films with the stuff. THIS ONE IS A MUST READ.</span>
