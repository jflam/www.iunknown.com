                    <span>This book is not for anyone who wants to build there own log home. It is clearly written from someone who wants to continually sell log home kits. There is a wonderful book called Home from the Woods that is much better and describes the details of building a log home from an everyday persons perspective.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book if your intention is to be your own general contractor, or even hire a general contractor to build your log home. The author (as noted in many other reviews) shows a bias towards milled kit homes since that's what he sells.<p>Since I am planning to build my own log home from scratch (not using a kit) I found the bias a little annoying, but I still found a few good pieces of advice here and there. If you are planning to build it yourself from scratch I would recommend taking the two-day seminar from loghomebuilders.org instead, or in addition to this book.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book currently available on the subject of log home construction planning. It is well-organized, clearly written, and offers helpful information to anyone who is planning on building a log home. The reason it gets four stars instead of five is that some statements in the book must be read with your thinking cap on...The author is a milled log kit seller, so he shows a subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) bias against handcrafted homes, build-it-yourselfers, and the like. Of course, every salesman believes that his own product is the best- so who can fault him...just take in the book with a "grain of salt" and remember to think for yourself.</span>

                    <span>This is the book you need if you're planning a log home -- I am. Gets right to what you need to be thinking about. Great checkoff lists. Starts right from site selection and property purchase and walks you through choosing a home, paying for it and maintaining it.</span>

                    <span>Just what it says in his description of why he wrote the book. It is NOT for the owner/builder, however it will make you think. After reading this book any subcontractor or supplier will have to earn his money. I now know  what to look for in my future dealings with log home businesses. His  contributions to Log Home Living Magazine are invaluable to owners and  future owners and dreamers.</span>
