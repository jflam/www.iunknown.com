                <span id="Label1"><p><i>Barbarians at the Gate</i> has been called one of the most influential business books of all time -- the definitive account of the largest takeover in Wall Street history. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's gripping account of the frenzy that overtook Wall Street in October and November of 1988 is the story of deal makers and publicity flaks, of strategy meetings and society dinners, of boardrooms and bedrooms -- giving us not only a detailed look at how financial operations at the highest levels are conducted but also a richly textured social history of wealth at the twilight of the Reagan era.</p> <p>Barbarians at the Gate -- a business narrative classic -- is must reading for everyone interested in the way today's world really works.</p></span>

                    <span>This book is one of the best business books out there and you wont waste a penny on it.
<br />The story shows how greed and money can destroy even the wildest of dreams and ambition in the world that we live in.The go go 80's was the time of the big swinging you-know-what believing themselves as the masters of the universe thus inevitably above everything else.
<br />
<br />The story of how a great american company RJR Nabisco loses battle for control of the company by a group a financiers of KKR led by Henry Kravis.The story unfolds from the time Ross Johson,the CEO of RJR Nabisco, decides to take the company private.In doing so he puts the company in play and then the action begins to take place as other huge financial firms with ego as huge as Ross Johnson try to get a piece of the action.In the end there is only one winner and doznes of losers.
<br />
<br />Barbarians at the gate also gives you an insight on the LBO fad and how it works.Those who follow wallstreet in the 80's know that non of this could have happened werent it for the service of Michael Milken and his junk bonds.in any case,it is interesting how the authors who obviously went to great lengths researching and interviewing the players involved and displays the facts in such an entertaining manner you wish you wanted to finish the book in one sitting!!
<br />
<br />The only con i found was the story of how RJR and Nabisco came into existent (the authors stretch this bit too far when they could have done it in 15 pages). nonetheless, it was a great read.
<br />
<br />10 stars for this book!!

                    <span>"Barbarians at the Gate" is, quite simply, a masterpiece.
<br />
<br />The book's "fly on the wall" narrative transports the reader into the hallowed corridors of Wall Street's most prestigious firms, and provides a close-up view on the dealings of its power brokers and financial elite.  It is truly a thrilling experience.
<br />
<br />The cast of characters includes outsized personalities like Henry Kravis, the LBO kingpin; Ross Johnson, the wise-cracking CEO of RJR Nabisco; Peter Cohen, the cigar-smoking chief of Shearson Lehman; and John Gutfreund, the fearsome head of Salomon Bros. 
<br />
<br />My only complaint is that Peter Cohen is portrayed unfairly.  The authors paint him as a buffoon-like figure, unschooled in the ways of Wall Street and easy prey for the wily Henry Kravis.  I find that image of him exceedingly difficult to believe.  After all, this is the same Peter Cohen who won the admiration of Sandy Weill - one of Wall Street's savviest dealmakers - and rose to become his top lieutenant.  That's quite a feat for a man reputed to be an ignoramus.
<br />
<br />At any rate, this is a fabulous book - minor inconsistencies notwithstanding - and its place in the nonfiction business canon is assured.</span>

                    <span>This book deserves all the superlatives it has received.  The layperson gets an idea of how an LBO is structured and the interactions of investment bankers, banks, and lawyers.  As well, the book is a riveting and entertaining read.  The key to the book are the telling details.  At one point for example, the authors note that one of the men at a key phase in the deal wears a ring with a peace symbol.  Without describing the individual any further, the authors imbue him with personality and character.  Even someone uninvolved with business deals will appreciate the intrigue and excitement.</span>

                    <span>To start explaining this book you must understand that the book has been written by two investigative reporters, so it reads like a well written novel. In fact with some of these books you must remind yourself that it is not fiction. <p>The other thing is that the authors emphasize the people and what they think, their motivations, their egos and their vulnerabilities. It is not a financial book. It is more of a novel. When you combine the writing plus with the emphasis on the people you get a best seller - as we have.<p>Here is the situation. The CEO's of some of these corporations get greedy and decide that making millions per year and having a fleet of their own jets - is not enough. They want to borrow money and buy the whole company. That is what we had here. The CEO Ross Johnson proposes a leveraged buy out (LBO) of RJR-Nabisco, which had previously merged.  His idea is to borrow money and buy all the stock. So it is really a story about Ross Johnson and whether or not he could pull of this (theft) purchase from the shareholders by borrowing enough money. He is abetted by bankers and investment people, and they all want a piece of the action and large fees. It is all quite fascinating stuff.<p>But he hits a snag. The prize is too big and draws other people into the fray. <p>Like sharks smelling blood in the water he attracts KKR runs by Henry Kravis - a New York based LBO company. It decides it wants to get involved. The book takes us like a suspense novel through various negotiations and heavy duty meetings in Manhattan until it is finally settled. It makes for a fascinating read.<p>Recently I read another book that I thought was quite different but just excellent. Ross Johnson in the present book RJR-Nabisco was the CEO of a large public company and he became such by working his way up through the ranks. To me a more fascinating book is Losing my Virginity by Richard Branson also at Amazon.com. Branson starts his career by himself selling a magazine as a teenager, starts Virgin Records, takes on and beats back British Airways with Virgin Airways, and does it all with a flair for the dramatic - and often he owns the companies.<p>Jack in Toronto</span>
