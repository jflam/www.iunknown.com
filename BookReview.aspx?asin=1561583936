                    <span>This book has pages of great photos and comprehensive ideas about lay-outs, storage, work areas, break down details on cabinets, counter tops, and all the good things to make a kitchen workable. I read all the details and got great ideas for my very small galley kitchen which most of us have but is not widely featured in this or any books on kitchens! One can always dream, and this book helps even the cramped kitchen owner think of new things for the kitchen.</span>

                    <span>The Kitchen Idea Book is exactly what is claims to be: a book full of ideas for the kitchen. Bouknight writes very little text to accompany the scores of color pictures; but what text there is is concise and helpful. She includes quite a few lay-out designs, gives the pros and cons of various materials and includes a both a short list of further information and a long list of the vendors featured in the book. For the most part, however, she lets the pictures do the work as she leads the reader through the basics of kitchen design and options for cabinets, countertops, floors, appliances, and lighting. Some of the choices and color schemes are very traditional, others less conventional, my favorite of the latter being concrete countertops. <P>For someone remodelling or building a new home, this book is a God-send (Bouknight has given ample information to give even the least secure reader confidence necessary for talking to a designer, contractor or kitchen salesperson), for someone who would like to spruce up an existing kitchen without a complete remodelling job, there are dozens of ideas, and for someone who enjoys interior design, this book will provide hours of entertainment.</span>

                    <span>A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing. Despite what the lead review suggests about "Its sharp photography" - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; "At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs" is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen.</span>

                    <span>THis book really is chock-full of ideas. Hundreds of photographs that provide both inspiration and concrete examples which I take to my contractor, saying "See? Just like this!" Also, lots of clearly-written, useful information that helps you make informed decisions. For example, there is a half-page dedicated to descriptions of various sink materials: one or two paragraphs describing the looks, benefits & drawbacks of stainless steel, enamaled cast iron, enameled steel, ceramic, solid surface, composites, german silver and slate/soapstone. What a terrific book!</span>
