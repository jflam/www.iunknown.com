                    <span>There is a multitude of books in the world, but I would gladly skip them all for this magnificent title.
<br />
<br />If you love the subtler realms of life this is one essential book, together with of course the Tao Te King and some works by Tagore, Gibran and Rumi.

                    <span>I was really excited when I found this book in late 1999, since I loved the Tao Te Ching and Lao-Tzu's simple, beautiful, timeless wisdom.  Finding this slim volume of his allegedly long-suppressed additional sayings was like the icing on the cake for me in my love of Taoist philosophy.  And the first chapters are really nice, with the types of sentiments you expect from the master, like "To embrace all things means first that one holds no anger or resistance toward any idea or thing, living or dead, formed or formless," "If your willingness to give blessings is limited, so also is your ability to receive them," and (my fave) "The ego is a monkey catapulting through the jungle."  As another reviewer pointed out but which I didn't realise at the time, it sure sounds like Lao-Tzu, but it's a bit wordier than most of what he expressed in the Tao Te Ching.  Still, it sounds like his voice regardless of how wordy it is.  Later on it really gets into things like medicine, the names of ancient masters, angelic intercourse, science, the kinds of stuff that didn't appear at all in the Tao Te Ching.  It just wasn't as poetic, though I found the insights into ancient Chinese philosophy and science fascinating.  I also don't like how the text is arranged in this edition.  My edition of the Tao Te Ching is the only Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English one, where it's arranged like a beautiful freeverse poem.  In the Walker edition of the Hua Hu Ching, every line of text is arranged like a line in a book.  It doesn't seem nearly as poetic; would it have hurt to break some of the lines up mid-sentence like Feng and English did?
<br />
<br />Finding out this book is in all likelihood a forgery which was originally designed to create bad blood between both Buddhists and Taoists actually explains a lot.  I probably still would have bought it if I had known, but I wouldn't have been as likely to.  Whoever wrote it, there are some great, beautiful, lovely, poetic insights, but I'll always turn to the Tao Te Ching first when I want some Taoist inspiration.</span>

                    <span>Among other golden insights, this book points to a way of managing sexual energy for a higher end. Having studied sacred sexuality for over a decade, I am amazed at how the author of the thoughts in this book accurately described the fallout from conventional sex. He describes symptoms that modern neuroscience is only now beginning to confirm as it tracks the addictiveness of sex, and the unwelcome effects of overstimulation of the primitive part of the brain. Bravo for Brian Walker for having the foresight to translate and publish this beautiful collection of wisdom.</span>

                    <span>Despite the gleeful denunciations by the polemicists below, this is a fine book for almost anyone interested in the wisdom, if perhaps not the historic interdenominational hijinks of ancient Taoist sects.<p>Master Ni Hua Ching should be applauded for encouraging a contemporary  and accessible rendering of the texts. This is a brilliant distillation that demystifies the often confusingly literal translations that leave the reader to stumble through linguistic indecision. <p>This book offers up the meaning we all want. It's an honest work presented in good spirit that any well-intentioned reader will appreciate. Clearly rendered meaning is  humorously and joyfully presented. <p>Don't miss this treasure.</span>

                    <span>I starting reading this when I got home, and something seemed off. Turns out that they laugh about this book on Taoist discussion boards. Hua Hu Ching was a forgery in the 8th century CE.  The intent was to convert western Chinese Buddhists to Taoism by presenting Lao Tzu as teaching Buddhist thought in China before Buddha's Enlightenment.  The earlier chapters have a rather Buddhist feel, which turns into a "Religious Taoist" feel in the later chapters with discussions on magic, Feng Shui, "angelic" sex, and the need to worship the 64 I Ching hexagrams!<p>It was responsible for some tremendous bad blood between Buddhists and Taoists, and was eventually ordered destroyed by an emperor in the 14th century. Apparently, at least a handful of Taoists believe in it and have kept it alive via oral tradition, and so, Walker, touted as a "Taoist scholar," translates it, apparently unaware of its dubious history, relying solely on Ni Hua-Ching's version of it.<p>The first several chapters are beautiful, insightful, and poetic, though a bit wordy for Lao Tzu. for instance, "Division is contrary to the nature of the Tao. / Foregoing antagonism and separation, one enters into the harmonious oneness of all things." (3) <p>However, after Chapter 50, things go rapidly downhill, I mean falling-off-a-cliff downhill, with bizarre New-Age flavored droppings such as "Because yin and yang are not complete within us as individuals, we pair up to integrate them and bring forth new life./ Although most people spend their  entire lives following this biological impulse, it is only a tiny portion of our beings as well. / If we remain obsessed with seeds and eggs, we are married to the fertile reproductive valley of the Mysterious Mother but not to her immeasurable heart and all-knowing mind." (65) Sounds just like Lao Tzu, right?<p>Or how about this? "In ancient times, various holistic sciences were developed by hightly evolved beings to enable their own evolution and that of others...The student who ignores them hinders the development of all beings." (54)<p>I wish I had researched this one before I bought it.  I'd like to have my money back!  Interested in wisdom from Taoism?  Read the Tao Te Ching, and Chuang Tzu.  Interested in Buddhist scripture? Read the Dhammapada, The Way of the Bodhisattva, and other sutras.  Avoid this junk, which was banned for its dishonesty.</span>
