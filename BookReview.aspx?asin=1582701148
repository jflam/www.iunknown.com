                    <span>I am not surprised by the negative reviews for this book.  Notice how many individuals attack Emoto's integrity and objectivity yet these same critics exhibit such a strong emotional aversion to the book.  After all, I didn't notice any thoughtful rebuttals of his ideas, only sarcasm and mockery.  Does anyone see the hypocrisy in this?  While Emoto's explanations for his observations are certainly not substantiated, we should not dismiss them simply because they lack a mechanistic explanation.  Being that our scientific efforts have shown even the most "rational" thinking to involve the highly emotional centers of the brain (limbic system), I am reluctant to say that there is a purely rational, objective form of thinking.  However, we can still strive, and anyone that dismisses the possible implications of this book is probably doing so for emotional reasons.  What would your mechanistic, reductionist colleagues think of YOU if you were to actually humor Emoto?
<br />
<br />On another philosophical note, I have pondered what might happen if these water crystal-type experiments were subjected to true scientific scrutiny.  I would not be surprised if the correlations presented herein broke down.  Look at it this way: these experiments would essentially attempt to capture intent.  Should the scientific community find out about the details of such experiments, there would be what I will call a "consciousness tug-of-war" between skeptical minds and hopeful minds.  Larry Dossey speaks of nonlocal mind and the ability of our intent to influence others (i.e. distance healing, hexes).  Those with absolutely no expectations would be the only ones who wouldn't exert an influence over the experimental outcomes.  Regrettably, as I perceive it, the skeptical minds would likely prevail as they seem greater in number (at least within the scientific community).  If the public were to find out about such experiments, they might tip the scales in favor of positive outcomes as I think a greater proportion of vitalistic, spiritual people are represented among laypeople...
<br />
<br />What you should gather from this convolted scenario is the fact that certain things are simply too subtle, complex, and nonlinear to be captured/measured/appreciated by scientific study.  Intent may prove to be one of them.  David Hawkins and others who calibrate intent are exceptions to this assertion, although many conventional scientists discredit this calibration method entirely.  What virtually all scientists fail to recognize is that science yields a representation of reality, a model or worldview.  There are alternate worldviews that are arguably as valid.  Many of you have likely heard "The Scientist" by Coldplay, known for its memorable piano arrangement.  If you haven't already, now would be a good time to pay close attention to the lyrics!</span>

                    <span>It's sad what passes for science these days. 
<br />Publishing companies used to pass over crap like this, but thanks to some stupid sheeple out there, this stuff has an audience.

                    <span>The gist of this fascinating book is that water is the "life-blood" that circulates through all biological life on Earth and it should be treated with all the due respect it deserves. When one comes to understand the dynamics of water, it should not be considered a stretch to then see water as life itself and hence, the "Noblest Element". 
<br />
<br />Masaru Emoto has studied water for years using an intriguing method of analyzing various samples of water from the crystals formed when frozen. Pure water forms beautiful prism-like ice-matrices, while polluted water forms distorted, or no ice-matrices at all.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most amazing discovery of Masaru's research is that water demonstrates that it  has sentient qualities by reacting with  healthy or sick responses to various stimuli such as good, loving thoughts or bad, negative thoughts. These same studies were performed on plants with the same results and related in the book, "The Secret Life of Plants" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Both books conclude that ALL life is sentient and dynamic.
<br />
<br />Skeptical or not, one should  find this study of water and ice-crystals to be fascinating and  with the many beautiful photographs of  crystals included, that makes the book worth the time all on it's own. Indeed, there are few other forms of art so profoundly beautiful, whether from Nature or humans, that can compare with the awesome matrices formed by ice-crystals, especially those from pure, un-polluted water.
<br />
<br />In her book, "Taking The Waters: Spirit, Art, Sensuality", Alev Croutier also relates the need for respect of water and humble feelings of gratitude for all that it does for us. This is a perspective and over-view of the history of how humans have been "taking the waters" from drinking, to baths, to health spas and more, and all over the world. Towards the end of this beautiful, colorful book, there is a prophecy of the water story from the Cogui Indians who live in the Columbian Mountains and have decided to break their traditional isolation from the outside world by giving humanity a strong warning about the abuse of water and environment.
<br />
<br />In the Cogui language, the word for water and spirit is the same. [They refer to the act of creation as "water thinking" and all their teachings begin with the question "what is water?" Water is life itself. It thinks, it is alive, and it needs to be fed.]- (p 183). Indeed, considering what water is and does for all life, it needs to be held in high reverence and not abused.
<br />
<br />Masaru Emoto has truly clarified and enhanced what "Love and Gratitude" really means in his beautiful little book!

                    <span>Dr. Emoto is not a scientist, nor does he employ such methods in his " Research "  At best this could be creative photography for junior-high year-book staff, at worst endemic of the break-down of science where charlatans rush wild un-substantiated claims to whore the un-suspecting public's dollars and common sense.  One star for ice, none for integrity, and even less for snake-oil practice.</span>
