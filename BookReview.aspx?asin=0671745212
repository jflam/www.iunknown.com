                    <span>Many books have been written about success and self help, but this book is at the top of the heap. The techniques are very powerful and they do work. The mirror technique is especially powerful. This technique enables one to develop a hypnotic and magnetic personality. The author writes in this book that the methods must not be misused or there will be a rebound of evil. This is no idle warning. I found that Hitler used the mirror technique to develop a hypnotic personality. The mirror method gives one the power to use suggestion to influence other people. This is how Hitler could overtake Germany and people would kill at his command. No doubt Hitler was a master at the mirror technique. This is an incredible book that also shows how to use the powers of visualization to gain great power. Nothing I wrote is an exageration. This book is awesome. I have seen the results for myself. Please heed the authors warning and do not use the book for evil. If you do you do you will surely suffer the consequences. A great, great book.</span>

                    <span>Hello. I'm a 37-year-old Korean and live in south Korea. At first I read this Magic of Believing in 1978. It was translated into Korean. I found it by chance on the desk of my father's. At that time the book did not give any impression to me. But I started to read it seriously in Aug, 1984, when I was in the 3rd year student of Seoul National University of Korea, because I began to worry about my future. Before that I believed in Christian religion, but I couldn't find any answer from that religion. On the contrary this book written by Claude M. Bristol seemed to ansewer perfectly to my question about my future job, girl friend, way of life, millitary service, etc. Since then I have read it sincerly again and again as christian read the Bible, and practiced the rules that the author taught to me. Until now I have read that book more than 100 times as long as about 17 years. I have read English version of that book foreworded by Nido Qubein since about 8 years before. Now this book became a part of my thought, my way of life with the author's another book, TNT- the power within you. Now I can't live without this book. I have achieved many things like my job, career, educational achivement, etc. with my own hard work and these books. I really, really recommend you read and reread this book as Bristol says. Now I want to say my hearty wish. I want to know the personal life of Claude M. Bristol, like his history of life, his family, his career that is not appeared in this book. I want to visit his hometown and see his house. I want to have his biography. And I want to discuss with the people who have the same idea as I have. My e-mail is ohgidu@yahoo.co.kr.<P>Thank you for reading my review even with my poor English.</span>

                    <span>The application of the principles in this book can change you life. I heard about this book through an online egroup I belong to. I found an egroup dedicated to the study of this book and read about a number of people who had read the book and applied the principles. I have seen these principles work in my own life. Ironically, a six figure education is not likely to have given you the real knowledge of self outlined in this and similar books.<P>I recommend reading and applying the principles in this book with the short book "It Works" by RJH and "Power of Your Subconscious Mind" by Joseph Murphy. If you are interested in interacting with others who have applied these principles, do a search on yahoo groups using the title of the books and read some success stories.<P>Try it and see!</span>

                    <span>I don't regret buying this book. It is motivational for sure. I was just dissapointed that it didn't give more details or steps on how to attain such powerful thinking. It is filled with LOTS of stories to prove that positive thinking works. It just doesn't tell you very clearly how to do it yourself.</span>

I've read this book and re-read the key passages several times, because this book helped me get out of a rut and on the fast track to success!<P>My only issue with my copy was that the type size was a little bit hard to read and hard to underline, but this book is great!<BR>- Fabio Marciano www.FabmanSecrets.com</span>
