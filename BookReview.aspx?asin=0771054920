                    <span>A rat is a rat......is a rat. I guess this guy and others like him (see Henry Hill and Sammy the Bull) feel if they can make some money getting average citizens to read about their exploits maybe they can justify (to themselves) their betrayal of their friends and brothers. You'd be wise to save your money and not make these kinds any richer...especially one like this who is short on details when it comes to his association with the Angels. In my opinion he only used their name to help sell the book. Don't bother. Read Sonny's instead.</span>

                    <span>Not a very good or entertaining book.  More of a ramblimg egomaniac's diary.  The book did not contain much detail on the events and jumped around way too much.  He tries to make himself into a heavy and when it got hot he turned.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book would give a better insight into the world of the HA, but I came away disappointed.  Quesnel's story is interesting and controversial, but I don't think his story reveals enough details.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book yesterday.  It's a great book, not much detail in regards to the angels, it's just a biography on one of it's members.  Good story, very easy read.</span>
