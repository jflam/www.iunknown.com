                <span id="Label1">For a knock-out combination of timeless entertainment and vintage studio history, you can't do much better than <I>The Warner Brothers Gangsters Collection</I>. In the 1930s and '40s, Paramount specialized in glossy comedies, MGM popularized lavish musicals, Universal produced signature horror classics, and Fox scored hits with sophisticated dramas. But it was Warner Bros. that generated controversy--if not always box-office profits--with so-called "social problem" films, and that meant gangsters. When viewed in their pre- and post-Prohibition context and in chronological order (<I>Little Caesar</I> and <I>The Public Enemy</I>, 1931; <I>The Petrified Forest</I>, 1936; <I>Angels With Dirty Faces</I>, 1938; <I>The Roaring Twenties</I>, 1939; <I>White Heat</I>, 1949), these six films definitively capture Warners' domination of the mobster genre, and to varying degrees, they all qualify as classics.<p>  With its stilted visuals and pulpy plot, <I>Little Caesar</I> remains stuck in the stiff, early-sound era, but it's still a prototypical powerhouse, with Edward G. Robinson's titular "Rico" setting the stage for all screen gangsters to follow. <I>The Public Enemy</I> made James Cagney a star (who can forget him smashing a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face?), and Humphrey Bogart repeats his Broadway success in <I>The Petrified Forest</I>, a stagy adaptation of Robert Sherwood's play, still enjoyable for Bogey's ever-threatening malevolence. Then it's a Cagney triple-threat in <I>Angels</I> (with Pat O'Brien), racketeering in <I>The Roaring Twenties</I> (with Bogart), and especially the jailbird classic <I>White Heat</I>, with a fiery finale and an exit line ("Made it Ma! Top o' the world!") that epitomized Cagney's iconic, tough-guy image. In many ways Cagney <I>was</I> Warner Bros., and this <I>Gangsters Collection</I> pays enduring tribute to him and the important films that forged the studio's rugged reputation. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>What more can one say but 'excellent'. This collection of Warner gangster greats is a must have to any serious film collector. Each has been restored and look great. Cagney, Bogart, Robinson, toss in the Dead End kids, a lot of Irish coppers, sleezy babes, booze, blazing .38s and .45s, classic one liners and the dark glances and wisecracks and your have this collection. If you have seen them before, get the set. If you haven't seen any of these films, you are in for a treat. Each has something special about them. Each has the traditional Warner sound effects and fast moving dialog and scripts. Enjoy. </span>

                    <span>What a great set this is.  Warner Brothers did it right this time.  Not only do they release six classics and offer them at a substantial saving as a box set, they load each disk with goodies.  Each disk has a 15-20 minute documentary on the film, a commentary track by a film expert, and the delightful Warners Night at the Movies - trailer, newsreel, two-reel short, cartoon.  The only thing that would have made it a more authentic experience was a second, b-movie feature and a bag of popcorn.  
<br /> The movies - 
<br />  The Public Enemy - ***** Jimmy Cagney explodes on the scene in this, his first star vehicle.  Directed by Raoul Walsh.
<br />  Little Caesar - ***** Edgar G. Robinson IS Rico in a role he'd forever be identified with.
<br />  The Petrified Forest - **** The movie that put Humphrey Bogart on the map, and even includes an interesting main story with Bette Davis and Leslie Howard.
<br />  Angels with Dirty Faces - **** Jimmy Cagney teaches the Dead End Kids to straighten up and fly right, with an assist by Pat O'Brien. A Big Time Cast in a Big City Drama Destined to be the Biggest Hit in Years!
<br />  The Roaring Twenties - ***** Cagney and Bogart are battling bootleggers.
<br />  White Heat - ***** Cagney's greatest role in this late (1949) entry in the gangster cycle. Pick up the pieces folks, Jimmy's in action again!

                    <span>In the early days of movies, the studios often had their specialties.  MGM did musicals.  Universal did monster movies.  And Warner Brothers did gangster movies.  With an emphasis on "common" people - those growing up in urban tenements or in working-class professions - Warner Brothers created its own special niche, and in the process, defined the gangster movie so well that the influence of these films are still seen today.
<br />
<br />In chronological order (with one exception, explained below), this set starts with Little Caesar, with Edward G. Robinson as the vicious gangster Rico, who goes from minor hoodlum to gang boss.  This film - made in the early sound era - is definitely dated but has its strengths, particularly Robinson, who is the center the movie.  In a way, this film is a prototype for the gangster genre, not fully formed but showing the shape of things to come.
<br />
<br />Next is the first of four James Cagney movies, The Public Enemy.  With this movie, the genre hits its stride with its tale of Tom Powers.  Beginning with this movie, we begin to see the reasons why these men turn to crime, especially poverty.  As Powers, Cagney is a brutal character who nonetheless values friendship and family, in particular his mother, a gentle but weak woman who turns a blind eye to her son's flaws and therefore can't stop him.  
<br />
<br />Cagney returned in Angels in Dirty Faces, where he contends with Pat O'Brien, his childhood friend turned priest and Humphrey Bogart, as his craven but evil lawyer.  Here, Cagney is a generally likeable character who is the idol of the local street kids (the Dead End Kids).  He is also likeable in The Roaring Twenties as a WWI vet who is driven to crime after finding no opportunities in the "legitimate" world.  Finally, in White Heat, he is psychopathic Cody Jarrett, a gang leader with a big mother fixation; while far from a pleasant person, Cagney is still able to make Cody somewhat sympathetic.  
<br />
<br />The exception in this set of movies is Petrified Forest, which, while very good, does not fully fit with the other films.  While the other movies all are distinctly urban, Petrified Forest takes place in an isolated desert café.  In addition, while the other movies take place over the course of months or years, Petrified Forest takes place over a few hours.  Finally, Petrified Forest does not focus on the gangster, in this case Duke Mantee (played excellently by Bogart in a breakthrough role), but rather on a romance between Leslie Howard and Bette Davis).
<br />
<br />This top-notch set of classic gangster movies is a pleasure to watch from beginning to end.  In addition to the films themselves, there are some great commentary tracks that provide extra insight, mini-documentaries on each film and a "Warner Night at the Movies" feature that allows the viewer to watch an old-time trailer, newsreel, short subject and cartoon prior to the main feature.  Some boxed sets are hit-or-miss; this one is definitely a hit.</span>

                    <span>The good people at Warner Home Video have outdone themselves on this sassy six pack of classic gangster films. The box set includes William Wellman's "The Public Enemy" (1931)a benchmark acheivement in crime cinema; Raoul Walsh's intense character study of criminal insanity, "White Heat" (1949)and his ode to the ultimate decade of decadence - "The Roaring Twenties" (1939); Robert E. Sherwood's Broadway blockbuster, "The Petrified Forest" (1936),"Little Caesar" (1931)and "Angels With Dirty Faces." <p>"The Public Enemy is the undisputed trend setting monarch of this box set with James Cagney in his breakout performance as bad boy Tom Powers, a deviant from the wrong side of the tracks who refuses to mellow with age. In "White Heat" Cagney plays the psychotic and sadistic Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett, a ruthless gang leader with a penchant for deriving pleasure from the affliction of pain. "The Petrified Forest" is basically two acts of melodrama with a crime thriller finish, pitting idealists, Alan Squier (Leslie Howard)and Gabby Maple (Bette Davis) against ruthless prison escapee, Duke Mantee (Humphrey Bogart). In "The Roaring Twenties" Cagney and Bogart unite as a pair of unlikely pals who scratch each other's back for a while, then tear one another to pieces. "Little Caesar" is the slightly off kilter recanting of the Al Capone story, told under the auspices of not so pure fiction. It's loveable fluff mixed with arsenic and twice as explosive with Edward G. Robinson in the driver's seat. And last, but certainly not least, is "Angels With Dirty Faces" a mix of empathy and excitement as two childhood buddies wind up on opposite sides of morality. Good versus evil never came out so good! <p>Warner's DVD transfers throughout this box set are marvelous improvements over previous video incarnations. Though age related artifacts still exist the remastered print elements are generally smooth and inviting. Of the set, "Little Caesar" rates the poorest in quality - though it's still pretty good. "The Roaring Twenties" is the best of the bunch - a near flawless transfer that simply sparkles. The gray scale on each transfer has been impeccibly rendered. There are moments where film grain will appear more excessive but this, again, is the fault of a 70 plus year old negative. The audio is mono and exhibits a decided hiss on "The Public Enemy" but is generally smooth and engaging elsewhere. No more could have been done by the good people at Warners on these transfers - save a full blown and costly restoration. <p>Extras include engaging audio commentaries by film historians, featurettes for each film and the return of Leonard Maltin, hosting "Warner Night at the Movies." Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Warner Brothers, you have really outdone yourselves on this set!  Everything is perfect!  If I could, I would give you an additional star for not issuing this release in those crummy folded cardboard cases that really hoke up a person's library!  Each title is in its own plastic "keep case" to add to the beauty of the set!  I hope this is indicative of how studios will package their releases (singles, multi-disc and boxed sets) in the future!  CLASS!  The re-mastering of these films make them look and sound better than they probably did at their original cinema showings!  Folks I know who claim they get bored with B&W (you color movie snobs know who you are) had their socks knocked off by this set -- by both the pristine B&W picture quality and by the stories themselves!  You just can't get a better sampling of the movies that played a major part in the creation of the film noir tradition!  Is this set worth it?  Without a doubt!  You add the "extras" included in this bundle with the performances by Cagney (especially here), Bogart, Pat O'Brien and Edward G. Robinson and you have true value for your hard-earned dough!
