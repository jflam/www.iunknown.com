                    <span>I consider this text a superior cover on database systems.
<br />So far,I didn't see a text as thorough as this one to cover the theory of databases. The book is full of SQL examples that links what you've learned with DBMS(s) and it also emphasizes the practical& impractical query algebraic e.g. division in query algebra and how would you accomplish it efficiently in SQL. However, the authors have devoted parts of their times to illustrate the implementation of queries for those interested in a deeper understanding.
<br />
<br />You will find also interesting chapters about advanced database issues like data-mining, warehousing...etc. These topics need volumes to be covered thoroughly; however, they are covered in a way that make your life easier whenever you read postgraduate level texts on database systems.
<br />
<br />As an undergrad. student I would say you don't have to consult any other text through the course. It is a full coverage, I guess!
<br />
<br />As DB professional (Data Modeling,DBA,DB programmer or whatever you do for life !)  I guess, unless you have problems with your wife or your roommate :),you will enjoy your time reading this text.
<br />
<br />The bottom line is:  I recommend this text for you or in other words, this is what you need.</span>

                    <span>this is one of the best books if you ever wanted to know anything about databases. I think this isn't a tutorial book or a book for self study on this topic for beginners - but if you ever need to look up for an profound explication on some database matter this will be the book for you.
<br />
<br />This gives you insights into your database, if you are on the frontier from application developer that has to understand what a database realy does.</span>

                    <span>I am very disappointed with this book because the content is generally very badly explained. I constantly had to refer to other 'clearer' sources online regarding nearly all areas of reading for much better explanations which incidentally were regularly about a tenth of the length of text and a hundred times clearer.</span>

                    <span>I had to buy this book for my graduate level course, and what a waste of money and paper. The authors of this book are completely out of touch with current database technologies in the market. This book contains superfluous and invalid assumptions, and topics. Not only the materials are not correct, but the format it is presented, is very confusing and useless. I could not rate this book less than 1, otherwise I would. If your instructor is asking to buy this book for any classes, just drop the course.</span>

                    <span>Be brave. If you can read through this book cover to cover without utter frustration and/or thoughts of complete hopelessness... Than you, sir, are a better man than I.<p>This book was not what I was looking for. I thought I would be intrigued and genuinely interested in reading database theory and its application; Instead I was scared away. The flow of this book is about as high and dry as stale crackers. You chew and chew and chew, and swallow with the eagerness of a pet refusing to take its medicine.</span>
