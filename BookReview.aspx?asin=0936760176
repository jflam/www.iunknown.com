                <span id="Label1">Across Many Fields captures the essence of Ohio football by chronicling the 2001 high school season with a lively combination of pictures and insights. This book observes high school football less as a sport and more as a cultural event through which a wide variety of people take meaning.  <P>Last fall, writer Christopher Butler and photographer Jennifer Rothchild traveled across Ohio, visited schools in all six high school divisions, and observed big-city and small-town teams. All told, they watched 45 games in 15 weeks, and conducted nearly 150 interviews. The book takes readers from first-game expectations, through mid-season highs and lows, and ends with the two-day, six-game championship weekend that dominates state news headlines every first weekend in December.  <P>The 160-page hardback book is driven mainly by the 261 full-color and black and white photos which capture players, coaches, referees, bands, cheerleaders, teachers, parents, pep clubs, trainers, and paramedics.   <P>ESPN&#146;s Kirk Herbstreit, former quarterback at Centerville High School and Ohio State University, provides the foreword for the book as well.</span>

                    <span>I hesitated to buy this book because I had read some negative things about it on some Ohio high school internet sites. Then I browsed a copy in a local bookstore and realized how foolish I was to wait. This is one of the finest books on high school football I've ever seen (and I own many). <P>Across Many Fields is about football with capital "F". Having read it now (which I suspect some critics have not), I realize the authors were looking for the whole picture and that people unhappy with it were upset because their team wasn't represented. Well, this book isn't about one team or another. It's about all the teams in Ohio that strap on the helmets each season and all the people who support these young men (and a few women). <P>The pictures are tremendous, glorious and the writing is smooth and creative. For any football fan, for anyone who has relished the crisp autumn air on a Friday night in a local football stadium, this book is a can't miss. You'll be transported!</span>

                    <span>This book took me back to my high school years. I was a 320 pound offensive lineman. The 4 years I played high school football were the best of my life. I can never get them back, but with this book I was able to bring back all my memories. Chris and Jen have provided ex-jocks like me something to hold on to. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants some way to recall those glory years of high schoo. <BR>Giles Powell.</span>

                    <span>I bought a few copies as early Christmas gifts because I know my dad and brothers are big fans. After flipping through just the first few pages of photos and text, I knew I made the right choice. The author really covered his tracks. The photos are fantastic! There's no better time in the midwest than fall -- and this book seems to bring out the best of that season.</span>

                    <span>Touchdown! This book drives the length of the field to take the reader on a journey through small towns and big cities who live and die for football. The tradition of Ohio High School Football is second to none and Butler's brilliant narration mixed in with interviews from coaches, players, parents and fans captures what Friday night in the fall is all about - a social gathering of sorts where football is the main focus. Rothchild's photography allows the reader to experience every facet of Friday night football from the star quarterback to the mom selling programs to raise money for the band. <P>Across Many Fields is a must for anyone who loves high school football.</span>

                    <span>While Across Many Fields chronicles the 2001 Ohio high school football season, this book is to be enjoyed by all -- regardless of the reader's geographic location. Across Many Fields goes well beyond statistics and X's and O's to explore the very essence of high school football; whereas a Friday Night Lights exposes the darker side of a big-time high school program, AMF is a celebration of the sights, sounds, athletes, and communities that make autumn evenings special for so many. From big-time rivalries to small town tradition, this book explores high school football with a depth and passion that make it a captivating read.<P>Handsomely photographed and insightfully written, Across Many Fields is a timeless tribute to a uniquely American institution.</span>
