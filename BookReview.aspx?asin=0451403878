                    <span>This is a very huge book. I read it in like 3 days because it is so engrossing and enthralling and it is just plain CRAZY!! Roy DeMeo is one psychotic man....or should say WAS since they found him in a trunk of a car riddled with bullet holes with a chandelier on top! GREAT BOOK! DONT PASS IT UP! Higly recommended to anyone who digs mob books or movies! The part about the DeMeo crew ordering a pizza while dismembering bodies they hang upside down in the shower is enough to grab your attention but this entire book is very interesting! Great book title too! </span>

                    <span>In response to many of your reviews, thumbs up to those smart enough to determine fact from fiction. For those of you who believe this "thriller" and comment as if you know the characters, all I can say is "poor judgement!" I am one of the fortunate to know many of these men, and all I can say is that this book is extremely exciting to read, but full of nonsense. I only wish today's generation was filled with more of these men. Maybe we should look deeper into the people behind this story, such as Dominic. Another weak and screwed up drug user crying poor me and looking for a pity party. This creature told many lies all to try to make himself look like a hero. As for Roys son, another pity party. Poor thing; so it wasn't drugs but booze, lets blame it on dad.
<br /> 
<br /> So go on and enjoy the story, but if you are all that interested, try looking up the actual cases involved and see the real truth. It is then that we might learn a thing or two about what we call justice. A perfect example would be Henry Borelli serving 150 years in a maximum security prison far away from his family, and all for 15 stolen cars; nothing more. God, I have heard of lighter sentences for murder and rape.
<br /> 
<br /> Maybe more people should take the time to look deeper into our justice system, before they comment on a book such as this. </span>

                    <span>Despite some reviews here that state that Dominick Montiglio was never a Green Beret, never a war hero, maybe never even in combat, I still give this book credence. While Montiglio was a source for this book, it's clear to the reader that he was not truly involved in the Demeo crew but really more of a servant to Nino Gaggi his uncle. So there is no way Montiglio could have known all these horrifying details about many of these murders. Capeci and Mustain would have to have had other sources that they learned about these murders from. The book definitely focuses too much attention on Montiglio, he was basically a down-and-out deadbeat cokehead. 
<br />
<br />I wouldn't go as far as to say that this book is a complete fabrication. Too much law enforcement has found out too much information about the Demeo crew for someone to think that the information about these murders was fabricated. As for the Dominick Montiglio war hero stuff, well it's a minor part of the book at best so take it with a grain of salt. The real point of this book is that the Mafia is not the Sopranos or The Godfather. It's these people. People who have zero intelligence or practical function on this planet, but who kill innocent people in gruesome ways just so their crimes can continue. This is a very good read. </span>

                    <span>This book just didn't flow smoothly for me. I did find it interesting but also got lost a few times and had to backtrack. Some readers thought it was more fiction than fact. I have no idea since I have no facts to compare to. There obviously is a mafia, crime associated with it, hit men, etc. but I have no reason to dispute the facts I read here. The murder business now seems a lot more brutal than I once thought it was. I am from Philadelphia and travel often on business to New York especially thru Brooklyn. Now I can't drive thru Brooklyn without thinking about the carnage that went on. Overall it's a good book and I would recommend reading it.</span>

                    <span>You will learn that by reading this book, the most ordinary people can be the biggest scumbags around. Not this Sopranos crap with these idiots with there "look at me" outfits and flashy jewelry. That's just hollywoods image of mobsters. If you look at real mobsters most you don't even know what they look like.  For example look at richard kuklinski, murderer of hundreds (hitman) had wife kids, nobody suspected.<br>Roy Demeo, Murderer killer of at least 100 people (butchered with boning knives) had a wife, kids, and kids went to good schools. nobody suspected. <br>The real scumbags killers aren't the sopranos type of guys, thats hollywood crap again. <p>Mafia people are not harvard grads, with great educations, like we seems to think they are, they are really criminals and thugs from the streets of brooklyn and elsewhere, drug dealers,car theifs, loansharks.<br>The guys who are the most vicious never really get the credit for being that way, people like john gotti do who was a total dope thats why he ended up in jail unlike carlo gambino. same with john gotti's dope son john jr. who he put in charge the guy was like 28 or something and went to prison for years, he's still serving time.<p>The sad part was roy demeo, it just confuses me because at some points he was a nice guy who felt sympathy (read his son's book) and others he just murdered with no feelings like they were bugs being squished. he killed his own best friend, and his other friends participated they were friends since youth. can you believe these scum? They kill they're own friends! <p>mafia life is far from romantic, it's sick</span>
