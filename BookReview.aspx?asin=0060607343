                    <span>I read this book after reading "Nothing Special". I like Joko's writing a lot, simple, direct to the points just as Zen should be simple. This book may be hard for people trying to understand Zen only (without practice) or beginners. But to people practicing sitting Zen daily I think it contains a lot of good advices which I can apply into living. I will read and read again both books by Joko. I have read many Zen books and found that this book and "Nothing Special" are among the best for me. Highly recommend both "Everyday Zen" and "Nothing Special".</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Back in the early 80's I read a few very scholarly volumes about Zen. They were great at giving a total novice some idea of the formation and history of Zen. They were full of very strict admonishments, you must live very austere existence, live off almost nothing, and be almost perfect before you even begin.<P>Twenty years on and I am interested again in Zen. This book is such a contrast to those early volumes. It teaches you that none of us are perfect, and each of us needs to move at a suitable pace for where we are now. It might be helpful if before reading this book you have some theoretical knowledge of how Zen came to be and what it's about, but I don't feel that is essential. If you are like me you will have decided you want to know about Zen or wish to begin practicing and you will find someone (a teacher) to help start you on the path, and they will recommend this book to you.<P>The writer seems to know EXACTLY how I'm feeling and writes in a style that speaks to the inner me, rather than talking to all the perfect people I envisaged would be the only ones to take up Zen practice...i.e. she de-esoteric-orises the subject. She also sounds like she must have experienced the doubts, the hopes, and all the other up's and downs that we all go through.<P>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Having read a few of the negative reviews of Beck's original introduction to the Ordinary Mind philosophy and practice, I have to say that I was one who had no previous exposure to zen nor do I have a zen teacher. The clarity of the subjects covered through lecture and teacher-student interaction at the zen hall made it quite understandable to me. Of course I am talking clearly about the text and its absorbility. Now understanding the way of life through zen, THAT is the challenge - not the author's teachablity through this work. Outstanding work by the author.</span>

                    <span>This is simply my favorite zen book, and I have read a few. Granted, if you are a total newcomer to zen, you may experience some frustration. In fact, I did not appreciate this book after my first read. After additional study and reading - especially of Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now - I reread Everday Zen and now I cannot get enough of Charlotte Joko Beck's teaching. Her other book, Nothing Special, is equally beneficial. Her writing is straightforward, but profound. What a treasure she is!</span>

                    <span>great text for students of zen practice but also an amazing read for anyone NOT at all familiar with zen practice - sans the 'religious' spiritual overtones. this is an easy, flowing read with a lot of insightful observations and reminders that give the reader much to think about and consider on their journey! definitely a wonderful book for anyone :)</span>
