                    <span>I found the way this book is organized terrible. It tells you more HOW to see things than WHAT to see. It's like wanting to know when a movie starts, and you check the paper and find directions on how to get to the theater, advice on the best place to park, you're told what food is really yummy at the snack counter, and you're pulling your hair out because you can't find when the movie starts!!!</span>

                    <span>I have been exploring the Anza-Borrego Desert region for 15 years. The Lindsay book is an invaluble resource if you truly want to become intimate with the area. The Lindsay's include a lot of the area history in an interesting, easy reading format. I just ordered the latest edition (I have two previous editions, which are completely dog eared and very well used) to make sure I am up to date. The State Park has a way of changing every few years and some back country trails and roads are no longer accessible. If you have only one book of the Anza-Borrego desert, this is it! The map that comes with it is excellent.</span>

                    <span>If you only get one book on this area, get this one. I actually have an older copy I bought over ten years ago and it is still well used. It has a very detailed map (of which mine is tattered and well used) and the book is a great accompiament. I often use the book to determine how many miles I had walked or driven in for that day. It also gives you some advice as to camping and rules of the state park and surrounding public lands.<P>The Lindsays are well known in the area and Diana Lindsay is active in the Anza-Borrego Desert Natural History Association. She and Lowell are known the be two of the foremost authorities of information of that region.</span>

                    <span>This is THE book to have if you're going to the Anza Borrego desert, thinking about going, or just wondering what the place is like. The folding map in the back of the book alone is worth the price of the entire book - it shows points of interest, camp sites, 4x4 trails, hiking trails, etc...<P>Most of the book itself is structured around the map, dividing it into seven regions. For each region it goes into detail about what you can see and do along the main route through the region, and then also goes into detail about many "sub-routes" that get you off the beaten path and into the desert (the mud caves are REALLY cool!).<P>My copy is already dog-eared and the map has a few tears, and I've only been to the desert twice since I've gotten the book!</span>
