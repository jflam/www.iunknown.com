                    <span>I was originally given this book by a friend and told to approach it with a completely open mind. This book will help you explore your true inner self and how it relates to golf. I now have the ability to forget all my 32 years of golf mumbo-jumbo and "correct-swing" theories, and focus on experiencing and truly enjoying golf. I recently had the opportunity to take an all day seminar / golf experience from Fred and it changed my whole life and thoughts about the game. I am now re-reading the book again!!! Don't let this one pass you by...get the book and forget all the technical theories...the game and swing are in you, Fred simply helps you bring it out.</span>

                    <span>How many golf lessons have you taken where the (well intended) pro has filled your head with adjustments to your hands, feet, head, arms, back, chin, ball, brain, fingers and or grip? And, like a responsible adult, you respond to their instructions, strike the ball well while you're there only to revert back to your old ways a couple of days later? THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU! Fred Shoemaker is the first golf instructor I've ever read that has the courage to NOT try to tell you everything you need to do to change your swing. Instead, he gives you a simple, easy to understand APPROACH to the game of golf that enables you to really understand what's right and what's wrong. As a result of reading Fred's book, I now know my swing well enough to KNOW what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong -- so I can make my own correction. Whether your an "8" or "28" you should read this book now!</span>

                    <span>Extraordinary Golf is the best publication on self coaching that I have ever discovered.<P>I remember Tiger Woods crediting his success with his ability to 'get out of his own way'. Fred Shoemaker, and Extraordinary Golf provide each of us the path to letting go of the mechanics, and the expectations of performance in golf, and letting our inner passion for the fun and enjoyment of competition take over.<P>After years of struggling to recover the game of my youth as a scratch handicapper, Fred's wisdom helped me to understand that my own power came from having fun as a kid.. I am young again !<P>I learned from Fred that in golf, there is a ball, a target, and me. The only variable in the game.. is me.. and Extraordinary Golf provided me with the power.. to be me.<P>You have to read this book.. it will change your game, and your life.</span>
