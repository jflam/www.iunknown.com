                    <span>I found every part of this book, except for the last chapter, to be thorough, even-handed and well written. As a South African with a strong interest in our history seeking to flesh out an incomplete knowledge of it, this is the best and most complete source I have found so far.
<br />
<br />The third edition contains two new chapters: the first one describes the negotiation process and the transition to the new government, and the second is a description of the state of the New South Africa. The transition chapter is excellent -- it is insightful, fascinating and highly relevant to South Africa today. 
<br />
<br />However, I found the final chapter of this book to be badly written, overly pessimistic and, in places, dangerously subjective. Part of this is because it was written in 2000, and doesn't include some of the serious progress made since then -- for example, it mentions the sharp drop in the Rand's value in 1999 and 2000, but not its subsequent strong and equally rapid recovery in 2003 and 2004. This leaves the impression that the Mbeki government is doing a terrible job, whereas as of now (early 2005) it is doing relatively well.
<br />
<br />However, some (not much, but a little bit) of the material in the final chapter contains the kind of alarmist statements that South Africans have come to expect (and learned to ignore) from certain (predominantly conservative) sections of the popular press, and are inappropriate in a book that claims to be accurate and factual. I suspect that Bishop Tutu might wish to have the glowing review he gave to the first edition removed from the cover of the third.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, provided the reader is willing to to be take the final chapter with a grain of salt, the book lives up to its billing and deserves its extremely positive reviews.</span>

                    <span>Its hard to find a readable history of SA in just under 300 pages. If you want a good overview of SA History this books is well written, accurate, and detailed enough that it is not too general. A must read if you need the History of SA in a short read.</span>

                    <span>"I did not think it was possible for a white person to write a history of South Africa which a black South African would find to be a fair and accurate account of a beautiful land and its people. Leonard Thompson has disabused me of that notion. His is a history that is both accurate and authentic, written in a delightful literary style." -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu<p>This truly is an incredible historical masterpiece. The account begins with two chapters dedicated to the early Africans before European intervention, and ends with the fall of apartheid and a new beginning for South Africa. It is a easy to read, and is a real page-turner.<p>The reason I picked this book up was I wanted to dig beneath the surface of the country's history. I learned about the two Afrikaner Republics - The Orange Free State, and the Transvaal Republic - and how they were incorporated, reluctantly, into the Union of South Africa at the beginning of the 20th century. The detail is incredible, and not boring in the least.<p>I highly recommend this book - especially for those who need to do research reports on apartheid, or South African history in general. Overall - and excellent, excellent history book!</span>
