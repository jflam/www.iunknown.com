                    <span>Too many typos in the practice exams (such as the upper-case 'I' in question 15 of Exam 1) make this a risky choice for the exam. You certainly don't need confusion when trying to study for this exam. The content is good though and it seems to targetthe necessary concepts. </span>

                    <span>This is the worst certification book ever written.  When I read the book, I did not feel confident that these were the actual questions that I would see on the exam.  I also did not learn anything from the book.  I stopped reading this book, and went on to read Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates' Java 2 Certification book.  That is much, much better, and it is written by the exam writers themselves.  The questions are more like what is on the exam, and I am actually learning Java concepts that I never knew.   The cram exam book is a waste of money, and more importantly, a waste of time. </span>

                    <span>This was not my primary study guide as I highly recommend the Sierra title, but it is a solid effort.  The questions and practice exams are well worth it and it is concise.  Some in depth explanations are lacking, and if you are trying to understand polymorphism and casting, you should augment what you read here.  I think it is always good to have a couple of books when going for certification because each book may stress or explain something different.  Many times, that gives you a three dimensional look at material that begins to really make sense.  If you have a study guide already, pick this one up as well.  It is compact and loaded with information and practice questions that are of excellent quality.  I passed using this and the Sierra book primarily and can only recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I would not rely exclusively on this book to get you through the Java exam unless you have some significant practical experience with Java to cover the stuff you won't find here. <p>There are some things missing in this book...simple stuff even like anonymous array creation. And everything else, as the title says, is crammed: about 10 pages per topic. Annoyingly however there is some stuff in this book that isn't in the exam objectives: eg. static intialization blocks...<p>I found the tests in the book were somewhat misleading of my current knowledge: they are fairly easy, so they flatter to deceive to a certain extent. ALso of annoyance are the topic tests at the end of each chapter: these are quite good in themselves, but each one has the answer straight after it. SO it's hard to avoid seeing it and the remedy: using a peice of paper to cover it and another the page next to it so you can't see and memorize the answer to the questions over there is a little demeaning. Seriously...it shows poor oversight and miserliness...what's a couple of more pages and put the answers in one section at the end of each chapter? A small gripe but nonetheless an important one.<p>The CD contains an exam where some of the questions cover material that isn't in the exam objectives: I hit one question on Iterator Methods! This is absurd! <p>I recommend Kathy Sierra's Book (she helped create the test!) instead of this and also reading the Java Language Specification to find out all the rules, nuances and quirky behavior that makes Java the language we all love- and love to hate because of this Exam (but what's life without a challenge?)<p>Also: to these people who like to post their test scores as vindication of a book: why do this? Firslty anybody cna make up a number or lie about having done the test. Secondly, god knows how much of your life you've spent on Java. So unless you give a fair assessment of your knowledge --book and then book++ it really doesn't mean much....just a thought.</span>

                    <span>My study for the exam consisted of:<p>1) sit sample test 1 from the book (scored 58%)<br>2) read a chapter of the book, skimming the easy bits but writing test code to demonstrate any interesting/surprising language features.<br>3) do the questions that appear at the end of the chapter.<br>4) repeat 2 & 3 for all chapters<br>5) sit sample test 2 from the book (scored 90%)<br> <br>This allowed me to pass the exam with a 88% score.<p>While this book was my primary study tool, I also made frequent use of the online library Javadocs and the book 'Java in a Nutshell' to provide supplementary detail.<p>Overall I thought the book was pretty good, my biggest complaint would be that the answers for the chapter questions are right under each question making it *much* too easy to accidentally see the answer.  I also felt the threading coverage was a little weak.<p>I'm an experienced developer, it could be that someone with less experience needs more detail.</span>
