                <span id="Label1">The Java 2 Black Book is the most up-to-date comprehensive reference on the latest version of Java, version 1.3.  This revised edition of the best-selling book has been updated to reflect changes available in the latest version of Java including drag and drop, security enhancements, the new applet deployment enhancements, and the new Java Naming and Directory Interface.  It also includes new features such as the new Java sound API and its use in both applications and applets, plus expanded coverage of Java's JDBC data access capabilities.  This book is a great reference tool-jam-packed with easily accessible information.</span>

                    <span>This is a really wonderful book for novice programmer. I have read the Java Tutorial book. I bought this book from bookstore, and read it.This book really good.but not enough for Java Certicification.I throw java tutorial to garbage when i get this book. Black book, I found it better on several topics than several other books I read. Exam or no exam, this book makes one an adept at programming in java, which I feel about myself during coding.<P>Highly recommended for an academic understanding of the Java language. It's guaranteed to make you a better programmer (at least much smarter than your colleagues!).</span>

                    <span>This isn't really a tutorial; it's a reference. In fact, it seems like most computer books I pick up these days are references. That's understandable: a tutorial is much harder to write than a reference. (It's probably harder to sell, too, since a tutorial has to be pretty squarely aimed, so I don't necessarily blame the author.) Of the 1,000+ pages this book, I'd say half just list all the attributes of Java objects, and a good portion of the remaining page consist of code listings showing help-file-level examples of how to use them. In cases where things are built up incrementally, often an entire page of code is repeated to show one or two new lines.<P>It'll definitely boost your ego and possibly your reputation among those who might be impressed by your "reading" of a 1,000 page book in a few hours, and it won't hurt your Java skills. But you won't see any serious Java programs in here either, or learn how to make them, or learn anything about object-oriented design--a pretty important topic if you're going to work in Java.<P>This Black Book is constructed in the form of a running dialogue between yourself--apparently a master of Java already--and a gallery of irritating "characters" like the "Novice Programmer", the "Big Boss", the "Product Market Specialist", etc. Sometimes these dialogues have the right hint of smat-alec, but by page 500, a sense of deja vu sets in, and they begin to seem like a crutch.<P>There are some seriously irksome things about this book, too. A third or more is dedicated to the "Advanced Windows Toolkit" (AWT) of Java. OK, no problem. Java's "Swing" system has taken over from that, but you might still use AWT, right? Except the Swing section begins with a discussion of how bug-ridden AWT was. What? How can I have read a book's worth of material on a subject and this be the first I've heard about the bugs? <P>Swing is relatively glossed over, but not as badly as interfaces, threading, beans, and a bunch of other topics where reading a list of attributes does not give you a good sense of how to use them.<P>I expected a lot more from a Coriolis Black Book.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<BR>Beginner/intermediate Java developers who are looking for practical examples of code while learning about a specific concept.<P>Contents<BR>This guide to learning Java is focused more on solving problems than an exhaustive teaching of each Java concept.<P>The book is divided into the following chapters: Essential Java; Variables, Arrays, and Strings; Operators, Conditionals, and Loops; Object-Oriented Programming; Inheritance, Inner Classes, and Interfaces; AWT: Applets, Applications, and Event Handling; AWT: Text Fields, Buttons, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and Layouts; AWT: Lists, Choices, Text Areas, Scrollbars, and Scroll Panes; AWT: Graphics, Images, Text, and Fonts; AWT: Windows, Menus, and Dialog Boxes; Working With Streams: File and I/O Handling; Working With Multiple Threads; Swing: Applets, Applications, and Pluggable Look And Feel; Swing: Text Fields, Buttons, Toggle Buttons, Checkboxes, and Radio Buttons; Swing: Viewports, Scrolling, Sliders, and Lists; Swing: Combo Boxes, Progress Bars, Tooltips, Separators, and Choosers; Swing: Layered Panes, Tabbed Panes, Split Panes, and Layouts; Swing: Menus and Toolbars; Swing: Windows, Desktop Panes, Inner Frames, and Dialog Boxes; Java And XML: Using The Document Object Model; Java And XML: Using The Simple API for XML; Collections; Creating Packages, Interfaces, JAR Files, and Java Beans; Exception Handling, Debugging, and Advanced Topics<P>Review<BR>It's getting harder and harder to find a unique niche when it comes to Java learning guides. There are humor-based guides and academic-based guides, reference guides and basic information guides, exhaustive volumes and "For Dummies" level material. So how do you find something different? Holzner finds it in Java 2 Black Book... a guide oriented towards practical solutions.<P>Each chapter has a brief explanation of the material to be covered. From there, the rest of the material is covered within the "immediate solution" sections. The first section is an outline of each class to be covered, along with the properties and methods. The rest of the immediate solutions follow a conversational tone with a series of fictional problems that need to be solved by a java programmer. In many ways, this approach makes it easier to place the new information in context. You see how someone might need to use a text box in an applet instead of just learning what a text box is.<P>This particular edition of the book covers Java through version 1.3, so if you want the most up to date information, you'll need to look elsewhere. Also, by looking at the chapters, you'll see there is a lot of coverage given to AWT and Swing programming. If you're more interested in server-side Java programming, this may not be your best choice. I would think this book would appeal to someone who has already gone through one learning guide and is now starting to use Java on a regular basis.<P>Conclusion<BR>This book is more conversational and practical in nature than many other Java guides, and will appeal to readers who appreciate a less academic approach to learning new concepts. In my opinion, this would be a good "second Java book" for someone learning the language.</span>

                    <span>I am a c++ programmer that was suddenly given a very large java assignment out of the blue. I saw this book on sale for $5 at the local borders and am very glad that I bought it.<P>The book uses a running dialog between a novice programmer and you(an experienced programmer) as the start of each section. While it is kind of corny, it does work out well. <P>I didn't bother with the first couple of chapters as they cover basic programming, but instead I went striaght to the AWT and Swing sections. Each chapter covered it's stated area well enough that I could start working after looking over the code examples and skimming the text. When the auther modifies previous code, it is highlighted which makes life a lot easier.<P>The book is over 1100 pages and includes two bonus chaperts on the companion cdrom. All in all, this is a great book for someone who is new to java.</span>

                    <span>I have only one basis for comparison for this book, but what I do know is that it is easy to read and comprehend, and written for people who have or haven't had experience with Java programming before. I compared its ease-of-reading to Sun Microsystems' Course Technology "Java Programming" book by Joyce Farrell, which assumes too much knowledge from its readers and is much less referencable. This book is a great way to get started learning Java 2 as well as learn how to solve advanced programming problems.</span>
