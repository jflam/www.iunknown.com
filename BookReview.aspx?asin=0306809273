                <span id="Label1">A chilling memoir by the head of Hitler's Foreign Intelligence Service-the only SS-man to describe the inner workings of the Nazi bureaucracy  <P>This unique account of Hitler's corrupt regime illuminates more vividly than any other the deepening atmosphere of terror and unreality in which the Nazi leadership lived as the war progressed. Schellenberg recounts with firsthand knowledge the motivations and machinations surrounding the Nazi Army's every move in Poland, Austria, and Russia. But this remarkable inside account is perhaps most memorable for its riveting portraits of Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Heinrich Mueller, Ernst Kaltenbrunner-men whom Schellenberg calls, with stunning lack of irony,"Hitler's willing executioners."  <P>"[Schellenberg's] lack of self-consciousness, damning as a revelation of character, makes him the more valuable as an historical witness." -Alan Bullock  <P>"The interest of this book lies in the rich assortment of 'cloak and dagger' stories, some of them so fantastic that they could only have taken place in the loony world of the Nazis, and in the picture of the sinister, bloodthirsty world of the Gestapo." -William L.

                    <span>Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Heinrich Mueller, all exposed in a different light through the eyes of Walter Schellenberg, in his book, "The Labyrinth." The book is a story of how Schellenber attempted to create and run an intelligence unit (secret service) for Nazi Germany during World War II, while, at the same time, attempting to survive the petty jealousies of other party leaders who desired Hitler's attention. I read the book in two days, as I was intrigued by Schellenberg's approach to problems he perceived Nazi Germany faced both at the beginning of the war and at the end.</span>

                    <span>This book, first published fifty years ago is an account of the working life of Walter Schellenberg, Hitlers chief of counter intelligence. Schellenberg was one of the many young intelligentsia who flocked to join the SS in the ealy 1930's, due to the lack of opportunities in other fields. Trained as a lawyer Schellenberg was assigned to work for Reinhard Heydrich chief of the SD, the security divisiion of the SS. This book has several facets: a super paced spy story reminiscent of a Len Deighton spy thriller, an account of counter intelligence in the Third Reich and finally character portraits of Nazi Germany's ruling clique. We have excellant thumb nail sketches of the frightening Reinhard Heydrich head of SS security, the indecisive Heinrich Himmler head of the SS, the drunken Ernest Kaltenbrunner Heydrich's successor and finally the universally despised ex champaigne salesman Joachim von Ribbentrop the Nazi foreign minister. Schellenberg has real talent on portraying what it must have been like to work in a terror directed society where every move could be one's last. This was intensified by the rivalry between three organiations doing essentially the same job, namely the Abwehr(Army intelligence),the SS and the Gestapo. In this nightmare the only individual who gains any of my sympathy is Admiral Canaris, Heydrich's old boss and head of the Abwher.He was trying to negotiate an ending to the war but was found out and murdered by Hitler. Although the personification of evil Heydrich at least maintains our interest as he impresses with his competance and intelligence. The rest of the Nazi hierarchy from Hitler downwards appear as a brainless collection of incompetents and one wonders how they could have kept the world at bay for twelve years. THe answer is of course that the Nazi Party had in its possession the 1940 Wehrmacht which in Generalship and fighting qualities had no equal this century. It was if the Mafia had contol of the Pentagon to fight it's battles. There are some memorable scenes such as the time Heydrich questions Schellenberg about his relationship with Frau Heydrich , pointing out that the drink just taken was laced with poison and could only be deactivated if he, Schellenberg were telling the truth. On another Heydrich entrusts Schellenberg with the establishment of a brothel for security purposes."Salon Kitty" was never short of high society recruits from Berlin society though Schellenberg's involvement with its establishment shows him as somewhat of a prude. Embellished in the narative are some interesting historical observations that have been forgotten over the years namely: Richard Sorge the great Rusdsian spoy was a double agent also working for the Germans. Heydrich privately thought that the killing of Jews was stupid and would lead to Germany's destruction. Up to 1943 Japan was continually trying to broker a peace between Russia and Germany. Marshall Tukhachevsky Stalins best General who was shot in the purges was in fact plotting against Stalin though he was set up by the Germans. This muust have been one of the few authentic accusations in the Moscow show trials. Schellenberh was given the task of organizing the occupation of Great Britain when operation Sea Lion materialized. His main contribution to this was the preparation of a comprehensive list of the ruling elite of British society. Schellenberg mentions very little about his personal life. He appears to be somewhat of an Anglophile and his wife had Polish blood. He mentions very little about the Holocaust which is strange sinc his superiors Heydrich and Himler were the architects of this policy. He always hints that he wanted the war ended yet mentions nothing about the 1944 July plot to kill Hitler. One gets the feeling that he had become so corrupted by the regime that he was immune to the difference of right and wrong. This is highlighted that his main regrets appear to be the loss of power and especially the loss of his office with its concealed microphones and machine guns. He never expresses any remorse for any of the crimes committed by the regime of which he was one of the main custodians. Schellenberg died in 19562 of an undisclosed ailment. If he had lived what a catch he would have been for the CIA with his superb knowledge of Russian intelligence methods.</span>

                    <span>Walter Schellenberg, -the closest friend of Reinhard Heydrich, an intimate of Himmler- was an "idea man" for both and his career sky-rocketted to make him the youngest SS General. How are we expected to believe that he had nothing to do with the mass murdering of Jewish people?<BR>Isn't he the one, who, on May 20 1941, ordered to stop the emigrations of Jewish people from France and Belgium, being the first to refer to the coming "Final Solution" of the Jewish problem... Well, you will not find this in his Memoirs, and neither in the US archives on Walter Schellenberg which have just been declassified (1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002) and even less in the British archives which have not been declassified.<P>Thanks to a plea bargain with the British, owing to the Allies desire to conceal that the duke of Windsor (former king Edward VIII) and Wallis Simpson (his wife) were Nazi spies, Walter Schellenberg's history was rewritten with the help of his western Allies investigators. <P>Schellenberg was given the time to prepare his defense in Sweden with Himmler's chyropractor, Felix Kersten, to be later acting as a defense witness. Thus, through the "Troza Memoradum" then written by Schellenberg, Felix Kersten was informed of how he had to adapt the "notiezen" which would be used for writing his own Memoirs. This avoided him of being convicted and helped saving his Gestapo accomplice.<P>Walter Schellenberg had attempted more negotiations for a separate peace witht the west than anybody else event if he was carrying them out not for a return to democracy but only for replacing Hitler by Himmler. Even this part is misinformation.<P>Schellenberg in fact was just an agent-provocateur, who infiltrated every treason attempt against the nazis. It did cost, at Venlo, Menzies and Dansey (heads of the British IS) their spy network in continental Europe. <P>During the war it only costed Himmler the life saving of a couple of Swedish jews, and, at the very end of the war, a train of 1200 Jewish persons which were about to be liberated by the Allies: for this "Musy train" negotiations had been dragging since June 1944 (almost one full year) but were arranged in a matter of days when it became strategic for Himmler.<P>Schellenberg worked as a chief of the Gestapo Office E, before directing (only for two and a half year) the political espionage of the Nazi Security Service. After the von Stauffenberg attempt against Hitler (which he and Himmler had fully penetrated) he also gained full control over the military espionage. Naturally the Memoirs loose the reader in the Labyrinth of the spy stories to avoid him getting to the Minotaur of the Holocaust. Wasn't the Minotaur symbolically representing the guilt of King Minos of Crete?<BR>Schellenberg's Memoirs duly called the Labyrinth are full of silence and subtle lies, well wrapped up in true fascinating but misleading spy stories.<BR>Unfortunately lots of historians did base other analysis on this twisted and biased account written by one of the nazi monster.<P>To be read with more than caution as, contrary to what the investigators claimed, the author is extremely clever. Their statement about his alleged lack of intelligence was only aiming at covering the holes left in their own investigation, and at hiding some inconsistencies in their presentation.<P>This book doesn't supply any answers but it raises a huge number of questions for the knowlegeable historian. <BR>One day someone will use the Ariadne thread to find the proven way to the Minotaur and fly above the intricacies of the Labyrinth with wings that the sun will not melt down.</span>

                    <span>I've been studying the American, British and German archives and testimonies about Walter Schellenberg for the last ten years. His memoirs are a masterpiece... in deception. The book aims at focusing attention on spy stories and personal stories concerning Hitler, Himmler and Heydrich (most of the times totally twisted but never totally factually false). Yet he would not have become the youngest SS general just on the accounts of his failed spying attempts that he very subtely describes in his book (omitting he had a heart attack at the only successful one). Readers should know that he was one of the originators of the Einsatzgruppen who shot millions of men, women and children behind the Eastern European front. He did play a part in the organization of the emigration of rich Jewish persons after they had been so heavily ransomed that they were basically left with their lives. He basically was the recognized idea man behind Heydrich (the worst of the worst) and Himmler. A letter signed by him demonstrates that he was working on the Final Solution of the Jewish Problem before May 20th 1941 (the Wannsee conference -where Heydrich announced it- would only come on January 1942) He favored the massacre of Jews (namely in Hungaria) to have something to exchange with the allies for peace negotiations allgedly preparing an alliance against the Soviet Union. He managed to go through Nurenberg by dealing with the American juges and the British Secret services and lying to them about the were-wolfes and the Alpine Reduit, which never existed. He was helped by charging some other major criminal when other evidences were inconclusive (Kaltenbrunner). He sprinkles his book with reference to a few Jewish persons (Portugal) or to Kersten (Himmler's chyropractor) who occasonally helped Jewish families to be saved. He used his negotiation attempts as if they were political and humanitarian (for historical practical reasons, the allies acted as if they believed it). To crown everything, he may have been [the young] "Werther", the soviet spymaster who had access to Hitler's most secret military plans and transmitted them, unpunished, daily from Berlin (he supported and save several times his adjutant Stirlitz really a Soviet agent, Colonel Maksim Maksimovich Isaev, who had infiltrated the SD): after all he was the head of the counter-intelligence. Naturally he did put historians on a false track inducing that H. Mueller (head of Gestapo) had turned into a communist. This book is very dangerous for historians as many massively quoted it, taking it at face value: these memoirs are one of the first real successful attempts at what is now called desinformation. It is done intelligently, with charm, making it all the more ambiguous. The other reviews here demonstrate how successful Schellenberg was, but he was one of the most cynical murderers of the time: he invented the solutions to Heydrich, Hitler and Himmler's problems and had others doing the dirty work to keep his hands clean and collecting the rewards of his murderous masters. Don't forget that this book was written after Nurenberg to clean his past preparing his future career. Fortunately there is a form of justice and he died from a liver cancer convinced that he was being poisoned by the British. Readers should remember that Bin Laden's September 11th is a (macabre) joke compared to what this guy invented.</span>
