                    <span>This book covers serial-port programming in Visual Basic from VB's early editions through Visual Basic .NET, including programming for Windows CE. It's the most complete reference you'll find on the topic. Richard Grier has done a great job of keeping the book up to date through multiple editions. If you do serial-port programming in VB, this book will save you time and trouble.

                    <span>This is an excellent, excellent reference for using serial ports with VB. I can't say enough for this book. The author knows his material and communicates his knowledge very well. I am using it to write a communications program to interface with field devices using the modbus protocol. The book doesn't specifically cover modbus, but I still found this book to be very helpful. Again, excellent!</span>

                    <span>For Visual Basic programmers working with serial ports, if you are not an expert at them, then you need this book. Since I already had a great deal of experience with serial ports, most of this was not new to me. However, instead of having to train some colleagues on all the details, I recommended they buy this book. They did and it made them very proficient with serial ports. They kept the books.</span>

                    <span>One thing that i like in this book is the author's recommendation on how to optimize the serial communication program in terms of program execution speed. However, i do not like the way source codes are pointed out. Some codes are shaded gray and it took me time to find which code is being explained. Each line of code should have been numbered. Additionally, the book may need to add some more pages that will walk the reader through a small most common serial comm project from "scratch to finish". Overall, this book is a good reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is very helpful for using either the MSComm control or the Win API for serial communications in VB. Anyone who has to communicate with a serial device using VB should have this book in their reference library. I used the information to help me write some serial drivers for a Human Machine Interface (HMI) application...</span>
