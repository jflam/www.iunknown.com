                    <span>If your one of those people like me that loves the smell of a new book, are picky about what you read, and find yourself organizing your books with your own little system, here is something special for you. Like Walter Mosley and Ross MacDonald, John Dunning's work is much more than a mere detective novel.It is a novel of intrigue and murder amidst the book world, or more to the point, those who love books and spend much of their time looking for that first edition copy of....<P> Cliff Janeway is the Denver bookman and part time detective who gets involved looking for a girl who may have in her possession a rare, and unheard of, Grayson Press edition of Poe's "The Raven", a book worth a fortune. Things are not always what they seem and as Janeway tries to help the young and frightened Eleanor the story becomes more complex and dangerous. This mystery is exiting and compelling, peppered with insights and observations about books from a writer who loves and respects them as much as we do. <P> This is a book you will love and respect after finishing it. It is a wonderful and exiting read and Cliff Janeway can stand side by side with Easy Rawlins and Lew Archer in American detective fiction. We are treated to keen observations about humanity during this twisty tale of books and murder. Dunning uses the rain in Seattle and the snow in Denver for atmosphere and there is almost a wistful feel to the ending. <P> Written in '95 this was the second Cliff Janeway novel. "Booked to Die" was the first and is also highly recommended. We can only hope Dunning will give us a third one day. This is a smart read that will be enjoyed by anyone who loves books. If you like an intelligent mystery with sharply drawn characters, and observations on our society as well, then this book is a must have for your library. A treasured find.</span>

                    <span>Book-collectors and lovers of cerebral mysteries have reason to rejoice. Ex-Denver cop and now bookstore owner Cliff Janeway is back and involved in an intrigue that gets more byzantine by the page. Mr. Dunning is even more ambitious in this novel than his first with a plot that twists and turns as Janeway sets out to pick up a young fugitive in Seattle. But that is just the beginning of a mystery that takes him back in time as he uncovers murder after murder in some way connected to a 1969 edition of Poe's "The Raven."<P>At one point in the novel the character Huggins describes the writing skills of another character Trish Aandahl: "The woman is just a sorceress when it comes to words. There's a seductive quality to her writing that hooks you by the neck and just drags you through it. Just wait till you get started reading her book-- you won't be able to leave it alone." That could be a perfect description of the better part of this well-plotted book where only at rare times do you see Mr. Dunning's scaffolding.<P>Of course there's Mr. Dunning's opinions about the book business that I completely agree with, for example, the "anal-obsessive who defaces books: "You find a grand copy of an old Ross Macdonald and open it to see that some fool has written all over it, destroying half its value and all of its factory-fresh desirability. Why is a book the only gift that the giver feels free and often compelled to deface before giving?" "Even worse than the scribblers. . . were the name embossers." Finally, Dunning takes aim at "the remainder goons at the Viking Press." I have never understood why people in the book business insist on those awful remainder marks either. I get the feeling they would be just as happy retailing toilet tissue if the profit margin were greater.</span>

                    <span>Cliff Janeway, narrator and protagonist, is a former Denver cop turned book dealer. After a tantalizing prologue describing a series of 20-year-old unsolved murders featuring book collectors, the story begins with Janeway accepting a job to trace a woman who skipped bail.<P>It's not the sort of job Janeway would ordinarily take, but this woman has been accused of, among other things - like shooting - stealing a rare book. A book that doesn't, in fact, exist. Jetting to Seattle, Janeway captures the young woman easily. But instead of dragging her to justice, Janeway, charmed by her knowledge of rare books and intrigued by certain puzzles in the case, allows her to visit her family. The girl disappears and people start getting murdered.<P>Meanwhile, a number of collectors seem eager to get their hands on this non-existent book, an elegant edition of Poe's The Raven, supposedly done in the same year its small and specialized publisher died in a fire.<P>The plot grows complex but never incomprehensible. Janeway is a tough but tender sort who drops plenty of fascinating book lore among the bodies and chase scenes.</span>

                    <span>One of those few books that is written by an author at the top of his craft and is a joy to read. The plot is interesting, although somewhat confusing as its multiple layers build up toward the end. The cast of characters were (with few exceptions) memorable, well drawn and believable. Their interplay and dialogue sparkle. Dunning has a gift for advancing the story, and conveying detail, through the character's words; avoiding the lengthy descriptive paragraphs that other authors must use to propel their stories. Worth searching for.</span>

                    <span>"The Bookman's Wake" is an interestingly good follow-up to "Booked To Die" by John Dunning. Mr. Dunning's character, Cliff Janeway is a wondrerful sleuth that we learn more about in this outing, set in the beautiful state of Washington. We also learn more about the fabulous world of literature and the book business as well. At times, the plot gets complex when a rare copy of Poe's The Raven is up for grabs and anyone who has a copy of it, gets murdered. I felt that most of the characters were well portrayed and are quite memorable. Without giving the ending away, I felt that the loose-ends at the end of the story, could of been resolved a little better. However, a good story leaves a question or two unanswered to make way for the sequel, (if one is indeed in the works.) Also, life is full of mysteries and anyone who claims to have all the answers is either a charleton or a fool or both. The plot and characters return to me in different ways and continues to ask the never ending question; what makes complicated people do certain things? Some reviewers either loved this story or hated it. Either, or; this book makes you think twice about book the industry and the people who make books happen.</span>
