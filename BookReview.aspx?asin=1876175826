                    <span>This is a magnificent book... people might say that is pro-cuban biography but what we really have here is Che like the way he was... If you really want to know che this is the book you should be reading, pay no attention to the "gusanos" (the exiles from Miami that don't deserve to be called cubans)who don't like Che becuase he is a better man that all those "gusanos" put together... The reason Che will be present today and tomorrow is because his only dream was to liberate people all over the world without caring about skin color.
<br />Hasta la victoria siempre!!!
<br />Muerte a los "gusanos"!!!!</span>

                    <span>If you are tired of the same books on Che Guevara, this is the different book.  Formed by texts and images based upon Che's own life it follows mainly the same path of its biographers but in such a beautiful way it made his own daughter Aleyda (who rarely saw him) exclaim: "the photos in this book are so magnificent you feel a desire for kissing him, embracing him and keep talking to him" (she means with his own personal texts based in his own testimony).  
<br />
<br />The selection, prepared in the first hand with the remembrance of a lost love (by his widow) and in the other, by the professional eye of Victor Casaus (a Cuban cinematographer who had been many times a judge on international film competitions) you can follow Dr. Guevara from his childhood, young age, his travels, the Sierra Maestra up to his last days in Bolivia.
<br />
<br />Sorry, no Christ figure photo (in the words of its own editor).  Keep in mind this is a pro-Cuban Government book so you instead will find Fidel, but judge by yourself.  My only last opinion is that if this people can produce such a book in  a system so full of censorship, I do wonder what they can achieve in liberty!</span>
