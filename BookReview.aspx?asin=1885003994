Not only will it introduce you to the type of questions you may be asked, it will also get you to start thinking in a smarter way. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Wow!  This book is so much fun.  But I am warning you that it is also very addictive so make sure that you have the time and patience.  I would love to see some follow-ups since I'm almost all the way through.  Thanks!!!</span>
