                    <span>This is one book you must have in your j2ee collection or you can just forget it.  If you don't apply any of these patterns you are not going to have a designed system, much less a well designed j2ee system.  These guys have been through the dark and shed light on areas that we don't have to suffer through, like the back button browser solution.  Never thought you could solve that one on the back-end and be browser independent.  You want to know best practices, here it is, no other book comes close and within so few pages.  It's pricey all right, but you'll get all of that back in robust, maintainable code.  Can't beat it with a stick.</span>

                    <span>Without a doubt, the authors have spent a lot of time developing J2EE applications. While I've applied most of the patterns in one way or another in the past, this book brings them all together. If you're looking for ways to improve your existing J2EE architecture, or if you need to start work on a new project and want to do it right, read this book cover to cover first. 
<br />
<br />Core J2EE Patterns presents real-life examples of how to build web applications: from front-end patterns, to business object patterns, to integration and data access patterns, it's all here. It even presents strategies for refactoring existing applications to take advantage of architectural patterns. 
<br />
<br />In reality, you'll probably never implement every one of the patterns described in this book in a single application (or you'd be maintaining thousands of classes). But if you don't implement many of them, you're doing it wrong. The authors don't describe every possible J2EE pattern, but the patterns they do cover will undoubtedly make your application easier to design, develop, test, and maintain. </span>
