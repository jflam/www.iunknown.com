                    <span>I used Liberty and Power to teach the Jacksonian period to international students for a course on US History.  The book started right where Gordon Wood's "Radicalism of the American Revolution" left off with the splintering of the Democrat-Republicans and the emergence of the Democrat Party.  Because the book was not too long but still had some great ideas, it served very well as a textbook.  The book does not go into an excruciating amount of detail, so it may not be ideal for those who desire primary source material.  Probably Watson's best effort is seen in his description of the Democrat and Whig parties, their constituencies, and their platforms.  He shines in showing how contemporary forces led to the creation of these parties, and how they continued to shape them.
<br />
<br />I gave the book 4 stars because I am not entirely convinced by the message behind its title.  One could argue that the struggle between "Liberty" and "Power" began not with the Whigs and Democrats, but could be traced back to the Federalists and Democrat-Republicans over the First B.U.S. in the 1790s or even the Federalists and Antifederalists over the ratification of the US Constitution.  The National Republicans/Whigs can be interpreted as inheriting the Federalists' role as promoting the economic and fiscal strength of the nation.  Furthermore, Watson himself states that both the Whigs and Democrats, as the children of the previous Democrat-Republicans portrayed themselves as the champions of liberty, with the Democrats casting "big money" and corruption as the enemies of liberty and the Whigs struggling against what they interpreted as Jackson's absolutism ("King Andrew") and partisanship which the Founding Fathers themselves decried.  
<br />
<br />Watson could have written a little more in Chapter 7 on Van Buren, Harrison, and Tyler.  Quite a lot happened in these 8 years, including the rise of the railroads and the explosion of the Market Revolution.  The events of these years also led to the Mexican War, which itself would have profound implications on the future unity of the nation.
<br />
<br />I think the most important lesson learned from this book is how the American party system began, which has continued more or less into the modern age.  The reader will see the role which religion played in government even in these early years, along with anti-immigration and fear of big government among other political sentiments which exist even today.</span>

                    <span>Through this book I gained a better understanding of the politics of Jacksonian America. To call Liberty & Power a textbook would be a great injustice; Liberty & Power is more like a novel about a forgotten people and time.</span>

                    <span>It may be that "liberty vs. power" was the central political trope of antebellum times, but that doesn't make it an accurate description of antebellum politics.  Really, this book is a very simplistic account of  that pivotal period.  I suggest reading William Freehling's _The Road to  Disunion_ for a more nuanced view.</span>
