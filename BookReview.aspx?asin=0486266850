                    <span>Poe is a poet of great intensity and music, of haunting rhythm and obsessive feeling. This collection contains the lyrics he is most known for including the title- piece, his most famous work, the haunting 'The Raven'. But the rhythms of loss and longing and lament which play such a great part in his invocation of ' Lenore' who he will see nevermore, are also present in his 'To Helen' and his 'Annabel Lee'. And there will be other memorable lines as "The glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome " which will refrain in the reader's mind . Poe makes his readers sense an echo effect , and we hear and hear again his deep- beating lines. 
<br />And with them there comes too a sense of deep disturbance, a disquiet that is at the heart of America's strangest and most hauntingly gloomy great poet. </span>

                    <span>The Dover Thrift Edition of "The Raven and Other Favorite Poems," by Edgar Allan Poe, is a fine collection of work from one of the most remarkable figures in American literature.  The poems in this volume demonstrate Poe's total mastery of poetic effects: rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc.  He is inventive and versatile in his use of different poetic structures.  The many allusions mark this as the work of a truly brainy poet.<p>But it's not just his skill and intelligence that are characteristic of Poe.  He is also a poet of deeply felt passions.  This collection shows his appreciation of love and beauty, as well as his concern with loss and tragedy.<p>I'll just mention a few of the selections that struck me most.  "Sonnet--To Science": brilliantly expresses the tension between scientific and mythopoetic worldviews.  "The Coliseum": a thrilling exploration of the power of ancient ruins.  "The Haunted Palace": the rich language contributes to its fairy-tale like flavor.  "To My Mother": an achingly tender tribute to the speaker's mother-in-law.  "Annabel Lee": a hauntingly beautiful, yet disturbingly creepy poem of love and loss.  And of course, the unforgettable title poem.<p>Dive into Poe's poetry and you enter a realm haunted by both angels and demons--a world of sorrow and joy, of terror and intoxicating beauty.</span>

                    <span>I have read most of the American poets, both past and present.  For my money Poe is simply one of the best when it comes to rhythm and rhyme.  Plus his imagery and themes are so dark and foreboding that poems, such as his masterpiece "The Raven" will stand forever as immortal verses from this master of shadows and sheer terror.</span>

                    <span>I was first hooked on literature in high school, having before that been strictly a reader of sci-fi and horror. I was wonderfully surprised to discover Poe's tales and poems, not only because they catered to my love of the dark and disturbed, but because they were something altogether different from what I'd been reading! This book contains the poem that Poe is most favorite for and one of my long time faves, the Raven. But it also contains a wonderful assortment of other poems so that you get the full range of Poe's literary ability in one slim little book! Whoever put teen angst in such beautiful terms; "From childhood's hour I have not been/as others were..." If you're looking for a cheap version with a good cross section of his poetry, this is most definitely the book to pick up.</span>

                    <span>What can I say of "The Raven" that has not been said? Beauty and sadness, grief and romance...<p>Lamenting  the loss of a gentle but passionate woman, the narrator drinks, yet somberly dwells on her name. A local raven, with the capacity to utter like a parrot a syllable or two, repeats "Lenore," and "Nevermore." The narrator, tired and broken, believes the raven might be sent by God or even by the Devil, and tries talking with it.<p>The poem, like an long tale, draws the listener or reader to be in that lonely room.<p>Anyone who has ever been in love and lost that lover will known Poe's pain and supplication of god.<p>I fully recommend this book.<p>Anthony Trendl</span>
