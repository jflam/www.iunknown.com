                    <span>There couldn't be two more different places than New York City and the lands of the Maasai in Tanzania. Tepilit Ole Saitoti's story of his journey in and between these two worlds is fascinating. I am looking forward to the update he is writing now that he is a Maasai Elder. This insight into another land and culture is a gift.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book, very accurate and really worth the money. It gives the picture of a boy growing up as a real Maasai and the new life in civilized world of Germany and USA - a man between two cultures and the difficult question to decide which way to go along. Makes yourself wondering about the way we Western people are living and gives a chance to see our world with other eyers. <P>After having visited the Maasai area some months ago a good opportunity to compare facts with my own experience and found it even more interesting. Go for it!</span>

                    <span>I read this book 12 years ago and was so moved that I wrote a letter to to the author - something I have never done before or since. I was so struck by his ability to navigate between two cultures that seemingly had little in common. His book is a testimonial to the flexibility of the human spirit and the power of education. Last week, out of the blue, I received a telephone call from the author. Apparently, he had saved my address all these years. Saitoti is currently in the US as a visiting scholar. He will be speaking in various institutions and he has just started writing a follow up to The Worlds of a Maasai Warrior (The Worlds of a Maasai Elder). I have just shown him these amazon reviews. He is sitting here beside me and <BR>would like to take this opportunity to say: "Thank you to the reviewers of my book for such beautiful reviews and to amazon.com for posting such a wonderful display of my work."</span>

                    <span>I chose an autobiography of a Maasai himself, rather than an anthropologist's description, for my first reading about a people and part of the world about which I know nothing. Each page of Saitoti's book piqued my curiosity for more details and led me to search for more information. I can't wait to read his collaborative photo-essay (with Carol Beckwith) of the Maasai. The challenge of retaining cultural diversity in the modern world is well-articulated here.</span>

                    <span>I read this book as part of an anthropology course I was taking recently and was totally enthralled with it. Seeing American culture through the eyes of someone from such a vastly different background made for excellent reading. The depiction of the author's life in Africa was exceptional, making a Western reader, like myself, realize how many common threads we all hold with the whole of humanity. I cannot recommend this book enough.</span>
