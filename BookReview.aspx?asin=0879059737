                <span id="Label1">One of the most breathtaking realms of the world becomes an inspiration for design in this visual survey of the many bold styles of the African safari camp. The seduction of mossquito netting undulating in the wind; the romance of rich Oriental rugs on a lush savanna; the clasic civility of silver antiques; and the romance of a wardrobe trunk packed with lace are some of the defining elements of safari style.  Among the many locations that appear for the first time in pring are Hemingway's "Casa Matata", the traditional Finch-Hatton camp of luxury and romance and Africa's most exclusive camps:  Abu's Elehant Back Safari Camp in Botswana and the 1920's Cottar Camp in Kenya.  <P>Besides being a dream album for travelers, interior design photographs present creative solutions for the home that can be achieved with domestic mercnadise and ethnic crafts no matter how far you live from the majestic plains of Africa.  Radiant photographs so powerfully evoke this continent that one can alomost hear the grass russeling and feel the heat of the amber sun.</span>

                    <span>Libraries with strong sections on ethnic or modern architecture will want to include Bibi Jordan's Safari Chic as a unique presentation of over a hundred photos of exotic exteriors and interiors. African bush style goes modern in homes which profile decorating choices achieved through ethnic crafts and fabrics. The color photos are lavish and display many options and styles.</span>

                    <span>Bibi Jordan has managed to capture the true spirit of adventure in her new book Safari Chic. Not only do the wild exteriors and the mannered interiors inspire one to redecorate their physical surroundings but they resonate with the kindling spirit of rejuvenation and imagination. This is a traveler's delight as well. More books Bibi, more!</span>

                    <span>Upon first glance, Bibi Jordan's "Safari Chic" looks like a handsome, pretty-picture, coffee table, book that is ... just that; it looks good on an Ottoman in one's living room. Only, I have those types of books and was not prepared to buy another, hence my hesitation. But Africa is much more than an interest for me and so naturally I began to thumb through and shortly afterwards, lose myself in it. <P>The preface by Peter Beard - Mr. Africa himself - sets the tone for the unfolding of a modern day journey. Miss Jordan's safari takes us to those breathtaking sceneries where man is as much a part of nature as the elephants, hippo and lion. In doing so, she introduces us to the men and women who live in "the bush". These characters, some of whose families have been safari outfitters in Africa for 90 years, make up the real fabric of what Africa is about. In telling their story, we learn that safari is a way of life. Each camp has its own unique history. By understanding these people and how they live in harmony with their fellow Africans and wildlife, we are able to grasp the complete picture.<P>Miss Jordan weaves these fascinating personalities together into a wonderful narrative. Inspirational quotes from Karen Blixen, Ernest Hemingway, and others, and - yes, great pictures, make for an enticing read. <P>This book makes Africa real and for me, timeless. It makes you want to go there, and bring a piece of it back with you. The last chapter offers some excellent and affordable tips to decorating 'safari chic'. Popular stores like Pier One and The Pottery Barn can bring Africa to your fingertips.<P>As mentioned, many other African safari books are dictated by form and fashion above substance. "Safari Chic" is more than a decorating style; it's a frame of mind. From all of the famous quotes Miss Jordan uses, this one perhaps, sums it up best. <P>"All things considered, there are two kinds of people in the world: Those who stay at home and those who do not. The second are most interesting." <P> - Rudyard Kipling</span>
