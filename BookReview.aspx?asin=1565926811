                <span id="Label1">The <i>PHP Cookbook</i> is a collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for PHP programmers. The book contains a unique and extensive collection of best practices for everyday PHP programming dilemmas. For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or "recipe" -- short, focused pieces of code that you can insert directly into your applications. But this book offers more than cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.  The recipes in the <i>PHP Cookbook</i> range from simple tasks, such as sending a database query and fetching URLs, to entire programs that demonstrate complex tasks, such as printing HTML tables and generating bar charts. This book contains over 250 recipes -- a treasure trove of useful code for PHP programmers, from novices to advanced practitioners. Rely on the <i>PHP Cookbook</i> to provide quick solutions to common problems, so you can spend your time on those out-of-the-ordinary problems specific to your application.   </span>

                    <span>Among the PHP cookbooks in the market today, this one's good but lacks sufficient depth in coverage. It unfortunately has nothing more to offer than the PHP developers cookbook (II Edition). Infact,i found the latter to be more comprehensive and well-written. Another book, that is not actually labelled a cookbook, but is chockfull of completely re-usable solutions for web developers is the PHP4 Web Development Solutions book.</span>

And the best of this book - in my personal opinion - is, that by reading it, you will find a lot of problems/solutions/ideas you have not thought about before.<BR>Be warned: This book is not a real "help" for anybody who looks for the easy solution, but it will definitely help YOU to develop your site and develop yourself.<BR>Just buy it - it's well worth the money and if this book won't pay out, none will!</span>

                    <span>I have been programming PHP for a couple of years, and have lots of books on the subject. IMHO, I felt like this book serves the role of a "cookbook" very nicely. The contents are organized by language function via chapters (i.e. strings, numbers, arrays, regex, forms, classes, db, security, XML, etc...) which makes it convenient to find what you are looking for. Within each chapter, are very specific "Problem" and "Solutions" which contain simple code snippets (like 10 lines or less) and a description of what it does. Most problems are solved within one page. It is really concise and to the point. The index is comprehensive so it is straightforward to lookup the issue you are having, find the problem / solution and get on with your coding. You don't have to read thru lots of code or descriptions of why somebody setup a display template or complicated object. Look up your problem, read a quick solution, and BOOM, you're done and back to implementing it in your code.<P>I have read some other reviews for this book here that recommend the Wrox book, stating this one is too simple. I don't agree with this. The Wrox book appears to me to be another "... let's show you a bunch of full blown application examples ..." book to me, similar to the classic Welling and Thomson SAMS published text. The "cookbook" will not teach you the language, nor is that its intent; it assumes you know what you are doing.<P>This book is exactly what it says it is, a cookbook. If you need a quick solution to specific coding problems, at a fairly advanced level, it is a really good reference.</span>
