                    <span>T.A. Barron has said that writing this book spurred him to begin his epic "Lost Year of Merlin" saga. That said, "The Merlin Effect" is a book that is only similar to his high fantasy series because of... well, Merlin. The old wizard is only one source of magic and mystery in Barron's third entrancing novel. 
<br /> 
<br />Kate Gordon has been tooling around around near her dad's research vehicles in Baja, California. Her father, Jim, has come there determined to prove the validity of the ancient sunken ship, the Resurreccion, and the fabled horn of Merlin that it contains. The Horn of Merlin, the Serilliant, was once filled with a mer-king's gift: the gift of forever remaining young. And the "Ballad of the Resurreccion" mentions this horn. 
<br /> 
<br />Now Jim, Isabella and Terry, a marine biologist and an obnoxious sonar expert, are finding some very strange things in the vicinity of an enormous, never-ending whirlpool. When they set out to find out more about the whirlpool, Kate finds herself on the Resureccion -- with a strange old monk who has lived down there, kept alive by the presence of the horn. Now they must find the horn, and battle the evil enchantress Nimue, before a rupture in the ocean floor destroys all of them... 
<br /> 
<br />T.A. Barron has made a reputation for himself with his lush, imaginative fantasies laced with little bits of myth and legend. And "Merlin Effect" shows how he can take even seemingly silly ideas -- the horn of Merlin on an old Spanish ship? -- and make them plausible fantasy plots. He also gives a few new twists on Arthurian legend, bringing the character of Merlin forward in time without silly gimmicks. 
<br /> 
<br />Barron's writing is typically lush here, with ornate descriptions of the California shoreline and the strange, eerie interior of the shipwrecked Resureccion (an apt name for the ship, considering the horn's effect). He makes the story come alive with little details, sounds and smells and colors; the message of the book is in the true effect of the horn, which will come as something of a surprise. And little tidbits of real Celtic legend are woven in, such as the various treasures at the climax. 
<br /> 
<br />Thankfully, Barron doesn't "wise-up" Kate to the point that she seems unreal. Rather, she seems like a teenager who has seen and experienced too much to not be intrigued by the strange and surreal. Merlin himself is pretty easy to spot, but the way he fakes doddering eccentricity is amusing to read. Even the malicious Nimue is given a bit of extra dimension, when Merlin reveals that once she was good and selfless. 
<br /> 
<br />T.A. Barron's "Merlin Effect" is a worthy predecessor to the "Lost Years of Merlin" and "Great Tree of Avalon" series, a solid fantasy-adventure full of beauty, magic and color.</span>

                    <span>This week I would like to talk about the new T.A. Barron book THE MERLIN EFFECT.<p>Like Barron's last book that I reviewed this one has the feel of a very good juvenile.  Although while the hero is a ten-year-old girl, it is very easy to forget what her age is.  All that really matters is that she is with her father on a research trip.<p>This book tells the story of a new chapter in the myth of Merlin.  A sunken Spanish ship off of the California Peninsula coast may contain a treasure often called the Horn of Merlin.  Unfortunately the wreck is near a huge whirlpool, thus making direct investigation a chancy affair.  Time is at a premium as the local government is uninterested in extending the research visa.  Soon it is noted that there is something unusual about the area.  The local villagers claim to be hundreds of years old.  A pod of whales circling the whirlpool seem to be deliberately singing to jam the sonar equipment used to find the ship.  Unusual fish though to be extinct show no signs of aging.<p>A mishap at sea leads Kate, her father and the rest of the research team to the bottom of the sea where they encounter merfolk, monsters of the deep, the Glass House, Nimue, Merlin himself and an ancient treasure ship.<p>The story moves quickly and the plot twists frequently.  I found THE MERLIN EFFECT to be a very enjoyable read that, while on the light side, does not lack for substance.</span>

                    <span>I will start by saying that I am HUGE T.A. Barron fan. If there is anyone looking for an amazing fantasy story packed with adventure, T.A.Barron is the author for you. Even though this book starts out a bit slow, it progresses steadily until you can't put it down. This is the third book of his with Kate Gordon as the main character,  and it is terrific. This time, her adventure takes place underwater, with an ancient monk, a legendary ship, a massive whirpool, songs of the whales, magic, and much more. READ THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>The Merlin Effect is a great book that includes a fantasy, mystery, and a adventure all in one! Kate and her father travel to Baja California where they are trapped in a mystery about Merlin. When Kate and her family are swallowed by a whirlpool wierd events start to happen including Kate's dad and Isabella, a marine biologist who came along on the trip, are captured by a sea witch. The story has an exciting ending with a surprizing twist.</span>
