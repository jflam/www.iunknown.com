                    <span>I first read the Social Contract back in college.  Then, it was but one piece of philosophy/political writings out of many.  I ran across the book again a few months ago and decided to give it a second reading.  I was very happy that I did.  In these uncertain times, the truth and role of government becomes cloudy.  Rousseau's work helped to remind me that the government should serve the people and humanity in general.  This is an idea that really seems to have been lost, especially under the Bush administration.  Although I do not agree with everything Rousseau writes, I would recommend this work to anyone to read this and reflect on its modern context. "Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains."</span>

                    <span>This work attests to the application of human freedoms within the<br>context of organizational structures and governmental institutions . The author explains how the general or collective<br>will intervenes when it is proper to do so. In addition, the will<br>is believed to be omnipotent. In the long run, states tend to act in ways that promote self-preservation and perpetuation.<br>Governments are divided into democracies, monarchies, royalties<br>and in other organizational frameworks consistent with accomplishing a variety of missions. The State is far removed<br>from the family. Nevertheless, it is charged with promulgating<br>laws and conventions agreeable to the general or collective will.<br>This work is an important contribution to comparative governmental organizations and structures. It explains the<br>applicable rationale for implementing political distinctions<br>of virtually every variety and type.</span>

                    <span>This is a valuable historical document, because it shows us the thinking that led up to the French Revolution.  Rousseau wrote: "Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains."  What Rousseau means by this is that Man is born free in the State of Nature - it is society, government, and urban life that are the corruptive forces.  Without those things, Rousseau argues, man would exist in peaceful co-habitation.  What is striking to the modern reader about this claim is how blatantly wrong it is.  Rousseau was trying to refute Thomas Hobbes who wrote that the State of Nature is the same as the State of War.  Apparently Hobbes got the better of the argument because, as soon as the French Revolution took effect, peaceful liberty went out the window in favor of the Reign of Terror.<p>But, back to Rousseau.  He claims that, even though men in nature peacefully co-exist, it is more beneficial for them to come together to form a society.  Thus they SHOULD come together and form a Social Contract.  The ideal contract for Rousseau would entail the individual GIVING UP ALL HIS RIGHTS on entering the contract with the understanding that he will get them all back from the Sovereign.  Who is the Sovereign?  Well, for Rousseau, the Sovereign is the People.  If Rousseau's Ideal State were an organism, it would be a large one-celled organism with no differentiation.  This is very much unlike Hobbes' Leviathan, with the Sovereign at the head and each part assigned its individual task.  For Rousseau, only the SOCIETY AS A WHOLE has the right to govern.  <p>Of course, this system is incredibly unwieldy, that is why - in Rousseau's world - there are a whole bunch of little city-states, like ancient Athens.  HERE COMES THE SCARY PART.  Once the whole population gets together and makes a decision, that decision is infallible.  "THE GENERAL WILL CANNOT BE WRONG."  Those minorities who are disaffected by this general rule shall be "FORCED TO BE FREE."  In the case of the French Revolution, that was the freedom of one's head from one's shoulders.<p>According to Simon Schama in his wonderful book, Citizens, the importance of the Social Contract has been overestimated.  Rousseau's love of the State of Nature (which was the spirit of the French Revolution) had more of an effect on the public through his novels Emile and La Nouvelle Heloise.<p>The Social Contract must be viewed in its historical context as a piece of history in itself.  If one reads it for philosophic reasons only, it will come of sounding either frightening or painfully na√Øve.  One sentence caught my imagination however - Rousseau saw the island of Corsica as the perfect candidate for his ideal state.  "I have a presentiment that this little island will one day astonish Europe."  It did.  It produced the greatest warlord the world had ever seen - Napoleon.</span>

                    <span>'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision. An individual who owes everything to the state cannot conceivably be called an 'individual.' They are, rather, reduced to being an automated cog in the wheel of human motion. Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective. This cannot be right. Minorities must be protected. If not, they will find a way. However, I agree, as Orwell did, that there must be a rejection of 'every form of man's dominion over man.' We are equal but different. This paradox resists neat hyperbole.</span>

                    <span>Deeply influential book, "The Social Contract" is a "must read" for anybody interested in the history of political ideas, or even in history. It had a big influence on the French Revolution, and in many movements after it that considered that the individual owes everything to the state.<p>After reading this book you will be astounded by the insight that Rousseau (1712-1778) showed.  He explains us, among other things, the reason for the formation of political society, and the origin of the social contract.<p>I believe this is a good book to start a study on political ideas. It is simple and well written, it has had an important political impact and can make you curious enough to know more. If you are interested, read also a book about the history of political ideas (for example the one written by George Sabine), because it can guide you to other interesting books, and can give you a deeper insight into the ideas, circumstances and life of Rousseau.</span>
