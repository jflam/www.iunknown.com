But enough with the small stuff: In <i>Barranca</i>, Eddie is called upon by the U.S. government to go after a South American economic terrorist threatening the only commodity capable of destabilizing the entire Western Hemisphere.<br><br>Yes, Manuel Villa Lobos de Barranca is out to corner the market on coffee.<br><br>When a grande (small) cup of Starbucks hits $20, riots break out in cities and towns all over America, worker productivity plummets, and the very fabric of society begins unraveling. But there's nothing the government can do about it because the scrupulously honest and upright de Barranca (Stanford, '96) is running his revolution without firing a shot or breaking any laws, which makes him the most dangerous subversive since Gandhi.<br><br>But he's nuts about golf, positively fanatic about betting, and that's where Eddie Caminetti comes in. Armed with only fourteen weapons of mass destruction (the most you're allowed to carry in your bag), he sets up a match against de Barranca on which hangs the very fate of Western civilization.<br><br>In the hands of master storyteller Troon McAllister, impending doom has never been more fun.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This is not your usual Eddie Camenetti golf adventure. In fact, the golf is very much a side piece to the book. It is much more of a comment on the foibles of our governments, the media that cover them and what motivates both told in very biting satire. The structure of the story is interesting. In the first section of the book we read "the beginning of the story." In the second part we are told the "end of the story." At the end we are told "the middle of the story." Of course, it is the middle that makes all the rest understandable.<P>Some of the characters of the book are very entertaining, perhaps none more so than the GNN "war correspondent" Mona Bertram who might just remind you a wee bit of CNN's "war chick", Christiana Amanpor. <P>To outline the story here would spoil the read. It is a clever effort and sometimes it is a bit too clever. Other times it hits home with some truths that make you pause. When the Secretary of Homeland Security is asked by the president's chief of staff if he can help in a situation, it is pointed out that he "was happy to do anything, as his was a thankless a job as any to be found on the planet and he was always on the lookout for things, however small, that might earn him some recognition or gratitude. Like people who cleaned toilets or maintained computers, his success was utterly dependant on absolutely nothing bad happening, and when it didn't, nobody noticed. It was only when the plumbing backed up or the operating system wiped itself out or a building got blown up that anyone paid any attention and then all manner of hell would pour down and the trouble free years to that point wouldn't even be a rounding error in the balancing of recriminatory accounts." <P>Eddie is more fun when doing his thing on the golf course and hopefully he will be returned there for the next effort.</span>

                    <span>I'm convinced: There's no better writer in the sports novel genre than Troon McAllister. This is only the latest in a string of wonderful books that can be read on any of many levels. The social satire is cutting edge, the story is as thrilling as anything by Clancy or Follett, and all the while the belly laughs just keep on coming. A book to be savored, and as highly recommended as they come.</span>

                    <span>I have mixed feelings about this one. The premise is great, and it starts out laugh out loud funny with a steady stream of the author's wry, tongue in cheek humor. About one-third of the way in, the cleverness slows down markedly and the story gets told. Finally, at the end, we get the real story that is almost preachy and serious.<P>Don't get me wrong. I really liked this book, and I considered giving it a 5. The cynicism toward politics and the media are absolutely on target, but something about the changes of pace and the preachy tone took a bit of the edge off for me. <P>The Green and Scratch are both better.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>While Homeland Security and the department of defense fight a global war against terrorism, most Americans feel the latest OPEC oil manipulations not quite realizing that this time it is more than supply control as third world demand dramatically has increased. However, a greater threat to world peace occurs when, Manuel Villa Lobos de Barranca corners the coffee market. The problem the administration faces as the public screams for impeachment between coffee party riots when Starbucks hits double digits is that Manuel has scored his coup following American capitalist principles he learned at Stanford. <P>The CIA and the FBI consider Manuel as the world's greatest threat and know they must intercede, but he broke no laws and conducted his caffeine takeover above board. Normally that would not stop them from filtering Manuel by taking him out, but the world is watching what they do to a South American who applied acceptable Bush economics to take over the coffee business. Desperate, as the government runs on coffee, the Feds turn to their greatest weapon, golf hustler Eddie Caminetti because Manuel trusts him and loves the sport. Equipped with fourteen WMD clubs, Eddie plays Manuel for a cup of coffee.<P>BARRANCA is cutting edge satire that takes shots at the double bogie American economic policies and the war against terrorism. The story line is fast-paced and witty and never slows until the final holes play out at Camp David make that Trump. Eddie is a terrific golfer, but this time he shares the 18-holes with Manuel. Fans of golfing stories that consist of aces, eagles, and sand traps will appreciate Troon McAlister's fourth hole tale.<P>Harriet Klausner</span>
