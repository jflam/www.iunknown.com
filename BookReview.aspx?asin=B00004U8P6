                <span id="Label1">"Antwerp!" For science fiction fans, the long-awaited VHS and DVD release of <I>The Lathe of Heaven</I> is a dream come true. This haunting adaptation of Ursula K. Le&nbsp;Guin's genre-classic novel was broadcast but once on PBS in 1980 before rights and other legal snafus relegated it to the archives. Reportedly PBS's most requested program, the made-for-TV film was at last rebroadcast in 2000. Set in Portland, Oregon, in the near future, <I>The Lathe of Heaven</I> stars Bruce Davison as George Orr, who, to put it mildly, has a dream problem. Not only do his dreams come true, but they "change reality back to the Stone Age."<P>Kevin Conway costars as Dr.&nbsp;Haber, a dream specialist who instantly recognizes George's gift and tries to harness it to make the whole world right. But, as George notes, "Unlimited power means unlimited danger." The increasingly megalomaniacal Haber uses George to try to cure the world's ills, from overpopulation to war, resulting in, for starters, a devastating plague and even alien invasion.<P>Many in this production went on to projects familiar to audiences: Cowriter Diane English went on to create TV's <I>Murphy Brown</I>; Scott Rudin, credited with "Principle Casting," is now one of Hollywood's most formidable producers; Margaret Avery, who costars as a skeptical lawyer who comes to believe George's incredible tale, was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in <I>The Color Purple</I>. For those who have only been able to see this now-legendary production on poor-quality bootleg tapes, this release will be sheer heaven. The DVD contains an interview with Le&nbsp;Guin conducted by Bill Moyers. <I>--Donald Liebenson</I></span>

                    <span>..when the news of PBS broadcasting this TV movie on public TV back in the late summer of 1979, I read the reviews in the paper about this unusual sci-fi movie, which to me, had the veins and hints of the ITC 1968 TV limited series, "the Prisoner", with Patrick MaGoohan - the story of "dehumanization."
<br />
<br />Thus, I set up my VCR, had a new tape in the machine and captured this one-performance event, that would escape us for all of these years until the announcement of the DVD release was made, which was like a re-encarnation of sorts in bringing out such a rare yet classic piece of film history.  As I watched this film while capturing it on tape which was presented in its entirety (which was unheard of in those days to see a movie on air TV without commericals. Yet, of course, this is PBS..), I sat with extreme awe on how deep and powerful this movie was and how the story evolved with character development, the plot and the ending.
<br />
<br />True, if this story was ever remade as a feature motion picture, it would never have the charm and originality as this original PBS release.
<br />
<br />I still have that original video tape of this film that I made in 1979.</span>

                    <span>If God is everything, then everything is God. Without ourselves, the universe as we know it would not exist. Each person is a unique prism which fractionates the rays of life into a unique experience. Therefore, we are God. We have infinite power if we choose to have it because we are capable of thought. Thought is energy. Energy is mass. Mass is force, and force creates change. Through what you would call the "butterfly" effect, a simple intangible thought can change the entire universe (read about the Hologram Theory). All you have to do is seek that which is inside us (opposite of materialism). That's the power of dreams, a connection to Man's deep subconscious, but  in order to obtain it, one has to achieve Balance. George Orr has balance. Balance is freedom, but balance varies from individual to individual, and what makes Orr different from the mad scientist is that the mad scientist would push his sense of balance on others, while Orr would let others achieve their own balance. The mad scientist is totalitarianism. Orr is freedom.
<br />
<br />Imagine infinity as a sheet of paper. Balance is a straight line from one corner to the opposite corner, resulting in the longest line possible. Imbalance results in a line that deviates and is therefore shorter. We want to have the longest line possible, and that line can be measured by years, quality of life, experience, whatever we choose. Balance is individualized. 
<br />
<br />Great movie.</span>

                    <span>We've only been waiting 20 years to see this movie again.  Apparently, this movie had quite an effect on people.  So much so that it is PBS' most requested movie to date.  It was only aired once 20 years ago but everyone who saw it remembered it.  PBS finally aired it in 2000 twice in a row (during one of their pledge drives) and people ran frantically all over the house to find a blank video tape so they could record it and called their friends to tell them it was on again.  In interviews with the original cast, it came to light that even they couldn't get copies of it.  Bruce Davison said that people have been begging, pleading and bribing him for a copy for the last 20 years but he didn't even have one himself.  To have this movie on DVD is sheer heaven since it will last a lifetime.
<br />
<br />Lathe of Heaven is quite a strange tale.  Imagine being afraid to sleep because every time you dream, you changed the world.  That was the world for George Orr (Davison) and the mad shrink, Dr. Haber, that tried to control Orr's power.  Of course what Dr. Haber asks George to dream and what George dreamt are 2 different things.  Haber continually tries to correct what's been dreamt up with disasterous results.  I don't believe the whole story needs to be retold here.  You should just watch it to see what all the fuss is about.  You know all you need to know.  There were no big budget special effects.  No elaborate sets or costumes.  Still folks were dying to see it again.  This movie was redone and broadcast in 2002.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't the original.  Margaret Avery's role of Orr's attorney was played by Lisa Bonet in the 2002 version.
<br />
<br />I suggest that you buy this before it runs out of stock.  You wouldn't want to wait another 20 years to see it now, would you?
<br />I can't believe it's finally out on DVD.  Oh happy day!!!!!</span>

                    <span>Great movie, one that I'd always heard of, but had never seen. Well, until I learned they put it on DVD! It's one of those movies that's aged well - not visually, of course, but because the strange late 70's production values (low budget, shot on video) add a certain other-wordly flavor, which is perfect for an other-wordly story like this. The video quality is fuzzy and blurry and dark, and they explain before the movie is shown that the original materials for the movie have been lost forever and they were forced to rely on a 2" video tape copy for the DVD transfer. But the muddy look truly does add a nice flavor to the story, and for me it's one of the reasons this movie is so re-watchable. I've read about others complaining about the acting, but I thought everyone was great, except for maybe the black lawyer lady - she makes a few scenes feel awkward with her laid back delivery of her lines. I also have read people complain about the electronic music they use. Again, I think this is a benefit to the atmosphere and story, since to me it's eerie and feels lonely. Which is how the character feels in this changing world of his. Anyway, I loved this movie, it's much better than the remake they did last year (talk about bad acting), and it has a big rewatchability factor. You'll never hear the word "Antwerp" the same way again!</span>
