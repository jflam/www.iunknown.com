                    <span>REAL MAGIC is another work by Dr. Dyer that literally had me absorbed and excited and reading along with highlighter in hand (Which is my highest accolade I suppose).  This book contains all sorts of strategies for bringing magic, coincidence, and miracles into everyday life...so that these things become everyday occurances.  REAL MAGIC is a real source of bound inspiration - the kind of book I read and think "Oh yeah, this is what I need to do to get my life back on course."  It reminds me of who I truly am.  It's very applicable and very readable and is about miracles yet very much grounded in the real world...which is something I look for in books of this nature.  Dyer covers every aspect of life from finances and health to addictions to relationships and of course the basic "goals" of happiness and fulfillment/discovery of life purpose.  Dyer is an expert not so much at giving ideas but awakening ideas...and yet it seems fresh and not simply a rehash of thousands of other books out there.  That combo is priceless and it sure works for me.    </span>

                    <span>Having read a number of his other books, I picked this one up, and was pleasantly surprized at how much this book was able to strike an inner cord with me. There are many good books on the subject of self awareness, but this is one of the best that I have found so far. This one connected.</span>

                    <span>Hello,<p> I must say this is one of the most profound books I have ever come across. I happen to be a Hindu and a student of both Western and Indian Philosophy but I have seldom come across a book so deceptively simple yet so breathtaking in its insights. I can honestly say that this book has proved to be an invaluabe aid to my life's problems of many many years. After many years of searching answers in the pages of Russell, Foucalt, Santayana, Plato or even in my earlier "desi" favourite Deepak Chopra, I owe Dr. Dyer my profoundest gratitude to bring this book to my life. Dr. Dyer, You are an angel, may you come back again and again to spread light, joy and peace in this world. This man, Dr. Dyer, are one of the true "peacemakers" and truly he shall be called a "child of God". Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.</span>

                    <span>This book is so profound that I actually find it difficult to sit down and write about it because I feel intimidated that I cannot give it the justice it deserves and won't be able to aptly express my appreciation of this little yet very profound spiritual gem.<br>I first read this book about 10 years ago.  It was the 1st spiritual book I had ever read.  Within a few days my life was completely transformed.  Yes, I said a few days.  Just from following Wayne's very simple advice.  It is so simple, it can actually be deceptive.  We tend to brush these very simple principles off for more "intensive" teachings.  We want something that gets into things like past psychoanalysis or something more "complex" that involves a lot of either writing journals, goal setting or some very "deep" philosphy that is usually quite dry but we force ourselves to read these things due to how supposedly "deep" these thinkers were.<br>Then comes along a little book like "Real Magic" that is basically just teaching you that we can align ourselves with 'purpose'(realizing that we are spiritual beings having a human experience)and living every moment aligned with that and living our lives based on cultivating 'Knowings' instead of fear and doubt.  <br>Of course that is just an abbreviation of the teachings, but those are the 2 main points that continuously come up throughout the whole book.<br>I don't know how Wayne managed to do it, but please trust me when I say this book is a very, very special book.  I have read almost all of Wayne's book and they are all a variation of the same spiritual theme, but for some reason, I find this book to be just so effective, simple and magical. Even more than all his others to date.<br>Now, even though I said that it changed my life in a few days, that does not mean that I didn't have huge challenges from the time I discovered 'Real Magic', times where I gave up on these teachings and dismissed them due to being "overly simplistic".   No matter how many times I feel that way, I always eventually come back to the foundation of these teachings and realize that these universal principles are so profound, life changing and spiritually enlightening.  <br>What I've learned over the years are 2 main things about this book: not to read this book as just another pop "positive thinking" book.  That is not what makes this book magical.  What makes it magical, is that Wayne found a way to create an extremely accessable book that will bring you closer to Spirit and the power of 'knowing'. The second thing is that like anything else, it takes a certain discipline and persevearance to make this work for a lifetime.  It doesn't just "click" for life.  There are times when one needs to really use the muscle of intention to keep it together.  That is sometimes overlooked because we think that it should just 'flow' always.  It doesn't quite work that way. However, eventually, your connection to Source deepens more and more and your connection becomes effortless most of the time.<br>This is really a book about finding your true essence and manifesting miracles in the physical world.   The outcome is joy and peace and a world where your deepest desires pop up and you manage the coincidences of your life...I'm not exaggerating when I say that!! <br>You are Light, Spirit and Magic, this book will very simply teach how to access that domain of Heaven on Earth.</span>

                    <span>"Real Magic" formed the amazing first step in a 2 year spiritual quest for me that has transformed my life from the inside out.  It launched me on an amazing process of exploring the ideas presented between it's covers and provided me with wonderfully useful ideas as I referred to it and re-read it over and over again during that period.  I don't expect ANY one book to hand me all of life's answers on a silver platter, or to answer all the questions that it raises in my mind and heart.  What this book provided for me was a mix of insight, ideas, inspiration and guidance that was an invaluable aid during my own journey of exploration, discovery and revolutionary change.   I wouldn't recommend that anyone look to any one book to answer all of the questions they have about life FOR them ... but if you're motivated to explore the possibilities of your own life and are looking for a great place to start and a book that will provide wonderful insights along the way as your mind begins to grasp your own full potential, this is a book I can strongly recommend.   I consider it one of the keystone books in my growing library of inspirational references.   Both thumbs up!</span>
