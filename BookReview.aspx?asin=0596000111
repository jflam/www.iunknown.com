                <span id="Label1">The suite of utility applications that Unix users and administrators find indispensable--Telnet, rlogin, FTP, and the rest--can in fact prove to be the undoing of interconnected systems. The Secure Shell, a.k.a. SSH (which isn't a true shell at all) provides your otherwise attack-prone utilities with the protection they need. <I>SSH: The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</I> explains how to use SSH at all levels. In a blended sequence, the book explains what SSH is all about, how it fits into a larger security scheme, and how to employ it as an everyday user with an SSH client. More technically detailed chapters show how to configure a SSH server--several variants are covered--and how to integrate SSH with non-Unix client platforms.<p>  As befits its detail- and variation-rich subject, this book comprises many specialized sections, each dealing with some specific aspect of use or configuration (setting up access control at the account level, for example, or generating keys for a particular SSH server). The writing is both informative and fun to read; the authors switch back and forth between text and entry-and-response listings from SSH machines. They often run through a half-dozen or more variants on the same command in a few pages, providing the reader with lots of practical information. The discussion of how SSH fits into a Kerberos Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is great, as is the advice on defeating particular kinds of attacks. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>The Secure Shell (SSH) for installers, administrators, and everyday users <li>SSH design and operation <li>Server setup <li>SSH agents <li>Client configuration <li>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration <li>SSH1 <li>SSH2 <li>F-Secure <li>OpenSSH for Unix <li>SSH1 and SecureCRT for Microsoft Windows <li>NiftyTelnet SSH for Mac OS</ul> </span>

                    <span>SSH:<P>- A complex and hard to master protocol (protocols).<BR>- An invaluable defensive weapon against several types of attacks.<BR>- In short time, SSH will be the 'de facto' privacy standard for remote connections and transference.<P>The Approach:<P>Three extraordinary introduction chapters, clearly and well written, lead you step by step into SSH internals. Several clever graphics, and a lot of basic definitions makes these chapters absolutely self contained.<BR>The rest of the chapters are carefully dedicated to issues related to implementation and use of SSH, and to ports to several Operating Systems.<P>The Book:<P>540+ Pages well structured into 17 chapters and two appendixes.<BR>Clever conventions, and a very useful 'Which Chapters Are for You' guide.<BR>Plenty of 'real world' examples and 63 pages of special case studies.<P>The Covered Protocols:<P>- SSH1.<BR>- F-Secure SSH1.<BR>- OpenSSH.<BR>- SSH2.<BR>- F-Secure SSH2.<P>The Intended Audience:<P>Quoting the authors: " We've written this book for system administrators and technically minded users. Some chapters are suitable for a wide audience, while others are thoroughly technical and intended for computer and networking professionals."<P>The Bottom Line:<P>Being a computer security professor, I constantly assign to my students complex laboratory works related to SSH. Well, with the only help of this book, they usually succeed in their tasks and even improve the original projects.<BR>It is a worthy book and really deserves to be purchased.</span>

                    <span><P>I find too often that SysAdmins simply slap a pre-configured SSH onto their systems and do not truly understand how it works. Tasked with implementing SSH at my UNIX site, I found this book to be useful both in understanding SSH, and actually configuring it. This book is heavily weighted towards SSH1 and SSH2 and provides a wonderful amount of detail. However, I found it's coverage of OpenSSH to be lacking. I had to search the internet for a good deal of supplementary material to get OpenSSH working the way I wanted it to.<BR><P>I truly enjoyed the books explanation of how a secure channel is established before login occurs. This explains the "magic" of the authentication process that is so integral to SSH. Its explanation of publickey authentication is also excellent. It helps you to really understand what SSH is for and how it can be used. <BR><P>Examples are a bit too cluttered at times and are lost on the reader. I was also expecting a better explanation on how to "implement and administer" SSH at my site. For example, creating SSH packages and keeping known_host files updated. I have found the most useful information on these topics from various internet articles.<BR><P>If you're truly interested in the inner-workings of SSH, I would strongly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>SSH, the Secure Shell: The Defintiive Guide is another great book from O'Reilly. As the name would suggest, however, it's not so much a meant as a tutorial or a howto as it is an in-depth analysis of SSH's workings, though the examples given could probably be used as the former.<P>The first chapters of the book begin with a lookat what SSH is, a summary of its general uses, and the differences between the various SSH implmentations. It then quickly moves onto a number of practical examples, with explanations of both the 'how' and 'why' behind the examples. <P>Some of the more interesting examples are those that demonstrate X11 tunnelling, key management, and how SSH can be integrated with other applications (such as PGP, for example). <P>One of the major faults of the book is in the writing style. The regular switching back and forth between a conversational tone and a serious, technical one was something that I found rather annoying. But other than that, this is more or less a well-rounded and nicely written book on SSH, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in this topic.</span>

                    <span>I had some experience with ssh prior to purchasing this book, but picked it up to learn about more advanced topics like key pair generation for unattended ssh tunnels.<P>The content of the book is ok, but the organization is horrible. The authors mix SSH1, SSH2 and OpenSSH and it is easy to get confused as to which files or commands belong to which. To add to the confusion, OpenSSH now appears to support SSH2 protocol so a lot of the file names don't match up. That makes the book a little out-of-date.<P>The biggest complaint is that there are no "cookbooks". I wanted to do something well-defined and relatively common. There was a section suited specifically to what I wanted. However to ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT the technique, I had to flip back and forth between 5 different sections, plus infer some information about file contents.<P>There are few complete configuration file examples. There are snips of files scattered throughout a section - again making for a lot of navigation through the book to assemble sufficient information to get the job done.<P>The index is marginal, which makes this poorly-suited for a reference manual.<P>In all, a real disappointment for a O'Reilly book. The editors must have been asleep at the wheel.</span>
