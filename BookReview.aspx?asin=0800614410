                    <span>"Strength to Love" woke me up. 
<br />
<br />It made Dr. King so much more real. It contains some of the most powerful teachings on how to love in situations where it is difficult to.  Not love -in the romantic sense - but rather, in a much deeper way - as in love of humankind. Of Christ-love. Just read his sermon on "Loving your enemies": he starts with the difficulty of reconciling this commandment, and finishes with a flury of passion exhorting us to make this commandment real when he starts with the words "To our most bitter opponents, we say...". It's not just the banter and broad strokes which he uses so magnificently to generate his passion. He also gathers support from folks such as Emerson, Napolean, Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche and the Bible of course. All of this to convey a sense of urgency to show how low we all have come, and at the same time to inspire us to a place where we can go. 
<br />
<br />While you may not agree with what he says, you must admire and respect what he says. Dr. King's messages aren't easy to digest- but he says the right thing - which is not always, the easy thing. Even though these teachings were written over 40 years ago now, his messages in "Strength" are no less relevant and more important than ever. </span>

                    <span>In the popular eye, Martin Luther King, Jr. is best known for his work in the Civil Rights struggle during the 1950s and 1960s; his public speeches and public acts are part of the general pattern of American history.  However, his ability at public speaking came largely from his experience as a preacher in Black church - the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. had a 'day job' as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and as part of this task, he regularly delivered sermons to his congregation.  This is a collection of 15 sermons, illustrating major points of King's theology and sense of social justice.
<br />
<br />This book has a foreword by King's daughter, Coretta Scott King, who speaks of this book as one that is most influential to others - the primary feature of King's theology and practice, nonviolence, is contained here.  King's sense of justice, the love of the divine, the interconnectedness of all peoples in the human community, and King's ultimate sense of optimism come through the powerful words of these sermons.  
<br />
<br />King's words often take conventional phrases and ideas and bring out new meanings.  King's ideas of the practical meaning of being a nonconformist, or of loving one's enemies, put new interpretations on these ideas.  King talks of the difficulty of being a nonconformist, and the echoes of the Transcendentalists such as Emerson and Thoreau are present, as are theologians such as Niebuhr.  King does not speak of the kind of simple nonconformity that typifies teen-age rebellion and angst (which is, in itself a very conformist kind of nonconformity), but rather a working against the prevailing norms of society toward a transformation in love and furtherance of the gospel message.
<br />
<br />King states that of all Jesus' commands, the command to love one's enemies is the most difficult to follow in practice.  King looks not only at the question of how, but also why should we love our enemies, concluding with the observation that 'love is the most durable power in the world.'  Love, being a creative and transformative force, is the greatest hope for lasting and meaningful peace.  Quoting Napoleon Bonaparte, who built a great empire, he observes that all empires and authorities that rest on force are destined to fail, but Jesus' empire built on love continues generation after generation.
<br />
<br />King risked unpopularity among the dominant white culture of America; this is well known.  However, he also risked unpopularity among his own community (and risked giving the powers that be further ammunition against him) by delivering sermons such as 'How should Christians view Communism?' and not giving a unilateral condemnation of the same.  This was a perilous stand to take in Cold-War America.  Admitting the problems with Communism, King was equally honest about the shortcomings of Capitalism, and wrote, 'We who cannot accept the creed of the Communists recognize their zeal and commitment to a cause which they believe will create a better world.'  King takes both Communism and Capitalism to task for failing to appreciate the social aspect of humanity, concentrating more on the Enlightenment-generated individual.
<br />
<br />This is no simple Baptist preaching - King's erudition shows through without being oppressive or condescending; he weaves in references from Greek and Roman classics, Shakespeare, English and Continental philosophers, the Declaration of Independence, and American writers with grace and ease, all the while maintaining a close attention to the primary biblical message.  King doesn't engage in prooftexting, but does provide a new hermeneutic (for the time) that provides foundation for more recent liberation theologies of diverse strands.  
<br />
<br />Perhaps pride of place goes to the final sermon in this collection ('and the last shall be first'), which is King's 'Pilgrimage to Nonviolence'.  King gives a brief spiritual and intellectual autobiography, talking of his quest for understanding from fundamentalism to liberalism to neo-orthodoxy and beyond; he gives credit to examples such as Gandhi and the people of bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama as proof that nonviolent action can have dramatic, lasting and beneficial power for the whole community.  The sermon ends with hope for the future, a future we are called to continue to build.
<br />
<br />This is a text to be read again and again, as the words remain fresh and powerful even as nearly half a century has passed since their first utterance.  There is inspiration for our time as well as a glimpse of times past in King's sermons.  It is worthy of a place in history, and deserves a place in the future.

                    <span>i first picked this up in college, and got it again this year because it couldn't possibly have been as great as i remembered it to be, but lo!  it actually is.
<br />
<br />i'm a committed secular humanist who has done a great deal of bible study, and who likes narrative jesus 'the guy who turned over tables and said what he meant', without buying into the 'resurrected son of man' part.  king in these speeches talks more clearly, honestly, truthfully, and eloquently about the jesus I like than anyone i have ever read or heard.  it's about jesus the temperate, jesus the considerate, jesus the revolutionary, jesus the useful and applicable to all people, not just christians.  it's an amazing thing, what king does here.
<br />
<br />this is not to say that he's not talking about the other jesus, too -- he is.  but in most of these sermons, the qualities that king highlights are the ones that are pragmatic and applicable to his particular struggles, things like pacifism, steadfastness, and courage to speak truth to power.  these are all christian values, too, i suppose, but they're really just human values, i think.
<br />
<br />so, no offense jesus people, but i think that this is a book of sermons from a guy who knew that jesus was bigger than just being the annointed.  as he exists in the gospel narratives, king draws jesus as a model *human*, independent of his messianic qualities.  this is an *amazing* book.</span>

                    <span>I have bought and given this book away to friends because it clarifies Christ's stand on civil rights and the role of race.  The book also eliminates many public misrepresentations of my Lord.  It does this by simple demonstration of how King applied Christ's understanding, the wisdom of the ancients, and the prophets, in the practical matter of getting along; a way of seeing. The book is the history of a beginning, practical, and timeless.  Finding these three attributes simultaneously is a sure sign that we should pay attention.  This is a book worthy of your attention.  Read it in prayer.</span>
