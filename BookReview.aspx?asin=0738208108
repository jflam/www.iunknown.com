                <span id="Label1">The first scientific exploration of those animals, from honeybees to gorillas, whose abilities should entitle them to legal rights as persons.  <P>Are we ready for parrots and dolphins to be treated as persons before the law? In this unprecedented exploration of animal cognition along the evolutionary spectrum-from infants and children to other intelligent primates, from dolphins, parrots, elephants, and dogs to colonies of honeybees-Steve Wise finds answers to the big question in animal rights today: Where do we draw the line? <P>Readers will be enthralled as they follow Wise's firsthand account of the world's most famous animal experts at work: Cynthia Moss and the touchingly affectionate families of Amboseli; Irene Pepperberg and her amazing and witty African Grey parrot, Alex; and Penny Paterson with the formidable gorilla Koko. In many cases, Wise was able to sustain an extended conversation with these extraordinary creatures. No one with even a shred of curiosity about animal intelligence or justice will want to miss this book.</span>

                    <span>Steven M. Wise's "Drawing the Line" presents a compelling argument for recognizing the rights of "nonhuman" animals. As a lawyer who has taught at Harvard and has championed animal rights for over twenty years, Mr. Wise directs our attention in this book to some of the recent scientific studies pertaining to animal intelligence. The evidence strongly suggests that at least some species qualify for dignity rights and other legal protections.<P>Mr. Wise provides introductory chapters that succinctly defines the struggle for animal rights. The author compares the historic practice of slavery with today's plight of nonhuman animals. Deep-rooted socioeconomic practices conspired to keep slavery alive for most of human history; today, animal slavery is fueled by longstanding cultural and economic forces. Consequently Mr. Wise approaches the daunting task of animal liberation with eyes wide open. He has written this book as a strategic move to further our understanding and with the hope of advancing the struggle. <P>To that end, I would have to say that Mr. Wise has succeeded brilliantly. The author employs a sound methodology to persuade us of the merits of his case. Mr. Wise rank-orders the intelligence of nonhuman animals by utilizing Piaget's well-known theories pertaining to the study of early childhood development. Consequently most of the chapters in the book are devoted to the study of specific animals (such as Koko the gorilla) who might represent the innate abilities of their respective species. You will be intrigued with how Mr. Wise utilizes Piagetian measures such as mirror self-recognition tests in order to compare animal performances with human intelligence.<P>I think that nearly everyone who reads this book with an open mind will be persuaded that at least a few species do indeed display the characteristics of "practical autonomy" that should assure them of rights under the law. Mr. Wise visits with leading researchers to demonstrate the mental acuities of specific animals; in many cases, we come to appreciate the unique personalities of these remarkable animals. The power of Mr. Wise's writing is such that the notion of subjecting these animals to cruel scientific experiments and the like seems unthinkable, and liberation suddenly appears to be a quite reasonable and humane thing to do. <P>In short, I highly recommend this compassionate, original and thought-provoking book to everyone who cares about animals. While the legal system may not yet have recognized the validity of Mr. Wise' argument, this book will no doubt help the good lawyer secure a favorable ruling in the court of public opinion.</span>

                    <span>This is the book which introduced me to the world of animal intelligence and emotion. In Steven Wise's book, he dedicates chapters to an African Grey parrot, a pair of dolphins, an elephant matriarch, an orangutan, Koko the gorilla, Wise's own family dog, and even spends a chapter describing the intricate communication of honeybees. Wise is a lawyer, and so his goal in the book is to analyze whether or not these "nonhuman animals" (I love that wording!) fit the criteria to deserve rights under the law. Some of them do (by his estimation), and some of them don't... but Wise's writing style draws you in and his stories about the various animals he meets are fascinating (my favorite was Alex the parrot). Animal lovers will feel vindicated, and those who are unsure on the subject of animal rights may find themselves swayed by Wise's strong arguments. The writing is a little scientific at times, but the book is well worth the effort!</span>

                    <span>This is a ground-breaking book. Read it if you love animals, read it if you hate animals. I garuntee you will learn a lot you diddn't know. I have an African Grey Parrot myslef who is extreemily intelligent, so when flipping through the book for the the first time, I was delighted to spot the chapter 'Alex'. Alex is an African Grey who is famous throughout the bird world for his intelligence. Naturally I read this chapter right away, and was worried that the rest of the book would not live up to the expectations I developed from reading 'Alex' However; the rest of the book was fantastic. I have a brand new understanding of non-human animals and the rights the should have.</span>

                    <span>The argument in this book, and in accompaniement with the author's earlier Rattling the Cage, is of tremendous importance and deserves heartfelt endorsement at step one before examining some possible difficulties in the probing analysis of man--as much as the animal. To become human, ironically, requires the compassion of real men, and more the understanding of what constitutes man's will, and therefore the earliest signs and prophecies of man in the animal realm, where the same dilemma is shown by author to confront the chimpanzee, and other threshold creatures. There the mirror of our autonomy, or lack of it, challenges the mystery of the animal in ourselves. This work breaks new ground in the sense that it explores the narrower realm of the grey zone between autonomy and true self-consciousness as the ground of right, beside the broader argument proposed by such as Singer where the basic issue is simply the question, 'do animals suffer'. <BR>The definition of human autonomy is a dangerous precipice that might exclude man, and thence we should in some wonder and caution see the plight of creatures as much in ourselves. It is a critical point since the Nietzschean theme concealed behind social politics is far stronger in history than we suspect, with the consequence that man has himself suffered the condemnation and peril that his is still animalistic. <BR>If I have one problem here with the argument it is that the author's assumptions about Darwinism confuse the issue,perhaps. Evolution, as an idea, has taught us to see the continuum between man and animal. And that is to be applauded next to the confusions of some aspects of the Christian tradition with its arrogance about man. But as a theory, more restricted than the perception of evolution, Darwinism cannot establish the nature of man's consciousness or autonomy in a zone beyond the reductionist, and ascribes the very cruelties of nature to the mechanism of evolution, a proposition that has become dogma and yet is probably false. We must renew the question, how did man evolve, and how will he bring forth his latent autonomy. Then the plight of 'mere creatures' will become transparent. Since this is also a legal question, in the life and death matter of drawing the line, we should ask if Darwinist thinking as to selectionist will stand up in court. We cannot make this excuse for conflictual extinction exempt from examination, in such legal discourse. <BR>What is the basis for establishing right at all in the competition of species, if natural selection is taken in such confused fashion as the source of ethical or conscious advance. The argument here in the book tends to collate two realms of discourse. Otherwise a superb effort. <BR>I recommend wrestling with this argument, beside the more general stance of the compassionate embrace of all forms of sentient life as one. The author's novelties are both ambitious and fruitful. <BR>Simply doing that much, will 'throw light' on the obscurity of our thinking in this travail of all sentient life. That causes change, slowly but surely.</span>
