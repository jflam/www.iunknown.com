                    <span>When I first started to explore Anza-Borrego, it was with obscure stories that were loosely related to even more obscure maps. It was extremely difficult to find a book with good and concise information about this wonderful place without having to read a novel-like book. This book has cross-referencing so you will never miss a thing. Places, people and occurrences are listed alphabetically and contain great stories along with location information. Definitely a must if you are exploring Anza-Borrego and care to do more than simply rip around in the dust.</span>

                    <span>Anza-Borrego A to Z is both an interesting and informative book on the Anza-Borrego desert area. I especially liked the organizational format used by the author. Lindsay's Introduction gives an overall historic summary of the area followed by an alphabetically listing of people, places and things relevant to the Anza-Borrego Desert. The author's encyclopedic entries with links to related entries will meet the needs of both the average reader and those interested in a more "in depth" study of the area. <P>Anza-Borrego A to Z contains a wealth of information and will be especially helpful for: readers who would like more in-depth information about the area, guides who lead hikes in the Anza-Borrego Desert, people who love the desert environment and those who have just been introduced to the beauty and wonders of Anza-Borrego. <P>Lindsay substantiates her dedication to Anza-Borrego by her pledge to donate all author royalties to the Anza-Borrego Foundation!</span>

                    <span>Anyone who has ever had any contact with the Anza-Borrego region, or anyone who might even have an interest in going there someday, will enjoy Anza-Borrego A to Z. Diana Lindsay has compiled an encyclopedia of information on the area that will be the standard reference work for many years to come. Only through years of contact and relationship building with a region can someone produce a book like this. <P>Lindsay has arranged her book alphabetically in the form of an encyclopedia. To look up information, turn to the subject and there it is. Cross-references at the end of each entry direct the reader to other related entries and an extensive index also aids in the discovery process. <P>However, the book is more than just an encyclopedia. Lindsay's prose makes the history of the desert come to life. As in her 1973 book "Our Historic Desert", hard to find facts and local historical gems are interwoven to form an intimate look at one of the most historically significant regions of the Southwest. Written as a companion to the guidebook "The Anza-Borrego Desert Region", co-authored with her husband Lowell, the Lindsay's now have compiled the most up to date information on the Colorado Desert regions of eastern San Diego County. When you hold these books in your hand, you're actually holding a historian and knowledgeable tour guide wrapped up in between the covers. <P>I had anticipated the publication of this book for quite a while, and when I finally had my copy, I came home and sat on the couch, planning to simply skim the book and get a feel for it. Several hours later, I discovered that I'd simply been reading through the book, page by page. This is definitely not your average compendium of encyclopedic facts!</span>
