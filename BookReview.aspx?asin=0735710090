                <span id="Label1">In <I>Hackers Beware</I>, Eric Cole succeeds in explaining how hackers break into computers, steal information, and deny services to machines' legitimate users. An intended side effect of his documentary efforts is a feeling for how network-connected computers should be configured for maximum resistance to attack. Cole, who works with the attack-monitoring SANS Institute as an instructor and security consultant, conveys to his readers specific knowledge of offensive and defensive weaponry as well as general familiarity with attack strategies and good security practices. <I>Hackers Beware</I> is a good primer and really earns its price by going into enough detail to enable readers to actually <I>do</I> something to make their resources safer. It also enables its readers to understand more specialized security texts, including Stephen Northcutt's fine <I>Intrusion Signatures and Analysis</I>.<p>   Cole's didactic style is largely conversational, embracing the fact that most computer exploits can be conveyed as stories about what hackers want and the steps they take to achieve their goals. He punctuates his prose passages with line drawings that clarify what gets passed among the machines involved in an attack, and pauses frequently to show programs' user interfaces and passages from their logs. Cole explains all the jargon he uses--a characteristic that alone distinguishes this book from many of its competitors. <I>--David Wall</I><p>   <B>Topics covered:</B> What motivates black-hat hackers, and the technical means they use to go about satisfying their ambitions. General attack strategies--spoofing, password cracking, social engineering, and buffer overflows, among others--are explained, and the tools used to carry them out are catalogued. The same goes for defensive tools and practices. </span>

                    <span>I am a senior engineer for network security operations. I have attended Eric Cole's excellent SANS classes and consider him a professional acquaintance. "Hackers Beware" is a welcome contribution to the security community. Although some of the material is redundant, you're bound to gain new insights on network intrusions by reading this book.<P>The message of "Hackers Beware" is clear: prevention is preferred, but detection is mandatory. To discover intrusions, one must understand the tools and tactics of the adversary. To this end, "Hackers Beware" devotes chapters to information gathering, spoofing, session hijacking, denial of service, buffer overflows, password security, access preservation, and log cleaning. Some of the material in these chapters is based on the "practicum" required of SANS students.<P>My favorite section, without doubt, was chapter 17: "Other Types of Attacks." It features many valuable essays by SANS students on BIND NXT exploitation, cookie-based overflows, SNMP enumeration, and other topics.<P>Publishing student material has its drawbacks, however. "Hackers Beware" is repetitive, a sin given the book's page count (778). Why include yet another explanation of buffer overflows in chapter 14, for example, when a whole chapter (7) already discusses them? (Actually, Brent Hughes' work in chapter 14 is more enlightening!) Furthermore, the "fundamentals" of UNIX and NT chapters are much less informative compared to Ed Skoudis' chapters in "Counter Hack."<P>I also recommend New Riders help the author overcome his addiction to "three phrase sentences," such as "Now the Internet is very popular, and everyone is using Linux because it is powerful and inexpensive, so the number of people beating on the system is very high." (p. 480.)<P>Future editions should reduce the number of vulnerabilities described in favor of more thorough explanations of sample exploits. For example, a virtual reprint of cDc's advisory on a NetMeeting weakness teaches me very little; providing background on the coding, system calls, and principles of this exploit is more useful. I would also pare the student-based material down to the essential core, removing generic material discussed elsewhere.<P>I'd almost buy "Hackers Beware" for chapter 17 alone, so I'm sure security professionals will find many reasons to enjoy this book.<P>(Disclaimer: I received a free review copy from the publisher.)</span>

                    <span>There are four main kinds of computer security books:<P>1) Books containing large enumerations of known vulnerabilities and attacks.<BR>2) Books covering the theoretical related aspects.<BR>3) Books on computer forensic areas.<BR>4) Some kind of hybrids of two or more of the above.<P>'Hackers Beware' is a well balanced hybrid of 1) and 2) categories.<BR>I think of it as a sort of Hacking Exposed (the book) enriched with theoretical background and detailed explanations.<P>In the plus side, this book offers:<P>- Well structured by kind of attacks and by kind of Operating Systems. <BR>- Well written chapters on Fundamentals of Unix and NT.<BR>- The author, a recognized specialist and SANS' high rated instructor.<BR>- Full of well documented analysis of relevant exploits.<BR>- Discussions (although short) about 'Rootkits', 'Buffer Overflows' and 'Covering the Tracks'.<BR>- Chapter 17, 'Other Types of Attack', specially for the PGP ADK Exploit presentation.<P>In the minus side:<P>- As a book relaying on 'current' exploits, it could easily be short-lived. If future additional editions are scheduled (a la Hacking Exposed)...OK, else ...Beware!<P>- Chapter 18, can be found (updated) in the Internet. Chapters 19 and 20 are just fillers.<P>I use this book mainly as a reference book for my (undergraduate) students.</span>

                    <span>I'll be brief. If you are a layman, and you don't have much expertise in the computer security field, then read this book. "Hackers Beware" does assume some prior general knowledge about networking and software, but anybody who's taken a few courses, or had a bit of on-the-job experience will be able to follow along quite well.<P>Even better, if you are a business owner, and are worried about the security of your network (and believe me, you should be), then reading this book will give you the added advantage of being able to communicate intelligently with you network security personnel. Further, after having studied this accessible tome, you will be able to discern as to whether your networking people actually know what they are dealing with (sadly, some don't. You know 'em and I know 'em. Yes, I'm refering to the PAPER MCSE's). Being able to speak intelligently with your employees, and put your heads together in solving the formidible problem of network security, will be of limitless benefit to you.<P>All in all, an understandable, mostly-in-plain-English book that will behoove all who read it.</span>

                    <span>I am not a system admin nor do I play one on TV. However being a computer professional, I have an interest in the topic of network security, and how crackers and "script kiddies" infiltrate network systems. This book offers a wealth of network security information that even "novices" like myself can easily follow. And in some of the examples Cole discusses, it's almost scary to discover how easy it is for someone with even a little bit of knowledge to infiltrate a computer network. Cole's book while dauntingly large contains a wealth of information that any security professional should know about. One of my sys admin friends was commenting to me that books like Cole's allow the "script kiddies" to learn about exploits without doing any of the work that a "black hat (cracker)" or "white hat (hacker)" might do to exploit a system. However big a risk that may possibly be, I still feel it's best for any security professional to be informed about all the various types of exploits they may deal with. And with a book of this size, there are obviously lots of them to discuss.<P>Cole discusses exploits against Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Windows NT and the myriad of programs (password crackers, network sniffers, back door programs, etc.) designed to break into other people's systems. Each program is described in full and what it does. Cole also offers suggestions and solutions in various chapters to keep unauthorized users from accessing various systems.<P>While you will never be 100% safe from an "attack," Cole's book offers ways to keep your system from being attacked or ensure that the chances of it actually happening remain remote, or the "damage" from such attacks stays minimal.</span>

                    <span>Although this book is useful to both beginners and security administrators, it is written so beginners can get a great understanding of what hacking is about and how to protect against it. The examples are thorough and provide step-by-step screen shots as to what happens during a certain exploit. It also tells the counter measures for each attack therefore enabling you to combat such an attack.<P>This book is a definate "must read" for anyone currently involved in or who wants to be involved in computer/network security.</span>
