                    <span>This squat 350 page book is filled with practical advice for anyone tasked with the administration of one or more Windows servers. It covers simple remote machine management, Active Directory, IIS, and the truly annoying Windows DNS issues. Screen shots are kept to a minimum and graphics are used effectively. Concepts are explained but not rat-holed and the topics covered are practical. The only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect ranking are the often longish code samples that are not annotated and could be referenced on the site as opposed to included in the text.
<br />
<br />A must have for starting Windows administrators, definitely worth the look for experienced ones, particularly because of the condensed practical nature of the text with Microsoft Press books so often lack.</span>

                    <span>OK...so maybe I'm a bit biased because a) I'm in the book, b) I wrote the forward, and c) there's so many myITforum.com columnists highlighted in it, but dang it if this isn't a great book!  I got my early copy and just started parsing through the pages.  Mitch has done a great job putting this together.  The book is laid out in a logical manner and has excellent solutions for Windows Server administration. You can stick with your fruit and salad books -- I'll take this one.  This book has beef!</span>
