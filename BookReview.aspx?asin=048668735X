                    <span>To paraphrase Chandrasekhar's review of Watson's Bessel functions text, this is "a veritable mine of information... indispensable to those who have occasion to use point-set topology." I don't think this book is intended to be a text (& I think the authors say so), in which case it would be terrible because it doesn't explain the concepts very much. It's mostly a catalogue of every kind of set you can come up with, every kind of topology you can put on it, and what properties it has such as what T_i axioms the space satisfies, whether it's compact, para compact, etc etc. Most of the time such things are proven, but be prepared to think hard sometimes about the proofs or fill in details. I'm the kind of student where I have trouble understanding things which are highly 'counter-intuitive' so I had trouble proving things, even when I knew definitions, when I did topology for the first time last term. Once I saw this book though I got used to all the weird things in topology (like the ordered square, R in the lower-limit topology, Sorgenfrey plane, etc etc). This book is incredibly useful as a reference.</span>

                    <span>A distinct characteristic of point set topology is that it thrives on counterexamples. In fact, if you thumb through any point set topology text, almost all the theorems are in the form "If the space X is A,B,C, then the space is X,Y,Z". The point of point set topology is too determine what A,B,C are, and whether that is the minimal condition. "Can we take condition B out? Maybe hypothesis C can be weaken considerably?" How can we answer these questions? You're right, by counterexamples. Students who really wants to master point set topology should know the various counterexamples (no matter how contrived or unnatural they seem), and while textbooks usually present a counterexample to show why Theorem Three Point Five Oh will not work on weaker assumption -- most students (and teachers, too) tend to skip these parts. A collection of counterexamples presented in this book (excellent organisationm, by the way) is an essential supplement of a topology course, and it might make people 'see' through the whole thing.</span>

                    <span>This book has examples in it that are "missing", so to speak, from many regular topology books. It aims to shore up some of these shortcomings, with examples that the student can see and understand. There are charts and graphs, as well as a detailed explanation. Some "problems" often found in regular topology books are solved. Very few proofs, if any, are given. This is not a book meant to be studied without a regular textbook on topology, only to be used as an overall review of problems and short basic premises of topology. Use this in addition to your regular fare, but keep it close at hand when doing homework or preparing for an exam.<br>   There are fundamentals on Cantor's Theorem, the countability or uncountability of sets, compactness, closed and bounded functions, open sets, continuity, connectedness, etc. All these are basic to topology, and this book does address them, but in a brief way. It then shows a basic overview of topology that helps greatly to understand the different fields of topology.</span>

                    <span>As a graduate I encountered a book called "counter examples in analysis" which I found very useful.  I always  dreamed of such a book in topology, this book exceeds my dreams. It is great.  It does not cover all the examples that I have used over the decades but it does cover some that I have never seen.  The style is quite readable for a professional topologist.  The book goes into a lot of interesting details (and some while not interesting to me would be another person).  In short for me it is an essential book.  The question is to whom else would this be interesting to. It is clearly of little use to a first year student and less to more advanced student.  It's brand of topology is not the current cutting edge.  So the audience for this book is limited to a small group and for these people it is top notch.</span>

                    <span>This book gave me an inspiration: it isn't the best written or the best organized, just one of the best topology books I've ever found! It gives you an idea of the areas of topology  in a way that is very good and very  understandable.</span>
