                    <span>I read this entertaining book on Thanksgiving Day and am so thankful of the message the Author tries to deliver. Sure, the story can be edited down in some places, but maybe the wacky sense of humor keeps you read on. Well, some people like shortcuts while others prefer the scenic routes. Bottomline is you can finish this book in about 3 hours. And that's not a lot at all if that 3 hours spent will improve the quality of your life. At the end of my reading, I (a typical procastinator) actually took some action just exactly as the Author advised. And I'm confident that the future me will be more successful, more passionate and definitely happier (just like Mack, Monica and George in the story). Buy this book, read it, AND DO THE EXERCISE AT THE END. Your wish shall be granted!</span>

                    <span>I'm a fan of Jon Spoelstra's work since I accidently picked up Marketing Outrageously.  This is the second of his work, and again the author grabbed me in the first chapter.  Three hours later, I finished the book.  It was full of insight, similar to Who Moved the Cheese.  I highly reccomend this.</span>

                    <span>I thought Writers Group review was a little snotty.  I read the book and I really loved the story and it jolted me into doing some new and terrific things.  As for it being short, I liked that.  I've lent the  book out and people have read it in one sitting, got inspired and thanked me for it.  My review isn't as a professional critic but one from somebody where a book made a real difference in my life.</span>

                    <span>This book may be only 149 pages long but at times you feel like you are reading War and Peace.  I am in no way suggesting that this book is a classic nor is it my intention to disrespect the classic War and Peace.    The fact is that a majority of this book is simply filler.  This book  should have been edited down to at least one half of its current length.   Ironically, the long drawn out, choppy style of the book not only takes  away from the message of the book, but also runs contrary to it.   Again,  the author's message is a worthy one.   It is the idea that one should  "wish for success in what they do for a living."  The author's point is  success in one's work leads to joy and happiness in all areas of life.   In  the last chapter and epilogue of the book the author does a good job in  describing the steps involved in attaining success.  Simply, you must get  an "oil change, lube job, and tune-up" on a regular basis.  I do not feel  it is fair for me to give the rest away.   Nevertheless, save yourself the  time and money and just read the last chapter and epilogue in the  bookstore.     <p>If you really want to read small books of this genre that  are packed with solid advice throughout it then I suggest you take a look  at the masters in the field, Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson.   I  personally like One Minute for Myself, Who Stole my Cheese, the Precious  Present and Big Bucks.</span>

                    <span>It's difficult to keep up with the best and brightest in today's oversaturated book market.  I've spent hours trying to find the truly great books and this is one of them.  If your looking for something that you can  use in the next millenium this is the book for you.  If you really want  ideas you can use, whether your a business owner, manager or employee this  book will help you get the most out of your "dreams".  Oppossed  to making my employees write personal mission statements they don't believe  in, this is a must read.</span>
