                    <span>This book is great. It contains a wealth of information that is not found in other books. It is probably not the best book to read first if you are just starting out, because it can make eBay seem a bit overwhelming. This book is worth buying.
<br />
<br />After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:
<br />---Beginner with eBay and computers---
<br />1. The Official eBay Bible
<br />
<br />---eBay Seller---
<br />1. Sell it on eBay
<br />2. eBay Hacks
<br />
<br />---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---
<br />1. eBay Strategies
<br />2. eBay Business the Smart Way</span>

                    <span>Ah eBay. Purveyor of treasures and reliever of junk. Is there a bigger garage sale in the world? I think not! But there are many ways to make it easier to make your "millions" on eBay then the old fashion way. (You still have to "earn it" however.)
<br />
<br />Within this list of 100 tips and tools you will get an insider's look on how to become the most effective buyer or seller on eBay you can be. Being a novice myself, I learned more from this book than all the other eBay books combined. It cuts all the cutsie fluff and gets to the business end of the eBay: making you money.
<br />
<br />An easy start is getting the eBay Toolbar. You should already be using the Google Toolbar so you know how much easier the eBay Toolbar can make your buying and selling. But for me selling was my main focus in eBay Hacks and I was not disappointed. I found how to automate sending my payment instructions using built-in PayPal service that I didn't even know existed. The then there was the prepaid mailing slips that will save me hours of time in line at the Post Office. But wait, I found out that I could generate these prepaid shipping labels from my PayPal account also. What doesn't this marriage between PayPal and eBay NOT bring forth? 
<br />
<br />But the one that will probable make me the most money is using The Merchant and Editor Kits on eBay. On them I can create search boxes and category listing that I can host on my own web site and make going to my or other's auction a breeze; and I get paid for them doing so. Now how cool is that?</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent for both the novice and experienced eBayer alike.  Everyone who uses eBay regularly should be able to take something away from this book.
<br />
<br />As a previous reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and come straight off the ebay site.  However, its great to have these tips in one place and easily referenced.  This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling procedures.
<br />
<br />The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'.  This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction).  This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.
<br />
<br />This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.</span>

                    <span>eBay Hacks isn't a 'how to use eBay' book, and it doesn't try to be. Instead, it's a great collection of strategies, advice, and software tools to be used when buying and selling on eBay. I have already increased my sales and found new ways to save time creating auctions. And for buyers, there are sniping and searching hacks. The code is a little over my head, but maybe someday... Altogether, an awesome book, and a must for anyone who uses eBay.</span>

                    <span>I have been selling for 5 years and have 6000+  rating with 100% positive.  If I had read this book first, I would have been scared away, thinking eBay was too complicated.  I leave feedback as soon as the person pays...they have fulfilled their requirement.  Pictures must be clear and fill the entire field.  Scanning small items works well for the beginner without a digital.  EBay Hacks gives much time to the details of picture taking with film.  If a person has a film camera, they know how to use it.  And I can not imagine someone using my photo in their sales and if they did, I doubt that I would know.  Mr. Karp says they use his and he has had to deal with these people.  I use Multi Block Storage for my canned messages.  Free for a month to try it out and then $10.00 one time payment.  This is the only money I have spent on frills.  Did the cut and paste recommended by eBay Hacks for several years and it works fine but Multi Block is better.  But NEVER put a negative in your canned messages as eBay Hacks recommends.  He recommended giving it lots of space so you don't copy and paste it by mistake.  Negative should be written fresh each time and from the facts of that sale.  It should be so rare that you do not need a short cut to save time.  People should start slowly to see if eBay is for them.  Some people just don't have the temperament for listing, waiting for payment, packing, mailing and living with the clutter of packaging materials and items to list.  Mr. Karp had a lot of information for the beginner that would help avoid costly mistakes...like putting in a counter that can slow the loading of the page and avoiding noises and wall paper.  But I think the book should have had a beginners section with the balance of the book written for after sellers got their eBay feet wet.</span>
