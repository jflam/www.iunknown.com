                <span id="Label1"><P> James Stanfield is, without question, one of a kind. He boasts Clint Eastwood's rugged good looks, but he's been to places no movie would ever send a star. He's a natural diplomat, equally at home in an Appalachian farmhouse, a Bedouin tent, or a papal palace. He's an adventurer, a raconteur, a perfectionist...and, more important by far, one of the world's most outstanding, most respected photographers. <P> This extraordinary record of more than three decades behind the lens celebrates a career that led the White House Photographers Association to name him Photographer of the Year in 1970, 1977, 1982, and 1988 -- just 4 of the over 40 major awards he's won. His work has taken him from the bottomlands of the Potomac River to the Himalayan heights, from Native American powwows to the incense-filled temples of India. He has traveled the globe to document the glittering allure of gold and the skittish, hidden world of rats. And, always, he has produced superlative images that capture the very essence of his subjects. <P> <I>Eye of the Beholder</I> presents 120 examples of Stanfield's finest work, along with his own account of how he created it. You'll accompany him as he makes friends with Vatican prelates and Chinese peasants; you'll hear his inimitable stories of adventure and artistry, and, best of all, you'll see through his keenly observant eye, famous among his colleagues for its ability to discern both the grandeur of the simplest of people and things, and the simple wonder with which the greatest art begins. <P> As Stanfield would be the first to tell you, it has been a glorious and satisfying experience from start to finish, and in this extraordinary book, you have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share the glory and the satisfaction alike. This is a man gifted as few men are -- and <I>Eye of the Beholder</I> is his generous present to the world.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite photography books. It covers 30 years of images made by James Stanfield of the National Geographic. The book explains what led to Stanfield making each photograph, which adds greatly to my appreciation of this book. The section on the "Human Connection" will enrich your soul and the entire book is a celebration of life.</span>

                    <span>As a fan of National Geographic, I always look foward to the spectacular images. This book has plenty of colorful, moving images. But I found myself wanting more images like those in the chapter "The Human Connection". Images of people that gave insight into their lives. My other wish was that we would see 'fresher' work. The images for the most part have been published over the years in Nat. Geo. Magazine. So if you are a subscriber, you will recognize many of the images.<P>The cover is a mesmerizing image and I wanted more of those images and less of landscapes and macro work of stoneware and such.<P>I don't regret buying it and there are many things to like. His vision, use of color and the output of his camera leave you wondering how can he get that kind of quality on film.</span>

                    <span>In the fall of 1959, I attended a U.S.Army photography school at Fort Monmouth,New Jersey with a young man named JamesStanfield who's ambition was to be aNational Geographic photographer. Wow,did he ever succeed! If you care aboutphotography and/or the world, I highlyrecommend this beautiful book.</span>

                    <span>Pack your bags and head off on a 30-year quest to the ends of the earth with Geographic photographer Jim Stanfield! Take a look at the world through the "eye" of a true artist!<P>His photos will knock your socks off, as you might well expect; National Geographic's never published a book entirely devoted to one photographer's body of work before. But equally precious are the insights you'll get from the photos' captions and absorbing text. <P>Then, when you're through, set the book aside for a few days, and read it again when you're in a completely different mood. You'll see things that you never even came close to seeing the first time around! <P>Guess that's what they mean by great art, eh?! <P>Only one complaint.....haven't heard when the sequel's coming out! Hope we don't have to wait another thirty years!</span>
