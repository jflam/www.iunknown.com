                <span id="Label1">Oracle system performance inefficiencies often go undetected for months or even years--even under intense scrutiny--because traditional Oracle performance analysis methods and tools are fundamentally flawed. They're unreliable and inefficient.    Oracle DBAs and developers are all too familiar with the outlay of time and resources, blown budgets, missed deadlines, and marginally effective performance fiddling that is commonplace with traditional methods of Oracle performance tuning. In this crucial book, Cary Millsap, former VP of Oracle's System Performance Group, clearly and concisely explains how to use Oracle's response time statistics to diagnose and repair performance problems. Cary also shows how "queueing theory" can be applied to response time statistics to predict the impact of upgrades and other system changes.  <i>Optimizing Oracle Performance</i> eliminates the time-consuming, trial-and-error guesswork inherent in most conventional approaches to tuning. You can determine exactly where a system's performance problem is, and with equal importance, where it is  not, in just a few minutes--even if the problem is several years old. This book cuts a path through the complexity of current tuning methods, and streamlines an approach that focuses on optimization techniques that any DBA can use quickly and successfully to make noticeable--even dramatic--improvements.   The price of this essential book will be paid back in hours saved the first time its methods are used. </span>

                    <span>In a style that will be appreciated by the beginner, intermediate and advanced DBA/Developer, Cary and Jeff introduce the reader to the world of the Oracle wait interface. This book has depth, the contents are full of meat, and it's not a rehash of every other Oracle book published in the last 10 years. In these pages is something for everyone. Cary introduces the wait interface, and how it can be used for tuning. The book presents the topic in a clear and concise fashion. <P>The book is full of detail such as concise information on the internal workings of Oracle trace files and how to use them to your advantage when tuning your Oracle database. They demonstrate the power of the 10046 event and it's potential.<P>Putting all of this together into a performance tuning method he calls Method-R, they lead us from tuning by guess work into a world of facts and using accurate measures to generate appropriate tuning responses.<P>This book IS required reading for any DBA who wants to be elevated to the level of a tuning deity. I've already dog eared a goodly number of pages!</span>

                    <span>If you want a quick checklist of whats wrong with your Oracle systems - do not buy this book. <P>If you want validation of your existing tuning techniques - so not buy this book. <P>If you want to be told what to do without thinking - do not buy this book. <P>If on the other hand you are fed up with received wisdom that does not work, you recognize that performance tuning is a valuable skill for your business and you wish to learn an effective scientific and repeatable approach to improving the performance of your business systems, don't just buy this book but live it. Cary and Jeff take a rigorous, scientific approach to performance tuning that is especially suited to Oracle systems and by both formal proof and real world example show that the mystery of Oracle performance is controllable by you. <P>The only downside comes from explaining to your boss that the thousands you spent on automated performance tools were wasted.<P>A word about the Math. 2/3 of the book has no math at all in it. The remainder of the book was perfectly understandable to this reader, whose academic background is Economics and Philosophy not maths or computer science. Don't be put off by the idea that the book has equations, a competent High School student can follow the relevant mathematical arguments.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great starting point for beginners (like myself) or a good reference for even experienced Oracle DBAs. It is just what you would expect from an O'Reilly book, it is very readable and presents information in a logical manner. It is refreshing to finally find a book about Oracle performance that does more than provide a collection of "tips" that you can try and then cross your fingers hoping it will improve things. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and it will definitely stay in my library. <P>I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of a couple reasons.<BR>1. The author really pushes his hotsos profiler, which I don't mind too much. What did bother me a little bit is that in his case studies and any time showed "Method R" in action, he used the output of the profiler as a starting point. It would have been nice to assume the reader is not going to purchase the profiler and proceed from that point instead of always starting at the resource profile which the profiler outputs. This is a little nitpicky I admit.<P>2. I would have liked to see an expanded section on seeing Method R in action, or even downloadable sql scripts that you could run on a database and then find the bottleneck in its execution. <P>Overall, I definitely would recommend this book. It is well worth the money and time.</span>

                    <span>I've been working with Oracle software for the last 6 years, and read all books by leading experts such as Tom Kyte, Steve Adams, Donald Burleson, Mike Ault, Jonathan Lewis, Christopher Lawson, and I cal tell you that Cary's work is a "top shelf", probably ranks right next to the famous Steve's 120-page masterpiece. It is NOT a casual reading, and you probably will have to re-read some sections to fully understand what Cary is trying to explain. His walkthrough the extended SQL trace file is just unmatchable. You can write your own SQL trace file parser right off that book. If you are a DBA working on complex performance problems, you will not solve them without this book. Every corporation should purchase a copy and give it to every DBA in the company! And make sure they read it cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>It's surprising how often people say things without knowing what they're talking about. That's a good, short description of almost everything that's been said about Oracle tuning over the last 15 years.<P>Surprisingly, the facts about tuning Oracle are pretty simple. Most of the results you will achieve come from doing one thing -- tuning individual SQL statements.<P>The author of this book is one of the few Oracle experts around, and he has created a product called HOTSOS, which is essentially an enhanced version of TKPROF. At times this book reads like the world's best infomercial, designed to promote the author's product.<P>Still, 99% of Oracle professionals will benefit from this book, even if you don't buy the author's product. It explains very clearly how to DIAGNOSE Oracle performance problems, and it shows an entire approach to tuning that's invaluable.<P>By the way, there's absolutely no need to know calculus or any other advanced math to understand this book. This rumor apparently got started by some blowhard, pretending to be an expert, but mainly interested in self promotion and telling the world, "I know calculus!" In fact, anyone with basic knowledge of SQL could understand this book and benefit from it.</span>
