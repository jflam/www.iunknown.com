                    <span>I have done lots of research on anxiety and nothing offers such relief as Janet's book. Just reading it brings relief because she relates to pain since she has experienced it herself.
<br />I highly recommmend this book!!!</span>

                    <span>Since I don't have a terrible 'fear' of speaking in public, but instead just get a bit nervous, I did not find this book useful. If you experience panic attacks at the thought of speaking in public, then this book is well-suited for you.</span>

                    <span>To start off with, this book is for people who avoid public speaking situations (presentations/performances/not speaking up during meetings/keeping yourself back from voicing your opinion/avoiding presentations at Uni/avioding subjects that involve public speaking/afraid of promotion at work due to increased public speaking situations etc...). This book is for people who have a phobia of speaking in front of others and want to understand how they can accept, deal with, and conquer this fear (that is shared by LOADS of people worldwide).<p>If you are one of the above, I recommend this book 110%. I read this book, took notes while I was reading, and did all her Action Steps.<p>Janet hits the nail on the head and will give you that inner confidence that you need to speak up and voice your opinion whether its at work, Uni, or in your everyday life!<p>***** - 5 stars</span>

                    <span>I can honestly say that I was extremely fearful of public speaking. I'm a college student and I gave a speech and was extremely uncomfortable while doing it, experiencing almost an out of body like sensation which made me very nervous. I had to deliver another speech and was searching for a solution to my problem and came across this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. I read this book in little under a week, and was prepared to give my speech with excitement and no longer anxiety. The only drawbacks to this book is that alot of the exercises I didn't do because they rely on other people to assist you and I was very embarassed by this fear and didn't want anyone to know it. Also, it has many self promotions to her seminar throughout the book. But, some of the excercises and techniques this book has to offer really do work and greatly reduce the fear. Heck, it also motivated me to give up caffeine.</span>

                    <span>I have read several book on overcoming speaking anxiety and public speaking and have found this book to be one written from someone who walks their talk.  Someone who has has experience and knows where people are coming from.<p>This book along with the book, "10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking", written by Lenny Laskowski are the two best books I have found on this topic.<p>And just think, these two authors are both from Connecticut.</span>
