                    <span>I have not read the 24x7 book, but I have evaluated most of the other Exchange books on the market. This book has "actual" information from someone's experience - instead of just being a regurgitation from the Microsoft help manual. Several books on the market are truly weak regurgitations of the help file, unfortunately. Based on the review for the 24x7 book, I am buying a copy of that now. I checked out Boswell's Exchange book in the store the other day and didn't see the stuff that I was looking for in it. However, Bosewell has a good name and is usually very thorough. So, I would say that you should probably check out that book and the 24x7 book to see what you think about the people reviewing those.
<br />
<br />This book has a lot of good information, and is worth the price. Many of the other Exchange books are just a waste of money. I did also buy the "Exchange Server 2003 Administrators Companion" as well as "Implementing Exchange Server 2003 70-284 study guide" from Microsoft Press. I recommend that you avoid the study guide because it REALLY sucks. The other book "Administrators Companion" is okay, but not as good as this one.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps you - as you can tell, it is clearly a real review. Honestly, I would have given this 4.5 stars. However, since that is not an option, I gave it 5. I am sure someone will come along and give it a 4-star rating one of these days. I just didn't want to be the one to take this book down a notch because it is still the best Exchange book I own.</span>

                    <span>The best book I have read on Exchange 2003. I have read about 10 books on exchange 5.5 - 2003 and most are full of dry how-to information with no thought behind the overall technology or processes.  The text provides vast amounts information and practical examples of old and new technology.  I like the honesty of the information provided, in that it is not full of Microsoft Marketing material but Real thoughtful info.<p>This is not a step by step how to manual or to be used for certification - although the experience of the text will help in certification. <p>For Exchange Admins new and old this is a great book in designing and operating an Exchange 2003 Environment. This is a must read.</span>
