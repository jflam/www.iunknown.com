                <span id="Label1">Organizing the home is one of those desirable and beneficial activities that remain elusive for many. This practical guide explains the many benefits - physical, emotional, and spiritual - of an organized home and shows how to attain them. Breaking down the process into 50 steps, the author uses her own experiences as a psychologist and professional home organizer to help readers clear away not only the physical clutter but the psychological blocks that encourage it and hinder organization. She tells where to start, encourages small steps, and explores the psychology of organizing. Next she addresses fundamental principles, including keeping tools where they will be used and making the most of active storage space. Finally, she shows how to get rid of excess stuff, including how to attack those never-ending piles and junk drawers, and stem the inflow of junk into the home. These easy exercises, tips, and stories will truly help readers organize their homes for efficiency, peacefulness, and well-being.</span>

                    <span>I found Kathy Kendall-Tackett's book, The Well-Ordered Home an extremely helpful,easy-read book. I don't have hours of spare time to read lengthy diatribes that I can't remember five minutes after putting the book down. I prefer the two-pages-a-read kind of book, with common sense advice that I can apply the minute I stop reading, even at the midnight hour. This book is that kind of helpful tool. It's so much easier to follow someone who has been there and blazed the trail. Kathy leads me by the hand and gives me practical ways to get the job done in sprints as well as long distance runs. She anticipates my excuses for not tackling a job and addresses them before I whine them forth. As I finished each chapter, I said, "I can do that!" And I did . . . well, except for the garment groomer and lint roller. Think I can get it at Walmart? Thanks, Kathy!!</span>

                    <span>A delighful new approach to home organization. Very focused on 50 specific areas that can be applied to many other situations. Great for the reader short on time but needing both motivation and an understanding of practical methods of organization for the busy family. Written in a positive and crisp manner...</span>

                    <span>This is by far the worst, most superficial treatment of the subject matter I have ever seen. Dont waste your money on this book. You would do better with Don Aslett's books or Julie Morgenstein or both. This book was like an essay written by a bored middle school student.</span>

                    <span>This book has become a permanent fixture at the breakfast spot on my kitchen table. It could easily be titled "How to Eat an Elephant." Every few days, I open to a different page and find out how to make my life sane. The author has done a great job of helping me approach very difficult household tasks and become good at them. This is after all another skill those of us who are not obsessively compulsive need to learn in order to survive life on the edge! So far her ideas have gone down better and have saved me real time and real money by not having to re-buy what I know I have already bought but can't couldn't find if you had a gun to my head! Her writing style is crisp and light and she approaches the negative emotion of why these tasks are so distasteful. As you read you feel she is right there at your kitchen table to help you through the tough spots. Enjoy!</span>
