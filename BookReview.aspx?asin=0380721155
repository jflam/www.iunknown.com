                    <span>I read this book for an odd reason: I was looking for anything written by John Barry, whose absolutely brilliant book, Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America, completely captivated  me. He's only the ghost-writer this time, and this book may not be quite as  good as his own, but it's still an amazing story of guts and determination.  The reader comes away from this book with new respect for the guts and  determination to the point of obsessiveness of both medical researchers and  patients who participate in test programs. Along the way of a story as  suspenseful as any murder mystery, one gets and understanding of  immunology, molecular biology, and cancer. Barry's other book may change  the way you think. This one won't exactly do thast, but it will open an  entire world to you.</span>

                    <span>An account of the dedicated, honest and intelligent efforts
to solve one of the most complicated of problems of medical
science today, as described in "The Transformed Cell", makes
 one feel confidant that with scientists like Prof. Rosenberg
 around us, the solution to such problems is not very far. I'm
 only looking for the sequel to this masterpiece with a title
 "...And the Solution to it!".

                    <span>For those interested in understanding more about cancer and
the vagaries of scientific research and FDA approval, this book provides non-fiction
as interesting as fiction.  The book chronicles the journey and
 work of the author, a brilliant, driven scientist as he 
 explores a radical new treament methodology for cancer,
 immunotherapy.  His incision of the topic into understandable
 questions to be answered, and the research process to answer 
 them makes the book a fascinating mystery.  The reader 
 learns to root for the scientist, his hard-working
 team, and the immune cells that fight cancer.  Along the way,
 you learn about cancer, its causes, and alot of the associated terminology.
 Educational and entertaining.</span>
