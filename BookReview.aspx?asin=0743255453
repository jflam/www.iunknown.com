                <span id="Label1">The George W. Bush White House, as described by former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, is a world out of kilter. Policy decisions are determined not by careful weighing of an issue's complexities; rather, they're dictated by a cabal of ideologues and political advisors operating outside the view of top cabinet officials. The President is not a fully engaged administrator but an enigma who is, at best, guarded and poker-faced but at worst, uncurious, unintelligent, and a puppet of larger forces. O'Neill provided extensive documentation to journalist and author Suskind, including schedules with 7,630 entries and a set of 19,000 documents that featured memoranda to the President, thank-you notes, meeting minutes, and voluminous reports. The result, <I>The Price of Loyalty</I>, is a gripping look inside the meeting rooms, the in-boxes, and the minds of a famously guarded administration. Much of the book, as one might expect from the story of a Treasury Secretary, revolves around economics, but even those not normally enthused by tax code intricacies will be fascinated by the rapid-fire intellects of O'Neill and Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as they gather for regular power breakfasts. A good deal of the book is about the things that O'Neill never figures out. He knows there's something creepy going on with the administration's power structure, but he's never inside enough to know quite what it is. But while those sections are intriguing, other passages are simply revelatory: O'Neill asserts that Saddam Hussein was targeted for removal not in the 9/11 aftermath but soon after Bush took office. Paul O'Neill makes for an interesting protagonist. A vaunted economist from the days of Nixon and Ford, he returns to a Washington that's immeasurably more cutthroat. And while he appears almost na&#239;vely academic initially, he emerges as someone determined to speak his mind even when it becomes apparent that such an approach spells his political doom. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>In spite of my whimsical review title, I believe this is a very, very important book that every voter in the country should read. O'Neill is the first guy who's left the administration and is "old enough and rich enough" to tell the truth about how the current adminstration operates. I think most of us who voted for W last time did not expect him to be smart or hard working - after all, he had no history of success at anything other than being the son of President Bush 41. But, I do think we expected him to surround himself with wise counsel, listen carefully to their analysis and advice, lead his team to a consensus on the best path and then act. As this book makes crystal clear, Bush is just a dim, lazy leader who does what Cheney and Karl Rove tell him to do.<P>Having spewed that venom, I will say that through much of this book I found myself irritated with O'Neill. It seems like he took the job of Treasury Secretary more to feed his own ego than any other reason. Yes, I believe he's interested in doing good, but could he really be so naive as to take this job so quickly without more due diligence on his role and how things would work? And after he clearly saw what a screwed up operation he was part of ("kids rolling around on the lawn" reference), why didn't he take a policy stand then when he had some real political capital to spend and make some hay with? My guess is that he wishes he had done both of those things, but since he didn't, writing this book was one thing he could still do. And, I got back on his side based on the way he handled his firing. I do believe he's a "truth teller" and the truth is that this administration is run by ideologues named Rove and Cheney who have a powerful toy named W who does what they tell him to and pronounces it to be leadership instead of puppetry.<P>O'Neill's book gets me to this point by explaining how ideas and analysis and debate are not part of this administration's operation. Cabinet secretaries have roles to play and lines to read, but they aren't supposed to nay say about anything the Mayberry Machiavellis have already told W to do. If they dissent, they aren't team players and they will be trashed in the press and eventually "resigned". With no analysis and little experience or smarts, is it any wonder W makes so many dumb mistakes? I think not.<P>If you want to learn some important things, read this book. If you prefer to lazily continue to think W's doing the job right, keep on snoozing. After all, he is.</span>

                    <span>Paul O'Neill is a millionaire and a big-time corporate CEO. He's a fiscally conservative Republican whose counsel was sought by every U.S. President from Nixon to Clinton. He came to Washington at the invitation of his old friend Dick Cheney to be Secretary of the Treasury -- the man trusted to sign the dollar bill.<P>That was his first mistake.<P>"The Price of Loyalty" is a meticulously detailed work. Not O'Neill's autobiography per se, it's a work of investigatory journalism by the Wall Street Journal's Ron Suskind, given full access not only to O'Neill, but to all of his work-product (schedules, memos, personal notes) from two years in the Bush White House.<P>Because the Bush presidency is best known for its obsessive secrecy, it's former CEO O'Neill's devotion to transparency that caused his ouster from Washington. To read this account of his too-short Cabinet tenure is to understand how one of America's most influential (albeit behind-the-scenes) Republicans become heartbroken at the direction the country took under George W. Bush. This is "Bush 43" as painted by his top fiscal advisor -- a man who preached budgetary responsibility, and who therefore first drew reproving stares from the political right for praising Bill Clinton's monetary policies.<P>O'Neill reveals everything: from Bush's inability to ask questions in one-on-one meetings, to the primacy of his political advisors (Karl Rove, Larry Lindsey) over policy men (O'Neill, Christy Todd Whitman, Colin Powell, Alan Greenspan), to his comical yet life-changing visit to Africa with Bono. The book's major revelation is not that Bush's team planned to invade Iraq even before September 2001 -- that was basically an open secret, even though Bob Woodward did not report it that way in "Bush At War". Rather, the most revealing tidbit in "The Price of Loyalty" is the composition of Cheney's secret energy policy task force, the identity of whose members had to be litigated in federal court. O'Neill names names, and shows how that policy group was influenced solely by energy executives, without any input from environmental voices.<P>This book celebrates thought process and pragmatism. O'Neill's thoughts and ideas are dense, his economics hard to interpret for the layman, but his dedication to hearing both sides is admirable. His (increasingly shorter) briefs for the President argued both sides of a position, while still laying out a clear road map of where he wanted the President to go. However, his ideas were abandoned by Bush's political men -- the ideologues, not the planners or thinkers. But O'Neill was no mere policy wonk -- he was a radical executive who enjoyed making waves -- and the fact that he was chased from the Administration, does not speak well of the man who was elected to run it.<P>The final insult comes when Cheney -- not the President -- called to tell O'Neill he was out. When O'Neill was offered the "amicable and gracious" chance to resign, he refused to offer the excuse that he was "returning to private life". The next day, after submitting his resignation, O'Neill turned on CNBC and heard he'd been fired. Not amicable. Not gracious.</span>

                    <span>It is a good thing Mr. O'neill gets his frustrations out by using his typewriter. This seems to be the year for 'Bush Bashing' and many people seem to be getting on the band wagon. It is amazing to me that so many people actually believe everything they read or hear about President Bush.</span>

                    <span>Paul O'Neill was persuaded by his friend Dick Cheney to take the job of Treasury Secretary, on his retirement from Alcoa. After he was dismissed from that post, a chance encounter with Ron Suskind (senior national affairs reporter at the Wall Street Journal for eight years) led to this account of his two years in office. It is Suskind's book, not O'Neill's, though of course it is intended to present his understanding of O'Neill's experiences and views, and was reviewed by O'Neill for general accuracy. Since the book passed that review, I take it to be a satisfactory account of both.<P>The writing is quite lively, and directed at a general audience with some interest in politics. A reader who has been following the news will not be much surprised by anything in it (particularly with the quotable bits having now made their way<BR>into the general press). But it is useful to have this insider's confirmation of what can only be guessed at from new reports, as the present administration is considerably more secretive than any administration, of either party, in living memory. <BR>For example, the famous first-month reversal that embarrassed Christie Whitman was clear enough at the time, where the administration flipped its position on global warming without warning the head of our environmental agency (just after she presented that policy at a major international conference), but it is interesting to see it unfold from O'Neill's perspective. <P>The younger Bush remains an enigma throughout; one gets little understanding either of how he thinks, or what his own primary motivations might be - in striking contrast to every other member of his government. While many politicians may be described as "enigmatic", Cheney for example, this is not strictly speaking accurate. Their goals, values, and objectives are generally transparent, and can be read both from their history and some of their public pronouncements. Cheney may be a good poker player, but at least you know he's playing poker.The enigmas are tactical rather than strategic. Bush's enigmatic quality lies considerably deeper, beginning with the question, what game might he be playing? O'Neill does not pretend to know, which is refreshing. From my own perspective, the most significant remark Bush makes is "I don't negotiate with myself". O'Neill finds this extremely puzzling. Late in the book there is a detailed account of one meeting in which, exceptionally, a free exchange of views on policy was encouraged, in an interestingly chaotic manner.<P>No doubt other readers will approach this from other perspectives, and reach quite different conclusions. There is ample material to do so.<BR>For example, the portrait of O'Neill's relationship with Greenspan reveals something worth knowing about both, and one of the more striking sections deals with O'Neill's experiences on an official trip through Africa. While it has little to do with the rest of the Bush administration, it is interesting in its own right (as are the remarks on the development of the Argentine financial crisis). O'Neill's views on policy matters are also given, with brevity and clarity, for the most part as one of a range of options with various identifiable strengths and weaknesses.<P>One major strength of the book is that O'Neill worked with other administrations, including Nixon and Ford, and is in a position to compare their working styles. <P>Perhaps this book deserves a 4.2 rather than a 5 star rating.<BR>It is not one of the classics of political reporting, merely timely, easy to read, and informative. <BR>On the other hand it is clearly of more value than the polemical books that have been doing quite well of late, so I give it a 5 for its combination of seriousness of intent, execution, and general readability. Suskind keeps well out of the way and allows you to see O'Neill's world. In this category, the basic question is whether a book is worth reading at all. This one is.<P>[Here's a little zinger that had me sitting up on page 107: "It was a mistake of nearly $700 billion. 'What do you mean, no one was consulted?' O'Neill moaned."]</span>

                    <span>I found this to be a very eye-opening and scary book, but very factual. It follows Paul's own feelings, so at the beginning he is excited and hopeful, and then he gradually gets disillusioned about the current administration. Had to be gutsy to write this, but I'm glad he did, and I hope as many people as possible read it before the election.
