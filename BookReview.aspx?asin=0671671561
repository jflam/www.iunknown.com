                    <span>My wife's uncle recommended this book to me. Really, so what I hear you say. Well, he was one of the Paras who landed in the gliders at Pegasus Bridge. He landed on the night of 5th/6th of June at the river bridge now known as Horsa. 
<br />His recommendation was good enough for me!    </span>

                    <span>"Pegasus Bridge", describes 6th Airborne Division's planning and execution of the seizure of a crucial bridge near Caen in the British invasion sector.  Originally written in 1984 in time for the 40th anniversary of  Neptune/Overlord, it is a straightforward retelling of this mission, relying extensively on participant's reminisces and memoirs.  The most interesting part of the book is the first few chapters, where the commander Major Howard relates how he overcame the personal and institutional obstacles to train his company, and get this mission.  In short that mission was to seize the bridge in a coup-de-main operation, and hold it until relieved by ground forces moving forward from the beaches.  Otherwise, the story is really not much more than an extended magazine article in terms of what we learn about this operation, and the 6th Airborne Division's role in D-Day.  While there's nothing quite like first-person accounts to give immediacy and personalize the action, they are always fret with dangers for historians.  Memories fade (especially after some 40 years), chronologies can get confused, and sometimes one's own participation becomes somewhat more important than it was historically.  (We're all the stars of our own lives-deservedly so.)  At least two other popular histories, "The Longest Day" and "Overlord:  D-Day and the Battle for Normandy" describe this battle and its relevance much better.  The work itself is idiosyncratic as the author, an American historian, adopts British expressions and terms throughout his narrative-not just in the quotes and citations.  Maybe his publisher insisted on this to aim the book at a British audience, but this seems like pandering to sell books to me.
<br />
<br />As a way to get a post-"Saving Private Ryan"/"Greatest Generation" American readership to realize that the Allies also had a pivotal role in this campaign, and capture some oral-history it succeeds well.  As far as adding anything significant to the battle or campaign, it's a mediocre work at best.

                    <span>This is the story of the Ox and Bucks regiment who captured Pegasus bridge on D-Day. This book is superb it gives an excellent account of the importance of the mission and the training of the men leading up to the actual assault and capture of the bridge. The book then goes on to explain how the bridge was held and includes good detail of when the re-enforcements arrived. The book is written very well and it has lots of eye witness accounts in it by people who were actually there. I recently visited the bridge during the 60th anniversary of D-Day and I would certainly reccommend reading the book if you are to visit the bridge ( I would also reccommend a visit to Pegasus bridge). This book has inspired me to purchase another book titled "The devils own luck" which is about the Ox and Bucks regiment after Pegasus bridge up to the end of the war.</span>

                    <span>At last Ambrose begins to tackle the massive british contribution to victory. but it is a disappointingly short and skimpy look.<p>Ambrose (and one notes, some US reviewers below)manages to recognise the vitory at the bridge, but understates the non US contribution overall. remember, approx 50% of all forces in Normandy were UK/Canadian - and far from failing, as one reviewer below has it, they held, and ground  down, the bulk of the German forces in Normandy, enabling US forces to break out against weak opposition.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Ambrose's book tells the story of D company, 6th para. and the taking of the bridges over the Orne canal and river.  It is an excellent, if skimpy, telling of one of the facinating stories of WWII.  I have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in "The Longest Day"  It is a quick read, and I'd have liked more detail, but it is a good book none the less.</span>
