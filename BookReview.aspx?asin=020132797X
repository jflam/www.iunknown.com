                    <span>Stross' book goes beyond explaining the ways of Microsoft to man, but explains what it takes to stay up-to-date. As is oft said, the leader of one revolution can not be the leader of another. Because Stross have had a total archival access that's why the reasons why Microsoft company is in the high stakes high technology business are very clear.  <br>Tongue and cheek aside, this book is a real way of thinking in a company. Bill Gates is not the ruthless taskmaster that some people try to denonciate.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book when it was first published, but went back and reread it recently.  The book is broken down into four sections, the first being my favorite.  As an entrepreneur I find the initial organization, growth, and recruiting patterns at Microsoft to be extremely valuable.  I think that any company can learn from this section, especially companies with investments in intellectual capital.<p>The rest of the book is pretty good, but not as valuable as the first section was to me.  It did have interesting discussions about Microsoft's early entry into the Personal Finance market going head to head against Intuit.  This should have helped dispel many of the anti-trust issues as it shows that Microsoft is not alone in aggressively marketing their products.</span>

                    <span>I found this to be a very well-researched book. Stross provides details for all his points and conclusions. This is not a book by someone can can see no good in MSFT, nor by someone who can see no bad in MSFT.<p>An excellent book if one wants to understand what makes a great software firm.</span>

                    <span>I've enjoyed reading most of this book and have taken a lot of interesting lessons away with me. The first 150 pages are especially good at illustrating how the company favored technical intelligence over business acumen and why some of the decisions made have paid off so well. This type of information readily applies to any work being done today and I would highly recommend it.<p>What I found odd was the amount of personal opinion included in the book rather than making this a more objective look at Microsoft. I'm not a Microsoft basher by any means - I use the products every day, program in VB, Microsoft's proprietary language, and genuinely like many of their products. I was just surprised to see the author include many personal opinions, blatantly claiming unfairness towards Microsoft when the context of the discussion already showed his point. <p>This personalization led me to reduce 4 stars to three. After a while it's just distracting and I had an urge to yell "Shut up and tell the story!" The story is very interesting, and I do recommend reading it. Just don't be surprised if you want to tell the author to shut up once in a while.</span>

                    <span>I thought when buying this book that I would be getting a new insight in to the _real_ behavior of Microsoft, namely how this giant used every trick in the book to dominate the software industry. Instead it was a  watered-down tail of how MS likes to hire smart people. Its sad to see how  such a respectable historian could be duped by MS into thinking their  success lies in good honest leadership and hard-word. Where are all the  swindles, the lies, the shady business deals, and abuse of their monopoly  that is the truth behind MS?</span>
