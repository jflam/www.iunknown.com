                    <span>The 1st Hough book Proficient Motorcycling is a very complete overview of the motorcycle, its mechanics and basic safety. That book serves starting riders very well. I read "More" proficient motorcycling soon after I finished the first book and when I had less than 200 miles under my belt. At that point in time I  found that I was not ready for the 2nd book. I couldn't make sense of the examples. The book is much more a discussion with riders than a training course for beginners.<p>This spring after beginning to commute to work on the motorcycle and having many more hours of cycle time I re-read the book in prerparation to return to the road. With more experience the book was much more useful. Where the first book told the reader what to do, "More" gives examples, choices and options for the rider to consider.<p>The book is extremely thought provoking. It contains many excellent examples including a section that describes how you can lay out your own training course (assuming you have the tarmac to do it)and much helpful advice on cornering.<p>If you are just starting out read the first book before this you read this one. You'll need the grounding. If you are an experienced rider I would suggest reading this book every year as you gear up for the riding season (unless of course you are lucky enough to live where its always riding season, then I'd make it a New Year's resolution). <p>Any way you slice it its another excellent book from Mr. Hough.</span>

                    <span>In a few words, after reading the first one -Proficient Motorcycling- one cannot expect less from this renowned author and experienced rider.<br>This book deals deeper with concepts presented in the first one, concepts any reader-rider should have caught in mind and practised on the street after reading that. So this second part re-enforces and emphasizes basics ideas and fundamentals of riding safe as well as presents new optics on advanced motorcycling.<br>I highly recommend it to you all bike enthusiasts who ¨eated-up¨ the first one in a week and conciously practised every drill described there.</span>

                    <span>David L. Hough's book "Proficient Motorcycling" showed me how little I really knew about the mechanical dynamics of a motorcycle. While I have been riding for a while, and am a safe rider, with Hough's book it has become a lot clearer about what a motorcycle is realing doing as I ride. Hough covers, in detail, many topics of safe riding, but he also helps you understand the mechanical dynamics of the motorcycle, in depth. By knowing what the machine wants to do under normal conditions, and under what conditions the machine fails us, we can better ride within the the margins of the bike's design and conditions. No matter how proficient you think you are already, Hough's book will help you understand what the machine is designed to do, and not do, and how important the rider is to it's safe operation. With the book in hand, plan on reading a chapter and wanting to go for a ride just to relate Hough's points to real riding.</span>
