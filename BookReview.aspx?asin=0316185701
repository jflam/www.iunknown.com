                    <span>This is a great read for all interested in the political process and how it works.  The Speaker, from my state was one of a last breed of statesmen that one typically cannot see or find in our political dashboard today.</span>

                    <span>John Farrell's biography of Tip O'Neill will stand as the definative book on the legendary Speaker of the House for years to come.  The Tip O'Neill that emerges from these pages is a very complex man.  Farrell does not needlessly canonize O'Neill or portray him as the caricature that many of his fans and detractors have painted him as.  Instead, Farrell let's O'Neill's words and actions speak for themselves - and what a narrative it is!  <p>The striking thing about Tip O'Neill that comes through in the book is how authentic he was to himself, to others, and to his principles.  In one of the Democratic Party's darkest hours - the beginning of the Reagan Revolution - Tip O'Neill stood as the last Democratic titan, one who was willing to take on the slings and arrows of his critics in order to preserve all that he, and his party, worked and stood for.  Regardless of your political persuasion, O'Neill's courage and loyalty are worthy of admiration.  Unfortunately, they simply don't make leaders like that anymore.<p>As a fan of political biogrpahies, I found 'Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century' to be fair, balanced, highly readable, entertaining, inspiring, and compelling.  This book is the best political biography I have read in years and I highly recommend it to all.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for all who aspire to be politicians and wish to learn the the way the political process really works in our nation. John Farrell does an excellent job in profiling Tip O'Neill and putting O'Neill's actions and principles in the context of the issues of his day (i.e. the New Deal, the Vietnam War, Watergate and other issues). When doing this, Farrell uses the phrase " it was in this backdrop.... When writing a biography, it is crucial to explain the currrent events that impacted the world of those being profiled. Farrell mastered this principle of biography writing. O'Neill is a fascinating individual to study, i was especially taken back at how prevalent is the belief that machnine politics is always corrupt and the politicians that it produces are inept. This is not true. O'Neill was typecasted as a corrupt machine politician by some, in my view, because of his down to earth personality and some of his political tactics. The Kennedy's also used this "machine" to their advantage but they were never viewed by anyone as machine politicians. Although I am not Irish, there was clearly some anti-Irish prejudice in the attitudes of some who disliked O'Neill.This book gave me a very clear picture of Irish American history and the role politics played in its history. Farrell also touches on the ideological rift in the Democratic party. I highly recommend this book and i hope this review was useful.<p>Andres J. Ledesma, New York City</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed Mr. Farrell's book about Congressman Tip O'Neill. It was good to see a book that told not just Tip's story, but told it in the context of the other great politicians who were his contemporaries. It is full of the anecdotes that made him famous, and paints a very unbiased portrait of a politician who might have been the last of his kind. Mr. Farrell writes like a novelist, and, as stated by one reviewer, paints as gripping a portrait of Boston as Dennis Lehane. Read this book, for it is the 'Master of the Senate' for the House of Representatives.</span>
