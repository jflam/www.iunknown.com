                    <span>During my initial first few minutes of listening I realized that Stephen Covey wasn't the main speaker on this tape (he narrates some sections). Suddenly I thought maybe the quality would be mediocre. That this would be some cranked out product just to make a buck. I was wrong. I listened to all 3 CD's (the 4th is a computer demo) and enjoyed the presentation highly. <P>Steve Jones is the person who gives presentation. I believe it is a recorded live process. What I liked about this alot is it covered all of the Franklin Covey time management principles in a very focussed manner (hence the title...??).<P>This CD series serves as an excellent refresher or introduction to the principles of managing your time. They introduce the time quadrants and explain in pretty good detail how to use paper, PDA or computer planners to manage your time. The sessions never bog down in any one area and they move from topic to topic at just about the right pace.<P>Obviously this CD set has some ties to the services and courses offered by Franklin Covey. They'd love it if you registered for the full course or bought a $200 planner/binder. However the course on tape/CD will standalone quite well. The speaker is clear and has a good delivery. I enjoyed this and found the time passed quickly (which doesn't always happen) as I was listening. Buy this - you won't be sorry!</span>

                    <span>I think this set of CD with CD-Rom is a good deal. Covey is also in the audio program, with both other Frankin Covey's associates inside as well.<P>This program updated Frankin Covey's previous What Matters Most program, and has added a lot of additional perspectives on integrating PDA, Window Outlook, and Paper-based planning tools.<P>This program has its value. The previous 2 comments in this customer review have not provided a fair, in-depth look at this new program. I almost missed buying/owning this new, interesting CD set, if I had totally bought into the last two comments, which could be quite one-sided--biased!</span>

                    <span>While initiallly rehashing Covey's four quadrants theory, the book lays the groundwork for setting priorities. People who do not have time to take the Focus On Priorites course will gain insight into Covey's methodology of setting goals and priorities. While not as inspiring as other works, it still was a good help (but not great)...</span>

                    <span>This is basically a rehash, in some cases, word for word of a Hyrum Smith audio "Managing Personal Change" The audio is not done by Dr. Covey, it's done by another individual who's not very entertaining, it seems memorized.<P>I've long admired and respected everything else from Dr. Covey and this "rendition" shocks me. A repackaging of old stuff, uninspiring. I feel cheated.</span>
