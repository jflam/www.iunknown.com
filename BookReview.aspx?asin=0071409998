                    <span>Although quite entertaining and filled with interesting stories and examples, such qualities ultimately bring a significant cost for a serious reader in the following ways. Because it is too "user-friendly," the author focuses too much on explaining basic ideas and keeping the reader entertained rather than explaining the essentials and even introduce advanced skills of networking offered by other books. Further, the organization of this book may appear to be well-done, yet once the reader begins reading the content, he/she will realize that due to storytelling here and there, sometimes the main, essential points can easily be missed. I suggest for those who are looking for an in-depth approach to networking look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I received this book as a gift since my friend knows that I'm continuing to refine my professional "soft" skills.  Networking has always been one area that I've been terrified of.  I've never been able to strategically meet new people and build upon the relationships that I had.   Diane's book breaks down networking to the bare essentials and makes it very easy to understand.  The important thing is that this book makes it easy to make small successes every day and soon enough, you're a networking maniac!  <p>I've been successful using her advice in a very short time.  Ultimately, you have to make the change and be more positive about meeting people and enhancing your professional and personal relationships but Diane's book is a great coach!  I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking to build this very important skill.</span>

                    <span>In the nineties, business people discovered the importance of relationships: it was easier, safer and more reliable to deal with people you knew and trusted. The evolution of this ninety's insight is the explosion we see today of  networking groups. Businesses and business people alike understand the importance and potential of networking. Unfortunately for most of them, it is  potential unrealized. For the truth is most business people don't know how to effectively network. They view  networking as nothing more than showing up to an event, shaking some hands, handing out business card and waiting for the business to flow. It rarely does. <p>Networking, however,  works and can be a fecund source of new business and new opportunities- if one knows how to do it effectively. In "The Networking Survival Guide" Diana Darling teaches you how to do just that. In 237 pages, Ms Darling  covers  not just the ABC's of effective networking but the complete alphabet on effective networking. What is networking? How do I get started and where do I go? How do I prepare to network and what tools do I need? How do I  start, stop and transition a networking conversation? What are some of the best practices when I'm face to face and when I'm not? How do I follow-up on my networking opportunities? What do I do if I'm uncomfortable about networking? In a style that is easy, engaging and economical , Ms Darling addresses all of these questions and more. In doing so, she provides not just the know-how, but the how-to. You can open her book up to any page and gain value, a rare accomplishment even for a self-help book. <br>If you want to learn how to network, or if you are already networking and want to do it better, pick up this book. You won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed hearing Diane speak on this topic in the past and have eagerly awaited the release of her first book.  As I expected, it is a superbly pragmatic approach to refining a business and life skill that everyone needs, but few truly embrace, and even fewer maximize to its full potential. Diane empowers the reader through such practical, easy-to-follow advice, that one would almost have to feel silly to be intimidated in networking situations after reading this book.  It's not rocket science, but a set of wonderfully helpful reminders and tips that take the anxiety (and mystery) out of networking. Read this book and you will actually look forward to networking events in the future.</span>
