Benefiting developers who apply extreme programming methodology to Java projects, this resource provides detailed coverage of ANT and explains how to use it in large projects and extend it when needed. In addition to using ANT for Java applications, it includes discussions of servlets and J2EE applications, which cover the majority of Java development projects.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Ant (Another Neat Tool) is a build tool that facilitates building applications using Java. To use Ant, you construct a build file that then directs the various Java software packages to automate the building of a working application. The book starts with a simple application: compiling Java source. From here it goes on to ever more complex projects until the whole Ant language is covered. 
<br />
<br />The only complaint I have about the book is the beginning. You'd better have some idea about what you are trying to do before getting started. The book gives analogies like: "Thing of your source code as raw materials that you are sending into a factory for processing and assembly into a product, say an automobile. ... Ant is the factory floor with all the whiz-bang gizmos." What's this supposed to mean? Come on guys, we're talking about a software package, not a factory. It seems like the first part of the book is written to impress rather than express. 
<br />
<br />If you know you need Ant, then I'd recommend the book, it's just the first chapter that's a mess. </span>

                    <span>This is by far the best Ant book on the market.  The authors know Ant inside and out and are able to explain it's use.  Notice I said "it's use".  Unlike some other Ant books this one doesn't spend most of its time telling you how to write an Ant task (something few people need to do) but instead concentrates on using Ant to solve software build problems.
<br />
<br />Recommended.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book for learning Ant.  It covered everything I needed to get up to speed quickly.  However, I was a little disappointed in the reference material that I was hoping to use for everyday type stuff.  Overall a good book.</span>

                    <span>I had to come back to this book listing just to leave this review.  I'm not finished with the book yet but I just love it.  Very few tech books I own have been able to ramp me up in a technology as fast as this one.  Very clearly written and builds on the technology nicely.  You need to know something about Java and XML.  But if you are looking at ANT you are because you are looking for something to help your development experience.  I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Being a long-time fan of computer books with animals on the cover, I had bought a certain other Ant book before I got this one. But after I got this book, I've not cracked open the other book even once. Meanwhile, I'm considering getting another copy of JDwA because the one I have now is starting to look ragged from all of the use I've gotten out of it!<p>This book covers everything there is to know about Ant 1.5. It takes you from basic build steps such as compiling right up to more advanced topics such as code generation with XDoclet and on to packaging up web, enterprise, and web-service applications. And if that isn't enough, you'll also learn how to extend Ant with custom tasks.<p>If you're using Ant to build your Java projects, then you *need* this book. If you're not using Ant to build your projects, then why aren't you? Get this book and find out how to streamline your builds. Don't waste your time or money on any other Ant book. This is the best Ant book, bar-none.</span>
