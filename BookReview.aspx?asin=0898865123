                    <span>This book is less entartaining than his other ones, but in fact it is not intended as a substitute, but as a complement for the other ones. We havefor instance the poetic description of skinhead bully and the clash in the pub, a typical Simpson story, multiplicity of climbing, and the complete study of Simpson's face and the consequences of using his mimics. Apart from these Simpsonites, the book itself is a treatise on Tibet, once a peaceful, free country - the Roof of the World. Read that and understand what you did not want to know. It would be fun to read this book before or after seeing "Seven Years in Tibet".</span>

                    <span>Simpson's climbing adventures continues. This book gave me a little bit of deja vu. Simpson philosophizes about senseless violence when almost getting into a barroom fight. This is a rehash of a similar violent brawl that occurs in "This Game of Ghosts." Simpson reanalyzes why people are prone to violence yet again. Simpson gives an account of a climb of Cho Oyo in Tibet. He philosophizes constantly about his decision to climb in repressed Tibet. This book is more a account of Simpson's feelings about climbing Cho Oyo then a story of actual mountaineering. It seems to me that Simpson said what he had to say in his second novel and this book just retells it in a slightly different context. The second part of this book deals with a trip Simpson takes to Peru. Yet again he philosophizes about violence, cruelty and seemingly senseless death and focuses less on the actual climbing. Some of these chapters have odd topics and I'm not sure what he was trying to say, although I found them interesting. Some of the dialogue between characters seem fictional. He gets into deep conversations with other climbers about politics etc and uses words I don't think a climber in a typical situation would use. Unless he was tape recording these conversations, I don't think all the quotes used were warranted. He's also not as witty as his previous book. I recommend that you stop reading his stuff after his second book which I think is really quite good.</span>

                    <span>Simpson continues his climbing adventures but delves a little deeper into his own conscience this time, reflecting on his decision to climb Cho Oyu with the brutality of the Chinese in Tibet uppermost on his mind; and from the summit of Peru's Huascaran, looks down on the barrenness of the once bustling 18,000-strong town of Yungay, devastated by the earthquake-induced landslide of May 1970. This is a more hypocrisy-accepting Simpson, and for this and his own new awareness of the plight of Tibet, well worth the read.</span>
