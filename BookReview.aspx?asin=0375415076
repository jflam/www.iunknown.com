                <span id="Label1">Just about every other person in the world seems like an unfocused dilettante compared to long-distance swimming legend Lynne Cox. Soon At the age of 14, after several years of training hard in pools and the open sea, she was swimming the 26 mile stretch from Catalina Island to the coast of California. A year after that, she surpassed a lifelong goal by not only swimming the English Channel but setting a new men's and women's record in the process. Rather than be satisfied, Cox aimed still higher, conquering the Cook Strait in New Zealand, the Strait of Magellan and, the Cape of Good Hope, none of which had been swum before. Being the first to swim the Bering Sea from Alaska to what was then the Soviet Union is perhaps Cox's most impressive achievement, requiring a phenomenal amount of physical strength and endurance to withstand the chilly waters and diplomatic persistence to gain permission from Gorbachev during the Cold War. <I>Swimming to Antarctica</I> is Cox's remarkably detailed account of her major swims and all that went right and wrong with them. While there are plenty of highs, as one might expect in a memoir by so impressive an athlete, all is not sunshine and roses for Cox. She overcomes extreme physical hardship, predatory sharks, and a swim through a sewage-soaked Nile while suffering from dysentery. There is plenty in <I>Swimming to Antarctica</I> to encourage even non-swimmers to work hard to achieve the seemingly impossible, but Cox, a skilled and highly readable writer, sticks to the swimming, leading the reader by example. For thrills and inspiration, it's hard to find anyone better than Lynne Cox. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I started reading Swimming to Antarctica at 8 pm and I couldn't put it down till I finished it after midnight!<P>Her book, her adventures, her swims, and especially Lynne herself - are all fantastic! Not only did she set and achieve personal goals, she did it keeping in mind her involvement with those around her - family, coaches, fellow swimmers, the community, and even those non-swimmers who cheered on her achievements! <P>I can't stop using exclamation marks because I admire and am thrilled by everything Lynne has done! <P>I wish the book had photographs! I wish I read Lynne's book or heard about herin high school - it might have inspired me to do more over the years. <P>The writing is engaging and you feel you are right in the stormy, foggy ocean or in the murky slime of the Nile or in the icy, freezing water of Antarctica. Lynne rates as high as Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki) as a modern adventurer. When I saw a photograph of her in People Magazine - it was wonderful to put that smiling face to the smiling voice that comes through clearly in her writing! <P>I will read and re-read this book many times over the years.</span>

                    <span>Lynne Cox is certainly a remarkable woman. A swimmer with a built-in resistance to cold, she has attempted and completed some incredible bodies of water in extreme conditions, all with a positive attitude and a genuinely humble approach to her accomplishments. Cox is certainly no polished writer - you won't read any flowery prose describing icebergs, currents, sea creatures or waves with metaphors or an abundance of adjectives. The author is plainspoken and honest, making the book seem like an extended - and completely facinating - conversation over coffee. <P>I have competed in open-water swimming for a decade in conditions much more favorable than Lynne Cox and tore through this book wanting to know how she crossed each body of water. For me, it was a page-turner. Her detailed descriptions of open water swimming and its challenges were right on the mark.<P>But the book left me wanting to know more. How did the author deal with her personal and family life in the middle of her training and her travels? What specifically inspired her to complete a certain swim? The author only briefly touches upon her romance with an Egyptian swimmer and her supportive parents' illness. I only wish she wrote about the demands swimming placed on her life on dry land.</span>

                    <span>Lynne Cox's story is an inspiring account of perseverance, determination, and courage. She is an excellent role model for all athletes in that she swims for a greater purpose than herself. Although it is for her about pushing her physical and mental limitations and the challenge of doing something new, she also attempts to bridge borders between people. I gave this book four stars rather than five for two reasons. One, I would have liked it if she had woven more of her personal life into the story and told about how the way she lives her life is reflected not only in her swims but in other aspects of living (which I assume is true- I doubt her athletic feats exist in a vacuum- but I don't really know, since we only got a glimpse here and there of her private life.) Two, it would have been great if she had included pictures, particularly because as a woman who is apparently heavier than most successful female athletes (although again, she doesn't really get into detail on this topic), she would serve as a great role model for girls who don't fit the typical athlete mold. Still, her stories were fantastic and should be inspiring to anyone who appreciates people who aren't afraid to get out there and live life to the fullest, challenge themselves, and try to make a difference in the world.</span>

                    <span>I am grateful to have encountered Ms. Cox's fine account of her swims across the world - where she broke record after record for her swims in places where no human swimmers have ventured. As an endurance swimmer myself, I was fascinated by her accomplishments, and yet, more importantly, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to have been in the company of Ms. Cox, through reading her book. What shines through these pages, again and again, is her humanity, her humility, her gratitude to her team members, and her desire to be a force for peace and reconcilliation in our world. Time and time again in her story she displays where she made a choice to compromise, to respect her teammates, to avoid anger, to chose not be selfish, even, amazingly, when her own life would appear to be in danger, and yet she never preaches and never sounds self-righteous. Her tale is relevant and inspiring to all of us who wish to leave our world a little better than we found it. One need not be a swimmer to find the book a beautiful and inspiring tale. She is a rare individual, because she appears to be free from the blatant narcisissm of prominant athletes who have accomplished only a fraction of what she has accomplished. Her style and pacing make the book read like a compelling novel. I was sad to turn the final page.</span>

                    <span>The book was a disappointment for me in some ways. I am a swimmer and I was looking for some explanation for Lynne's extrodinary feats of swimming long distances in very cold water. Perhaps it takes a certain kind of blank mind to be able to accomplish such things and so she has no life other than swimming. Someone must have taken some photos of the venues and of her. Why not publish them in the book? How did she get so incredibly strong? Plus, a description of her weight at various times in her life would be really insightful. I read in an article in the New Yorker that she is 5'6'' and weighs 185 pounds. But she ignores that completely although it would be of enormous interest. Vanity perhaps. Also we don't know what age she was when she swam the Bering Sea. She sprints often to keep warm. She checks her hands to make sure they are paddles. She counts her strokes to 1,000 and then starts again. The doctors check her (...) temperature and its high. That's about all of the information she gives out. Her spectacular swims are quite exciting and fun to think about when swimming: the huge dolphins bumping into her, breaking through ice pans with her elbows and much more. But one more weird thing: she never has given up or lost. Just once when swimming in the polluted Nile River in Egypt she swallowed a turd and got dysentery and so had to drop out. Other then that she ALWAYS wins everything.</span>
