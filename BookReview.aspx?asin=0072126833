                    <span>Succinct, authoritative, indispensable.  One wonders where this book has been.  Goff makes it seem so simple.  Could it really be?  But finally there is a voice that spells it out.  A great read that we've waited for forever.  A must for the changing marketplace.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for all IT professionals! It contains information relevant to most, if not all, IT careers whether you are looking for changing your career or just keeping yourself marketable. Ms. Goff includes great interviews with people in all aspects of IT. The interviews include job descriptions, the good and bad parts to a particular position, and some helpful hints and ideas (there is a great interview with the creator of the Elvis Presley/Graceland web site!).  Ms Goff introduces you to many IT careers and tells you what are the related skills you need for that position. She also helps you decide if a job is right for you (I really liked reading about the different postions and learning what skills are needed in each position and what type of person is usually good in that position). She gives examples and tells how people have successfully transitioned either into IT from other fields or parlayed their position into a new position.  This book has given me ideas for keeping myself up to date and how to use what I know already to advance my career or change areas and how to decide what I want to do next.</span>
