                    <span>If you are like me, and have never built a chopper, only riden rice burners, it has good information. Perhaps, I could have gotten all of this knowledge from the internet, but I wanted a place to start. That's what this book is, a start. You could probably sum the book up in 20 pages and saved some trees, but the book in whole was worth the 13 or so dollars I spent on it.</span>

                    <span>Pretty pictures, but in all a very shallow book about the basics of creating a bike by bolting together purchased componenents.  Just one page devoted to discussing trail, and only a vague sentence or two on how it effects handling.  Then, a complete chapter on how a pro shop fabricates a frame.  Interesting, but anyone with the ability to actually make a frame won't be impressed by the knowledge presented, and anyone without the ability will be no closer to it by reading.  The book seems thrown together; too much info here, not nearly enough there.</span>

                    <span>I have been contemplating building my dream bike and picked up this book to learn more on about the chassis of a bike.  This book provides some good basic information, namely the different manufacturers.  However, I think it  could have went into more detail on things like the geometry of the frame  or effects of swing arm length.  In alot of instances, instead of going  into detail the writer points you towards your local shop for info.  There  were plenty of pictures but overall not much text.  It felt like a lot of  the pictures where there just to make the book longer.</span>
