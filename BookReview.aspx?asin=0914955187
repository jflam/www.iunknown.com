                    <span>This is the best modern commentary on the Bhagavad Gita. The scripture itself is a synthesis of many of the most important Indian spiritual philosophies, and is, in my opinion, by far the most relevant to modern humanity and the most inspiring to westerners. It contains instruction in the highest forms of Yoga with an eye towards the needs of practical people involved in the often confusing and distressing activities of life in the world. <p>Sri Aurobindo clearly states his intentions towards this text in the introduction: to put the teachings of the Gita in a modern context, that is, to see how they can be made relevant to readers in the present day. <p>In addition, he asks for a more objective look at the text than certain other interpretations. While I found that he, in general, carried this out, it is not dry, nor is there any vacillation: the book is imbued with the author's ideas about evolution and the role of man in relation to the divine and the author is clear in his interpretive bent. <p>Most important, however, is that his explinations of the meaning of the scripture are truly magical. He clarifies confusing points with such ease and lucidity, I often found myself thinking "Ah, but that's so clear! How'd I ever have a problem with it?"<p>This is NOT, however, an easy text to read. Sri Aurobindo went to Cambridge during the 1890's and the language he uses is not what most people are used to. He is deliberately thorough and has no inhibitions about repeating himself with slight variation if there is an even slightly different context shedding light on the passage. He uses long sentences when expressing large, transcendent ideas (that is, most of the time) and it is easy to get lost in his paragraphs. <p>In addition, the scope of the Gita when expressed in this way is tremendous. Not all of the text can possibly be relevant to someone's life, and at times it can seem as if he's belaboring the point. Often, however, such troubling passages become the ones that are most inspiring when reread in a different context.<p>Therefore, I strongly recommend this book, but only to people who are interested in serious, deep study of the Gita and are willing to invest a lot of time and effort into it. The rewards can be truly fabulous.</span>

                    <span>This book occupies the highest place among the modern commentaries on Gita because it is original, profound and written in a language that is powerful and poetic. There are no digressions from the main argument of the Book.  All the complexity, subtle beauty, grace and the vast synthesis of Gita is  captured perfectly. The last chapter titled "Message of the Gita"  provides such an excellent summary that reading it gives the satisfaction  of the study of the entire Gita. This book is a treat for both the beginner  as well as the scholar. The normal commentaries which give interpretation  for each stanza usually miss out the connecting themes, underlying ideas  and the progression in the argument of the eighteen chapters of the Gita.  This book is an exception. It is unique in form and style among the modern  commentaries of the Gita.</span>

                    <span>The most truthful, profound, exact, powerful and sincere interpretation of the Gita. It would be safe to assert that only the original author of the Gita could have come up with such an interpretation. No other interpration  of the Gita comes close.</span>

                    <span>Sri Aurobindo is definitely among the most notable of Indian authors in the recent past.  In this collection of articles on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, he has brought out the essence of the doctrines of sanAtana dharma, popularly known as Hinduism, that is described in the Gita.  The english is old style and the sentences are often long, but  the serious student of Hinduism will certainly enjoy reading the book.  This book is a definite departure from the usual 'introductory' texts on Hinduism.  

In his inimitable style, he discusses the exposition in the Gita of God (as three purushas) and His relationship to the world, the Divine manifestation (sambhuti and vibhuti) as well as the scope of the doctrines of karma, svabhAva, svadharma, the three gunas and yoga.</span>
