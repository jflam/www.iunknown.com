                    <span>The first 150 pages (one third) of this book have little to do with Java. Rather, it is a port of the authors' previous book on POSIX. It talks about three main platforms (Solaris, Digital, and Wintel) and goes into great detail as to how a Java VM uses each OS's primitives to offer Java synchronization. Why?<P>The authors show bias towards Solaris, and they spend a great amount of time focusing on how you can get the right number of LWPs on Solaris.<P>If I'm buying a Java book, I'm programming to the Java VM and could care less if Digital Unix gives you one light-weight process per CPU plus one for each outstanding system call. I also don't care about making native calls to the OS under Solaris.<P>The introduction suggests that multitheading offers increased speed by running on Parellel hardware. I think what people are really looking for is increased responsiveness. Most computers are single-CPU.<P>The authors are experts in their areas, and they do cover eventually cover multithreading in a no-nonsense manner, with the target audience being the advanced programmer. Don't be annoyed by thier constantly saying, "no, you don't want to do that. Don't do that", and then telling you why in a few more chapters.</span>

                    <span>This book is a one of such books which you can keep as reference. This may not be a begineers book. This book gives clear picture of mapping of POSIX threads an Java API usage.<P>This book intial chapters covers background regarding the threads, and takes examples of varios flavours of unix. If any one read the book of "Thread Primer" from the same author they can skip intial chapters and can focus with respect to java.<P>From application programmers view this may be of too detail but ofcourse this will help them to understand the concept behind Java threads.<P>I gave 5 star because this is the only book gives the insight picture of Java threads and how it exploits the underlying OS.</span>

                    <span>This was the first threading book I read--which turned out to be a huge mistake. The material is very dense and only a small part of it is Java. Most of the book deals with operating system threading concepts. There is a lot of space dedicated to contrasting MS vs. Unix threading models. Also, comparisons between Java and c threading.<P>If you are looking for a solid beginner book on Java threading (or threading in general), I highly recommend Concurrency: State Models & Java Programs. This is the second threading book I read and I highly recommend it if your goal is to _understand_ thread theory and problems. It approaches the subject in a very rigorous manner and models all concepts using finite state machines and then showing the Java source code.<P>If you are already comfortable with basic threading concepts and some systems programming then I would recommend the Multithreaded Programming with Java Technology.<P>I deducted a star because of a few annoying typos and for a few convoluted sections.</span>

                    <span>That this book was a member of the Sun Java series was the primary reason make me take a look at this book. <P>I have been highly disappointed. This body of work for this book is primarly a rushed port of the authors other title - named, funnily enough Multithreaded Programming with PThreads. <P>The Java topics seem to be bolted on as an after-thought - and makes the book read and present very badly. For example a good amount of examples are presented in C not Java, demonstrating POSIX threading!<P>The author is also in the bad habit of presenting material out-of-order, so that the reader has to wait sometimes 50 pages for clarification. This does not breed suspense, merely frustation at the disorder.<P>The low-level OS technical coverage is quite adequate - with a good explanation of LWP and POSIX threading (if only this is what I bought the book for!). <P>The author is clearly a C type who has come to Java and tries to basically recreate the semantics of C POSIX threading in Java... while at the same time constantly drifting back to a topic that he is clearly more comfortable with - PThreads. <P>This is hardly an embracing approach for a book with the word Java in the title - an obvious cash-in on the behalf of the publisher, Prentice Hall.<P>Do not buy this book.</span>
