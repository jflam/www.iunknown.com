                    <span>This book seems to be well written and is very helpful in learning VBA, but, without the CD which the book is written around it makes the examples and problems at the end of each chapter a frustrating experience.  That would not be so bad if somewhere in the book there was some indication of where you could obtain the CD for a price or for free.  I do not recommend purchase of this book without the CD, which may not be possible.</span>

                    <span>Reads like a very, very long, but well written, email.  Next to impossible to use as any sort of reference; I find that I cannot even locate material that I've already read.  Much better to follow a format like the Visual QuickStart guides, which give you BOTH (slimmed-down) step-by-step instructions AND are grouped into short lessons that are suitable for use as a reference (you don't necessarily need to read those books cover-to-cover, in sequence).  <p>Another problem w/the Zak book:  I generally find that I'm not quite sure why I'm doing the steps that she's asked me to do.  Surprisingly, the QuickStart guides provide some context.<p>The Zak book is generally well-written and has relatively few errors, and it has a lot of screen shots, which can be helpful.  One other plus:  the book works around examples that you can download, making it suitable for use as a text.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on a previous review.  The book was everything the review stated.  However, what I found out the hard way is the book is written for Microsoft Office 2000.  Also, the exercises required either a data disk (not included) or downloading the files from the Internet.  However, being an owner of Microsoft Office 97, I was out of luck.  <br>In summary, if you have Microsoft Office 2000 and a fast enough Internet connection to download the data files needed, the book is excellent.  I, unfortunately, had to return it.</span>

                    <span>The book is a considerate introduction to VBA in regards to Word, Excel and Access.  The chapters introduce the concepts needed which are then reinforced by completing the relevant lesson sections which refer to a specific flavor of VBA.<p>Highly recommended.</span>
