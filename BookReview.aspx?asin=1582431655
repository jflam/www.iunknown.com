                <span id="Label1">A story of extraordinary danger and adventure as a very young woman attempts, alone, a trip across Papua New Guinea.  <P>After her first taste of the freedom found in travel at age nineteen, Kira Salak spent the next several years of her youth as a constant, impulsive traveler. Barely old enough to drink, she leaves her life behind-graduate school, a job, a boyfriend who loves her-to attempt the impossible, her dream of following in the footsteps of British explorer Ivan Champion, the first person to successfully cross the island of Papua New Guinea in 1927. She is motivated by something much deeper than simply wanting to be the first woman to make such a crossing, and as she composes this memoir she still searches for answers. Why would a lone traveler, a very young woman at that, want to embark on such a dangerous and mysterious trip? Where was her fear? Or was this all an attempt to court and indulge her fear for some larger purpose? No one, on the road or at home, could quite understand.  <P>Kira Salak matches her adventures in these vivid landscapes with prose that is quite simply thrilling. More than a travel book or adventure story, <I>Four Corners</I> is a work of self-discovery in extreme, of being at great risk in places that are on the edge and being, most of the time, their equal.</span>

                    <span>I am leaving for my second trip to Papua New Guinea in little under a week. I found Salak's book to be a great read! I agree with another reviewer that her introspective thoughts became a bit redundant but all in all the book flowed well and was very interesting<BR>I would definately-- and have already-- recommended this to friends.</span>

                    <span>I found Kira Salaks Four Corners a very good book. I have hardly been able to put it down.The only thing I found disappointing was that there were no pictures except for the cover. It would have been so nice to see these places where she went. I do hope we see another book from Miss Salak soon.</span>

                    <span>A compulsive traveler to remote and dangerous places, Kira Salak is on a journey of self-discovery. The trouble is, she keeps making the same mistakes. Intent on proving that she, a young, single woman, can go anywhere she pleases, she keeps setting the bar higher.<P>In Africa, 1992, age 20, she decides to cross war-torn Mozambique on the lawless, mine-riddled road known as the Bone Yard Stretch. Natives and tourists alike point out the dangers, but Salak convinces a reluctant trucker to take her. A former runner with Olympic aspirations, when the inevitable happens Salak manages to escape her captors. "No one knows where I am....If I died here no one would ever know." Guilt stricken, she realizes that her "self-indulgent, foolish trip" has probably cost the lives of the men whose need for money induced them to risk bringing her.<P>Several years later, Salak is bound for Papua New Guinea with a vague plan to "get from the south to the north of the country via the major rivers." Or, as she explains to a fellow traveler, "Actually, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing. I'm just going to wing it as I go." Again, no one knows where she is and all advice falls on deaf ears. "The only rule I try to follow religiously in life is not to listen to most people." And I suspect the "most" was an editing afterthought.<P>But Salak grows on you. The child of Ayn Rand fanatics, she struggles to overcome a loveless childhood through self reliance and searches for epiphany through ordeal. And she gets plenty of that, from guides who take her money and strand her in the jungle to hordes of mosquitoes, armies of roaches and plagues of leeches. She nearly repeats her Mozambique experience on a trek to a camp of refugees from Irian Jaya (invaded by Indonesia), suffers serious sunstroke after a harrowing jungle trek, gets lost on land and water and meets an amazing variety of kind and vicious people, native and foreign.<P>This is a colorful odyssey by a quirky narrator who both exasperates and inspires.</span>

                    <span>This is an incredible book that kept me engrossed from beginning to end. It reminded me of the thrill of travel, and of the plight of so many indiginous populations. How she managed to finish the trip alive, I will never understand, but I'm glad she came back to write about it!<P>The only reason that I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found her self-analysis at times a bit tedious. She goes through the same doubts and fears that most people her age experience, and I got a little bored of reading "I had never let anyone close to me," and "After all this travel, I still don't know why I'm here or where I'm going." <P>Nonetheless, I will be sure to keep an eye out for this author's next book. I heartily recommend this book to those with an adventurous heart!</span>

                    <span>By the end of this interesting and at times exciting story you feel as if you've been to Papua New Guinea . . . at least enough to know that you don't really want to go. This is more than travel writing, it is a coming of age drama as well. We learn right along with the author the consequences of some of her rather insane ideas while at the same time admiring her courage and independence. She provides us with evidence of what a single young person can accomplish with a healthy ego and a lot of determination. Hopefully her readers will be encouraged to take on new challenges and at the same time exercise a little better judgment in making their choices. My only disappointment with the book was that scant attention was paid to the exotic wildlife for which Papua New Guinea has long been famous.</span>
