                    <span>From the very beginning of the book I was enticed.  I thought it was very well written and an enjoyable read.  It includes stories and things I would have never expected.  I thought the relationship between Marshall and Eisenhower was most interesting.  I had not learned much about Marshall and Eisenhower's personalities.  They were opposites yet worked very well together.  Their relationship was based on trust. It is inspirational to hear of all that our soldiers went through during World War II.  As someone looking back it helped me to better understand what went on and what the soldiers experienced first hand.  I thought "The Victors" was a wonderful book and spanned over a good period of time.  I would highly recommend it to others as a World War II informative book.</span>

                    <span>This covers the European theater from D day to the end. <br>The futile battles of the Hurtgen forest are documented. A waste of men for nothing. We gave up our advantages of air power and tanks to fight in an impenatrable forest.<br>What struck me over and over, was what the men fighting endured.<br>The supply situation was what is was always in the military. Those in the rear get the gear. Those doing the fighting get the remains.<br>In the battle of the Hurtgen forest, during a visit by Ike, a company of Rangers complained to Ike about the lack of cold weather gear. He got the Rangers cold weather gear, but not the other thousands of men doing the fighting. <br>The same applied in the battle of the Bulge. The people in the rear out of the line of fire had waterproof, warm boots, and huge overcoats to keep warm. Those doing the fighting had summer uniforms, leather boots, and had to fight without benefit of fire to keep them warm, or get their food warm. The result was thousands of men with trench foot. The men went hungry a lot of the time due to impassible roads, so food supplies could not be brought up.<br>The men who endured this were heros. <br>Ike was the first to realize what Hitler was up to when the Battle of the Bulge started, and got Patton moving on a counterattack plan immediately, which succeeded.<br>Thanks to Steve Ambrose, the suffering of the men who did the fighting  is documented.</span>

                    <span>I have read most of the books by Ambrose and the material in The Victors is covered better in his other works.  It isn;t bad, but the only reader who might find it interesting is someone who was looking to get into Ambrose's WWII works.  Anyone else but the completists will probably not enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Ambrose has crafted a wonderful popular history of a tale that should, and must, be told to every generation of Americans and Europeans.  This story must remain in our hearts and witness that there is such a thing as objective evil and that we, all of us, have an obligation to stand up for the good.<p>To that end, Stephen Ambrose, has marvelously depicted the lives of Eisenhower's men in battle.  This book is a complilation of several other books written by Ambrose.  Therefore, if you have read the others, you may be disappointed by this book.  Nonetheless, for the first time reader of an Ambrose book, I can say that this book needed to be written.<p>The book ends with the following: "What I think of the GIs more than a half century after their victory was best said by Sgt. Mike Ranney of the 101st: 'In thinking back on the days of Easy Company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who asked, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?'  No, I answered, but I served in a company of heroes.'  So far as I am concerned, so did they all."<p>Ambrose has compiled quite a compendium of oral histories and preserved the memories of these soldiers in print.  The reader will not be disappointed by Ambrose's casual style because it conveys a sense of brotherhood, of victory.  This is no stale tome of history which recites dates and facts ad nauseum.  Rather, it is a story of boys becoming men for the defeat of evil.  One soldier remarked as he entered a concentration camp and saw the harm and hate down to innocents that "Now I know why I am here."<p>We should also know why this war was fought.  Therefore, read this book, treasure it and pass it on to your children.</span>
