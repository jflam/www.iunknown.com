                    <span>Although other reviewers have already pointed out everything positive about this book, I felt I also had to praise it because it's so good. It's a great introduction to neural networks and genetic algorithms. By the way the author should be congratulated for his "never include any code that you don't throughly explain" philosophy. Although it's over 400 pages because of this philosophy, you can skim/skip around 150 of them if you know some win32 programming and basic high school math/physics. The book is so concise and easy to understand that I went through it in a night and came up having a firm idea about the subject. There are also a lot of good ideas to try out throughout the book(i.e. tinkering with the source included etc.) 
<br />
<br />To put it shortly, this is a great book, it's really worth the money you spend on it.</span>

                    <span>This book is a little jewel hidden in the usually trashy prima press 
<br />game development series.. it gives a great, clear, non-formal introduction to genetic algorithms and neural networks in the context of game programming.. and gives you example code in good C++ (brainy aliens storming towards you, a genetic algorithm controlled lunar lander.. tanks that move around avoiding obstacles....) that actually works and is simple enough to be understandable for a newbie. The writing style is lively but not annoying. I recommend this title to anyone who has an interest for the fun side of programming....</span>

                    <span>This book IS my Masters thesis. I built a multi layered combative system driven wholly by neural networks evolved using genetic algorithms. The learning of agents was unsupervised and they existed collaboratively and adversarily. If all of this made no sense, dont worry! Read this book and it will.
<br />The book covers these techniques (except for multi layered architectures) to a level understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of C++. It totally demystifies NNs and GAs. Other books on these subjects actually put you off the entire concepts of AI by feeding you fear and confusion.
<br />I have completed the book and have read it numerous times. It is going to be invaluable for my development of PHd stuff - his writing introduces areas for potential research.
<br />Im would definately buy other books from this author. I hope he covers other areas of AI soon and puts 'em into print.
<br />Be jaysus, tis mighty I tell ya!!!</span>
