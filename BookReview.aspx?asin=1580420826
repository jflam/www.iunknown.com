                    <span>This is a book you definitely have to have if you play live poker.
<br />
<br />Even though the book is a bit outdated in terms of the photos the information it contains is invaluable.
<br />
<br />The book covers most physical and verbal tells that amateurs and pros alike exhibit.  Learn how to tell when a player wants you to call or wants you to fold.  Learn when they didn't hit their hand and you can bluff them off the pot, or when thy hit it huge and are praying that you bet into them.
<br />
<br />This is a must have book for your collection.
<br />
<br />The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the outdated photos.  If they release a new updated version with the same info then it's a 5 star book!

<br />
<br />This sage wisdom is just as penetrating in poker as it is...in life.  Through extensive photographs and commentary Caro tells the tells that tell the tale of whether your opponents are serious or just bluffing.
<br />
<br />As a statement on human behavior it's interesting to read Caro's descriptions of deceptive behavior and consider other situations wherein people may try to bluff their way through.  Though the situations in which people broadcast deceit may vary, it is interesting to speculate on some of the universal signs observed by Caro.
<br />
<br />As Kenny Rogers once put it:  "You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run...You never count your money, while you're sittin' at the table...There'll be time enough for counting, when the dealins' done."</span>

                    <span>this is a terrific book, but now that so many people have read it, you have to be careful about them putting out false tells.  But, it's still very accurate and important, and a must-read for serious players.</span>
