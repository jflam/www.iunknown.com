                    <span>This book is from 1987, I briefly read the reviews saying that it wasn't in the digital era, OK I figured that's fine, how out of date could it be? However, I didn't expect that so much of the book would be dedicated to functionality that's now fully automatic, such as TTL Flash, and TTL exposure metering. 
<br />
<br />It's certainly a very interesting technical read, that provided me with an understanding of all the different macro options, lenses, filters, extensions, TC's, reversing rings, bellows, reverse mount adapters, lens stacking, etc. However, it wasn't for me. 
<br />
<br />I was after something that would show technique, or provide advice on how/where to find the shots he was taking, but the book doesn't cover that at all, to my dismay the book starts with the author writing "it always surprises me that folks find it hard to find subjects" but then provides no advice. After having bought a 60mm Micro lens I was hopeful this would provide direction, but other than "I probably should have bought the 105mm lens" I didn't get any direction from it.

                    <span>John Shaw explains many good techniques for closeup nature photography, which are applicable even in today's digital world. However, this is still a book from the film-era, so anything relatively recent or digital (e.g. magnification ratios for digital cropped sensors, advancements in AF technology, change in lens lineup, etc) is not covered. It is perhaps due for a quick revision to bring it up to date to today's cameras. Also, the photos in this book are good, but perhaps not as striking as the photos in his other book, Nature Photography Field Guide.</span>

                    <span>I found this to a great book for the budding close-up photographer.  First, it is very comprehensive, covering all areas of macro know-how in enough detail to get you going.  It takes you through, step-by-step how to control your macrophotography to achieve various effects, with lots of sage and practical advice along the way.  As other reviewers have noted, his writing is incredibly clear and easy-to-read.  I found his explanations to be very intuitive, and several times whilst reading I thought "yeah, but what about...", and, boom, there was the answer in the next paragraph. Impressive.  Some suggestion its getting out of date, but really (aside from some equipment examples, which are precisely that anyway) this stuff doesn't get out of date.  Its written for film photography, but even if you're doing digital macro, the majority of this book (exposure,tripod use, flash, framing, background control, etc, etc) is still equally relevant.  Gripes?  Hard on the credit card - I know I need a decent tripod each time I refer to it (and a new lens, and a...)!  And spending too much time reading it rather than taking the bloody photos!  Its really good.</span>

                    <span>One of the most readable books on closeup photography has to be Closeups in Nature. Each chapter, while dealing with the subject, goes into very understandable detail on how to go about taking photographs of the little things. Each chapter describes using different types of equipment, from the most simple and inexpensive products, to the very precise and obviously costly. Most of us, I'm sure, fall somewhere in between. He also covers  not only types of film, but the differences in film brands. If you truly have a passion for this type of photography, Mr. Shaw's book is a "must read."</span>

                    <span>Like all of his books excellent text with clear, easy to understand concepts and instructions. This has definitely improved my close up work or at least removed several of the mistakes I use to make.</span>
