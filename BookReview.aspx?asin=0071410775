                <span id="Label1">When signing his eldest son up for Little League baseball, Ned McIntosh was told he'd have to find a coach if he wanted his son to play. So McIntosh stepped up to the plate and, with little guidance, began coaching. That's probably how most people become Little League coaches, and they often feel at a complete loss as to where to start. Written by a father/coach for other parent/coaches, <I>Little League Drills and Strategies</I> teaches coaches how to help their players enjoy the game--as well as develop the skills they need to win. Well-illustrated drills focus on the essentials--batting, base running, fielding, etc.--while other chapters teach novice coaches how to deal with competition and overbearing parents. An excellent resource for coaching neophytes as well as seasoned managers. <I>--Sunny Delaney</I></span>

                    <span>I am not a coach but I try to know as much as I can about the sports that my children are involved. My husband and I used some of the drill techniques with our children and the results were great. We did not get frustrated and we had a great family time. My husband stepped into the "assistant coaches" position half way into the season and he saw marvelous results by using these drills. The team begged to practice some of the drills! A must-have for all coaches!</span>

                    <span>An excellent resource with useful illustrations to help the little league coach prepare for practices, games and parents.  Strong points: good baseball drill and practice suggestions that are easily implementable on the field, good communications suggestions to ensure your team and their parents know what's up and minimize problems.  If you're not worried about winning too much then about 1/3 of the material is not going to be very useful to you.  If winning is everything (at this level I don't think it should be for lower level teams, for all stars and above the story changes) then this has excellent ideas to help you achieve your goal.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a first time coach.</span>
