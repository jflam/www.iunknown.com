                    <span>The majority of this Taoist scripture is composed of metaphysical gibberish about the emergence and emanations of the Tao. Lao-Tze (or whoever wrote the Tao Te Ching, since it's often thought he was more myth than man) spends an awful long time telling us that he can't really tell us anything about the Tao. Then there are the claims that by doing nothing you can do everything, although the translator claims this does not literally mean complete inaction. Though there are a few chapters of merit - for instance, chapters 39 and 42 instructing against war, and chapters 73 and 74 suggesting that rulers should be lenient in punishing criminals and that capital punishment is ineffective - these are few and far between, and ultimately get swallowed up in mystical fluff.<p>Specific to this translation, I find the rhyming of sentences in some chapters by Legge to be a bit suspicious. Whether or not they rhymed in Chinese, forcing them to rhyme in English will inevitably cause the translator to alter the meaning of the passage.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed most of this translation, but I noticed some sections that I found to be incorrect.  The strongly disagree with the translation from ,I believe, the Fourth Chapter- "I do not know whose son it is.  It might appear to have been before God." I feel this to be incorrect because the Chinese tradition does not have an idea of a capital G god who is the ruler of the universe.  I suppose from a pantheistic standpoint this translation could be more accurate, but to most first time readers this will sound as if it is talking about the Judeo-Christian god.  I hope those who get this translation because of its low price will read on the internet or download audio files to supplement this reading to get a better understanding of the original work.</span>

                    <span>This edition reproduces in facimile form the James Legge translation of  the Tao Te Ching, as published in the series "The Sacred Books of the  East". This series was published by Oxford in the 1870's and 1880's.  The present edition contains more in the form of annotations than it does  translated text, as was not unusual in Victorian times. This translation  certainly deserves a great deal of credit. Apparantly it does contain minor  errors, though I can say that I have found nothing by way of a concrete  inconsistency in the ideas as expressed in this translatin in comparison  with the same chapters in other translations. Many people enjoy, and find  meaning in this translation. If I could only have one translation of the  Tao Te Ching, this would be the one. I have removed one star, because the  author occasionally expresses (in the notes) a disbelief of the material he  is translating, which I find irrelevant but not obstructive to  understanding and enjoying the work itself.</span>

                    <span>Could this translation be any worse?  Reading through this version of the Tao was like wading through chin-high mud.  For a much more enjoyable read, pick up John C.H. Wu's translation.</span>
