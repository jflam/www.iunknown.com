                <span id="Label1">Consistently lauded for its lively, readable prose, this revised and  updated edition of <I>A People's History of the United States</I> turns  traditional textbook history on its head. Howard Zinn infuses the often-submerged voices of blacks, women, American Indians, war resisters, and  poor laborers of all nationalities into this thorough narrative that spans  American history from Christopher Columbus's arrival to an afterword on  the Clinton presidency. <p> Addressing his trademark reversals of perspective, Zinn--a teacher, historian,  and social activist for more than 20 years--explains, "My point is not that we  must, in telling history, accuse, judge, condemn Columbus in absentia. It is  too late for that; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality. But the  easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for  progress (Hiroshima and Vietnam, to save Western civilization; Kronstadt  and Hungary, to save socialism; nuclear proliferation, to save us all)--that is  still with us. One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have  learned to bury them in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are  buried in containers in the earth." <p> If your last experience of American history was brought to you by junior  high school textbooks--or even if you're a specialist--get ready for the other  side of stories you may not even have heard. With its vivid descriptions of  rarely noted events, <I>A People's History of the United States</I> is  required reading for anyone who wants to take a fresh look at the rich, rocky  history of America.</span>

                    <span>I think there gets to be a time in many hardcore history readers' lives when they realize that they know a heck of a lot about American history.  We come to a moment at which we feel as if we know who all of the most important figures are by heart, along with the most significant events, the most relevant milestones and the most earth-shattering developments since 1492.  
<br />
<br />However, after reading a slew of more specific books on the topics that interest you most (be it the Revolutionary period, the Civil War, business history, or what have you), a day comes along when you feel like it is time to read another "overview" that will give a global vision of American history in its entirety.  That is what happened to me a few weeks ago when I walked into my local bookstore and came across "A People's History of the United States," completely by chance, when I was overtaken by this need for generality.
<br />
<br />It was the PERFECT choice.  As I said before, I have always been the history buff, so reading the same once again would have been fun but somewhat pointless in the big picture.  By reading THIS particular survey of American history, I was reminded of all the main eras and events, but this time I got to see the viewpoint of the major losers and underdogs, who probably wouldn't be waving the star-spangled banner if they had lived until today.  
<br />
<br />This is the history of the downtrodden, all those people who we intuitively know must have existed, but that nobody ever seems to mention at school or elsewhere.  In the back of our minds, as intelligent human beings, we know that the American Revolution couldn't have been a boon to everyone.  And same goes for the Civil War, the uprise of Big Business, the takeover of the whole North American continent, the building of the railroads, the winning of all our wars.  
<br />
<br />You can take the negative view that this book is left-wing Anti-American rhetoric, or you can look at it positively and just say, "hey, I guess it is only fair that someone took the time to tell the story from the other perspective."  If you read this history book, you will then know who was left behind or stepped on in order for the rest of us to reach the wealth and power we are so fortunate to have today.</span>

                    <span>This history book is an excellent primer for those who want to learn about the complete history of the United States. All of the atrocities that regular history books gloss over are brought to light and this shows how fragile a democracy can be when it falls into the wrong hands.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there have been a lot of attacks from far right conservatives which have diluted the reviews section. Not one I will point out has been able to list a single instance where Zinn has been wrong or misleading about anything. Instead, the reviews are simply vicious personal attacks that, of all things, accuse the left of being vicious and personal in nature. But then, they tend to attack that which scares them, and if Zinn is scaring them it is because of the information that he brings attention to.
<br />
<br />Covering more than 500 years of history means that the book can not go into as much detail as I would have liked concerning some subjects. At the same time, there are very few important historical events that are not presented. Having read this book, I was motivated to do more research and found that all of the information is corroborated elsewhere and even more interesting when coming from a dedicated source.
<br />
<br />Well worth reading. It's a shame though that so many reviews that are simply ideological attacks are allowed taint what is otherwise a great system for reviewing books.</span>

                    <span>First of all, it's important to keep in mind that this isn't a history textbook.  It's more a lengthy editorial refuting all those Hooray For America history books we suffered through in school.  Its purpose is to be as biased to the negative/socialist as your schoolbook was to the positive/capitalist.  The point here is that if you're new to the subject of American history, this wouldn't be a good choice.
<br />
<br />For the most part, these pages ring depressingly true. If you ever look at the state of America today and shake your head in bafflement, People's History will clear it up for you.  There is no mistake being made now that hasn't been made numerous times before, for exactly the same reasons.
<br />
<br />Zinn is truly in his element during America's earlier history, and from Columbus through Vietnam he succeeds wonderfully in his goal to create a masterpiece of contrarian bias.  He paints a vivid and important picture of a country built on genocide, slavery, oppression, and war; railing endlessly against the `corporate elite' and sympathizing with the common worker, minorities, etc.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, those sympathies sometimes degenerate into outright romanticizing.  His statement that indigenous people's wars were more ritualized than violent has been thoroughly debunked, the working man was taken advantage of for so long because his lack of cohesiveness and racism were easy to manipulate, and many of our enemies (i.e. the North Vietnamese) weren't the swell guys Zinn makes them out to be.   
<br />
<br />All this bias makes for brilliant, eye-opening stuff, but it also creates a bizarre disconnect.  In reading Zinn's interpretation of our history, there is no sense at all of progress.  The country he describes would have collapsed beneath the weight of its own corruption and brutality.  And yet, here we are, two hundred years later, the only hyperpower on the block.  Seems like he might have left a few things out...
<br />
<br />After Vietnam, Zinn seems to get completely lost. As we push into an era where most of our oppressive hobgoblins have been slain and the interests of the corporations have largely merged with those of the working man, the narrative gets a little forced.
<br />
<br />An example from page 652:  "In the early 90s...the American system was out of control-a runaway capitalism, a runaway technology, a runaway militarism, a running away of government from the people it claimed to represent.  Crime was out of control, cancer and AIDS were out of control.  Prices, taxes, and unemployment were out of control.  The decay of cities and the breakdown of families was out of control."
<br />
<br />Is that how you remember the nineties?  Geez, I feel lucky to have just survived.
<br />
<br />From page 640:  "The United States, with 5% of the [world's] population, consumed 30% of the world's production. But only...the richest 1% of [Americans] benefited."
<br />
<br />Oh, come on.  I actually know a guy on the Fortune 400 and I can personally guarantee you that when he sits down for dinner he doesn't eat a six point three million steaks.  Nor does he own forty eight million pairs of bikini briefs.  And his car does not consume six hundred thousand barrels of oil for every mile it travels.
<br />
<br />Zinn then gets downright loopy with his idea that there is a brewing revolution of the middle class in America against that pesky Corporate Elite.  His theory seems to be that the problems of the middle class stem from the fact that we are being kept down by the man.  Not sure where he's going with this.  Is he saying that our, uh, desperation is derived from the fact that, as average Americans, we can only afford two SUVs that we don't need instead of two thousand like Bill Gates?  
<br />
<br />His answer to our horrifying condition is to increase tax rates on the wealthy to 90%, do away with defense spending (which he always refers to in dollar numbers instead of percentages to make it seem like it's 95% of the budget) and give it all to the poor.  The fact that he thinks this would work in the U.S suggests that he didn't read his own book.
<br />
<br />Bottom line?  It's one of the best books I ever read, but only because of the mountain of God Bless America propaganda that it attempts to balance.  As a stand-alone history book, it wouldn't be worth the paper it's printed on.  
<br />
<br />So maybe it deserves 5 stars, but I had to knock one off for all that aging hippy `let's start a commune and wear hemp' nonsense at the end.   Particularly because Zinn missed an amazing opportunity to explore thoroughly what he only hinted at:  that our oppressive tendencies haven't gone away, they've just been refocused on the goal of becoming (sigh) the Robber Barons of the world.  I suppose, though, that line of reasoning would force him to acknowledge that his beloved working-man is just as willing to work Cambodian children to death for a sweet pair of sneakers as Rockefeller was willing to work American children to death for a gold plated toilet... </span>

                    <span>This book addresses many issues that many had remained silent about for years.  Howard Zinn is a MASTER of reducing carefully researched works for use to progressives,moderates, and those that feel many questions have gone unanswered.  This massive work is not only intelligent and readable- but an excellent summary of other sources -great to have in one book.  You will read all of Zinn's books- and hunger for more. Zinn in articles, books, documentaries-the truth has let my soul free.
<br />
<br />(Even a non 20 year oldish- that is well travelled is a great believer!) </span>
