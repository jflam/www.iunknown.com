                    <span>I agree with Bill Oakes, I too must have received a different copy of Kirk's book than Bob Ward.  Kirk's book IS a time saver--if I have time available for research, I have time to be out on Route 66.  As a "repeat offender" I have used Kirk's M/C guide several times (I wish it had been been available for the "Inaugural Run!) both Eastbound and Westbound and found it easy to use, as accurate as most sources available, stores in my tank bag (I wish Kirk would reduce the size--tank bags are not created equal!) and was especially helpful in identifying "must see" icons of the Road.  No single website (IMHO) has as much comprehensive, organized motorcycle specific touring information as Kirk has in this book.  In retrospect, if I had Kirk's book and the map series he provides to all "Mother Road Rally" participants, I would have made fewer u-turns my first trip.  Although Kirk's book is motorcycle oriented (it lists dealers, campgrounds and state specific laws) it can be used by all manner of travelers.  So if you're considering "doin' Route 66" Kirk's book is a "primer!"</span>

                    <span>Well, the turn-by-turn directions are certainly useful and this is the first place I've seen turn-by-turn going from Los Angeles to Chicago (most are Chicago to Los Angeles) but my favorite part(s) are the diaries of people who have actually made the trip.  Lew Bellinger's detailed expense report from his run was particularly helpful in deciding how much money I need to take.  It was GREAT to see this fine old road through the eyes of that couple from Denmark.</span>

                    <span>Guess I received a different copy of the book then rpward3. I found the book INCREDIBLY helpful.  Yes, there's some data that's available on the web...but geeesshh...one of the VALUES of this book is saving you the time to DO that research...and given the amount of faulty data on Route 66 on the web (trust me...I found out the hard way), this book is a lifesaver when it comes to finding the old road segments, history, and some of the fun that comes with taking two wheels down the Mother Road.  I'm about to do my 3rd year in a row on Route 66, and still can't recommend The Motorcycle Guide to Route 66 enough.  Now if we can just get Kirk off that Gold Wing and on a Road King :-)</span>

                    <span>I was extremely disappointed when I received this book and discovered that it was basically a compilation of existing data. I have done extensive research on the web for an upcoming trip to explore Route 66 and I was hoping for some new, detailed information from Mr. Woodward's book. What I found was that his detailed route directions certainly appear to be a direct copy of the directions posted for several years on Swa Frantzen's excellent Route 66 website, including some of the typos from the website. In addition, Mr. Woodward includes reprints of articles from the AMA's magazine and some other things I've seen elsewhere.<p>If you lack the time, inclination, or patience to do a little research on your own, or if you're just too lazy to do so, this may be the book for you.<p>Otherwise, don't waste your money.</span>
