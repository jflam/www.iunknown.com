                    <span>The Adams-Jefferson Letters:  The Complete Correspondence Between Thomas Jefferson and Abigail and John Adams edited by Lester J. Cappon is a remarkable book containing letter correspondence of the time when the United States was being formed and for fifty more years.<p>It is very interesting to read their letters to find out what really was on their minds concerning issues of the day.  Americana at its best is what you come away with after reading these letters.  The letters are in chronological order and are placed in order of response to the letter sent.  Thomas Jefferson was a very prolific letter writer and the subjects the he discussed with John Adams vary greatly, but that is what made these letters very interesting.  Also, the depth and the detail of the letters is remarkable.<p>Abigail Adams for a woman of her time was well versed and her letters to both Jefferson and her husband showed character, wit, and resolve.  She was well aware of what was going on around her and you could tell by her letters that she loved her husband while he was away in the duty of his country.<p>This collection of letters is a real treasure, if you read or study the American Revolution, you have to own this book.  This makes an excellent reference volume to fall back on when you get to the footnotes and want a more detailed reference, you can with these letters readily at hand.<p>I would recommend this volume for your home library.</span>

                    <span>There is no substitute for the real thing... As successful as McCullough, Ellis, Wood, or any author may be at recreating and judging their lives and times, you cannot know them better than by reading their words. While I don't recommend this as an introduction of any of the three characters (Feminists be warned! Abigail is barely a feminist and gets short treatment since she wrote far fewer letters to Jefferson than John), it offers a leap in understanding for anyone who has a rudimentary background in the period.</span>

                    <span>When Jefferson and the Adamses retired from public life, the result was the basis for this wonderful little book.  Lester Cappon has produced one of the gems of scholarship on the autumn relationship of Adams and Jefferson.  Perhaps the greatest testament to the scholarship and skill of the editor is the fact that this book has remained in print continuously since 1959.  Though unlikely ever to score the impressive sales record of the recent biography of John Adams, this work is for those interested readers who want to learn more about the early days of the republic.  One warning, the participants were all products of the 18th century.  One should not be misled by the formality of the prose (any more than one should be misled by the gushy emotionalism of the victorian era).  Adams reveals himself (this was his justification for his life and beliefs) in a straight forward manner.  Jefferson, tells us more about himself by his personality by his lack of candor.</span>

                    <span><p><br>This is an absolutely invaluable volume; the complete correspondence of two of our most important and able minds whose untiring efforts did much to shape our new nation and its form of government.<p><p>The fact that our current government has departed so far from their vision is the fault of lesser men who followed these early men of genius, who were so devoted to the ideal of a workable constitutional republic. Indeed, for the last several generations of politicians it sometimes seems that principle has been replaced by expediency in our public servants. <p><p>John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were, without any doubt at all, true geniuses who mastered a large variety of disciplines, from literature to philosophy, theology, governmental design, the mastery of several languages, engineering, astronomy, navigation (see their remarks concerning Nathanael Bowditch, pp. 534,536,540), and especially diplomacy and political intrigue.<p><p>Jefferson's remarks about the pronunciation of the ancient Greek language (pp. 536-539) shows a deep and penetrating interest in a subject that today is of interest only to advanced scholars.  Indeed, most of their correspondence in their later years demonstrates an interest and, indeed, vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. Theirs was an age of generalists -- men who were conversant on a broad range of subjects -- as opposed to today, when we tend to specialization.<p><p>Much of their early correspondence included references to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, with whom they were associated while the three of them represented the United States in Europe and England, in creating trade treaties and diplomatic ventures, including relations with the Barbary states (pirates).  Abigail Adams also engaged in correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, and many of her letters are included.<p><p>We are in debt to several scholars who compiled the materials in this book from the libraries and writings of Jefferson and Adams, of whom Lester Cappon, the editor of this volume, has given much credit.<p><p>This book is a gold mine for anyone interested in either of these great men, or in the early history of the United States, or for that matter, the world during that epoch.<p><p>Joseph Pierre<p></span>

                    <span>Purchased the book at Monticello during a visit to the east coast. For the rest of my vacation I couldn't put it down. I learned so much about the founding of our nation that was never tought to me in school.  Some of the things I was taught in school were down right wrong when compared to the actual words of the people who were there.  Jefferson is an amazing man and Adams provides comic relief against Jeffersons hard exterior. Great read!</span>
