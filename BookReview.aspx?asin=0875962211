                    <span>Not only did this book manage to supply the info I needed in enough detail to be meaningful, particularly with the case studies, it was actually an entertaining page-turner. The author had such a human voice and managed to entirely avoid the tone of smarmy condescension that seems to be rampant in books of this sort. I was particularly won over by his willingness to even poke fun at himself as a case study. I certainly came away with a new respect for the field of podiatry in sports medicine.</span>

                    <span>I find that this book has been very helpful in my running and triathlon training. The first few chapters are very good, replete with some basic theory about running and remaining injury free.<BR>The second third of the book is very informative regarding injuries and their treatment.<BR>The last part of the book has great stretching exercises, and good information about how to stay injury free.<BR>My only criticism of the book is based on a comment that my physical therapist had. I've recently had big problems with sprained ankles in both feet and receive physical therapy from a PT specializing in runners. I discussed the book and the chapter on ankles with her and she mentioned that the chapter only describes the author's success and that for every successful treatment outcome, there are lots of not-so-total successes. It would be helpful to understand both. <BR>But overall, a worthy book to buy and read and re-read as the need arises.</span>

                    <span>If you run fewer than 30 miles a week, have never uttered the words "my coach" or "my physiotherapist," have never won more than a goodie bag at a 10k... in short, if you are a committed, non-elite, non-professional runner, this book is a must. <P>This is not to say that professionals won't benefit - they will. But for those of us who don't receive regular training-level medical attention, the great value of this book lies in its ability to clearly distinguish nagging pains that you can often home-treat from those that - even from the first twinge - signal something more serious. Add it to your running library.</span>

                    <span>I am only a recreational runner, but this book certainly applied to me as well as the active competitor. It hleps you understand when you should see a health care practitioner, or when you might be able to alter a factor of your regimen to solve some of your own problems. Even in the event that you must see a physician, the book helps you understand the type of information you should share with your provider to be a partner in your own treatment...not to mention how to be a good consumer of healthcare. One aspect I found irritating was the authors several references to his days in Medical school. With DPM after his name, I would think he went through the rigors of a school of Podiatry rather than Medical school. It's just a semantic, but irritates me.</span>
