                <span id="Label1">At its core, Amazon.com is a great big database concerned with lots of <I>stuff</I>--books, of course, but also tools, clothing, films on DVD, kitchen equipment, and lots and lots (and lots) of Harry Potter paraphernalia. Want to wear an Anna Kournikova exercise brassiere while juicing celery (presumably with considerable vigor)? Amazon can help. Need a cricket bat, radar gun, dietary fiber supplement, or vibrasonic molechaser? Amazon has what you need. Which is all great, but the real value of Amazon.com isn't that these things are in the database. The real value of this site lies in the information about all that stuff--reviews, sales rankings, recommendations, and the like--and the large number of ways to access it. <I>Amazon Hacks</I> explains how to get the most out of Amazon.com as an ordinary customer with a Web browser and as a software developer interested in the site's considerable collection of Web Services.<p>  In <I>Amazon Hacks</I>, Paul Bausch documents most of the avenues Amazon.com has opened up for exploration of the database. A lot of his coverage borders on the obvious: Sections on how to "Power-Search for Books" and "Put an Item Up for Bid at Amazon Auctions" aren't too different from Amazon's own explanatory articles. Coverage of how to add an Amazon search box to your own site, and add Amazon Associates item links to various kinds of Weblogs (including Blosxom and Moveable Type) are much handier. Bausch really shines when explaining Amazon.com's Web Services (AWS), the remotely accessible software interfaces that enables programs to search the database. He includes AWS-enabled programs in PHP, Python, and Perl. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Amazon.com as a Web surfer, Web site publisher, and software developer. Detailed coverage goes to advanced product search techniques, managing the characteristics associated with your Amazon login, selling through Amazon Auctions and zShops, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) API for Perl, PHP, and Python.</span>

                    <span>Amazon lives up to it's name.. it's huge and practically unknowable. 
<br />
<br />Amazon Hacks is the best of the wonderful "Hacks" series. You won't be suprised to see that you know about most of the 100 hacks and/or find them unusable.
<br />
<br />However, there are at least 0 that changed how I look at and use Amazon everyday. 
<br />
<br />I've been on Amazon as a buyer, seller, publisher, author and heavy user since the begining. I professionally promote books on Amazon... still, I found new information in this book. 
<br />
<br />I recommend anything in the HACK series, and this one for anyone that intend to use web services, Amazon, or a computer in the next decade.</span>

                    <span>The book is geared toward people who want to sell stuff or take advantage of the Associates program.  It's really a better-organized version of Amazon.com's own help pages (which are more accurate but harder to navigate).  If this book were half the price I'd give it 4 stars, but it's too expensive for the limited content.</span>

                    <span>By looking at the home page, one might assume Amazon.com is a simple site for such a large portal. Search for the book, put it in your shopping cart, and buy it.<p>But there's actually a lot more to Amazon, which you can see by reading this book. Many small timesaving (or just plain fun) features and tips have been added to this excellent title.<p>Amazon Associates in particular will love this book because of the extensive coverage of both Associates, linking to Amazon, and Amazon Web Services. But it's also nice for average users who want to know more about the coolest features of Amazon.<p>A must for any Associate, and a good read for anyone else.</span>

                    <span>If you have to ask if you are a serious Amazon user, you probably aren't. Serious amazon users are most likely vendors selling on or through Amazon. For those types this book is chock full of hints and tidbits about how to use Amazon directly and how to automate their usage through Perl and the web services API. So if you knew that Amazon had a web services API and have used it, you will get a lot out of this book. Otherwise I would recommend hanging back because you probably won't get a lot out of it.</span>
