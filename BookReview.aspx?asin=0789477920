                <span id="Label1">From the birth of the film industry in the dusty village of Hollywood 1905, to the computer-generated special effects extravaganzas of today; from the days when the big studios reigned supreme to the rise of the independent film; from the innovative directors who shared their visions to the talented actors who captured out hearts -- Hollywood: A Celebration! chronicles the enduring fascination of movies and movie stars over the last 100 years. Featuring 640 pages and over 750 photographs -- many of them published here for the first time -- this comprehensive work is an exhilarating journey into the heart of the world's entertainment capital. Hollywood: A Celebration offers an unprecedented look at American film, the preeminent art form of modern times. The Hollywood phenomenon is documented through stunning photography -- including dramatic film stills from hundreds of movies; glamorous studio portraits of actors from the era of the star system; candid, behind-the-scenes shots from movie sets and sound stages; graphic movie posters; and images of the ever-stylish Hollywood society -- drawn largely from the renowned Kobal collection, on of the most important movie-still archives in the world. Noted film critic David Thomson provides insightful narrative commentary for each photograph, as well as an incisive introduction.</span>

                    <span>What I find most interesting is how the standards for beauty change over the years. This book is basically filled with scene stills, portraits, candids and behind-the-scenes images from the movie sets. David Thomson gives his insight in interesting narrative next to each photograph. <P>The photography is divided into main sections: <P>1915-1929 Golden Age of Silents<BR>1930s Studio System<BR>1940s The Dream Turns Dark<BR>1950s High Fever in the Atomic Age<BR>1960s Censorship Hangs Loose<BR>1970s The Silver Age<BR>1980s The Space Opera Begins<BR>1990s The Cinema Goes Electronic<BR>2000s The Future, The Meaning<P>I can't say Hollywood has been the best influence on culture. In fact, one wonders if it has done more harm than good. Eventually you learn how to weed out the good and the bad. Normally, you can tell what you are getting in the first 15 minutes of a movie or by doing research here at Amazon which really is quite educational in itself. <P>If you are looking for ideas for movies you want to watch, I can't think of a better way to be introduced to classic movies. As you look through the pictures, many movies will strike you as interesting and soon you will be making a list of new fantasy adventures. <P>This contains photographs from sweet as pie Shirley Temple films to Tom Cruises Mission: Impossible and Lord of the Rings. <P>The photographs all come from the Kobal Collection, the largest and oldest privately owned movie photo archive in the world, with more than a million images on file. <P>Impressive!</span>

                    <span>On first opening this book, I completely lost track of time, and two hours later, realized that I was late for a dinner date. To open this book is to take a magical trip through the history of Hollywood film making. I am a film-lover, so I had been initially sceptical. However, this book does not limit itself to the usual Hollywood cliches and obvious selections. It provides a decade-by-decade analysis of the development of filmmaking in Hollywood from the days of silent films to the present, highlighting those films, directors and actors that it considers influential in contributing to those developments. There are, in addition to those films generally known to all of us and periodically aired on television, many surprise choices, especially among the earlier decades. Do not expect juicy gossip about "stars". This is a book that focuses on actors' performances, and not on their private lives. At the same time, however, the book is very accessible, due to its inspired visual layout, one that avoids the wearyingly familiar images in favor of fresher, more surprising and more thoughtful choices. I found myself wanting to rush to the video store to find those great, but lesser-known older movies that sadly have been forgotten, or of which many of us would, but for such a book, remain unaware.</span>

                    <span>This massive 600+ book is a collection of black and white and color film stills and portraits from 1915 through 2000. Brief captions are provided for each photo. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't have any objections to the quality of the photos. I think they are quite good and there were several images that I had never seen before. But then again, I do not consider myself an expert on photographic print quality. Overall I don't think that seasoned film lovers will find much new here and it may not be worth the price to you. However, if your library of film books is scant or if you are someone who is just discovering classic movies, then this would be a great purchase. Makes a good coffee table book too!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This new book is similar to John Kobal's Hollywood photo books of the late 1970s and 1980s, books which did much to revitalize interest in the great black & white and color photographs of cinema's past. The big difference between those impressive volumes and this one, is the quality of the photographic printing process used to replicate the original images. In the previous Kobal books, such as "A World of Movies" and "Hollywood Color Portraits", the photos were reprinted with extra-loving care, highlighting the irridescent shimmer and velvety shadows of glorious black & white, as well as the rich hues and technicolored glow of early color photography. Here, in "Hollywood: A Celebration!", we unfortunately find photographs that have been reprinted with none of the technical expertise and historical appreciation of the earlier works. Instead, we find bleary, dreary black and white shots, and strained fuzzy color images which do nothing to even hint at the glories of the original photographs. My advice is to skip this expensive volume, and instead seek out copies of any of the other Kobal Collection photobooks. You'll find them, if you search hard enough, in many used bookstores and on the web. Start with "A World of Movies" if you want to see what great old Hollywood photographs are supposed to look like, and pass this dismal "Celebration" by. You'll be glad you did.</span>
