                <span id="Label1">It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch. Under his leadership, General Electric reinvented itself several times over by integrating new and innovative practices into its many lines of business. In <I>Jack: Straight from the Gut</I>, Welch, with the help of <I>Business Week</I> journalist John Byrne, recounts his career and the style of management that helped to make GE one of the most successful companies of the last century. Beginning with Welch's childhood in Salem, Massachusetts, the book quickly progresses from his first job in GE's plastics division to his ambitious rise up the GE corporate ladder, which culminated in 1981. What comes across most in this autobiography is Welch's passion for business as well as his remarkable directness and intolerance of what he calls "superficial congeniality"--a dislike that would help earn him the nickname "Neutron Jack." In spite of its 496 pages, <I>Jack: Straight from the Gut</I> is a quick read that any student or manager would do well to consider. Highly recommended. --<I>Harry C. Edwards</I></span>

                    <span>Jack Welch was General Electric Chairman & CEO from 1981 to 2001 and is seen as one of the greatest business leaders of the 20st Century. The book is split up in five sections, an epilogue and the issue I read included a revised afterword.
<br />
<br />Section I - Early Years deals with Welch's youth, his education (PhD), his start at General Electric (GE) Plastics as engineer in October 1960, and his promotions within from engineer to general manager of GE Plastics in June 1968 ($26m in annual sales), VP of GE's chemical and metallurgical division in July 1971 ($400m), GE group executive in June 1973 ($2bn), and GE senior executive for the consumer products businesses in December 1977 ($4.2bn). The final chapter of this section discusses the race between 5 senior executives for the succession to Reg Jones (GE Chairman & CEO). And in December 1980 Welch got the nod from Reg Jones and on April 1, 1981, he officially took over. Although Welch's performance was good, it was still a surprise for many, including Welch himself: "Obviously, I wasn't a natural fit for the corporation. I had little respect or tolerance for protocol. I was an impatient manager, especially with people who didn't perform." General Electric at that time had annual sales of $25 billion, with profits of $1.5bn, and 404,000 employees.
<br />
<br />Section II - Building a Philosophy discusses Welch's early, turbulent years as CEO. "I came to the job without many of the external CEO skills. ... But I did know what I wanted the company to `feel' like" He discusses the No.1 or No.2 vision ("fix, close, or sell"), the three circles (services, core, and high technology), the outright sales of businesses (the air-conditioning business, Utah International, and the appliance business, whereby the last sale did not go down well with GE employees), and the cutbacks in many parts of GE (headcount went down 118,000 between 1980 and 1985; 81,000 lost their jobs and 57,000 in sold businesses). Due to all this actions Welch was nicknamed "Neutron Jack" in mid-1982 by Newsweek: "The guy who removed the people but left the buildings standing." ("I hated it, and it hurt") Late 1985, GE made the strategic acquisition of RCA for $6.3bn cash, who was then the biggest non-oil deal in history. In this section he also discusses the strange, but successful, combination between Bob Wright ("a light bulb maker") and NBC, which led to success in cable TV, CNBC, MSNBC, and NBC itself. One black mark on Welch's reign has been the saga regarding the PCB contamination of the Hudson River, which has been going on for 25 years. That particular experience has changed Welch's perception of government and he makes clear that he (still) does not agree with the government's stance towards GE on this case.
<br />
<br />Section IV - Game Changers discusses the four major initiatives GE pursued in the 1990s: 1. Globalization: Global sales went from $9bn in 1987 (19% of GE's overall sales) to $53bn (40%) in 2001, which Welch believes mainly grew out of Paolo Fresco's passion and appointment as senior VP in 1987. 2. Services: The successful service experiences from the medical business and the revised strategy of the nuclear business were shared and implemented into the other GE businesses. This has resulted in the growth from $8bn in 1995 to $19bn in 2001 and a possible $80bn by 201o. 3. Six Sigma: Through Welch's friend and ex-GE Vice Chairman Larry Bossidy (than CEO of AlliedSignal) Six Sigma was introduced in 1995. Six Sigma means less than 3.4 percent defects per million operations. "That's 99.99966 percent of perfection." 4. E-business: "The internet revolution nearly passed me by - until [second wife] Jane made me comfortable with it" (in 1999). Welch admits that he never fell for the old vs. new economy during the dot-com era. "... the only extra expense is for Internet development. The big company already has strong brands and the systems to fulfil orders." In 2000 GE had $7bn on-line sales and $14-15bn in 2001. "E-business and GE's installed base are made for each other."
<br />
<br />In Section V Jack Welch looks back and forward. The first chapter discusses the insulting treatment of GE by the European Commission regarding the $44bn acquisition of Honeywell International in 2001, where he gets told to "Go home, Mr. Welch." The next chapter he discusses what it means to be a CEO: "Being CEO is the nuts!" In that chapter he discusses shortly about 30 ideas that worked for him. "There's no pat formula to this CEO things. ... Pick and choose among them, or just toss them all." There is also a short chapter on the game of golf, which is one of Welch's largest passions - and he is good at it with a handicap of about 3. There is quite a long chapter on the GE succession in 2001, which was eventually between 3 executives, and the planning that went into that succession. There is also a short epilogue and a slightly longer afterword (with comments on his post-retirement package from GE).
<br />
<br />Yes, this is unmistakably Jack Welch's autobiography. It is blunt, fast and straight to the point. Although the book is about 450 pages long, it reads as a much shorter book and he could probably have filled another 450 pages. Jack Welch is considered as one of the great business leaders of the 20th century, together with the likes of Alfred P. Sloan. But the autobiographies of Sloan ("My Years with General Motors") and Welch hardly have any comparisons. Sloan's autobiography is much more detailed, while Welch's is more "helicopter view". I do have a few comments about this autobiography, there is not enough on the "real work" that took place, not enough on the "execution tools", and not enough on the financial numbers during his time at GE (within an appendix in future editions perhaps?). I recommend Larry Bossidy's book "Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done" to people interested in the "real work" and execution tools used at GE during this period. Still, a good entertaining business autobiography.</span>

                    <span>What a worthless self-promoter. GE, having apparently decided to commit harakiri as a manufacturer, has turned itself into a finance and communications company, while slapping its nameplate on some appliances-- thanks to the endless yammering of Jack Welch, who thankfully doesn't have a speculum or he'd be looking up himself every day and publishing the pictures. 
<br />
<br />It's not enough that he owns your ass, decides who will be president, and now, his company will decide what you watch on TV and in the movies; what he really wants is for you to say, "Gee, Mr. Welch, you're a genius." When he retired, it was revealed that GE stockholders had been picking up his luxury apartment, and paying millions for his retirement. In any other company, the stockholders would cancel the perks. But for Welch, his self-promotion was so intense that people actually think if they withdrew their tribute, the sky would fall. 
<br />
<br />I guess the captains of industry had their greatest generation, too. It was a long time ago. This is an '80s kind of guy. Hey, Jack? You're fired.</span>

                    <span>The book jacket calls this a "deeply personal journey filled with passion and a sheer lust for life."   Starting as an engineer at GE in 1960, he tried to stay out of the corporate bureaucracy while he ran a collection of GE businesses out of a Hilton in Massachusetts.  For more than twenty years, he played in his home state until he was chosen by Reg Jones to be his successor there in Fairfield, Connecticut.  A hug from Reg confirmed Jack as the new boss.
<br />
<br />In the early days, he says, he was called a crazy, wild man.  When he became CEO in 1981, Wall Street asked, "Jack who?"  He showed them (in fact, the whole world_ "who indeed."  He had said he wanted GE to become "the most competitive enterprise on earth."  He had big plans and, like Marvin Runyon at TVA, he pared down employment at the expense of being liked.  He acquired RCA but not Honeywell.
<br />
<br />From the photo section, there is a pictorial record of his exploits and associations with some of the most important people in America.  He is shown with Warren Buffet who he calls "the smartest guy in ANY room."  He is shown with Bill Gates of Microsoft, both Presidents Bush, also Clinton, even Queen Elizabeth I (who appeared entranced by him.)  In the '80s, he shakes hands with Russian Pres. Gorbachev and China's Pres. Zemin in the early '90s.   Now, I say, this is the man to be photographed with.  He is clearly proud of his young wife.
<br />
<br />A photo of his Irish mother and his dad, "Big Jack," as a conductor on the Boston & Maine commuter line show a happy family.
<br />
<br />After his twenty year tenure as CEO, it is his turn to choose his successor, Jeff Immelt, whose resemblance is so remarkable that they could be father and son.  He is America's success story, I'd say even more than his idol, Warren Buffet.  Now, after 41 years, no one says, "Jack who?"  He had shown them who "Jack" is and had a ball along the way traveling here and yon, hobnobbing with important people everywhere he went.  He is a man to be reckoned with -- hate to end a sentence with a preposition, but that's what he was.  His mother would be proud of his success.</span>

                    <span>Jack Welch, the man they call the Manager of the Century made General Electric a powerhouse.  Not electrical power, however - his legacy is a global behemoth that reaches homes through their loans as much as their light fixtures.  As a matter of fact, they could just take the "Electric" out of their name now and call themselves "General Corporation," as diversified as Jack made them.  This diversification was the outcome of a single word that Jack himself created upon seeing Santa Clause show up while he was vacationing in the Carribean.  The word was "boundarylessness."  At a time when so many other companies were following the Tom Peters dictate, "Stick to your knitting," Jack was morphing GE into a free-form organizational titan by letting his people explore new business ideas, view their markets more broadly, and acquire several other businesses.  The first phase of GE's success under Jack Welch did not, however, occur from boundaryless behavior.  The hard work of stripping off poor performing businesses and individuals, and businesses that were a bad fit was first, along with Jack's demand for the remaining business lines to be either #1 or #2 in their respective industries.  That foundation then enabled the profusion of successful companies that now carry the GE name.
<br />
<br />Of course, these things did not all happen simply because of Jack's inventive vocabulary.  The world's most admired CEO would probably rather be known as the "Businessman," rather than the "Manager of the Century."  Management, to Jack, is about bureaucracy and maintaining the status quo - both abominations in his way of running a business.  Jack, the businessman, succeeded mainly from his people focus and smart deal-making.  In his twenty years as CEO of GE, and the twenty plus that he worked there to earn that assignment, Jack demonstrated a phenomenal adaptiveness and drive that encompassed a daunting range of business skills.  Operating on gut instinct, as the title of his book implies, was his m.o., but take heart, all CEO wannabes.  I've dissected the traits and activities Jack relates in his book, so that you can emulate them in your rising career.  As for myself (if I ever decide I want to be a CEO when I grow up), after reading this book, I realize I have a long ways to go.  I could claim the first eleven JW traits extracted here.  How about you?
<br />
<br />On his rise to the top, Jack was:
<br />
<br />impatient
<br />liked to analyze, numbers, does homework
<br />thrived on competition
<br />engineer in the beginning
<br />working at headquarters (after many years in the field)
<br />not afraid to walk from a deal
<br />hardworking
<br />frank: not superficially congenial
<br />strategic thinker - with agility, situational awareness
<br />educator/teacher
<br />skilled with creating business charts
<br />PhD
<br />held after work celebrations
<br />set strech goals
<br />played golf
<br />loved people, esp. passionate ones
<br />bet on football
<br />mentored
<br />shared weekend corporate comraderie
<br />took family vacations
<br />played board and outdoor games w/family
<br />grasped macroeconomics
<br />entrepreneur
<br />tenured
<br />recruited talent
<br />believed integrity fundamental to competitiveness
<br />logistician - the services aspects of business
<br />self-confident
<br />thoroughly & continually appraised direct reports
<br />outsourced back-office functions
<br />
<br />Additionally, the house the Jack built was a result of these types of business acitivities that he conducted after becoming CEO:
<br />
<br />Divestitures
<br />Sharing Mental models
<br />Informal shareholder mtgs
<br />Quality of Work Life program
