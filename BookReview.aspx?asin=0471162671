                <span id="Label1">A total introduction to user interface (UI) design, <I>Elements of User Interface Design</I> covers theory and application with easy language and real world examples. Author Theo Mandel achieves an effective blend of theoretical consideration and practical utilization without leaving the less experienced user by the wayside. At the same time, even the most hardened applications developer will find abundant value in the discussions of user psychology and the analyses of popular UIs of the past and present.<P> Chapter topics include UI models, computer standards and UI guidelines, usability testing, command-line and menu driven interfaces, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The book also discusses intelligent agents and Internet interfaces at length. Each chapter contains examples from some of the most popular applications and operating systems complete with analysis and historical background.<P> The book itself has a fairly friendly UI; Mandel's writing is conversational and easy to follow, even when discussing complex topics. Throughout each chapter, "Key Ideas," such as tool tips, are broken out for clarification and quick reference on the current topic. Quotes at the beginning of each group of chapters are both topical and entertaining.</span>

                    <span>This book will not tell you how to create an intuitive and loyalty-inspiring interface for your company's applications. It won't help you create technologically cutting edge interfaces. It doesn't tell you how to design software or plan for change. It offers essentially no applicable guidelines for style or component choice. It doesn't have much to offer when it comes to the graphic design of icons or splash pages. And it won't tell you how to write the code to make a good UI happen.<P>What will it do? At best, it will open your mind to the field of human interface design, if you don't know it already. But there are no revelations and no surprises here.<P>If you have no previous knowledge of user interface design and/or have little knack for such things, Elements will break you in easily and comprehensively to the concepts. But with a little experience or common sense, you could gleam as much from a good twenty page tract as from this verbose tome. Skim it in an hour, or use it to feel vaguely productive during a lazy day at work, while you stare out the window. But don't count on much in the way of concrete benefits.</span>

                    <span>Mandel's book was one of several UI books I got when I was trying to implement a process for designing Web user interfaces at my workplace. Mandel has an entire chapter on it, "The User Interface Design Process", which on flipping through the pages seems quite comprehensive.<P>It turns out, however, that Mandel's intention in this book is to introduce the theory and practice of Object Oriented User Interfaces (OOUIs), through a brilliant "foundations" part that covers the concepts and evolution of user interfaces, two OOUI parts that profile and detail OOUIs, and an "Advanced" part that looks at evolving user interface concepts and issues.<P>Unfortunately, not only are Web interfaces covered in but a single chapter in the last part of the book, but the chapter merely explores, without a conclusion, how the Web interface is strikingly different from the traditional PC desktop interface. OOUI principles are in no way applicable to building Web applications (Consider what impact the OOUI tenet "Users must Understand Direct Manipulation (Drag and Drop)" would have on download time and cross-browser development costs in a Web project).<P>Overall, the book is a great read, a necessary reference for any UI designer, but avoid it if you're looking for solutions, especially for Web-based applications.</span>

                    <span>I'm a usability / human factors / HCI professional, and I thought I'd already read all the standard UI design books I'd ever need. After reading Mandel, I realized this book was an excellent standard reference. It belongs on the desk of anyone who is currently doing UI design, is planning to do UI design, or is merely curious about how good user interfaces can be created. This work has a good balance of friendly, accessible readability, and pointers to the basic scholarly research upon which the principles are based. Highly recommended.</span>
