                <span id="Label1">Apple's free iMovie software made history by tearing down the barriers to pro-quality filmmaking. In version 3, iMovie offers powerful audio enhancements, slick new photo effects, and integration with iTunes and iPhoto-- but it still comes without a single page of printed instructions.   In this funny, authoritative, updated guide, award-winning author David Pogue provides a complete course in Macintosh filmmaking. The book includes:<ul><li><b>Essentials of film technique.</b> Using iMovie without a grounding in film technique is like getting a map before you've learned to drive. This book offers a friendly guide to making even home movies look professional.</li> <li><b>Editing basics.</b> Part 2 of this book bursts with clever workarounds, hidden features, and editing tricks from the Hollywood film world.</li> <li><b>Finding an audience.</b> You can export your finished masterpiece back to the tape for high-quality TV playback-- or save it as a QuickTime movie that you can post on a Web page, email to friends, or burn as a Video CD.</li> <li><b>Mastering DVDs.</b> If your Mac has a SuperDrive, you can distribute your movies at much higher quality than VHS tapes or QuickTime movies-- by creating your own Hollywood-style DVDs. Four all-new chapters cover iDVD 3 in detail, including dozens of undocumented secrets for extending the program's design tools.</li></ul>Whether you plan to make the next <i>Blair Witch Project</i> or just better home movies, <i>iMovie 3 & iDVD: The Missing Manual</i> lets you marry the stunning quality of digital video with the power of your imagination.  </span>

                    <span>I bought this book as an afterthought when I started using I-Movie. At first, like most of us, I thought--hey, I can use I-movie intuitively without a manual...but after my Imovie 3.0 crashed and corrupted the movie I'd been working on for 100+ hours, I was eternally grateful to have it nearby. This manual is wonderfully organized, very easy-to-understand, and answers virtually every question you could have about I-Movie and I-DVD. It walks you through everything from how to shoot footage that is eye-appealing...to editing it to a work-of-art in I-movie...to converting it to a Quicktime video and/or burning it to DVD. It is honestly one of the best manuals I've ever used for anything---clear, concise, yet comprehensive. Thanksfully, you don't need to read the whole book in order to "get started" with I-movie; rather, it's a great tool to pick up on an "as needed" basis while you're editing. This book is definitely worth the small investment. It truly is "the missing manual" for I-movie. O'Reilley has done it again...great job!</span>

                    <span>I love this book. Its so easy to read and informative that it'll suit any age! Its an easy way to get the know-how on Imovie and Idvd and also helps seasoned ammatures (like myself) brush up on the commands and answers any questions you might have.</span>

                    <span>As digital video cameras spawn in the hands of you, me, parents and tourists like cockroaches in my kitchen we find ourselves needing the kind of technical and aesthetic help not really seen since the advent of 'desktop publishing'. Once again a 'Missing Manual' has come to my help. 'iMovie 3 & iDVD: The Missing Manual' is an excellent book.<P>I previously reviewed iPhoto2: The Missing Manual and said "The target audience for this book would probably be a little less technical than myself, however when I find myself in a field I don't understand well I don't mind a little stuff for the absolute newbie" -- and once again this is true. iMovie 3 & iDVD: The Missing Manual finds me in an area where I am technically inferior. Once again I truly appreciated this book and its style.<P>The book is broken up into four sections, one devoted to video cameras and shooting a movie, a large one on editing in iMovie 3, and smaller sections on exporting out of iMovie 3 and on using iDVD. At the end are two useful appendices: the first is a menu-by-menu look at iMovie 3, and the second is an iMovie 3 troubleshooting guide. The latter is often needed and always useful -- iMovie 3 still has more than one bug.<P>The first section gives a great deal of incredibly useful information about video cameras and how to use them, including hints on various types of shooting such as sporting events, interviews and weddings. The technical information on cameras is perfect if you have yet to buy a camera, including a guide to which features are essential and which unnecessary as you can do the same thing (only better) in iMovie 3. When it goes on to the 'how to shoot' section, you get pretty much the same advice you'll get anywhere, but since we didn't really read all of from the last book on video we read (and forgot half the bits we did read) it's nice to have it there again.<P>The second section does a good job of explaining the details of iMovie 3, even down to some of its shortcomings and bugs. I also appreciated the way it spent as much time on improving the quality of the finished film as it did telling me how to use the various parts of the software. It follows a logical sequence through the movie-making process, giving good details on how iMovie does the job, how to get the best result and what sort of things to avoid -- particularly useful for things like transitions and effects when less is best.<P>The third section, titled "Finding Your Audience," is a bit more of a problem. It really has nothing to do with finding an audience and a lot more to do with QuickTime. The section first spends ten pages telling us how to get our edited film back onto the camcorder or onto a VCR, then it spends a lot of time dealing with exporting to QuickTime, including posting movies to the web and some info on using the QuickTime player, including some "tricks" with QuickTime Player Pro.<P>The attention to the finished product in the second section carries through to the fourth section on iDVD, though the writing here is not quite as good. It is incredibly informative, however. I learned a great deal about putting together all sorts of iDVD projects, including ways of customizing almost every aspect of the finished product.<P>O'Reilly have the usual marketing stuff on their website while Pogue Press have the handy little Missing CD section with links to all the free and shareware software mentioned in the book. Neither has a sample chapter or the table of contents.<P>One of the drawbacks of getting free software is that we don't get good free documentation. One of the benefits of free software is that we can choose which 'documentation' to buy. Some people might prefer the style of the 'Dummies' books, others the style of Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guide. I've had a look at all three and like the balance of depth and explanation that Pogue has in his 'Missing Manual' series. I once again find myself recommending a 'Missing Manual' to everyone. While catering to the beginner, this book goes deep enough that all but the most long-term user of these two pieces of software will find something to learn in this volume.</span>

                    <span>Yup. This book really made using iMovie for the first time a walk in the park.<BR>Wiht absolutely no prior experience in this sort of stuff (the closest I've come is Photoshop Elements), I was able to, on the first try, make a music video of my son's first christmas.<BR>I was then able to convert an old videotape from the late 70's into a gleaming, groovy DVD.<BR>The book is well laid out, easy to navigate and above all, usable.<BR>It's a five-star manual, no doubt about it.</span>
