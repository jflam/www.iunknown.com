                    <span>I really like this book even if i'm not a Lisp fan.
<br />This book gave me fresh view of lisp that realy helped me. 
<br />
<br />Few months ago my company got a new wealthy client,
<br />the job was to maintain  their in-house  software ,
<br />as the application was written in Lisp and i was the
<br />only programmer with Lisp in my CV 
<br />(I's  behind  C/C++,Java,VB, php and before Pascal)
<br />i got the project , promotion "Lead Programmer",
<br />raise , and could hire  help .
<br />Sounds great ? Well it was untill i sow the code.
<br />Actually i didn't used Lisp since the college days,
<br />even than my largest one was less than 800 lines long.
<br />Facing the code that i sopose to maintain was a:
<br />"In what the hell is this written in ?"
<br />Even after 8 months, and countless hours working
<br />on the code i still can't answer that.
<br />The whole program is a one big macro , when i
<br />macroexpand it , got a code large enaphe to fill
<br />Paul Grahams' On Lisp , book   (around 400 pages)
<br />and remain enaphe for 2 Doctoral thesis.
<br />After unsuccessfull idea to rewrite the code in
<br />C# , our calculation was that  4 men would do it 
<br />in something like 5 years , and hiring three  Lispers 
<br />we decided to rewrite the code strictly from the comments 
<br />and   documentation (geetting as much idea from original code as we could).
<br />Thank you lord that it was such well documented and commented.
<br />Now our program is still missing features ,it's buggy ,
<br />it's  slower , and thanks god for the brand new Dell boxes that 
<br />hide our unoptimization else we would be out of job .
<br />
<br />Eight months ago i had a very high opinion of my skills
<br />now i feel like a high School jr writing his first Hello World.
<br />Lisp tested me and i failed  . 
<br />
<br />If it wasn't this recession i would leave this project ,but  good job are hard to find this days especially for one with lack of selfrespect as myself. 
<br />
<br />. 
<br />
<br />I wish you a happy Lisping 
<br />Stephen
<br />You could never know how good   you are if  never done 
<br />Lisp before</span>

                    <span>This book is an outstanding introduction to Common Lisp and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a better programmer. Few experienced programmers would deny the benefits of learning a new language, but with the proliferation of languages that are near clones of others, those benefits are not always significant or obvious. 
<br />
<br />Not so with Common Lisp! Within the first quarter of Practical Common Lisp a reader is introduced to interactive development, code as data, dynamic variable scope, several function calling conventions, syntactic abstraction, and much more.  True to the book title, these are tools that are useful in almost every program and their use is demonstrated with practical examples.
<br />
<br />Finally, a word of warning: once your programming toolbox contains such a wide selection of tools, it is very hard to limit yourself to the handful that most languages provide.</span>

                    <span>Practical Common Lisp is a solid introductory text to Common Lisp for people with previous programming experience, and is sufficiently no-nonsense that even relatively experienced lisp programmers will benefit from it.
<br />
<br />Having been exposed to people with no lisp experience who have started learning it from this book, most seem to manage well. Common problems stem from jumping too far ahead: unlike many books who claim to do so, PCL actually has a very nice didactic approach to most things, and benefits from being read in order.
<br />
<br />I have very few grivances with the book:
<br />
<br />1. I believe that package and symbol semantics could benefit from a thorough treatment earlier in the book -- say around chapter 6, as opposed to being left for chapter 22.
<br />
<br />2. While Seibel's style is refreshingly idiomatic[1], he consistently uses Javaesque dotted.package.names, which while not by any means unique to him I still find irritating. Most of the package names in the book are prefixed with com.gigamonkeys, whereas the more traditional approach would be to leave the prefix out totally, or make it com-gigamonkeys.
<br />
<br />3. Optimizing lisp code is admittedly a tough topic to deal with, especially when aspiring to give portable advice. The treament given is nonetheless too cursory for my liking. Norvig's advice in "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming" is far superior, but could still have been improved upon.
<br />
<br />These nits aside, I must say that this is definitely a book I wish I'd had when I was learning CL. Recommended to anyone interested in learning Common Lisp.
<br />
<br />[1] Some well-known authors of Common Lisp textbooks *cough* Graham *cough* have unfotunately quirky personal styles of writing code that do not mesh that well with what many consider idiomatic lisp. In comparison to this Mr. Seibel's style is clear and provides a good model to emulate.</span>

                    <span>The very title bespeaks the defensive nature of the book. So too are the several chapters of case studies of Lisp implementations, where these have titles beginning with "Practical". The biggest flaw in the book is what it does not describe about Lisp. It provides a good explanation of Common Lisp. And, yes, this language is probably the most powerful language generally available to anyone today. In fact, in Lisp's almost 50 year history, this has generally been true. Most Lisp proponents will readily tell  you this, as does the book. Many knowledgeable Lisp detractors will also agree. 
<br />
<br />But there has been an enduring puzzle. If Lisp is so powerful, why then has it consistently failed to hit the big time? Newer, inferior languages can come from nowhere to overtake it, like C++, Java, C# and Perl. The book sidesteps this entire issue. It describes the 1980s as the era of Lisp Machines, when several companies made chips that could natively run Lisp code. Well, firstly, the book fails to mention that this was in part a response to the miserably slow performance of the Lisp interpreters or compilers of that time. Secondly, the book does not say that most if not all of those Lisp companies failed. Why? Could it possibly have been due in part to the very choice of Lisp?
<br />
<br />The book asserts that many people's experiences with Lisp are with outdated versions. Whereas Common Lisp has none of those disadvantages. Humbug! When languages compete, what is often important is comparative advantage. Yes, the CL is better than 1985 Lisp, say. But CL today competes against languages like Java, C# and VB that are far more powerful in terms of expressive ability than languages in 1985. By the way, I'm not talking of hardware differences. At any given time, all languages have access to comparable hardware. 
<br />
<br />The book does not make a convincing case as to why CL should succeed now, against those formidable and entrenched opponents. Any more so than 1985 Lisp should have succeeded then against C or Fortran.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, perhaps the author and other CL advocates have lowered their sights. No longer do we hear paeans to the wonders of AI and how only Lisp can be used for it. The "Practical" chapters of the book are firmly down to earth. Rather prosaic, actually. No more grand visions.</span>
