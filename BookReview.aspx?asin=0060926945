                <span id="Label1">On January 15, 1990, the AT&T long-distance phone network crashed. Although it was eventually ruled an accident, the event was a wake-up call to telephone companies and law enforcement agencies everywhere, exposing the fragility of the systems that we all heavily depend on. The feds decided that the time had come to crack down on the handful of computer hackers they had been monitoring for several years in connection with the phone companies. The term "hacker" is about to become a household word, and not in the sense of "great programming."<P> Set against this backdrop, two rival gangs--The Legion of Doom and The Masters of Deception--are about to go to war. What sounds like a clash of comic-book supervillains is actually a feud between factions of teenagers, fueled by misunderstandings and adolescent testosterone. The events leading up to the conflict and its climax are riveting and fun. The book features great depictions of some of the earliest celebrities of hackerdom, including Acid Phreak and Phiber Optik, as well as tales of their exploits and rivalries. Slatalla and Quittner do a great job of portraying the principals as both the powerful cyberspace masters they want to be and the scared, emotional young men they really are.<P> There is also a nostalgic attraction at work in <I>Masters of Deception</I>. Anyone who remembers their first Commie 64 or TRS-80 will long for those golden days and be thankful that they were elsewhere when the Secret Service came calling.</span>

                    <span>I'm sorry. I don't know where that title came from. This is one of those books that really sheds some insight into the mind of the phone phreakers and the 'hacker' subculture. Kids, bored, learn everything there is to know about the phone system, social engineering, and various other things.<P>Because they are young, they do cool sutff with their knowledge, and because the world doesn't have much of a sense of humor, they get into trouble.<P>A very interesting read about the people who would be Internet Consultants and web designers today, but didn't have the material to work with at the time. Proto-web as it were. If you ever wondered about what the online world looked like before it was the web, read this book. It's great fun.</span>

                    <span>If you want a book to teach you about hacking, and the technical information surrounding hacking, this is not your book. If you are looking for a glimpse into hacker culture, and discover what people can do with a little curiousity in this modern wired world, definately read this book. As some of the other reviewers have said, this book is a little fluffy, and the authors seem to attempt to make the book read like a cheesy TV show. If you can look past the writing style you will find an interesting plot with many twists and turns through the phone company, the Secret Service and the legal system.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating journey into the world of international computer networks just before the birth of the Internet. While I do not fully understand the technical aspects of computer hacking in those days (much less now), my lack of knowledge did not hinder my understanding of the tale woven by these two fine authors. Good and evil are drawn with muddy lines, and the boundaries between curiosity and destruction are hard to define. I wavered between sympathy for the hacker protagonists and sympathy for those they hacked. In the end, I felt a little cheated by the sympathetic slant the story took. I think I would have more feeling for those boys if I could have seen how they changed and matured once the whip came down. Paul is the only one I feel could have actually turned himself around and made good, but perhaps the others truly did so. The book was published nearly ten years ago. I wonder if it is possible to find out what happened to the five after this story ended?</span>

                    <span>Michelle Slatalla and Joshua Quittner's Masters of Deception: The Gang that Ruled Cyberspace is about hackers, more specifically hackers that enjoy entering into the telephone companies computers and looking around or as they call it, "research." I recently borrowed this from our library for an assignment, and am planning on purchasing it and reading many times more. <BR>The book follows the path of the MOD boys as the deal with pranks and "pliks" along with some very weird Secret Service raids. Quittner and Slatalla make this possibly boring read come to life by explaining all of the hacker underground in laymen terms.</span>

Factual and detailed. The Masters of Deception is more a feelgood fuzzy kind of sociological study, light on facts and correlations. Not one to read a second time.</span>
