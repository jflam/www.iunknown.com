                    <span>There are a LOT of essentially useless, empty, vague or impractical books about "how to be a consultant" out there.  Process Consulting by Alan Weiss is NOT one of them.  <p>This volume is appropriate for both internal and external consultants, and Weiss's guidelines are applicable across a broad range of consulting industries - not just corporate or management arenas.  <p>Process Consulting shows how to:<p>~ create the environment for a successful intervention<br>~ gather the right information effectively & efficiently<br>~ create dynamic interventions that yield measurable results<br>~ coach key players and overcome resistance to change<p>Whether you're a long-time consultant or relatively new to the field, Process Consulting belongs on your bookshelf.  It will not disappoint!</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I know of from Alan Weiss which deals with the methodology of consulting. It applies to both internal and external consultants, and covers areas including focus groups, coaching, workshops, observation, facilitation, change management, and most of the basic consulting methods. Although best known as a marketing expert for consultants, Weiss has built his career on consulting for major organizations, such as HP, Merck, and Mercedes, and reveals how to successully launch and conclude projects. Note that this is not a book about human resources management, and Weiss is often disdainful of the HR function, but this is nonetheless a pithy, practical approach for even experienced consultants.</span>

                    <span>What does a consultant actually do when he or she is face-to-face with a client?  This book tells you precisely what to say and do.  It is the most practical, down-to-earth, lively and interesting guide that I have ever read...and I have read all of them!  It is based on the author's own success as a consultant, with real live stories and examples of what works and what does not.  Alan Weiss increased my vision for my work as a consultant by showing that my job is not simply to solve problems, but to go way beyond -- to raise the bar, to innovate, to take my clients to a higher level.  He is a contrarion who challenges everything we take for granted. Take "strategic planning" for example.  Weiss puts it down as an oxymoron.  Strategy is vision.  Planning is organization.  Most people mix the two up, forget about the vision and get bogged down with details.  Alan Weiss keeps the reader focused on the big picture, the grand objectives.  This is the true value that a consultant can bring to an organization.  And by delivering this kind of value, the consultant can charge high fees, based strictly on value added.  Any intelligent CEO will be happy to pay a higher fee, because the return on investment is clear and quick.</span>
