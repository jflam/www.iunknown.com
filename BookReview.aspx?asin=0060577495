                <span id="Label1">For more than 40 years, designer Lilly Pulitzer has lead the charge in pretty, preppy chic--a resort look long-worshipped by prim teens and stylish ladies alike. While the signature pink-and-lime-green floral frocks are what she's famous for, Pulitzer has also become known over the decades as the consummate hostess, now celebrated in her book <I>Essentially Lilly: A Guide to Colorful Entertaining</I>. Like most people with great style who aren't shy about showing it, Pulitzer put her personal stamp of informal elegance on all her gatherings, turning her home in Palm Beach back in the sixties (and beyond) into a "famously unstuffy" stomping ground for the resort town's movers and shakers. Unlike other entertaining tomes, Essentially Lilly doesn't go the route of practical party planning. Instead, Pulitzer's book unfolds like a diary of sorts, a scrapbook of her life chronicling inspirations, favorite moments, and events. Chapters are broken down into three sections reflective of the designer's lively aesthetic ("Mellow Yellow Mornings," "Think Pink Afternoons," "True Blue Evenings"), and ideas come by way of Pulitzer's Palm Beach passions--sunrise sails to the Bahamas, golf and tennis, weddings in her jungle slat house, and treasure hunting, among other things. In lieu of countless recipes (though there are a few good ones), Pulitzer extends a broader one--a more personal formula for a fun life, and in this, <I>Essentially Lilly</I> is dynamic and sincere. <I>--Christene Barberich</I></span>

                    <span>Lilly Pulitzer's name is practically synonymous with carefree living. From the late 60s on, she has championed a way of life that is virtually unrelated in any way to how most people really live and which had as its symbol her ubiquitous, colorful, flowery shifts. As the text makes clear, Lilly doesn't care for following rules and, lucky her, she has the means to do and live as she pleases. The narrative is competently written, echoing closely a recent Vanity Fair profile on Lilly which covered the history of her famous brand and name. One doubts that Lilly herself did much of the writing, as there is very little first person accounting. Rather, the book is presented as a very long interview with Lilly's input as quotes. <P>The photography in Essentially Lilly is gorgeous. Ocean and garden scenes display the young, beautiful and obviously wealthy (not to mention white - there is nary a person of color in Lilly's world, apparently) frolicking per Lilly's mantra of always enjoying oneself. Lilly's fans will enjoy seeing how the sometimes outrageous prints her clothing line produced stand up through time - vintage sales photos printed next to newer images look just as fresh as they day they were taken. <P>As for the recipes, well, they're not impressive or complex (WASPs aren't the most enthusiastic eaters/cooks - witness Alexandra Wentworth's "The WASP Cookbook") but they work and that's what's important. The ingredients are primarily fresh fruits, veggies and seafoods which are altered as minimally as possible. In short, they're perfect for the type of Palm Beach life that Lilly loves and encourages - a type of endless summer where it never rains, no one is ever unhappy and you never drop your sandwich into the sand.<P>One is astonished to read about such a rich (in every sense) life presented with such a lack of irony given current political and economic events. Still, Lilly is so happy and earnest that it's easy to forget when reading Essentially Lilly that very few people actually live as she does and it's hard not to share her enthusiastic approach to life when glancing at the pages of such a lovely book.</span>

                    <span>Lilly Pulitzer lives in Palm Spring. Her home is referred to as her jungle, but there is nothing wild or scary about it, only welcoming. Her door is always open and her ideas are there to share. Lilly is known as the "creator of a dress that bears her name and style" - the shift dress. Her styles continue to carry bold, colorful prints. Lilly tells her story from the beginning when she sold the oranges to her neighbors. She was good at it, and from there her imagination grew. Soon she created the Lilly style. Now she is ready to share her entertaining ideas. In the book, her advice on entertaining can be summed up to "just have fun." _Essentially Lilly_ shows us that "living and entertaining and having good times" is the parallel between her clothing and her parties.<P> There are many entertaining books out there, but I think Lilly has created one of the most expressive ones yet. Whether it's water, land, or in a jungle, Lilly's got it covered. Just looking at the book will put you in a good mood!<P>Brenda @ MyShelf.Com</span>

                    <span>Wow! What a wonderful book. Buy it without reservation! Not only is it beautifully written and illustrated with gorgeous summertime photos, it has a nice selection of what looks to be the best recipes for drinks and meals to serve for any special occasion- whether it is a tea party fundraiser or breakfast in bed. Lots of good little tips on how to just make yourself feel rejuvenated- like waking up early before every one is out and walking- either by yourself to hash out the day ahead, or with friends to share some stories. All the pictures are very "Lilly-ed" out- from the clothing to napkins and tablecloths- it is very Lilly. Makes me want to move farther south- maybe even to West Palm! <P>Beautiful & Spirited- would make a wonderful gift but you better buy another for yourself as well!</span>

                    <span>This book is so beautiful. The pictures, the message, the recipes. I sat on my deck and read this book and it made feel like I was on vacation. It also made me want to start having family and friends over more. It is a very relaxing read even if you aren't interested in recipes...it is so much more than that. Simply gorgeous!</span>
