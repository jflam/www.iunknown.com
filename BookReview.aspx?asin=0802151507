                    <span>Burroughs's The Ticket that Exploded, the second installment of this early trilogy (The Soft Machine and Nova Express, respectively) is a literary pleasure.  It encompasses many ideas (Jung's Synchronicity, Foucault's Structuralism, Korzybski's linguistic theories, to name a few) in a post-modernist style.  With many texts in the post-structuralism/post-modernist period and vein-like Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow-this book teaches the reader how to read the text as one continues through the work.  As such, it is a must reread, for as entertaining as the work is throughout the first reading, Ticket is more interesting and more insightful with each successive read.</span>

                    <span>Out of the three books in Burroghs' "cut-up" trilogy (the soft machine, the ticket that exploded, and nova express) this i feel is the best and most creative. Included in this book are Ginsyn's tape recorder experiments which produce a psychological analogy for the way our brains opperate as well as an interesting pass-time for anyone who finds the concept of words being a virus of the mind of any interest.</span>

                    <span>this book is an outerlandish(outer space) type of bizarre nuclear book... it has what few books lack visual impact, and adventure..and keeps exploding with action (unlike few books that stick to one place for a  million hours..and emotions, it jumps countlessly with entertainment and  never fails at that.</span>

                    <span>This book is the final word in cut-ups and Burroughs' tape experiments of the early 1960's.  This is Burroughs' most beautifully written text, if somewhat overrepetitive at times.  Moreso than in "Naked Lunch"  or in "Nova Express," Burroughs fleshes out his ideas about  language "being a virus from outer space," and looks forward to  his essay, "The Electronic Revolution."  This is a tough and  uncompromising book, filled with beautiful nonsequitors, funny anecdotal  tales, and plenty homoerotic sexual fantasies and realitease.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the parallel text to The Soft Machine and Nova Express. But the  qualities of these two almost unreadable but awesome works of art are only  partly presented here. It shows that Burroughs did a lot of rewriting on  this one, the repitions seem not all intended, and what he added to or  changed in the original, which would have been a beautiful further view in  the repelling cut up universe, undermines the visionary character of the  trilogy. Technical prose about recorders and idealistic musings about what  you can do with them makes this book sound dated. The idea itself,  revolving around a prerecorded universe and how to unrecord it, is  essential, but it gets a too political and too oneminded unhumorous  treatment here and there. Where he can be such a laugh if he tries. The  attacker of preachers falls prey to preaching. But then this turning into  your own enemy is inherent to his work. Those who haven't yet read the  first two novels of the cut up trilogy should start there, although there  is no chronological need to do so. In the end you will have to read this as  well, if you come as far. The hypnotising power of the trilogy shines  through despite 'the dr frankenstein goes for recorders' pasages.</span>
