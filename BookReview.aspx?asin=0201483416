                    <span>I have read a few books on the Panthers, and have always been drowned in my own romantacism that I never questioned anything that came from the movement. This book sheds light on so many things; which may at times make readers uncomfortable. At one point you feel greatful for such an organization, while at others your disapointment may sadden you.<p>That is what makes this a good book; objectivity. He lays the positives out, but does not ignore the negatives; in fact, a good percentage of this book is explaining so many of the negatives within the party. Still, at the same time, you get a feeling that the author truly appreciates the positive aspects of the BPP, but appreciates it without ignoring the blemishes within the party's past.<p>Anyway, it's a good book. I have known a few Panthers, and one in particular I made a coment about how I looked up to Huey Newton. He started making some statments and I asked him to stop because I didn't want to have a tarnished image of the man. Now, after reading this book, I see both sides of the issue; which makes things all the more clearer. This book has left me both disapointed and greatful. Disapointed because some things in Panther past were not as I expected; and greatful that I got to see another side of the BPP.</span>

                    <span>I am not a supporter of the Black Panthers, in fact I oppose them. Hugh Pearson does more than promote the Panthers in his hollow tell-all book by showing the public how lied about the Panthers are. Much of his sources are misinterpreted, as others have said, and he often seeks the worst outlook as a way of conveying the situation, never giving to even a modest viewpoint. He takes several sources that can be interpreted as unreliable, and then makes it worse by distorting the information therein. His book is as reliable as the history book you used in high school. It has so little of a reliable basis that one should only use it with the utmost scrutiny.</span>

                    <span>I became interested in the Panthers during high school, and during my research for a term paper on the BPP, I encountered sources that only supported and maintained the view that the Black Panthers were destroyed by FBI counterintelligence.  Pearson's book finally provides a more accurate view of Panther history.  While Pearson concentrates on the party's criminal activities and the overall negative impact on the community and its members' lives, he does not do it with Horowitz-style, moral judgement or a conservative, revisionist agenda.  The story Pearson presents is the true story, whether we like it or not, and any educated perspective on the Panthers must take this work into account.  However, I do feel that the book lacks serious discussion of the FBI's campaigns against the Panthers, which were damaging.  The murder of Fred Hampton is the most egregious example of the government's persecution of the Party, but it only gets a passing mention.  Also, Pearson forgets to bring it all together in the end and truly weigh the impact of the Party on the overall civil rights struggle, but overall, for any one who wants to finally see a less biased view of the Black Panters, this book is a definite read.</span>

                    <span>This book offers a look inside the rise and fall of Huey Newton and the Black Panther Party in Oakland from the 60's to the 80's.  Nelson has spoken to many of the participants and assembled what appears to be a well-balanced overview of the promise and problems of the Party. <p>His essential argument is that the Party began as a criminal enterprise with revolutionary trappings and was eventually consumed by it's own criminality.  The book was apparently somewhat controversial because this, of course, contradicts the standard view that the Panthers began as a worthy endeavor but was tragically destroyed by increasing criminal activity and mismanagement and illegal government meddling. <p>Despite some awkward prose, this is an excellent look at the turn from non-violence to violence in the Black Community in the mid-60's. <p>GRADE: B</span>

                    <span>I think it's great that people are writing in about my husband's book. However, I'd like to know how the reader from Chapel Hill who has posted a  review, would know whether or not Pearson slanted the information of his  sources? Was he there for the book interviews? And if he's referring to the  documented sources you can look up in the endnotes, I fail to see where my  husband is misrepresenting them. Hugh Pearson simply reported his research  findings then drew his own conclusions. And as far as the charge goes that  he has no feel for the era. What does the reader mean? It's not like  Pearson came up with conclusions based only on what he thought. He  interviewed Panther veterans. There is one movement veteran in particular  in the book who talks, for instance, about the murder of Black Panther Alex  Rackley. She says that you have to put the murder of Rackley by fellow  Panthers in the context of the times, which were crazy. And that the murder  was a mistake that the authorities were using to do in the movement. The  book is filled with interviews with veterans who take the reader back to  the era. And Pearson doesn't step on any of what they have to say. So I'm  at a loss for what the Chapel Hill reviewer is referring to. Lastly, I find  it interesting that more people have said they find this negative review  helpful than the positive reivews on line. This causes me to question a lot  of the motivations of potential customers. Are they looking for reasons not  to buy the book? Are they searching for reasons to dismiss what Pearson  wrote as happened among so many people who didn't even bother to pick it up  when it first came out, and simply went on the attack against him based  purely on what reviewers said (many of whom were biased veterans of the era  who were culpable in covering up Panther atrocities?). I wonder.</span>
