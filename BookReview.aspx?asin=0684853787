                <span id="Label1"><P> Do you believe that spending $15,000 on a media center is vulgar, but that spending $15,000 on a slate shower stall is a sign that you are at one with the Zenlike rhythms of nature? Do you work for one of those visionary software companies where people come to work wearing hiking boots and glacier glasses, as if a wall of ice were about to come sliding through the parking lot? If so, you might be a Bobo. <P> In his bestselling work of "comic sociology," David Brooks coins a new word, <I>Bobo,</I> to describe today's upper class -- those who have wed the bourgeois world of capitalist enterprise to the hippie values of the bohemian counterculture. Their hybrid lifestyle is the atmosphere we breathe, and in this witty and serious look at the cultural consequences of the information age, Brooks has defined a new generation.</span>

                    <span>To begin with, David Brooks is not the first author to provide a comic take on affluent people striking bohemian rebellious poses. Thirty years ago, after all, Tom Wolfe gave us the marvelous essay and book, Radical Chic.<P>Brooks offers many keen observations about the Bobo outlook on work, consumption, politics, and so forth. Bobos in Paradise is interesting, thought-provoking, and worth the time spent reading it. I probably should give it five stars.<P>But. . .the tone of gentle irony was ultimately infuriating to me. It's like he is almost apologizing to Bobos for hinting at some hypocrisies and moral inconsistencies in their behavior. His final peroration reads, "They can be silly a lot of the time. But if they raise their sights and ask the biggest questions, they have the ability to go down in history as the class that led America into another golden age.".....<P>Rather than send the Bobos off on some great redemptive public crusade, I would prefer to see them first try to recover their moral compass. My views on the Bobo mentality are less sanguine than Brooks'. My site will have an essay on "Troubles in Bobos' Paradise."</span>

                    <span>"Bobo" is author David Brooks' acronym for a Bourgeois Bohemian, a synthesis of Reaganism and Woodstock, the folks he says are running the country today. Bobos are new money--the meritocracy of smart folk who have become rich as fast-track professionals, clever enterpreneurs, start-up capitalists, or visionaries like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Some Bobos are capitalistic hippies and some are mellowed-out business people; Bobo is their common meeting ground. True to their mixed heritage, Bobos love oxymoronic concepts like "sustainable development," "cooperative individualism" or "liberation management." Reconciliation is their middle name. <P>Bobos dislike showing off, but of course all rich people do, so they are allowed to show off in discreet ways. Mercedes are out, but SUV's are in. Jewelry is out, but eco-tourism is in. Bobox buy the same things the rest of us do (bread, chicken, coffee) but pay from 3 to 10 times the mass-market price in search of something better, organic, or more planet-friendly. In fact, anything that shows one to be a friend to the planet is fair game, no matter how silly. There's even a toothpaste that encourages germs to leave the mouth.<P>Needless to say, it takes a huge income to be a true Bobo. Brooks almost had this reviewer feeling sorry for the poor U. of Chicago professor forced to live on a "mere" household income of $180K, barely enough to cover private schools for her kids and a nanny. The wretch suffers from what Brooks calls "status-income disequilibrium" or "SID" because her pay, while handsome, pales before her similarly educated peers in the professions and business, with whom she has to socialize at symposia. <P>America teems with the newly rich. Bobos are most easily spotted in "Latte Towns" like Madison, Wisconsin or Northampton, Massachusetts. Ideally, such venues have "a Swedish-style government, German-style pedestrian malls, Victorian houses, Native American crafts, Italian coffee, Berkeley human rights groups, and Beverly Hills income levels." That's where you'll see the businessman wearing hiking boots patiently explaining 401(k) plans to the aging hippie who's making a killing selling bicyles, or software, or sandwiches. <P>Brooks is at his best describing the furbelows and follies of Bobo-dom. But Bobos in Paradise is really two books in one. Massive amounts of this text could have been computer cut-and-pasted from a work called something like American Intellectual History: 1955-2000. Sometimes Brooks maintains a light tone (without being truly funny), sometimes he is merely factual. I really didn't need to hear three times how tendentious the old Partisan Review gang was back in the fifties. I didn't really need to hear how a Bobo should act on a political chat show (smile a lot and be positive). I didn't really need to hear how TV has coopted intellectual life (that process began in the fifties with J. Fred Muggs and Steve-a-reeno, before most Bobos were born, and it was dealt with much better in the book Nobrow, anyway). <P>Don't get me wrong, the funny parts of this book are quite funny, and for that reason alone I'm giving it four stars. If it had been consistently funny and satiric I would have given it five. I came real close to giving it a three because the slow stretches, while not inaccurate, did little to further the author's thesis. If you intend to write pop sociology, better to write first-rate pop sociology than second-rate academic sociology.<P>One point to ponder is whether the term "Bobo" will catch on. In 1945 no one had heard of a "Highbrow" and in 1980 no one knew what a "Yuppie" was. And there were plenty of columnists who said that we didn't need such words, yet they became coin of the realm anyway. If it strikes you that your local rich people are starting to act like a fusion of Richard Gere and Bill Gates, or Al Gore and Jerry Garcia, then maybe the Bobo moniker might just cover them all. Hopeless trendoids, take note and read this book before the inevitable paperback edition.</span>

                    <span>Brooks appears on Matthews show, and seems intelligent. That's why I bought the book. Generally, this book hits all the high points of American intellectualism. He tosses out the right names. The book is sort of satiric, and sort of serious.<P>Since it was written in the Bubble period, one can be charitable. Maybe this was the most criticism one could offer up. Now things are more serious. The discussion of how elite universities, how they held their power, could be channeled to ask why academics were so wrong in Iraq? Why are America's ideas, like neo-conservatism, so, um, lame? Is that the word?<P>Brooks gets into a very long discussion of moral absolutes. It's kind of a "Well, if you aren't on the plan, why aren't you going to Hell?" approach. It's a little breathtaking. One can argue that religions differ on the standards, the absolute standards, so if we are here to reconcile religious differences, life is going to be very bloody. He doesn't seem to accept this point, which is fine. Unfortunately, it devalues his idea of moral relativism and the Bobos, though he doesn't use that term, as I recall.<P>I guess it turns out that being shallow, a bit insipid, and totally materialist has a downside. A lot of the poor world tends to hate you, and wants to destroy you. Oh, dear. What a drag. So many snags.<P>So, his point about academia and top schools is interesting, as history, but what are these schools really churning out? Why do we have such a large income disparity? Why are we working so hard to build an elite? It's like Brooks is saying the elite is good enough, why sweat it, but I'm not really in it for vague and undefined reasons.<P>You have to be bright to pull it off. One could ask why anyone would want to pull it off? To have a bestseller?</span>

                    <span>While it may not be as catchy as "preppie" or "yuppie," in "bobo" David Brooks has coined a new term for a newly visible and significant segment of society. A Bobo, he claims, is a hybrid of the bourgeois and the bohemian--a "new meritocracy" or "educated elite." Bobos are the new movers and shakers of American business--in banking, law, the media, anything connected to the high-tech industry, even Hollywood. And like the preppies and the yuppies before them, they're making their mark on the rest of us: Starbucks, for example, was specifically envisioned as a Bobo hangout.<P>Brooks claims that Bobos despise yuppies, but a close study of his book will show that the two groups have several significant things in common. Both are educated professionals (though many Bobos, especially those in computer-connected fields, are college dropouts or never-wents, Bill Gates being the most obvious example) pulling in high salaries (from a minimum $100,000 annual gross to several million); couples are always dual-income. Both are comfortable with high tech in all its latest manifestations. Both take conscientious care of their bodies--no smoking, no drugs, only moderate alcohol consumption, health-club memberships, toning sports like running, skiing, and racquet games. Both are attracted to highbrow culture (Bobos are mad for museums and listen to NPR). Both enjoy vacationing in remote, out-of-the-way spots that don't expose them to the thundering herds of "fat tourists" pouring on and off busses. Both are entranced by "professional-grade" kitchen appliances and want to own a restaurant's worth of lesser tools and equipment. Both are happy to spend prodigious amounts of money on "things that used to be cheap"--everything from T-shirts to bottled water to coffee to food staples. Both think it important to expose their young to lots of broadening experiences, including, of course, private schools. Both are (or claim to be) in love with and consumed by their work. Some Bobos--those who are veterans of SDS or Woodstock--may even have done a turn as yuppies in the '80's before they discovered their true identity. But there are also important differences. The yuppie is a city dweller; Bobos prefer the suburbs (albeit high-end ones)--or small towns like Burlington, Vt., to which many of them eventually move to start up their own little dream businesses, often connected with food. Yuppies are conventional Organization Men and Women; Bobos value creativity, flat hierarchies, and a boss who gets right down in the trenches with his employees instead of issuing edicts from an ivory corner office. Yuppies love sleek, smooth, hard-edged decorating schemes; Bobos choose the country/rustic/ethnic look. Yuppie couples often consciously decide not to procreate, and when they do they confine themselves to one child; Bobos often have two or three (albeit well spaced apart). Yuppies boast about how exhausted they are by their work; Bobos seek balance.<P>The chief fault of this book is that Brooks can't seem to decide whether he comes to mock the Bobos or to praise them. In several of his chapters he adopts a wry voice, as when he discusses the seven rules for spending money, the most favored vacation destinations, or the REI store in Seattle where Microsoft staff loves to shop for explorer-type gear. But as he reaches the "intellectual life" section of the book he waxes sadly sympathetic toward the financial plight of the dual-income couple earning $180,000 a year and trying to send three kids to private school (the oldest is in Stanford). And in explicating the religious and political views of his subjects, he is completely serious; many readers, Bobos or not, will recognize themselves in his descriptions. He closes with a ringing call for the Bobos to assume a position of leadership and guide America "into its next golden age." All in all, it's an interesting book about a group many of us may not have really noticed up till now, but one which has a great influence on our lives.</span>

                    <span>David Brooks is a fine writer. I have always enjoyed his articles in the Weekly Standard, the Atlantic Monthly, and currently his column in the New York Times. He is a whimsical observer of American life. His writing has an inductive quality about it. He writes about slate shower stalls, cappuccino bars, eco-tourism, and the like. Pretty soon he has painted a landscape of American cultural trends. In the introduction of "Bobos in Paradise," Brooks describes his method: "The idea is to get at the essence of cultural patterns, getting the flavor of the times without trying to pin it down with meticulous exactitude" (pg 12). In the book with which Brooks will always be associated, he allows us to taste the surprisingly pleasant combination of bourgeois and bohemian cultures. <P>Being a pastor, I was especially interested in reading Brooks' observations on the spiritual life of the bourgeois bohemians. Bobos, according to Brooks, crave "freedom and flexibility on the one hand and the longing for rigor and orthodoxy on the other" (pg 224). Spirituality, like other areas of Bobo life, seems to display itself in utter contradiction. Frankly, the observation rings true. I see the same conflict in the lives of my parishioners. However, the observation rings too true. I wonder if these conflicts are inherent in human nature rather than particularly Bobo nature. Perhaps, Brooks would see the rich young ruler who desired eternal life, yet could not give up his wealth as the first Bobo (Luke 18). Nonetheless, this observation does not distract from the book since Brooks' intention is to make an impression not a necessarily win an argument.<P>The book has one major drawback. Brooks is a master as an author of articles. The book, however, has the feel of several articles strung together. After reading his acknowledgments, I realize that is exactly how the book developed. As a result, the flow is different from chapter to chapter. The reader sometimes has difficulty making the change. If you can suffer the disjointed feel, then you will enjoy a clever perspective of early twenty-first century life.</span>
