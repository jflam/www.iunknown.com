                    <span>This is the third PHP book I read and covers PHP versions 4 and 5. I worked through all its examples without any problems. Somebody reviewing it said there were errors, but I did not find them using PHP V4.3.2. Following the examples were a lot easier than in other computer books, like Visual Basic 6 by Petroutsos, which I had to abandon three years ago for lack of error-free exercises.<P>The VQS format appears to waste a lot of space, but it has its advantages. There is never any doubt what the script has to be, because it is repeated in its entirety even when only a few lines change. Some books cut this short, and give frugal explanation for what the clear script should be. In the end, one often wastes time in such cases. <P>I have the PHP Manual on my hard disk, and consulting it aids in extending the applications on hand. Once I learned the examples in the book, I was able to extend the scripts, make them more versatile and produce more attractive displays.<P>I started out stating it is my third book on PHP, and reading this book serves as an in-depth review. This book clarified some of the features I thought I learned before. This does not imply that one must have used other PHP books previously. It is an excellent first book on PHP. Of course, one should know some HTML before using this book.<P>Because of the VQS format I would like to rate this four and a half stars, even though the format improves on clarity. Even with this view, the book deserves five-stars.</span>

                    <span>I am somewhat new to programming, even newer to PHP. I have spent hours and hours in local bookstores trying to discern which book to buy. I have now owned 4 books on PHP -- 3 of which have been returned. This is the only one I've kept. Why? Every other book I have looked at is either (a) information overload, or (b) takes forgranted a certain level of programming experience. <P>WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? The beginning programmer--*not* just the beginning "PHP-er," but the beginning programmer. If you have a decent amount of programming experience, this book will be too basic for you. If you have little or no programming experience, this book is *perfect.* So far every line of code used has been explained so that the beginning coded can not just copy down a bunch of code, but actually LEARN programming concepts in general, and in PHP in particular.<P>ARE THERE ERRORS IN THE BOOK? Errors exist in *every* computer book I've ever touched. If you are looking for a book without errors, don't buy one, you will be disappointed. (Two of the other three PHP books I briefly owned were plagued with errors, one even came with a CD which was missing chapter 2 code, thus rendering the book/CD useless. The third book likely was error filled, I didn't keep it around long enough to find out.) However, there is a companion website .... which lists and corrects known errors...and it appears the list is updated when needed. Also, I emailed the author about an area not covered in his book and he promptly emailed me back.<P>I only hesitate to give this book 5 Stars because I am not the world's biggest fan of the "Visual Quickstart" layout. If you've gotten along fine with other Visual Quickstart books, this one is probably one of the best. (Do not compare this book to the horrible JavaScript book put out by Visual Quickstart, as there is no comparison.)<P>Without reservation, I recommend this book for the beginning--even intermediate--programmer who wants to LEARN, not just copy, PHP.</span>

                    <span>This book is great for those new to PHP. I came in with only a little knowledge of HTML, and came out with the basics of PHP + better HTML skills. If you want to learn PHP's basics fast before you use a more complex book, this should be your choice. Its cheap, and a great learning utility along with reference. I recommend it for everyone who wants to learn PHP with close to no knowledge of any other languages.</span>

                    <span>This book quickly got me to the point that I felt comfortable experimenting on my own. I have been doing VB and C programming for several years, having little web programming experience. This book was perfect to help me get familiar with the syntax and concepts of PHP and start putting up data-driven pages.<P>The only specific problem I had with the code samples was that by default register_globals was set to off in the php.ini file of PHP4. I believe this caused a minor problem for one of the form handling examples.</span>
