                    <span>Thank God I got this out of the library and read it, not paid money for it (he does encourage business owners to be frugal). This is the kind of book that someone ought to be able to write in a weekend, and if they spend any more time on it than that, sheesh, why? It's one mind-numbing platitude after another, AND misspellings and odd word choices. The guy's specialty is MARKETING, and he may be very good at that, but this book is like being stuck in kindergarten and turning to your fellow students for insight. At least, how your fellow students would express them: simple, declarative sentences with barely anything deep or insightful to express. "Get customers" is the point of the book. Yay. We probably already knew that. Not fully terrible, but if you're really in need of a book THIS simple, let's just say, don't let it be the only book you read. Whoo hoo.<P>It took me only as long to read as it took my spouse to go to food shopping. Read something by Seth Godin instead or in addition to -- also simply style, but not this simple, and much more to say. (Like Godin's "Purple Cow".)</span>

                    <span>Although some have criticized this book as being too simple, I find it makes a great summary of the important things a small entrepreneur must do.<P>It doesn't take too long to read but it contains lots of practical advice. I underlined mine heavily. <P>This book is also appropriate as a gift to friends that are starting their own company.<P>The most important points that I derived from this book were Fox's lists of things to do, and their priorities. I highly recommend this book, and all the rest by Jeffrey J. Fox. He's become one of my favorite business writers.<P>John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX</span>

                    <span>The author explains that the first and most important task is to<BR>identify quickly the target market of customers. Next, it is critical to compute the break-even-point and the minimum number of customers required to cover the costs of entering into the<BR>business. Ultimately, the author inspires us to do what comes easy to us and what is harder for others to do. He breaks down the time commitment into 60% marketing, 30% service and 10% management. In addition, he points out the necessity to work hard<BR>on a consistent basis.</span>
