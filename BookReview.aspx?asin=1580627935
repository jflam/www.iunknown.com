                    <span>I used this along with "Cover Letter Magic" and "The Very Quick Job Search," and I prefer those over this one. Though certainly an improvement over the old "Enclosed please find" style, the examples throughout the book are still a bit stiff, unnecessarily wordy, and dated. There's also not as much variety as in the other books. 
<br />
<br />On meail cover letters, he gives a bit of misinformation, which suggests he may not be as up-to-speed on email limitations as he could be. Specifically, he suggests using a signature-styled font in an email. (That only works if the recipient has the same font on their PC.) 
<br />
<br />I liked the examples of "Resurrection" letters (basically a thanks for the rejection), but their use is never explained in the book, so there's nothing to suggest this tactic is effective. (The only mention in the other books is in "Cover Letter Magic." They advise against them.) My guess is that this would have to be done selectively and carefully. What may be seen as persistence by the job seeker may be interpreted by the potential employer as either not being able to take a hint or a desperate need to have the last word.
<br />
<br />It's an okay book, particularly if your personal style is somewhat formal and "old school," but it's not worthy of its title.</span>

                    <span>I used this book when I was job searching during my senior year of  college.  I read it cover to cover, and followed the author's advice.  I  was highly successful in my job search, landing my dream job.  I was even  complimented several times on my "very creative" cover letter.   You can't go wrong with this book!</span>

                    <span>I think the letters in this book are just average, and they focus on me, me, me.  There is nothing that helps the writer craft a letter to meet the needs of the employer.  A good title, but this books misses the mark.</span>
