                    <span>I liked this book. After taking a discrete math course some time ago then promptly and deliberately forgetting as much as humanly possible about it. I am going on to get a masters degree in computer science. The professors love discrete math so some work involves writing things out mathematically. I am not a math oriented person unless that math pertains to what I am currently working on, 3D graphics, Neural networks, etc.  I was able to fly through this book feeling like I picked up a lot of useful information and it will serve as a simple reference.  This isn't the 'be all end all' of discrete math it's a simple intro/refresher, of the core topics, which my discrete math professor must have glossed straight over to get to the "fun stuff".  Fun for math nerds maybe, but when I was called on to reproduce this knowledge outside of that class most of what must be demonstrated is the basic core stuff.  
<br />
<br />So I am happy to say this book helped me refresh my skills up to the point I am confident I will be able to slide under the radar during that work to do well in the courses I am taking.
<br />
<br />I was tempted to give this book 4 stars because it is still a math book, but what the heck.  5/5

                    <span>From reading the above reviews, I assumed the book was a good source of information to help me understand the materials being covered in class.  There are some useful information in the book but it didn't cover 50% of the topics that were went over in class. <br>A few topics that the book didn't cover was:  <br>* Big O concept<br>* Modular Arithmetic</span>

                    <span>If you've read other textbooks on Discrete Math and had as much trouble as I did following them, then this book is for you. It covers the material well and is easier to follow then most other books on the subject. Plus, the price is right!</span>

                    <span>I bought Keneth Rosen's book on ebay, and uhhhhh... The thing was 600 pages long, and boring... I was looking for something simpler and shorter, and Dr. Dean's book was just what I needed. There are several things that I like about this book <br> 1. It is short<br> 2. No fluff <br> 3. It explain foundations of discrete math giving it some practical side. <br> 4. It is easy to read<br> 5. Solutions to questions is provided even the book is 200 pages long<br> <br> If you are struggling programmer who need some grounding in formalism or you would like to get started with discrete math, than this book is a good start. For 13 bucks it is more than a great deal. Big thanks to the author. <br> Dmitriy</span>
