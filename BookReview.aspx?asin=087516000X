                    <span>This book can help you clarify your own processes in your life.  It makes you think about how to get what you want out of life, whether it's financial success, love, good health, or anything else through the power of you.  It gives a spiritual and intellectual look at yourself.
<br />
<br />This book is really short and gets right to the point.  Some of the most important aspects I've listed below:
<br />*Prayers are only realized once they are harmonized with your thoughts and actions.
<br />*Use your circumstances to discover your hidden powers and possibilities within yourself.
<br />*Change your thoughts towards others and other things, and those things will change in kind.
<br />*Fear, doubt, and indecision lead to failure, indigence, and dependence.
<br />*Courage, self-reliance, and decision will generate success, plenty, and freedom.
<br />*Your thoughts will shape your circumstances.
<br />*Thoughts allied to fearless purpose becomes a creative force.
<br />*Ideals and visions constantly acted upon will result in eventual attainment.
<br />
<br />This book is more than a good buy and an addition to your library, but is potentially life changing if you follow the principles!</span>

                    <span>This book can be summed up in 3 sentences:
<br /> 'If you think bad, bad's what you'll get.'
<br /> 'Do the right thing.'
<br /> 'You have the power to control your mind.'
<br />
<br />If you're looking for self help, I recommend Dr. Laura.  If you're looking for philosophy of the mind, I recommend starting with Roger Penrose.  Then again, for 2 bucks, if you just want to read some flowery english to make you feel 'smart,' then this book might be great for you.  I think they could make more money if they put every sentence from this book on a desk calendar. so you could pull off the date and get a little message each morning.
<br />
<br />A desk calendar would at least do something useful!  The fact that there are so many positive reviews for this book caused me to sit down and read it.  after completing it, I fear even more for the human race.

                    <span>The basic assumptions of this book completely contradict sociological theory established by C.Wright Mills and others.  Throughout the text there are many assertions put forth at "true" which seem to be no more than the author's opinion.
<br />Some of it is far fetched and in a few spots down right bunk.  Still, with all that being said, I found about eight statements that are absolutely classic and feel very worthwhile to me.  Worth reading for those with open minds who can think for themselves.  First read will take less than an hour, but if you are anything like me you will continue to think on the precepts for many days to come.  LJB</span>

                    <span>Ancient wisdom explained and simplified. After reading this book several times, I realize more and more who is at the core of my success or failure...me. The beauty, however, is that Mr. Allen guides you to a place where correction can be made. I am convinced that I would have avoided many pitfalls if I had been exposed to the richness of the principles in this book years ago. Read and reread this book and buy a copy for a friend. This is a "must have" for anyone seeking to improve their world by imporoving themselves.</span>

                    <span>The greatest invention of all time - started in someone's brain. 
<br />
<br />That Person is what we call The Visionary. 
<br />
<br />What is amazing is that we are all visionaries. However because a negative visionary is not called a visionary, we don't perceive ourselves to be visionaries. This book shows you that you too are a visionary. You do create your own future. That said, what type of future do you want in your life?
