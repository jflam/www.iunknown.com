                <span id="Label1">Here is the candid collected wisdom of Jim McCarthy, a software industry veteran and the director of the Microsoft Visual C++ development group. In McCarthy's words, "More people have ascended bodily into heaven than have shipped great software on time"; but shipping great software on time can be done, he insists, and this book tells how. DYNAMICS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT is divided into five sections that chart the progress from initial design to successful product. Throughout, McCarthy expresses his sometimes-controversial judgments in witty, memorable maxims, one of which has become the title of the book. Destined to be a cult classic, DYNAMICS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT will get a lot of attention in the industry and cause a favorable stir in the press.</span>

                    <span>This books describes Jim McCarthy's story on developing Visual C++ 1.0. The method of development has much in line with the agile development methods at this moment. Quotes like "embrace the change" are now quite common but were less common in 1995.<P>The book is written in a very funny way. It's not always easy to follow the author but that doesn't really make it much worse. Jim McCarty puts very much effort on the "group psyche" and focus on team work and communication. He tries to describe on how to make a team with a "winning mood" which then should take all responsibility and 'just' finish the product.<P>Parts like "Group psyche", "Don't flip the bozo bit", "The world changes and so should you" and "slip but don't fall" are extremly good and useful to read! When reading the book I really got the feeling that he knows how to ship great intellectual property. And the success of the Visual C++ compiler also shows that his methods have been very successfull.<P>The second edition of the book will be released in 2 days from now (6 Feb. 2004) and that's certainly a book which I will read again! Great stuff.</span>

                    <span>You hear a lot today that talent is so scarce, esp. in the field of programming. Well, that's one of the biggest lies of our times. I've found Jim McCarthy's book extremely helpful in finding valuable characteristics programmers have. Programming is a lot more than just writing code and this book will help you see that. It'll encourage you to find out the other parts of software development and how people who may not know the latest buzzwords are nevertheless far more capable than the industry tends to give them credit.<P>It'll definitely cause you to question your processes of software development (do you have any where you work?), esp. if you believe that your way is the only way. Programming is much more about problem solving, so will you be versatile enough to welcome the many ways that many gifted individuals are able to design and create software, even when it's not what you originally had in mind?<P>I've found the Appendix extremely helpful. I love the part where Jim explains that the biggest mistake hiring managers make is their present obsession with buzzwords of the day, buzzwords which 2 to 4 years later become obsolete. Instead, what's really needed is to understand how a programmer uses technology to solve the problems at hand. The way programmers are evaluated during job interviews are in many places so inaccurate as this book points out, and you'll also get some ideas as to how to rectify this.<P>Probably the only people I have found who are not turned on by this book are those who say that software development and computers in general have no place for "touchy-feely" aspects like motivation and job satisfaction. But for those who want to find more of a human connection with the programming they do, I highly recommend it. That especially goes for managers in high-tech who usually get promoted because of their technical abilities alone. These same managers get no training in management, esp. in the handling of people skills. This book is indeed a great investment to begin learning some of these vital skills, esp. when so many say they got into high-tech professions like Information Technology because such occupations don't have to deal with hot human issues like egos and office politics. Guess again!<P>Lastly, my other favorite part within the book is the comparison of a well-run software organization with that of an awesome jazz band. Jazz lets individuals solo and improvise while the accompanying team provides an invigorating backdrop. And individuals each get a chance to solo, supported by team members' respect and admiration. I've experienced tremendous highs playing in both great jazz ensembles and software teams. Now you can too!</span>

                    <span>Despite the occasional lapse into speech resembling the Microsoft line and the relative age of the book, the message this book contains is still applicable. Software development is a very hard, (perhaps the hardest of all), thing to do and humans have yet to master it. McCarthy was a primary manager of the original Microsoft Visual C++ project and when he joined the group, it was in shambles. There was a lack of direction, and contrary too much of the published data, most C programmers had not yet made the transition to coding in C++. While it was true that the developers were using compilers that understood C++ source code, the code they were developing was a slightly modified C code that was translated using a C++ compiler. Under his direction, the Visual C++ team created a package that automated many of the complex, yet largely routine tasks of using C++, doing much to spread the use of the language. <BR> McCarthy has since become an evangelist for sensible software practices, and he has preached his sermons in many locations. The essence of those sermons is condensed into the 54 software development "rules" that appear in this book. Most of them continue to appear in the continuous cycle of books professing to put forward new, (so to speak), ways of developing software. For example, number 18, "Cycle Rapidly", is one of the fundamental principles of Extreme Programming, about which a large number of books have been written. Number 56, "Every milestone deserves a no-blame postmortem.", is the fundamental principle of the book, "Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews" by Norman L. Kerth and published by Dorset House in 2001. <BR> Therefore, since having your ideas repeated by experts who come later is the highest form of confirmation that they are good, there is no doubt that the ideas in this book are well worth reading. I have not investigated the chronology of the main ideas of software development that are currently bandied about, but it is quite possible that some of them first appeared in this book.</span>

                    <span>This book delivers great insight into what goes on in software development. Although presented in the context of work performed on Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0, the author does a good job of generalizing specific experience. McCarthy gives us an honest look into the ups and downs without sugar coating or promising silver bullets.<P>Presented in a format similar to Meyers' "Effective C++" books, the text flows very well and is a pleasure to read. When you read many of the pitfals presented, you may think "Duh!". However, these are things that I see happen regularly. Here are some of the highlights.<P>Rule #2 "Get Their Heads Into The Game". This sounds like a very simple rule. Everyone on the team needs to be contributing ideas toward creating intellectual property. However, most people know this is easier said than done. McCarthy goes on to explain the barriers to the flow of ideas.<P>Rule #4 "Don't Flip The Bozo Bit". This rule is necessary to keep #2 working. The author deals with the natural tendency that people have to become defensive when criticism is offered of their ideas. This can actually cause both the critic and the one being criticized to tune each other out. The author suggests that team members call each other on it when the Bozo Bit is being flipped.<P>Rule #25 "Don't Accept Dictation". This topic is addressed in many other texts, but that fact should tell us that we aren't getting it. McCarthy reminds us that it is foolish to accept dictation of scheudle, features, and resources. The "Holy Triangle" has to be balanced and tradeoffs are required when changing any one of these three. Managers are encouraged to be strong and take a stand when they find themselves in this situation. Eight years after this book was published, I still see this very thing happening. Until something changes, we will continue to see this issue addressed in software management texts.<P>Rule #31 "Beware Of A Guy In A Room". Software development is a collaborative effort. Don't let people isolate themselves. There is no opportunity for feedback or help when problems arise, and this can derail the project.<P>The appendix on "Hiring And Keeping Good People" is also very helpful. If you are like most managers, you didn't get to hire most of the people that work for you. Here you will find practical advice for letting your superstars reach their potential and getting something out of everyone.</span>

                    <span>For several years I've been aware that the biggest obstacles to overcome in producing high quality software are not technical but psychological. Finally here is a software engineering book that deals effectively with these problems.<P>Jim McCarthy explains the psychology behind cooperative vs competitive behaviours and gives you practical techniques that you as a software development leader can undertake. People make decisions based upon emotions more often than on intellect; that's a reality.<P>If you've ever wanted to act as an agent of change, you will know that you fail more often than you succeed and its risky. Giving someone advice that they haven't asked for is tricky.<P>When management creates an atmosphere where people feel safe about sharing their ideas & creating a shared vision and an evolutionary technology plan, then your group will become as supercharged as a V12 Pratt & Whitney engine!<P>This book would revolutionize software development if more people read it and understood it. It's great for technical recruiters too. Jim explains how to recognize the super achievers instead of trying to recruit an alphabet soup of acronyms.<P>Most people who write a review for this book are those who really liked it. The reviewers who didn't like it, hate it. I suspect technical people are going to find this book hard to swallow or are going to have a real preconceived antipathy, because they are focused upon their own achievements without regard to how they should behave as a team. This is due to a failure on the part of management to set forth these principles & guidelines. Certainly you can't expect to institute meaningful change if you are only a developer with limited influence, however this book gives you a framework to communicate to management.</span>
