                <span id="Label1">"Intended as an upper-level undergraduate or introductory graduate text in computer science theory," this book lucidly covers the key concepts and theorems of the theory of computation. The presentation is remarkably clear; for example, the "proof idea," which offers the reader an intuitive feel for how the proof was constructed, accompanies many of the theorems and a proof. <I>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</I> covers the usual topics for this type of text plus it features a solid section on complexity theory--including an entire chapter on space complexity. The final chapter introduces more advanced topics, such as the discussion of complexity classes associated with probabilistic algorithms.</span>

                    <span>yeah, sure, Sipser manages to pack a lot of difficult stuff into a small book and makes it seem easy. think again, you'll find that's because he's not telling you the whole story! a lot of interesting materials are just skipped. For example, Greibach normal form of CFG is nowhere seen in the book, which makes Sipser's explaining of converting CFG to NPDA (lemma 2.13) very uninteresting. Compare with lecture 24 in Kozen's book, you'll see the difference. This book also lacks examples. Without seeing enough examples, you just  won't grasp the concepts firmly. That's mainly the reason why the exercises and problems seem so difficult.
<br />
<br />I recommend Kozen's "Automata and Computability", Hopcroft and Ullman's "automata, languages, computation" and Papadimitriou's  "computational complexity". but not this one.  </span>

                    <span>Prof. Sipser gives a fabulous introduction to theoretical computer science.  His clear and concise proofs are preceding by "Proof Ideas" that give a non-technical overview of the proof to follow.  This makes the proofs far easier to follow.  He strikes a perfect balance between concise mathematics and eloquent exposition, so the book neither intimidates the novice student nor bores the seasonsed  mathematician.  This is a model computer science/mathematics textbook!</span>

                    <span>This book is unbelievably effective at getting the students prepared for what Computer Science it's all about. This semester I had the luck to get a great professor who has made clear that mathematics, vis a vis computers, it's not about "pushing symbols" or numbers. It's about understanding what a computer is in its innermost form. This book accomplishes that marvelously. As an undergraduate Computer Science student I find this book to be enlightening. It's one of the best, if not the best, book in the field. The coherence and candid and unassuming tone of the author makes the book much more approachable than most books in the subject. He, the author, understood that most CS people were getting "thrown off" by the lingo and the mathematical assumptions made by so many other authors in the field. 
<br />As a refutal to one reviewer: The fact that this book does not have a solution manual is what makes it SO great! Guess what? In real life, in mathematics there is NO solutions manual! You have to find it by yourself. Most problems in mathematics go without solution for ages, until one person has the epiphany and solves it. Most mathematicians, in as hard as they work and as smart as they are, never discover new proofs or new theories. It's irresponsible to lambast this volume just because "it does not have a solution manual."</span>

                    <span>This book is terrible as a text book.  The chapters give very simplistic examples, then the problems at the end of the chapters are very difficult.  There is no solutions manual, so there is no way to know if you are doing the problems correctly.  Let's face it, Automata theory is math, who ever heard of a college level math book without a solutions manual.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion this is one of the best written books in the CS discipline, a must have for every computer scientist. The topics are presented clearly, with emphasis in understanding the concept, which most of the times is missed in other books amongst the equation line up of theorems that nobody will further investigate. Probably not comprehensive enough for a researcher of the field, but definately the right text to start on the subject and comprehend the basics, which is more than most students in the CS field will need.</span>
