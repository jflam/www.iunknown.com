                <span id="Label1">Among Thelonious Monk's long stays at New York's legendary Five Spot was a six-month period in 1957 with possibly his most brilliant band, with John Coltrane finding fuel in Monk's music for his harmonic explorations. The quartet only recorded three studio tracks: a sublime reading of Monk's ballad "Ruby, My Dear"; a loping version of "Nutty"; and a stunning version of "Trinkle Tinkle" on which Trane's tenor mirrors Monk's piano part. The CD is completed with outtakes from an octet session that joined Coltrane and Coleman Hawkins and an extended solo version of "Functional." <i>--Stuart Broomer</i></span>

                    <span>When two of the greatest jazz musicians of all time get together, one would expect nothing less than sheer brilliance. This album delivers. There is a wonderful playfulness to this album that makes it one of my favorites.</span>

                    <span>I'm giving this disc 5 stars, because it features Jazz greats in their prime, with amazing talent. However, I guess I should have paid closer attention to the song listings, because with so few tracks, this disc has only about 37minutes of music. I was hoping for more. It would act as a great introduction to Jazz for the novice, I would highly recommend it in that. For the real fan, there are lenghtier discs which would better serve your cashflow.</span>

                    <span>I was a little dissapointed with this one, it should have a label saying: historic 3 tracks, the other tracks are just fillers. The 3 tracks of Trane and Monk are amongst the best I have ever heard in jazz, electryfing. But theres also two outtakes from the Monks music album that you dont need if you already own that album and that do not show the chemistry between Trane and Monk. And then there is a track with Monk playing by himslef. I cannot help but feeling a litlle .... off, sorry.</span>
