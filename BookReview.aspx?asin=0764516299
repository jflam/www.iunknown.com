                    <span>I bought this book because I was designing a web site for the very first time.  I had some background knowledge of other Adobe products but had never used GoLive.<p>The book does a good job of explaining the tools avaialble in the program but has little information about how to really use these tools to make your site look good.  The pages he shows you how to make in the book are uninspiring at best.  If you're looking to make a more visually appealing site that has a professional sort of quality, this book will not help you figure out how to do that.  Also, as with most programs, you're not going to use a lot of the more advanced features so a good majority of the book, while useful as a reference perhaps, was not relevant for me.<p>I ended up having to go online and read independent tutorials or ask friends to get the information I needed to learn how to use the tools to make my site visually appealing.</span>

                    <span>Before I purchased Go Live 6 for Dummies, I was pretty comfortable doing my html the old fashioned way-- with PageMill.  However, upgrading my Mac to OS X meant upgrading my software.<p>This book is another fine For Dummies product.  It was straight-forward enough for me (being familiar with html and the parent-application that spawned Go Live) to just read it through.  Now I just use it as a reference tool.  I don't think I have ever even opened the manual that came with the application.</span>
