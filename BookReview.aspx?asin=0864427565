                    <span>This book gives an fairly impartial yet Western view of modern Iran. I can see how some Iranians would criticize it, but my wife who is Iranian and me (an American) spent 4 weeks traveling in Iran in March 2000 found this book to be useful before, during, and after the trip. We never encountered any anti-American or anti-West attitudes during our trip, in fact just the opposite. Sure there aren't the nightclubs or other forms of 'entertainment' that you find in the west, like Paul mentions but for us this became an opportunity to do other things. They don't roll up the streets at dark, far from it. The coffee shops, resturants, stores, and bazaars in many cities are open quite late with many people shopping, having a meal or a chat. My wife said it was much better there than her last trip in 1996. I had a great time! If you're planning a trip to Iran (even if you're Iranian) get this book (my wife enjoyed it too).</span>

                    <span>One of the few guide books for Iran. Detailed maps and info bring out the rich culture and history of the nation. Some of the information however is outdated.</span>

                    <span>Racist commentary presented in backhanded journo-speak that is unfortunately typical of english language books on Iran. Example of tactics employed - if you want to say something particularly offensive/outrageous/demeaning, deflect blame by attributing the comment to a "source" or a "reader". Hopefully actual readers with the gumption to travel to the Middle East are intelligent enough to sift through Yale's antipathetic commentary and put the book to its best use - a compact set of maps, place names and telephone numbers.</span>

                    <span>While the guide is relatively useful for hotels (prices are outdated), it is not very interesting for the restaurants nor transport (many many obvious options aren't listed), nor for other practical information as many of Pat Yale's comments are negative, predicting hassle, bureaucracy or cheating when there is only friendlyness, smiles and enough english to handle the situation. <BR>Her comments on wearing the Hedjab are displaced. If wearing a scarf ruins your holiday to that point, are you realy the right person to write a guide book ?<BR>Pat Yale seems to have been afraid during her trip in Iran, and annoyed by iranians. They are the most friendly people I have encourtered on my many trips. I travelled on my own, and was not pinched in the back or molestated by anyone, never. The Lonely Planet, full of comments warning lone women travellers to better take a guided tour, made me hesitating unneccesarily before my departure.<BR>I did not appreciate her comments on the american blocus, where she pretends that other countries, including Europe and Japan, are too eager to tap on Irans ressources. <BR>Iran and the Iranians, and you as a tourist, definitely desserve a better guide, and Lonely Planet needs more competition.</span>

                    <span>I traveled to Iran for 2 weeks earlier this year and found it fine for my needs. Some of the info was outdated (travel agents in the US, some hotel stuff, etc). I can't speak about remote areas that other reviewers mentioned, but if you are planning to visit the major areas (Tehran, Shiraz, Esfahan), the book has everything you'd need.</span>
