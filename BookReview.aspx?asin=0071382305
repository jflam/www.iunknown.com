                    <span>For anyone who writes in a business environment-which is probably most people reading this-The Business Style Handbook is an extremely useful reference. I especially appreciated the introductory material, which provides the basis for great marketing copy for those of us who write and edit for a living. And it's a great relief to have a handy reference for handling all those marketing-speak and tech-speak neologisms and inconsistencies. 
<br />
<br />Plus this book is much more manageable in size and price than most writers' and editors' manuals, which few people besides professional writers and editors are going to be willing to invest in. I checked it out of the library first to see whether it was worth buying, and my conclusion was "Yes, definitely!"</span>

                    <span>I'm glad I had a copy of The Business Style Handbook when a big argument erupted in my department. One group said you have to write "an NYSE stock" while another said you have to write "a NSYE stock." I took out a copy of The Business Style Handbook (which my wife gave me for Christmas to help me improve my e-mail) to settle the dispute. By the way, it should be written "an NYSE stock."  It's one of the first times I've been on the right side of a grammar argument.</span>

                    <span>A while ago, a friend asked me to review some business correspondence when I was in Beijing. Subsequently, I always thought that it would be helpful to find him some business writing reference books. When I came across The Business Style Handbook (in both English and Chinese), I recommended them to my friend.<br> <br>The book is very practical. It differs from a regular dictionary in that it contains not only definitions for terms but also their cultural and social backgrounds. Look for the references for items such as 360-degree review, 401(k) or cookie. They are very helpful to people with different language backgrounds. Another advantage is the included examples, such as how to properly use kudos. Additionally, the first five chapters provide an excellent summary on modern business writing. In all, no matter it is for a beginner or as a reference, the book provides a lot of value to its readers.</span>

                    <span>I write on tight deadlines and can't afford to make mistakes in the work I produce.  This book is a big help.  It is a valued resource for questions on grammar, spelling and pronunciation.  And it is written in plain english; no need to wade through discussions on the fine points of grammar.  It also makes a great gift.</span>

                    <span>I spend a good deal of time at work writing documents and e-mails. When I have questions about how to write something correctly, The Business Style Handbook is my reference tool of first resort.  Its focus on business and finance is invaluable. Where else could I quickly find out whether to use a hyphen in enterprise-wide or parentheses with 401 (k)? The chapter on e-mail is also useful, as is the information from the Fortune 500.<br>It is now suggested reading for the employees in our Fortune 500 company.</span>
