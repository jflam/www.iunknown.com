                <span id="Label1">Naked is a riotous compilation of stories performed by David and Amy Sedaris.  Publishers Weekly praised this program's "smashing use of the audio as a unique entertainment medium" and called the performances "highly likeable and spirited throughout."  They also named it one of "the best of the best" tapes of the year, and deemed it worthy of "multiple listens."</span>

                    <span>I would love to give this books five stars but I can't. There were three stories ("Chipped Beef," "Dinah, the Christmas Whore," and "The Drama Bug") that just didn't grab me, so I can't in good conscience give "Naked" a perfect rating. But it's a very strong 4....like a 4.7.<P>David Sedaris is one of the funniest authors I've ever read. His storytelling is superb and absolutely hilarious! This is a must-read for anyone out there who wants to temporarily escape their own dull lives and live vicariously through someone else. Underneath Sedaris's humorous adventures lies a sadness and fear, but that's what makes the stories so beautiful and genuine. Living with OCD, his mother's death, and realizing and accepting his homosexuality are amongst life's trying situations, to say the least. But Sedaris recounts those experiences with tenderness and dignity. I dreaded getting to the last page, and when I closed the book and put it back on the shelf it felt like I was losing a new friend. So...the solution to that was simple....I just pre-ordered his next book. <P>NOTE: If you loved "Naked" you'll love "Barrell Fever."</span>

                    <span>NAKED is--by far--the funniest book I have ever read. Several people suggested that I read it, and I ignored them for a long time: I had a lot of other books I wanted to get to first. I finally read it this weekend. The next thing I knew, I was ordering HOLIDAYS ON ICE and BARREL FEVER.<P>NAKED is a collection of true stories from David Sedaris's life. I only wish my life was half as funny. <P>"Chipped Beef," "Get Your Ya-Ya's Out" and "I Like Guys" are highlights of this collection, but the funniest story is "A Plague of Tics." In it, Sedaris discusses his strange behaviors as a child: licking lightswitches, hitting himself with his shoe. I laughed so hard reading this story that my roommate told me I was going to have to shut up.<P>Give NAKED a shot. If you like it, pick up BARREL FEVER. It isn't as funny, but it's close.</span>

                    <span>David Sedaris takes you on a journey through part of his life in a series of autobiographical essays - each one better than the last. If you're in the mood for a comical autobiography then this is for you!</span>

                    <span>I loved David Sedaris' "NAKED." Bred of the same ilk as Augusten Burroughs' "RUNNING WITH SCISSORS" and Rikki Lee Travolta's "MY FRACTURED LIFE", the story is a collection of true misadventures told with scathingly fierce wit and dark humor. One of the funniest of its kind.</span>

                    <span>This collection of autobiographical essays ranges the gamut of diverse topics from a nudist colony (the essay which gives the collection its title) to a chain-smoking mother dying of cancer, to the prostitute who David's sister rescues one Christmas Eve. ('I felt superior to all the other families on the block, because suddenly the phrase 'Ho, ho, ho!' had an entirely new meaning to me.') <P>Sedaris, one of a select few openly homosexual authors to reach out to a broader audience, makes his prose sparkle with wit and cynicism. In the stories of his semi-dysfunctional family life, you will catch elements of your own (probably tame and normal) life. While being darkly funny and cynical, Sedaris balances humor with a touching tenderness about his mother's fatal bout with cancer. But lest he become too much of a softie, such zany essays such as 'A Plague of Tics,' about his collection of nervous habits growing up. ('Don't you lick that light switch one more time, young man!') <P>Sedaris's unique blend of dark humor, cynicism and wonderful tenderness and reflection are reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut. Sedaris bares his soul for the world to see Naked, showing us the contradiction of humanity. He is a satirist with a heart, a chain-smoking, zany, wonderful author who will leave you at the end of an essay in tears of laughter, choked up on a wonderful, sadly funny concept.
