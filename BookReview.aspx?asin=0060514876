                    <span>Pollan taps into an almost universal wish -- to be doing something else for a living. His strength here, as in his previous books, is to be a cheerleader. Everyone wants to be told, "go ahead, you can do it," and Pollan tells us just that.<p>Since he defines Second Acts so broadly (a couple who decide to buy a second home in the country, for instance), nearly everyone can be considered a candidate for a Second Act. He outlines the steps you should take before taking the leap. Decide just what it is you want and don't want, determine what financial and family support you will need, etc. By making an orderly exercise out of it, it seems more attainable.<p>Pollan is good at organizing us and putting a positive spin on doing something that is risky and frightening for most of us. I have to disagree with him on one point, and that is asking family members for money. He says that your family wants you to be happy, and if they were planning on leaving you money in their will, for instance, you should tell them you need it now. Or, if you don't have willing and wealthy grandparents, ask siblings or parents for a loan. This sounds like a mistake to me, but maybe Pollan knows better. It would also be nice to have a summary of the steps at the end of the book.<p>If you are thinking of a Second Act (and who isn't), you could probably figure out Pollan's steps on your own, but it's nice to have them organized for you with a friendly mentor cheering you on.</span>

                    <span>This book is fantastic.  It is valuable to anyone who works, even if you are not considering a second act it give you something to think about and some hard questions to ask yourself.  You may decide after reading this and going through the exercises that you should consider a second act.  If you are already considering one this book will help you get a better handle on what you need to do. It helps you set goals and objectives for your big move.  I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>According to Stephen Pollan, you are reading "Second Acts" at exactly the right time. If you have been toying with the idea of changing your life, this book will push you into taking the steps to achieve success. This is not a book to sit and read through.  Rather, it is a workbook of exercises to perform to help you realize your own second act.  Pollan describes himself as a "life coach," but he is really a cheerleader...your best friend who will give you inspiration and solutions on how to finally be what you always wanted to be when you grew up. <p>My one beef with Pollan's system is that he is serious when he presents his examples as though the "common man" can follow the same paths to success as the rich and famous.  Most of these examples are writers, actors and politicians who have launched successful second lives from their very successful first lives. However, if you ignore this fluff and use Pollan's system, you can find out how to overcome your doubts about your money, age, education, appearance, lack of connections, or any other perceived roadblocks and make your dream life a reality.</span>
