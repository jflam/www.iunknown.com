                <span id="Label1"><p>Patricia Roush&#146;s girls were kidnapped more than 16 years ago and taken by their Saudi father, who they hardly knew, to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They were three and seven at the time. <i>At Any Price</i> is the story of her fight to get them back from a father with a documented history of severe mental illnesses and violent tendencies. In the midst of this tragic set of circumstances was a bigger problem&#151;an ongoing, demoralizing struggle with the U.S. government and the Saudi kingdom to reunite her with her children.</p><p><i> At Any Price</i> reveals the desperate and risky attempts for rescue that slip again and again from Patricia&#146;s grasp. This personal story of bravery, courage, and faith will warm and inspire readers.</p></span>

                    <span>I am amazed at the misfortunes this valiant woman and her family have gone through. The author gives details of American greed for oil, leading to the unwillingness of our government to stand up for the rights of American citizens. And throughout the book, Ms. Roush is very honest, and shows great insight into herself, and both Saudi Arabia and America.<P>Pat Roush is an inspiring role model who has shown steadfastness and determination through troubles that would have crushed a lesser person. <P>This book is one I'm always going to keep on my bookshelves.</span>

                    <span>Upon finishing this totalling enralling and very well written book I am amazed at the courage, bravery and endurance this woman has had to sustain for nearly two decades. Not only has she devoted her life to freeing her innocent daughters from the totalitarian clutches of a Stalinistic regime like Saudi Arabia, had to fight her own government who obviously worked as 'Saudi agents' and compromised her and her daughters in every way but has helped so very many others in similar situations.<P>Ms. Roush keeps the reader on the 'edge of your seat' as she wages her Joan of Arc battles all alone amidst insurmountable government betrayal and abuse. What she has done for this issue of human rights for women and children caught inside Saudi Arabia not to mention her tireless work as a pioneer in international child abduction is truly astounding. Her work with legislation, media, the U.S. Congress and the United Nations not to mention all the personal time and expense she has given to those in need is an inspiration to me. <P>I found this book to be a special gift to America - to us all; it is exactly what is needed in these days of government deception and the focus on the Middle East. Her story of love, hope and faith should be on everyone's reading list.</span>

                    <span>I have read many books on the Middle East. Some of which relate to this issue. This book is by far the worst I have ever read. It was long and boring. I had to skip many parts just to get through the book. This was such an important issue. She should have written it differently. I would not recommend this book to anyone.</span>

                    <span>Too bad that Ms. Roush has only learned to walk all over those who have done all they could to help both she and her daughters over the years, and for what, monetary gain? She certainly does not take one step towards helping the thousands of parents who also have abducted children currently.<P>No, she steals a photograph for the cover taken by a disabled woman without her permission, compensation, or even photographic credit. No credit or name given to the other parents, online individuals and song artists for all the hard work they have contributed through the years, without even a "thank you" from this woman. Unknown little people who were trampled. Even the song writers Doug DeForest and Craig Deanto, used for her book and not mentioned by name.<P>Some of these people still write her and other parents, even though they are suffering with MS and other illnesses. She deletes their mail and treats them like dirt. One of the people in the photo she used without permission should not be on the cover of a book about missing children! They are a known and convicted stalker. What a nightmare this woman is. With her hatred she seems to have forgotten all of the people who lended their shoulders, money and more in her times of need.<P>Do not give this woman any more money, please. Go find a children's organization who really helps and give them the donation.</span>

                    <span>As an American who lived in Saudi Arabia for many years, it quickly became clear that the American Embassy would be the last place I would go should I need assistance. In Saudi Arabia, it appeared that our government representatives only cared about the feelings of the Saudi government, and couldn't have cared less about American citizens. This was very troubling to me then, and extremely upsetting to me now. Pat Roush's book reminded me again of the shameful behavior of America's state department. Her case was not a question of a marital dispute or even child custody, it was a case of kidnapping! I am incensed that former Ambassadors end up on the Saudi payroll. Frankly, I believe it should be forbidden for any former American government official to accept jobs or money from the Saudis, or from any other foreign government. Why is this not a criminal offense? <P>I think Pat Roush is remarkable. She has never stopped fighting for her children, against all odds. Her book is very readable, although your heart aches for her, and for her two children who never had the opportunity to grow up with their loving mother.<P>I just wish there was something I could do to right this situation, but only our government can make a difference. Every American should be INCENSED that our own government refuses to help these mothers--actually, the state department works AGAINST these American mothers! <P>I applaud Pat Roush and pray that one day, she'll have her two American daughters and their children back where they belong, in America. And, I hope that every American who has worked on behalf of the Saudis to hurt these mothers, will one day understand the terrible hurt and harm they have caused...</span>
