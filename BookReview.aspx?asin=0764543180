                    <span>Ok... I must admit, I am no photographer.  I live my professional life in marketing.  Strategy, concepts and copy.  Oh, yes I can "hack" around with the best of the programs.  So armed with a $1200 digital camera, rudimentary skills in Photoshop and this book.  Man... what a world of difference.   There's just too much to say...  get the book, it's well written, the tutorials make it easy for even the nerdiest of number crunchers.  Stop listening to me... just buy it already.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First and foremost, this book is MUCH more confusing and difficult than it needs to be.  I've been using Photoshop for ten years, dolling up model photography for about three, and have read extensively on the topics, so I'm far from a novice.  But many of the step-by-steps in this book literally give me headaches after constant re-reads of trying to sort them out.  The narrative is frequently simply unclear.
<br />
<br />All due respect to the parties involved, but it needs a severe editorial pass from an objective eye.  And perhaps a different "voice," that markets the book as "this is how Kevin Ames does it" rather than "this is how YOU ought to do it."  I.e., the "Ames way," rather than "the BEST way."  Because it really reflects how he's taught himself to work, moreso than surefire methods.
<br />
<br />That said, the book is far from worthless.  There ARE some good tips and tricks, and the narrow subject matter makes it refreshing (and even lovely) on a crowded shelf that tends toward redundancy.  There's a good chapter on how to composite multiple shots into one portrait.  (I had just finished a similar project of my own, so it WAS interesting to read someone else's take on it, and I found no flaw with his advice.)  And some of the general workflow stuff is good reference/food for thought.  
<br />
<br />Perhaps that's the balance of this book in a nutshell:  good when it's general, but frequently maddening in its specific long exercises.  And I blame that on language, not the steps themselves.  There's lots that's right about the book, but it reads too much like a first draft.  For instance, the numbered steps would benefit hugely from headlines and parallelism.  I.e., clearly delineate between "do this" and "here's why," rather than muddle the steps and explanations together broken up only by numbers.
<br />
<br />BTW, just to get it off my chest, but there should be a LAW against featuring an example on the back of the book that is not illustrated within.  There's a chapter on the "nostalgia pinup look" that's only barely relevant to the pinup shot on the back cover.  Nothing at all about "nostalgia coloring," for example.
<br />
<br />In a list of recommended reading, this would qualify as a "might read," but not yet a "must read."  As this first edition, it probably has more unqualified value in its photography tips than the Photoshop guidance itself.  If a second edition were to be proofed more objectively, it'd probably become a more solid and useful addition to the canon.</span>

                    <span>If you think about it, "women" here are simply a paradigm of the most beautiful and the most demanding subjects. Perfection is required almost always when you're dealing with them - and that is what this book is all about. Perfect angle, perfect pose, perfect light, perfect gear - and a perfect post-processing technique to reach the desired goal - a perfect picture.
<br />Book gives you a lot of intimate details about how things are done properly - and what to do if you encounter a sudden obstacle.
<br />The only thing I must warn you about - it's not a "my first photography book" type. Consider it medium-to-advanced level. I read it after reading three other books by Scott Kelby (on PS CS) and that gave me an edge and ability to quickly grasp the subject. Otherwise I would probably got lost in its first chapter. The amount of - a very useful, don't get me wrong! -  information would be simply overwhelming.
<br />Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Don't get fooled by the title -- or the cover. This book is for everyone who uses Photoshop -- not just those who photograph women. 
<br />
<br />Pictures of women are but a metaphor for all pictures. The techniques taught can be used on babies, seniors, landscapes, factories or cars. They work across the board.
<br />
<br />I've got lots of Photoshop books. This has been the easiest to use and most practical.
<br />
<br />The first 4 chapters -- on Workflow -- are worth the price of the book. With Kevin's help, I've developed an approach to archiving, proofing, and displaying my images. And, I've learned a way to create and use actions to do the heavy lifting.
<br />
<br />This book makes clear the qualitative difference between 8 and 16 bit images. Run the exercise and you will see the advantages of 16 bit with your own eyes.
<br />
<br />Color correction has become very easy. Kevin teaches a simple way to get dead on color. Now I understand the tremendous advantage one gets by using a Gretag/Macbeth or similar reference card.  And, again, to make it easy, he shows how to use what we've learned to make and use actions and batches to take the tedium out of correcting all the pictures taken under the same light.
<br />
<br />I shoot RAW. Kevin helped me master Adobe CS's RAW processor. But, more importantly, I've also learned how and when to simply make a .tif and do my corrections based on the reference shot. I find the latter to be more precise and accurate. What a time saver -- one step eliminated and the others run by actions.
<br />
<br />Notice I've not said one word about photographing women? I haven't used it for that, yet. Maybe,  I will -- but the book's value is not dependent on the subject matter, it is all about getting the most out of all your photographs whatever they  might be.</span>

                    <span>First of all, the book is great.  However, the workshop exercises have to be downloaded from Kevins site.  Even that wouldn't be so bad if they weren't compressed by some funky program called StuffIt.  StuffIt has to be downloaded as well and installed on the PC.  Every hear of ZIP!</span>
