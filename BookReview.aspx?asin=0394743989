                    <span>Few populations in history have gone through the dramatic changes that African Americans underwent at the end of the Civil War.  People who had suffered slavery for generations suddenly found themselves free, a welcome yet uncertain status that required considerable exploration and adjustment.  Leon Litwack's book examines this transition, concentrating on how freed African Americans perceived freedom and how they shaped the conditions of their freedom in the aftermath of the Civil War.
<br />
<br />For many African Americans, change began with the Civil War.  Slaves in areas occupied by Union soldiers would be liberated from bondage, while many African Americans took up arms as the war went on.  The end of the war and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment meant freedom for African Americans, freedom to live their lives as they wanted.  For most, the first step was finding their scattered families and coming to terms with their time as slaves.  Freedom also meant discovering a new identity, especially with regards to their former masters, as African Americans now had to deal with whites in new ways both socially and in the workplace.  Finally, African Americans faced the challenge of creating a new society free of the restrictions of slave life, which led to the establishment of modes of religion, politics, and the press to serve their particular interests.
<br />
<br />Litwack's book is an indispensable study of African Americans in the aftermath of emancipation.  Based on a wealth of primary sources (including the invaluable collection of oral interviews conducted by the Federal Writers' Project during the 1930s), he argues that no set experience defined how African Americans dealt with freedom.  What emancipation demonstrated was the interdependence that existed between African Americans and whites, an interdependence that did not end with freedom but was shaped by attitudes and tensions that remained from the experience of slavery.  The result is a book that is essential reading for any student of the era, as well as for those seeking insight into race relations in America today.</span>

                    <span>This book is gives an excellent synthesis as to how freedom was experienced in various regions of the South after 1863.  One of the finest books within the historiography of American slavery and freedom.  Litwack goes to great lengths explaining the freedom experience, the failures of the Freedmen's Bureau and the hesitations ex-slaves felt after 1863.  A must read and must have for anyone interested in slavery, its aftermath and Reconstruction.</span>

                    <span>Professor Litwack is a superb writer/teacher in the field of the struggles of african americans.  He fully understands and convincingly portrays the harsh realities of our shameful past in "Been in the Storm so  Long".</span>
