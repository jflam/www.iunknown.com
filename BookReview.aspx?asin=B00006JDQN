                <span id="Label1">For Ursula Le Guin's devoted following, the 2002 remake of the 1980 film based on her novel may not be the stuff dreams are made of. This new adaptation omits some of the original's most memorable developments (the racially equalized "grays" and the alien invasion). Lucas Haas stars as George Orr, a "little lost boy" haunted by his dreams, which, he claims, alter the present unbeknownst to anyone but him. James Caan (more menacing than was Kevin Conway in the original) costars as the self-promoting Dr. Haber, the therapist assigned to treat the suicidal young man. This "very productive relationship" most benefits Haber, who attempts to manufacture George's dreams "to fit some useful function." The requisite unforeseen consequences ensue. Lisa Bonet is ravishing, but less impressive as George's skeptical public defender who may be the girl of his dreams. The foreboding mood is enhanced by Angelo Badalamenti's score, which recalls his haunting work on <I>Twin Peaks</I>. <I>--Donald Liebenson</I> </span>

                    <span>George Orr (Lucas Haas) has a unique deformity when he dreams they come true.    Plagued by this feeling that he used his dreams to send someone away whom he loved very much, he tries to commit suicide.  The court remands him to a court appointed therapist Dr. Haber (James Caan).  When Orr confesses his belief about his dreams and that he tries to stay awake so that the world won't change, Haber diagnoses Orr as suffering from a delusional psychosis stemming from adolescent sexual abuse creating a phobic reaction to the dream process that causes amnesia and personality distortion.  <p>Through the augmenter, a brain wave monitoring device, Haber gives Orr hypnotic suggestions to control his brain patterns during dreams.  Haber discovers Orr is telling the truth and manipulates him to change the world the way he wants, including unleashing a plague to bring down the population.<p>Nurse Penny (Sheila McCarthy), Dr. Haber's secretary, steps in to put a stop to his medalling once and for all.<p>The Lathe of Heaven is based on the book by Ursulla K. Le Guin.  The movie consists of eight dream sequences and after each the world is changed.  Other than Haber and Penny people in Orr's life are rearranged into different social positions.  This was an extremely intriguing movie that kept me on the edge of my seat wondering how it would all end.  For Sci-Fi fans, this is a must see!!!</span>

                    <span>since I've read the book once more,read it,this isn't really bad.The actors,Caan especially,are.up to the work.The actor playing Orr was flat.Bonet was very good and beautiful(don't hold it against her),but was "unequally yoked"with the Orr presented on this version of the story.I would recommend it,but suggest reading the book,one of the best sf novels of all time.You might enjoy the PBS original more if you've seen this first,like me.The first is far superior.My biggest complaint is that,in tackling a great story,the film settled for too little orr.</span>

                    <span>This update remake of the Ursula LeGuin science fiction classic, <br>has half way decent performances, but it's hardly as good as the <br>original, it's been toned down a bit, it does have an ironic twist.  Lukas Haas and James Caan are fine as Orr and the doctor.<br>Lisa Bonet is cute as Heather.  Try to check out the original though, which is a better version.</span>

                    <span>It would be easy to dismiss Le Guin's novel as unfilmable, except for the fact that it has already been done and done well, managing to capture the subtleties of shifting histories and universes without having to rely on adding melodramatic subplots or spelling out blatantly what was handled with style and grace in the text.<p>All of which is a roundabout way to say that you can't watch this movie without comparing it with either the 1980 film or with the original novel and that this version is extremely disappointing.  Nuance is replaced with blatant acting and a heavy handed score, slow discoveries replaced by melodrama and all humanity reduced to the emotions of a soap opera.<p>While it's obvious that many changes would have to be made in order to turn a fairly cerebral novel into an accessible movie, the changes made to this are extremely disappointing and I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone on any level.  Leave it well enough alone and hope you can find either the 1980 movie or, preferably, the original book.</span>
