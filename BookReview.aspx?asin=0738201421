                    <span>Parts of this book were interesting, but overall it was much ado about not much, and what was done was often overdone (I agree with another reviewer on this point). I see that Amazon has coupled this book with Hidden Order. I can't see why. It would be like buying the same book twice. Anyway, so much of this has been warmed over so many times now that it's frankly a bit dry. I'd like to see a book that really breaks new ground in complexity without overusing buzz words or talking down to me, holding my hand through simple things. Here, the topic is more attractive than the content I'm afraid. Anyone really interested in complexity and emergence will need to go into technical details well beyond this book. Others, like me, will likely find the details that are here to be a bit tedious.</span>

                    <span>The review says "Think of the food replicators in the imaginary future of Star Trek--with some basic chemical building blocks and simple rules, those machines can produce everything from Klingon delicacies to Earl Grey tea. If scientists can understand and apply the knowledge they gather from studying emergent systems, we may soon witness the development of artificial intelligence, nanotech, biological machines, and other creations heretofore confined to science fiction." -- What?? Like we are about to make food replicators because of the "deep understanding" that we now have of emergent systems??<p>I agree with the other reviewer who says the book is characteristically weak. The cover is prettier than Hidden Order. But so what.<p>There have to be better books on complexity than this for the average popular science reader.</span>

                    <span>It is very important to the universal thinking the unsderstanding about complexity and its cognitive perception by humans. I read Dr. Holland's first book in London at 1993 and that time I follow his steps in order to reach a meaningfull knowledge to our lives and our existence in the universe. The title of the book is very difficult to develop but Dr. Holland has a special skill to clarify and transmmit the ideas breaking down our paradigm about the universe and the world and life complexity.</span>

                    <span>John Holland's "Emergence" just doesn't make it as a science popularization.  The ideas Holland presents are fascinating, exciting, and indeed highly relevant for our globalized, interconnected world.   <p>Unfortunately, none of this comes across.  Like many scientists (I  know... I *am* a scientist), Holland simply has no idea how a nonscientist  would grasp the concept of emergence.  He overexplains simple examples like  the numbers and board games of the first two chapters, then underexplains  the deeper ideas of later chapters.  The final chapter is pretty good in  terms of unifying the book's themes and providing a broader view of how  emergence fits into science and human culture.  However, the reader has not  been adequately prepared for this broadening because the middle chapters  were so poorly explained.  <p>I fear that most readers will come away  without sensing the truly revolutionary nature of this new branch of  science.  Holland lacks passion!  The book is bland because Holland seems  not to be able to present rigorous science in conjunction with thrill and  emotion.  He should take a lesson from the experts at popularization, such  as Sagan and Gribbin, who succeed at presenting factually correct science  in a way that engages and excites nonscientists.</span>
