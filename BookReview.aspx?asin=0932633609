                    </div>
                    <span>This book is an interesting mix. It starts with a philosophical discussion of why it is ethically wrong and success-endangering to ignore risks, but commercially weak to simply avoid them, thus establishing that we must accept and manage risk. The book then develops a comprehensive method for risk management in IT (or other) projects.<P>It may be surprising where DeMarco & Lister start from, explaining what risk is, why we need to accept it and why we must manage it, but they explain how common attitudes in the IT industry, which they correctly term "pathologies", can make it almost impossible to properly acknowledge and manage risks.<P>Maybe it's my background as a physicist, but I assumed that most project managers understand the concept of uncertainty in estimates of cost, timescale and benefits. The authors clearly start from the opposite position. This may be a little off-putting for some readers, but will definitely help those to whom this is a new concept, while the use of "uncertainty diagrams" (probability profiles) will be a useful addition to the toolkit even for those more familiar with the underlying ideas.<P>The book is very strong on how risk impacts budget and schedule, and how to more scientifically make goals and committed targets more realistic. There's a very good discussion of how to assess deadlines using probability theory, which shows the folly of trying to manage large efforts by single deadlines. The book also includes a very good section on brainstorming and analysing different stakeholders' "win" conditions to identify potential risks.<P>One weakness is the almost total lack of discussion of risk prevention - actively working to prevent a risk materialising, or at least to reduce its probability as well as mitigating its impact. For example they quote the example of an operating system upgrade which is incompatible with a "make or break" product development. Any sensible manager would work with the OS vendor and its developer information programmes to actively prevent this, rather than just worrying about its possible impact.<P>When it comes to combining the effects of multiple risks, the authors rely entirely on Monte-Carlo simulation and the "black box" outputs from a spreadsheet (which is downloadable from a web site for the book). This will be a useful tool, but a simple worked example showing the mathematical principles at work would be much better (see www.andrewj.com/thoughts/combining risks.htm for my attempt at this).<P>The book is dismissive of time-constrained scheduling as "schedule flaw", and there is only limited consideration of methods such as Agile Modeling and eXtreme Programming which aim to mitigate or even prevent the effects of requirements change. However there is a good section on the use of incremental delivery to mitigate risk, but possibly somewhat unrealistic in relying on very complete requirements and design before the incremental delivery plan can be completed.<P>The approach to benefits, and the importance of properly assessing and measuring benefit is excellent. As DeMarco and Lister state, you can't do any meaningful risk management or prioritisation unless costs and benefits are estimated, measured and controlled to almost exactly the same degree. Conversely, if you can build realistic models of both cost and benefit in risk terms, you have a very powerful but relatively simple model for project prioritisation.<P>Overall this is a good book which I can recommend, but not the definitive answer I expected from the authors of "Peopleware".</span>

                    <span>What an excellent book, but then what would one expect from Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister, and Dorset House? As well as being an excellent introduction to an extremely vital subject in this day and age, "Waltzing with Bears" provides some practical tips not only on how to do Risk Management, but also regarding how to overcome some of the factors in corporate culture that actively or passively suppress the application of Risk Management (e.g., the "can-do" attitude).<P>DeMarco and Lister have structured this book logically, beginning with "Why" and "Why Not", progressing through "How" and "How Much", and concluding with a brief "Whether or Not". The chapter on Core Risks of software projects is priceless. The authors provide instruction on how to graphically show the uncertainty that must be managed, and provide a link to a freeware RISKOLOGY tool that will assist those engaged in Risk Management.<P>Having spent several years in QA and Process Engineering supporting Risk Management, I can only say that I wish I'd had this book several years ago. But I have it now, and am better prepared for future efforts.<P>Thanks again, Tom and Tim. By the way, I love the cover.</span>

                    <span>The traditional methods for dealing with risk are typically:<P>(1) Ignore it. <BR>(2) Pretend it does not exist.<BR>(3) Look upon the messanger as "Not a Team Player" and finally ...<BR>(4) Pressure<P>DeMarco and Lister blow the lid off this approach by making a compelling argument that 1-4 are irresponsible and unethical, then pointing to a better way. <P>The "toolset" that DeMarco and Lister provide is very specific and will help, but I think they are getting to something deeper. Ever since "PeopleWare", the impression I have of these authors is that they are trying to get IS folks to think for themselves - to have a very large toolbox and to pick the right tool for that particular job, instead of "Standardized Procedure where you do everything by the book."<P>The fact is, IS people can add value and clarity by knowing that we can't do everything and picking the highest ROI items to work on. (Or helping Sr. Management to decide what to work on ... however you want to word it.)<P>The book can help your organization deal with reality, instead of hoping for fantasyland. If you struggle with projects with unrealistic deadlines and artificially compressed schedules (because if the project was scheduled in a sane way, the ROI wouldn't make it worth doing) - this book can help.</span>

                    <span>It never ceases to amaze me how easily impressed the masses are by well-expressed views expounded by eminent personalities with a proven track record for impressing. So strong is this effect that even when the views expressed are fundamentally flawed one rarely sees the offenders brought to account. Here, with 'Waltzing With Bears' we have a prime example: a book crammed with seemingly good advice on how to evaluate risk but which commits the cardinal sin of applying frequentist probability theory to model epistemic uncertainty. As a result we have yet another pair of consultants jumping on the bandwagon and promoting an aleatory method (Monte Carlo Simulation) without any regard for the second order uncertainties that bedevil software development projects. Why is this important? Because all the results you get will be wrong; very impressive but useless. I don't know about you, but I think that this is a serious drawback. <P>I believe it behoves renowned experts to do their homework and get the basics right before they pollute the education system with their half-baked 'wisdom'. Do yourself a favour, ignore what the book says about risk analysis and go and by a good book on Bayesian Methods and Decision Theory. You don't have to take my word for this, just type in 'epistemic uncertainty and Monte Carlo' into your Internet search engine and take it from there. In the meantime, here are some background notes to help explain my remarks:<P>There are two types of uncertainty: epistemic and aleatory. <BR>As the name suggests, epistemic uncertainty results from gaps in knowledge. For example, one may be uncertain of an outcome because one has never used a particular technology before. Such uncertainty is essentially a state of mind and hence subjective. <BR>Aleatory uncertainty results from variability that is intrinsic to the behaviour of some systems (alea is the Latin for die). For example, I can be confident regarding the long term frequency of throwing sixes but I remain uncertain of the outcome of any given throw of a dice. This uncertainty can be objectively determined. <BR>There are two branches of probability theory: Frequentist and Bayesian. <BR>Frequentist probability theory is used to analyse systems that are subject to aleatory uncertainty. <BR>Bayesian probability theory is used to analyse epistemic uncertainty. <BR>For most risk assessments a Project Manager has to undertake, there is both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty but epistemic uncertainty is always significant due to the novelty of the situation under assessment. <BR>Standard Monte Carlo Simulation uses frequentist probability theory to analyse risk. <BR>When Monte Carlo is used to model schedule risk, the schedule uncertainties are being treated as if they are aleatory, even though they are predominantly epistemic. This is now considered to be unrealistic and is known to give incorrect results. The main problem is that the second order uncertainties are often too large to be ignored, i.e. the required shape for the chosen probability distribution curves is more important than the tool vendors would have you believe and yet they are usually imprecisely known. <BR>Using standard Monte Carlo to analyse schedule risk also requires unrealistic assumptions to be made regarding the correlations between the probabilities for the individual outcomes, e.g. that there are no correlations or that they are all of the same nature. In practice, there are correlations to be considered when analysising schedule risk and they are of both a positive and negative nature.<BR>As a result of the above drawbacks many expert authorities are warning against the use of Monte Carlo Simulation where the historical data upon which the analysis is premised is incomplete. For example, its use in ecological and economic models is now controversial (see the World Congress on Risk website). <BR>In software development there is a growing appreciation of the importance of Bayesian Methods in analysing problems in software quality assurance. <BR>Bayesian methods are appropriate in situations where there are gaps in information (i.e. where there is epistemic uncertainty). They involve the creation of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to model causal relationships. Data is fed into the model to enable the probability of specified outcomes to be calculated given the current body of knowledge. <BR>Even more interesting, Bayes Theorem can be used to assess the likelihood that pre-conditions exist in the light of outcomes becoming known. <BR>BBNs can be used in any situation where one is trying to calculate the likelihood of an outcome, or an unknown situation, when there is only limited information. It is useful in Decision Theory when a risk-based decision is required in the face of epistemic uncertainty.</span>

                    <span>There are a ton of wonderful anecdotes and motivational examples for doing risk management. Also, he takes a very pragmatic approach towards what's actually possible in different corporate climates. Rather than only telling you what right thing to do is, he helps you decide what the appropriate thing is.<P>The explanation of the relationship between risk and benefit analysis was both insightful and seemed like it would be useful. It provides a pragmatic framework for a lot of what are considered 'good engineering practices', such as incremental deliverables that can be measured and verified in meaningful ways.<P>The only downside is that it's very difficult to understand how to take advantage of some of the frameworks he provides without being in a management position already. Individual contributors won't get a lot out of this.</span>
