                    <span>For the first time in a long time I sat down and actually enjoyed learning from a technical book! How many times have we purchased a book only to be driven to bed by some wannabe's author's feeble attempts at humor and wit? However, a book written by someone that has a good writing style wouldn't do me much good (or you for that matter if you're looking at this book) if it didn't also "cut the mustard" on the technical side. Believe me, I've read every single C# book on the market and this is BY FAR the best of the lot. <P>PROS: Great introduction to the type system, classes, operators and operator overloading. Also, major kudos for including several .net chapters on multithreading, reflection and com interoperability. <P>CONS: Would like to have seen a better opening chapter on oop. Would also like to see more .net stuff - especially winforms. However, since the book's focus is C#, I really couldn't take off for that omission.<P>Anyway, in final, a really well done book and one that I will keep handy for a good while to come.</span>

                    <span>Having been bitten before by the hype of a Miscrosoft Press book, I was a little worried when this book finally arrived. However, I can honestly say that this book met and even exceeded my expectations. It is by far the best beginner level book on learning C# on the market. I would like to have seen a bit more .net class stuff, however I didn't take off for that on my ranking because the book's focus is C# and not .net. Having said that, the book does contain a couple of the absolutely best chapters on the .net topics of multithreading and com interoperability available. With regards to the C# language, the book took its time in presenting subject matter without being overly verbose or condescending. I especially liked the fact that as one reviewer said, each topic had at least one demo to further explain what the author was saying and many topics had multiple demos - each building on the previous. I definite good buy in my opinion.</span>

                    <span>I read the book cover to cover, but wish I hadn't picked it up in the first place. It turned out to be one of the worst investment of my time.<P>If you want to buy this book, forget it. Download the freely available C# language Speciciation, the tutorials in the spec are far better.<P>This book is nice up to the first 6 or 7 chapters. (That's why many people thought it was a good book, 'cuz they didn't have time to read all the chapters before making a comment) <P>The rest fell far short of expectation from MSPress's "Inside" titles. Its presentation on important topics like delegate, event and interface are so lousy that you'll be better off not reading them at all. (For event, it utterly failed to explain what's unique to the "event" keyword) <P>If you are still not convinced this is one of those rubbish titles, let me point you to a glaring example in Chapter 13, the section on User-Defined Conversion. Spend 3 to 5 minutes on it, and see if you could make heads or tails of the gibberish. Do you think any self-respecting author would allow this sort of junk to slip into his flagship title? Guess the editor must have slept on the job as well. (Remember, it's already the second edition, so no more excuse on the time-to-market stuff) <P>As I read on from chap 7, there was mounting doubt if the author spend nearly enough time to the basic research, and whenever I encounter some incomprehensible paragraph, my first thought would be "Tom messed up again?" <P>A decent book on a programming language like C#(or java) should at least cover AND differentiate 2 aspects: <P>1) The language: All language elements, syntax, semantics, subtle differences, with easy-to-understand, practical examples. <BR>2) The platform: i.e.: Core functions of the Framework Class Library, how to use I/O? how to manipulate strings, dates, how to do basic sorting/searching. <P>For this book, it's just a muddled mix of the two, dotted with deassembled IL, and could be better renamed to "Tom's tome of study notes on C#" (you get the drift? that's right, Tom himself has a lot to learn about C#. Why not attend a training session from real giants like Jeff Richter, Tom?)</span>

                    <span>As others have mentioned, this book is not aimed at new developers. However, if you are an intermediate or advanced developers, this is a great book for learning C# in depth. One thing I found very useful is that it often refers to C++ or Java to point out differences. This is very important in areas where C# works differently, like calling virtual functions from constructors.<P>The book shows lots of MSIL for the examples. Although there's a table of the MSIL commands in the back, there's not enough information in this book for these to be comletely understandable. You'll need to learn more about the CLR and MSIL elsewhere for these to really be helpful.<P>A wide range of topics are covered, including some advanced topics like COM interop. There is also a chapter on security, although I felt it lumped too many topics together there without going into enough depth on them.<P>The biggest problem I had with the book was the huge number of typos and misprints. I noticed another reviewer said that many of the examples didn't compile. This could have been one of the reasons. I was amazed at how many errors I saw in the code, most of which looked like simple typos.</span>
