                    <span>A wonderful reference book of terms, food items, boats, geographic locations, tribes, specific Indians, games, politicians and of course the entire cast of explorers down to Seaman the Newfoundland. Biographies can be several pages long and they cover not only an individual's role but what is known of the individual after the journey. Particularly helpful are the definitions in detail and descriptions of the materials utilied on the journey. An example are descriptions of the small flat bottomed boats called a Pirogue, a cake like food made from grease that was an easy to retrieve as a traveling food called Pemmican and a "drink composed of equal parts water and rum used for medically or for celebration" called grog. The definitions, descriptions of geographic locations and biographies are in satisfying detail almost like small books within a book. A book not only handy for sitting near your reading chair for any Lewis and Clark book but for any reading of early American historty. </span>

                    <span>Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs and Clay Jenkinson have joined forces to produce the definitive text for Lewis and Clark readers to keep in one hand while they read through the many books available on the epic expedition. They cover numerous personalities involved, and the many other aspects of the journey with encyclopedic thoroughness, resulting in the reader coming away, not just with a superficial knowledge of any topic, but a comprehensive understanding of the many facets involved in the greatest adventure in American exploration. There is something for everyone in this book.  It makes great reading on its own, or as a reference book. The reader will gain much appreciation of Lewis and Clark, and a depth of knowledge previously only available to those with sufficient time to dig into the journals and sift through the dirt and pull out the gold nuggets...The authors have done the work of pulling out the gold, thus giving the reader the opportunity to enjoy their studies of the Corps of Discovery to a greater extent and not have to spend the effort of "mining" themselves.</span>

                    <span>As we celebrate the bicentennial, the world of Lewis and Clark books grows by leaps and bounds.  There are detailed studies of the flora and fauna, the weapons, the medical aspects, the views of various Indian tribes on the interactions with the Corps of Discovery.  You can find cookbooks detailing what they ate, books about what they wore, stories of Seaman (Lewis' dog), and biographies of all involved.<p>So, what is the average person with a small amount of budding interest to do?  Even scholars and historians who "do" Lewis and Clark have a hard time keeping up with all of it, and most people don't want to invest endless money in accumulating a personal Lewis and Clark library.  <p>Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs and Clay Straus Jenkinson have come up with a perfect solution to this dilemma.  "The Lewis and Clark Companion - An Encyclopedic Guide to the Voyage of Discovery" is a wonderful reference book on many aspects of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Arranged in alphabetical order, from "air gun" to "York," each article provides just the right amount of information needed to understand each area.  Each entry is written in a straightforward style, giving quotes from the journals of the Expedition where they would be enlightening.  There is also an extensive bibliography, if you find yourself wanting to know more about any aspect.<p>Tubbs is a Montana historian and serves on the Lewis and Clark National Trail Interpretive Center?s Foundation Board and is the daughter of the late Stephen Ambrose.  She has spent much of her life traveling the Trail.  Jenkinson is a well-respected Jefferson and Lewis and Clark historian, and author of several books, including "The Character of Meriwether Lewis," and "Thomas Jefferson, Man of Light." He has traveled the Trail extensively and also does Chautauqua performances around the country as both Thomas Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis. They bring vast knowledge and lively and interesting writing style to this project.<p>It is the perfect reference work for Lewis and Clark aficionados, as well as those who are just beginning their journey of enchantment with this epic adventure.</span>
