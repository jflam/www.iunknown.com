                <span id="Label1">This is the one jazz record owned by people who don't listen to jazz, and with good reason. The band itself is extraordinary (proof of Miles Davis's masterful casting skills, if not of God's existence), listing John Coltrane and Julian "Cannonball" Adderley on saxophones, Bill Evans (or, on "Freddie Freeloader," Wynton Kelly) on piano, and the crack rhythm unit of Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Coltrane's astringency on tenor is counterpoised to Adderley's funky self on alto, with Davis moderating between them as Bill Evans conjures up a still lake of sound on which they walk. Meanwhile, the rhythm partnership of Cobb and Chambers is prepared to click off time until eternity. It was the key recording of what became modal jazz, a music free of the fixed harmonies and forms of pop songs. In Davis's men's hands it was a weightless music, but one that refused to fade into the background. In retrospect every note seems perfect, and each piece moves inexorably towards its destiny. <i>--John Szwed</i></span>

                    <span>If I was limited to five albums on a desert island, I would also take along "Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd, "Siamese Dream," by the Smashing Pumpkins, "Revolver," by the Beatles, "A Love Supreme," by John Coltrane, and "Strangeways, Here We Come," by The Smiths, but if I could only take one, it would be "Kind of Blue."
<br />
<br />Simply put, "Kind of Blue" is the best record ever made, by any artist, in any genre of music, ever.  It will survive any amount of playing; it is impossible to tire of this wonderful album.  It is unlikely it will ever be surpassed.</span>

                    <span>you may not even notice how good this album is, but believe me, you will.  The remastered version makes a classic album even better, making this the definitive Miles Davis release.  the musical permutations are stunning and weave around you as you listen, and they seem to go on and on, making you pay attention.  if you are worried that it is a muzak sound, it is nothing close.  Miles and company are not looking to lightly entertain you, they are creating something much greater and cooler.  Everyone needs to have this cd.  I also recommend Blue Train by John Coltrane and Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet if you like this cd.  Of course, even those classics can't top this one!</span>

                    <span>This album was one of the greatest highlights in a very productive era in America artistically, part of a collective whole of artists and writers who lived life on the absolute edge and sometimes died young in the process, the intense notes on this album are like the soundtrack to that struggle.</span>

<br />
<br />Just great!</span>
