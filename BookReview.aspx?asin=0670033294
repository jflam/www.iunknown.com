                    <span>Mark Kriegel's work now stands as the definitive biography of Joe Namath. It is a painful story as the very sad truth about Joe is exposed. This football great, and sporting icon for my generation, clearly popularized the professional game. However, the "off-the-field" side is beyond disturbing. What was billed as cool about "Broadway Joe" turns out be horrible psychological problems dulled only by "booze and broads." Namath's desire to escape a reality everyone perceived as so desirable only confirms the extent of his mental instability.
<br />Kriegel's work illustrates this ever so clearly.
<br />
<br />The book is quite in depth from Namath's childhood up and to the point of his greatest triumph, Super Bowl III. I think the content after January 12, 1969 becomes sparse. The next thirty years of Namath's life are presented in far fewer, less involved, pages. I am not sure if the author simply tired of his subject or if there is literally nothing left of Namath to write about. Tiring of the alcoholic, dysfunctional, Namath would be understandable. The possibility that "Broadway Joe" simply became a bore after Super Bowl three very real too. So, either way one can not blame Kriegel. 
<br />
<br />A good book overall but be prepared to learn just how Namath actually failed to live up to his potential because of the lifestyle led. The injuries were just a cop out.

                    <span>   This is a very good read about a superb athelete who overcame serious injury (time and time again) to become a starring NFL quarterback who transcended the game to become ulitmately, a 60's icon.
<br />   Namath could be compared with Mickey Mantle, another legend whose career was also shortened by alchohol and injuries.  They both had New York City as their workplace (and the biggest media market) and they both were kings of it.  At times they were the best, but not neccesary well liked.
<br />   Although the book tries to touch on all the facets of his life including his rarely talked about childhood, the thing that will surprise readers the most would probably be that Joe Namath was not just a great football talent but he was a great athelete, period.  The book makes note of his great running ability in high school and because of his achievements in high school baseball, the promise of a future in professional baseball loomed for Mr. Namath as well.  But because he happened in the early 60's and well before ESPN tapes everything and everyone with a slice of talent, we can only be left with stories of how great Joe Namath really was before crippling knee injuries left him only as a great armed quarterback.  Also,  A point to note is that Joe Namath the student is revealed here.  Many times Namath would take opposing game reels home to his appartment to study them and prepare himself better for the next game as he called all his own plays---something unheard in today's game.  However the downside of Namath also comes into focus as well---the drinking, the greed, the inablity to become a team player, it's all here.  The book loses points because Namath's voice is not here to help describe any of this or tell us what happened at any time.  We are left with interviews and stories of what Namath and associates said to the media back when.</span>

                    <span>Before I read this book I liked Namath. I've seen him play at Alabama. After reading it I see him as selfish, money hungry drunk. The book is good, Namath is not.

                    <span>This book is a biography of Joe Namath and starts out from his birth and follows the course of his life through high school, college, professional football, and thereafter. It gives an inside look at what type of person Joe Namath really is, and provides much insight into the personality of a very unique individual. The book gives many stories of life on the football field and off of it. I thought the stories of Namath's very fast paced life living in New York was the best part. I was a little surpirised that he was basically dumped by his wife and while he had many friends, he appears to have struggled with developing lasting and intimate friendships.
<br />Whether you are a football fan or not, this book is a great read, especially if you grew up in the 1960's and 1970's time era. I would highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Joe Namath was a childhood idol of mine.  Kriegel captures very well what a great athlete he was and how he truly was the first of the new breed of made-for-TV sports stars.  The book is very insightful about Joe's early years through the end of his professional playing days.  I would have liked to have known a little more about his personal life since his football career ended, but maybe there just isn't that much to say.  My two complaints are that the writing is sometimes overblown and in many places there is too much detail.  We know he was a swinger and a drinker, how many times need we be reminded?</span>
