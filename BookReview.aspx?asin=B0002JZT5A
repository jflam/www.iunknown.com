                    <span>  Film includes many sexual scenes, female nudity and full frontal male nudity.
<br />Joe (Ewan McGregor) finds a dead woman floating towards the pier in the water.  his co-worker Les (Peter Mullan) do the right thing and call the police.  Joe lives with Les' family on the Atlantic Eve barge.  One night he notices through a crack in the wall that Les and his wife, Ella (Tilda Swinton) are hovaing sexual problems.  The next day while les is reading the newspaper at the table, Joe puts his leg onto Ella's under the table and makes a sexual motion with his hand.  She stops him. That night, while the husband is playing darts at a pub, Joe makes advances to Ella again in the barge.  She tells him firmly she does not want to awaken the boy.  They go outside on land and commit adultery.
<br />  Joe remembers Cathie (Emily Mortimer) who he had a sexual relationship with.
<br />  Joe and Ella are being oh so carefree about having sex while les is up on deckk, not knowing what goes on below.
<br />  Some strange turn of events are about to take place.
<br />  DVD includes in "Special Features", an extended sex scene, original passage narrations by Ewan McGregor, and two audio commentaries.
<br />  Good for you Ewan McGregor for being so brave la natural.</span>

                    <span>I watched this movie because I was dating a guy who is a huge Ewan MacGregor fan. I have always liked his performances, but I thought that this one was exceptional.  It tells the story of a failed writer who has a mysterious past with a woman that he abandoned. He works on a barge and begins an affair with his bosses' wife. It sort of is a mystery, but when it all comes down to it, this movie is basically an excuse to show as much sex as possible.(I have no objection to this!) There isn't a lot of dialogue, its more of what's not said that's important, and the story isn't really fast-paced, but if you get into to feeling of it, its actually pretty good.(One of my few objections is having to look at Tilda Swinton's hairy armpit. Yuck!) Basically to top it all off, not-so-nice people in Scotland have lots of sex and you get to see plenty of Ewan MacGregor in the process.</span>

                    <span>I loved all the actors in this movie but the movie itself was pretty bad. It attempted to to keep you in suspense- waiting to find out whether or not MacGregor's character had an morals. Instead, it just showed one uneventful sex scene after another. It's like the director/writer- whoever was in a contest to see how many times he could show MacGregors butt. Don't waste your money or time on this one! It was a big disappointment.</span>

                    <span>I say the film is unique because it has nothing to hold your interest but it apparently does.  I haven't read the book but the movie would have been the most tastless thing since Show Girls, Disclosure and Body of Evidence if it hadn't shown the reality it had within the characters and plot of the film. 
<br />
<br />The film is so gritty and the people so dirty-looking and filthy that you have to award the director for at least taking the time to show how people on an overseas barge really live. Mackenzie was true to life. He didn't sit a beautiful woman with manicured nails on the barge with a bikini like some directors would have.  He chose Tilda Swinton, who may not be society's conventional beauty but carries herself in a way that's so enchanting you can see why Joe ( Ewan McGregor ) can't wait to get a piece of her. Swinton isn't beautiful but she is sexy and if you don't know the difference between the two, that's your problem.  A reviewer stated that a hunk like McGregor wouldn't want Tilda Swinton. Well if you watched the film carefully, you'll see that Joe ( McGregor ) was no prize himself. Joe may have been good looking but seemed slow and slightly retarded by the way he drifted off by himself. He wasn't anywhere near Ella's intelligence.  Joe was a dumb seaman and McGregor played the part well.
<br />
<br />I for one are sick of no-acting pretty faces and was glad David didn't stick one in this. Swinton is a fine actress. She and McGregor had exciting chemistry.  When they had sex, I didn't find myself thinking of the actual act. I found myself reveling in the chemistry and magnitude these actors had. THIS alone keeps the film going because without this chemistry I wouldn't have watched it twice.  I agree that the sex gets tiresome after the third romp and it goes from semi-romantic to XXX porn by the end of the film.  Like I said, I didn't read the novel but I can't imagine it having as much sex in it as this. We didn't have to see every single time they had sex.  We knew they were having an affair so enough is enough. I found the frontal nudity too realistic and not needed. It cheapened the movie. I found seeing Tilda Swinton naked completely nauseating ( not because of how she looked but because by this point it seemed that Ella didn't care about her child at all, just romping around naked like a teenager ).  And no I don't think seeing Swinton naked added anything to the movie.
<br />
<br />This is a mixed bag. I bought it before seeing it so that should tell you something.  If I saw it first I probably wouldn't have bought it.  It's not up there with even the top 100 of my favorite films but it's not really bad, just it has to suit your particular tastes.  My opinion is there was way too much sex, the actors mumbled so you couldn't hear much of what they were saying. There were too many conflicting accents that made it impossible to keep up with the characters. The flashbacks should have been done in black and white.  I couldn't tell a flashback from the present until about five minutes back into the film and rhe film was way too long. If foreign noir is your thing you'll probably enjoy this.  If not, skip it or watch it with your hand on the fast forward button.  Believe me you'll need it at some point. </span>

                    <span>My instincts were correct when I first saw the Thumbs Up sign on Ebert and Roeper for a movie called Young Adam, which seemed more like a mystery, but which I also found out to be more of character study. 
<br />
<br />Young Adam tells the story of young Joe, a drifter who presently is working on a barge owned by his business partner, Leslie, and his wife Ella. One morning, Joe spots a woman's body in the river, covered only with a thin petticoat. As Joe and Leslie fish the body out, we see a suspicious action where Joe slowly moves to touch the corpse with his hand. Does he know this woman before?
<br />
<br />After the body is picked up by police and ambulance, we start to notice a silence in Joe that he's not showing with words but with eyes. It is never expected, but he falls into a deep love for Leslie's wife Ella, a skinny overworked wife who didn't care what happened with her life. For the new few days, we see Joe and Ella in a full-blown affair right under Leslie's lips, although during intercourse, there seems to never be any intimacy, just cold dark sex.
<br />
<br />Why did this sexual tension occur? Was it because of the dead corpse of the woman Joe found? While he and Ella continue their affair, the movie sends us to another point in time where we find Joe meeting a woman named Cathy (the dead corpse) of which they become lovers, but sooner or later, conflict and tension rises between the two.
<br />
<br />This story is a depressing one, about a man, just like "young Adam and Eve", a man going through maturity and a man "who's as far from innocent as you can be, but he is also not guilty". As we see in one scene, Joe saves Ella and Leslie's son, which tells us Joe doesn't TRY to be bad or good, he doesn't know what to do with himself and follows his selfish path...
<br />
<br />Whats probably what makes this film so phenomenal is the acting; Ewan McGregor plays this troubled man; I know he doesn't look the depressing type but he pulls it off as Joe; Tilda Swinton and Emily Mortimer are both splendid! And director David Mackenzie couldn't have made a better film!
<br />
<br />This is a movie you'll either hate or love, but I'm someone who loved watching this movie! You'll never expect what's going to happen next. The ending may leave people making a sketch of they knew about Joe so far from the whole movie, or people will not like the unhappy ending. You decide!</span>
