                    <span>...you will love this book...especially the 5th chapter, The Amazing Thread...i guarantee you will have tears in your eyes, and want to share it with all other Red Sox fans. Leigh Montville has written a book that is a compilation of stories by and about the people of Red Sox Nation...players, fans, managers, owners...and he has done a wonderful job. He has always been a great writer, and with this book he touches our hearts as no one else can. My only regret is that it isn't longer, but maybe he'll write a sequel after this season. (Hope springs eternal for this Red Sox fan!)</span>

                    <span>I am surprised that more people have not reviewed this book.  All Red Sox fans should read "Why Not Us," which tells the story of other Red Sox Fans and their tears and disappointment throughout the years and their joy and adulation when the Boston Red Sox finally win the World Series after 86 years.  A very poignant and touching book.  A must for all die hard fans and bandwagoneers alike.</span>

                    <span>86 years, EIGHTY-SIX YEARS we waited. Years that we came so close. The only thing that remained constant was the loyalty of the fans, the Red Sox Nation, we almost had to revel in underdog status. 
<br />
<br />At least the story can be told. The years we came so close, yet wound up so far away. One game from the championship so many times. 
<br />
<br />This is quite a story, it goes into detail from before I was born, players that I've only heard of. It's a wonderful story, and timed perfectly. Get a copy before the next season. Of course we'll win again, but then there will be a new book.
