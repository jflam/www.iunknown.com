                    <span>I don't understand how an editor could publish this book. It's only attribute is a cool look, but it's content is null.<p>Reading this book is like reading a lot of magazine headers, in wich you read what can dreamweaver do, but not how to do it.<p>If you plan to buy this book, don't do it, it's a very bad choice.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent. I have played around with Dreamweaver a little bit and was already familiar with HTML and its various tags before I bought this book.  You should too.<p>The great thing about this book is that it gives you a problem with HTML, then shows how to make it work with Dreamweaver.  It is not just a how-to book but a "why" book which I love.  It really teaches you. It gives the pluses and minuses of solving problems in different ways.<p>This book also tells you about what makes good web design.  Get this book and you will love it as I have.</span>

                    <span>I received this book, expecting it to be heavy on the server-side lingo and practices, but was pleasantly surprised to see that it dealt with the basics right through to the advanced areas of site conception, layout and design, static and dynamic sites.<p>If you are familiar with Dreamweaver MX (Self taught) and want to know more about actual web development, both static and application, then this is a must read book for you.  The book is clearly for the web developer starting out through to those that are somewhat familiar with 'the way of the web' through surfing and brain picking in the newsgroups.<p>Drews writing style made the book very easy to read and although I consider myself to be html knowledgable, the book taught me a few things especially related to tables and accessability.<p>Thanks Drew for the great book!</span>

                    <span>Drew McLellan's new book (dreamweaver mx web development) is fantastic! It's easy and quick to read, yet full of useful information and tips about the many valuable tools and options in Dreamweaver MX. Real world scenarios helped me understand how to apply the tools to my particular situations.<p>I will let others go into the details of the contents - I'd rather write briefly about how the book inspired me. I knew I'd lost sight of "work smarter, not harder" in my daily struggles to keep a dozen web sites updated. This well-written and totally enjoyable book was the "kick start" I needed; I took the time to read, rethink my work processes, learn even more about Dreamweaver MX, and move on to a much more efficient work style. <p>The time you take to read this book will repay itself again and again in improving your efficiency!</span>

                    <span>DREAMWEAVER MX - Web Development<br>AUTHOR:  Drew McLellan<br>PUBLISHER:  New Riders<br>REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<p>BOOK REVIEW:  There are over 500 pages of useful information on Dreamweaver MX.  Don't have time to read it word for word?  Check out the beginning of each Chapter.  There you will find a list of Objectives for that chapter and at the end, a summary of what you should have gotten out of the chapter.  This is an extremely helpful format, especially if you need to locate a specific topic.  An even further breakdown of chapter information can be garnered from the index.  There the chapters are reasonably titled so you can locate specific information.<p>Tips, examples and cautions are scattered though out the book in the same format as most other web-specific books.  The book does not contain a reference list chapter or one that has URLs or any web-related references, although the chapters are written in such a way that you don't need a PhD to understand what is in them.<p>Are you using Dreamweaver MX in your web design work?  Then be sure to buy this book to help you get the maximum usage from your program.</span>
