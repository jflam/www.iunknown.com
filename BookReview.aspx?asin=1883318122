                    <span>I bought this book when it first came out. Makes for a great read and kept me up for a few nights as I was reading away. Jacobson is an A-1 chronicler of the Hollywood ghost scene and has made me a believer after I visited some of these sites myself.</span>

                    <span>As a non believer in the paranromal, I was doubtful when I began "Hollywood Haunted." After reading it in one night, I visited most of the sites, checked the research, and was convinced! I had personal knowledge of some of the events described, and, as the owner of Grave Line Tours, I recommend it to whoever requests accurate information about the "nether-world" of Hollyweird! It's head and shoulders above anything else I've read on the subject. "I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks! I do- I do- I do!" This book made me!</span>

                    <span>Haunted Hollywood has been discussed and presented on cable network, E! And various other channels such as History Channel, A&E, Entertainment Tonight, Unsolved Mysteries and other entertainment news programs. There are many websites, which gives the reader plenty of information. This book contains limited information and falls short of satisfying real ghost enthusiasts. The author could have expanded to include more haunted stories and perhaps more details. The reader could invest his/her money on something else and read from websites.</span>

                    <span>Uhhh! Jacobson covers a broad spectrum of freaky fright starlitghts on this one. Bella grabbing the wheel of his hearse for one last stroll down Hollywood and Vine. The now Comedy Store that used to be the notorious mob affiliated Ciro's where such a dark specter lurks even a Vietnam vet can still barely talk about it to this day. The house where Sharon Tate saw a vision of her grisly end. And even the Holly Mont haunting's were the famed paranormal investigator Barry Taff couldnt get enough of the ghostly goings on. Especially when a lady who lived blocks from the homes called him weeks after the studies asking why he had left a note in her home when he had in fact left the note in the Holy Mont home. Ahhh, dont read at night or when you are alone in the house!!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book by Laurie Jacobson. Her writing style is good, and she keeps the book moving along with stories of ghostly goings on in Hollywood. It is a fun read. Enjoy!!!!</span>
