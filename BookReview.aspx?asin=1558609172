                <span id="Label1">Semantics in Business Systems begins with a description of what semantics are and how they affect business systems. It examines four main aspects of the application of semantics to systems, specifically: How do we infer meaning from unstructured information, how do application systems make meaning as they operate, how do practitioners uncover meaning in business settings, and how do we understand and communicate what we have deduced? This book illustrates how this applies to the future of application system development, especially how it informs and affects Web services and business rule- based approaches, and how semantics will play out with XML and the semantic Web. The book also contains a quick reference guide to related terms and technologies. It is part of Morgan Kaufmann's series of Savvy Manager's Guides.<br><br>* Presents an easy and enjoyable introduction to semantics in the context of business IT systems.<br>* Articulates the business value of semantics, while providing relevant introductory technical background.<br>* Describes the semantic underpinnings of data modeling, business rules, enterprise integration, and Web services.<br>* Contains a handy quick-reference guide to technologies and terminology. <br>* For more information, links, and discussions, go to www.savvymanagers.com.</span>

                    <span>This book does a tremendous job of covering some important issues -- rarely does a technical author provide comprehensive analysis of the role of semantics. McComb addresses high-level issues while also providing solid, hands-on, specific information. 
<br />
<br />Having myself been involved in complex integration projects, it's refreshing to see someone discussing the problem (and potential business value) of getting meaning out of unstructured information -- without promoting a particular technology.  Even more impressive is that he does this using an extremely readable style.

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was skeptical that the book would be relevant to a small company's projects, but I got lots of good ideas that we can start implementing right away.  Because the world of the semantic web is still so new, even our small company has a chance to contribute to  a lot of the ontologies that will be used in our industry for years to come.</span>

                    <span>As a professional data modeller, I found this book impressive, inspiring, and distressing.<p>It is impressive because the author has done a good job of encapsulating a broad set of what on the surface appear to be completely unrelated topics--metadata, business rules, data modeling, XML, etc.  Except that I am interested in all of them, which should already have told me that they were related.  He managed to balance the level of detail for each of the areas, not getting either intimidating with detail or too superficial to be useful.<p>I found it inspiring because I really have been interested in this subject for many years and just didn't know it.  In  my data modeling practice I have always focused more on the meaning of concepts than on how they might be physically represented in databases.  The author's admonition to companies to spend more time (and money) considering semantics could be in my marketing materials.  <p>My current problem is that data modeling has become passé  and it is tricky to market my services.  I like to distinguish myself from other data modelers in that I think I am better than most in understanding semantics, but I never described it that way. Semantics now gives me a way to rework my marketing message.<p>I found this book distressing for the same reasons I found it inspiring.  It points out that far from being a closed issue, this field is just beginning.  The amount of stuff I still don't know is really troubling.  The bibliography seriously scared me.  Part of the problem is that my undergraduate degree was in philosophy, but in addition to the fact that I really have trouble after all these years remembering who said what, I now realize that my education in that subject was seriously superficial. Now I am going to have to take a refresher course!<p>While I often see myself as an old curmudgeon who hates new ideas, I see this book as a challenge to me to get my intellectual act together.  I welcome that and I am glad to see that there are still exciting things to be done.</span>

I would recommed the book to technologists and business managers alike.</span>
