                <span id="Label1">Imagine crossing E.M. Forster with Jane Austen. Stir in a bit of socialist  doctrine, a sprig of satire, strong Indian curry, and a couple quarts of good English  gin and you get something close to the flavor of George Orwell's intensely readable and deftly plotted <I>Burmese Days</I>. In 1930, Kyauktada, Upper Burma, is one of the least auspicious postings in the ailing British Empire--and then the order comes that the European Club, previously for whites only, must elect one token native member. This edict  brings out the worst in this woefully enclosed society, not to mention among the natives who would become the One. Orwell mines his own Anglo-Indian background to evoke both the suffocating heat and the stifling pettiness that are the central facts of colonial life:  "Mr. MacGregor told his anecdote about Prome, which could be produced in almost any context.  And then the conversation veered back to the old, never-palling subject--the insolence of the natives, the supineness of the Government, the dear dead days when the British Raj <I>was</I> the Raj and please give the bearer fifteen lashes.  The topic was never let alone for long, partly because of Ellis's obsession.  Besides, you could forgive the Europeans a great deal of their bitterness.  Living and working among Orientals would try the temper of a saint."<p>  Protagonist James Flory is a timber merchant, whose facial birthmark serves as an outward expression of the ironic and left-leaning habits of mind that make him inwardly different from his coevals. Flory appreciates the local culture, has native allegiances, and detests the racist machinations of his fellow Club members. Alas, he doesn't always possess the moral courage, or the energy, to stand against them. His almost embarrassingly Anglophile friend, Dr. Veraswami, the highest-ranking native official, seems a shoo-in for Club membership, until Machiavellian magistrate U Po Kyin launches a campaign to discredit him that results, ultimately, in the loss not just of reputations but of lives. Whether to endorse Veraswami or to betray him becomes a kind of litmus test of Flory's character.<p>  Against this backdrop of politics and ethics, Orwell throws the shadow of romance. The arrival of the bobbed blonde, marriageable, and resolutely anti-intellectual Elizabeth Lackersteen not only casts Flory as hapless suitor but gives Orwell the chance to show that he's as astute a reporter of nuanced social interactions as he is of political intrigues. In fact, his combination of an astringently populist sensibility, dead-on observations of human behavior, formidable conjuring skills, and no-frills prose make for historical fiction that stands triumphantly outside of time. <I>--Joyce Thompson</I></span>

                    <span>Orwell's "Burma Days" is a masterpiece. I ought stop right here and just do nothing more than insist in my most persuasive tones that you should read it. But that wouldn't be much of a review, so I will say that Orwell wrote a novel that showcases exquisitely-drawn characters against Colonial Burma and the English Raj in the most masterful way possible. The descriptions of the British and Burmese characters (especially the unsavory ones,) the sweltering heat, the sodden texture of everything rotting in the jungle humidity, and the awful, filthy Burmese food are astonishingly to the point. After a few paragraphs, you can almost feel the brazen sun roasting your own head.<P>James Flory, the protagonist, is described as ugly, deformed, badly brought up, cheaply educated, and yet, we sympathize with him, as Orwell means us to do. Flory is obviously an alter-ego of Orwell, who also served in Burma. The plot, where a nasty local Burmese magistrate connives to discredit a social climber of an Indian doctor, is a simple enough device to manipulate each character along the fatalistic road to Hell. <P>The theme of a man past his youth, who drinks and thinks too much, who falls in love with a simple, thoughtless pretty woman is very like Winston Smith in 1984 and his fatal attraction to Julia. Here, Flory falls smack in love with Elizabeth, who is a bob-haired adolescent who cringes at the word "Art." <P>Orwell satirizes the British bullies and exiled failures who run the colonies and love the natives for being powerless and meek. Orwell's eye for cruelty is sharp, his wit is biting, and his writing skill is at its best in this novel. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>George Orwell has managed to create an extraordinarily vivid picture of life during the British Colonialism of Burma near the earlier part of the twentieth century. The descriptors used enable the reader to envision the story almost as a film being played out. For example, an entire paragraph is devoted to describing Flory's birthmark, which allows one to understand that this one physical characteristic will play an important part of the story. This is a story of unattainable love and bitter loneliness when one is exiled to the colonies. True loving relationships are conspicuously absent within this tale; and issues of oppression are interwoven within it's seams. Conformity to peer pressure is represented and questioned by the characters, especially the anti-hero, Flory. Orwell does an excellent job of setting and preparing the reader for future scenes while incorportating symbolism within his work; such as introducing several of the characters in the beginning within the conversation between U Po Kyin and Ko Ba Sein. He is masterful at creating drama and suspense throughout until the tragic ending. Why read a novel written in 1934? The answer is simple. This is a timeless classical piece of literature concerning real social problems occurring then as they do now. For anyone interested in a more personal glimpse of history this is a gripping tale for sure.</span>

                    <span>In up-country Burma, in the small village of Kyauktada, the British community represtents the outer edge of the Empire. John Flory, a timber merchant, stands out from the rest of the community, as he tries to maintain his contacts with the Indian doctor Veraswami, and as he does not share the others' blatently racist view of the locals. While the magistrate U Po Kin plots to distrupt the British, Elizabeth Lackersteen, niece of one of the British officials, arrives from Paris. Will the community be able to survive the (inevitable) disruption that will follow?<P>"Burmese Days" is a very readable novel, full of excellent descriptive passages and sharply-observed humour. It is also a savage indictment of British imperialism:<P>"... the lie that we're here to uplift our poor black brothers instead of to rob them. I suppose it's a natural enough lie. But it corrupts us, it corrupts us in ways you can't imagine."<P>The awfulness of the British community is in its "exclusiveness" and its petty snobbery. The racism runs deep too - especially in the truly terrible Ellis.<P>The novel fits into the tradition of British writing on the last days of the Empire - relfecting the sheer disillusionment with the imperial idea (not least on the part of the imperial administrators themselves). One thinks of such works as Forster's "A Passage to India" and Scott's "The Jewel in the Crown". It's interesting that in each of these works, the arrival or presence of a young British female is the major disruptive factor for the communities, bringing out into the open the absurdity of imperial rule.<P>Although "Burmese Days" is interesting for all the reasons outlined above, it is not as accomplished as it might have been. Orwell's shifts from bitter critique to comedy, then again to high drama are at times uneven and are not always assured. Other parts of the novel are slightly overdone - for example the passages centred on U Po Kyin, which are far less convincing than the rest of the novel. Nonetheless an interesting part of the imperial epitaph.<P>G Rodgers</span>

                    <span>When most people think of George Orwell they think of Nineteen Eighty-Four and perhaps Animal Farm. Many people don't realize that he also wrote a number of other books and essays that were successful before he wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four. One of these books that Orwell wrote before Nineteen Eight-Four is 'Burmese Days.' This book was published originally in 1934. The subject is appropriate for Orwell since Orwell spent time in Burma as an Imperial Policeman. 'Burmese Days' is about a man in a remote British outpost in Burma when Burma was still a British Colony. The man, named Flory, works for a British timber company harvesting timber from Burma.<BR>	Many issues are raised in this book. The main issues are the attitudes of the British toward the Burmese. Burmese attitudes towards the British are looked at. Issues of friendship are explored. One of the biggest issues is idealism, honesty, and loyalty vs. greed, excessive materialism, and selfishness.<BR>	The issue of Burmese vs. British relations is explored in the relationship between the main character Flory and his friend Dr. Veraswami. Other characters such as Ellis are used to illustrate the stupid and immature nature of most of the Englishmen's attitudes toward the Burmese.<BR>	The book also shows how most people are really just slaves to their inner instincts and the social constructs that they are indoctrinated into. One of the points related to this that most people don't really understand new ideas or are cultured unless it benefits them personally.<BR>	The book uses Dr. Veraswami and U Po Kyin to symbolize the struggle between idealism, honesty, loyalty and greed, excessive materialism, and selfishness. This is done in a very intresting way as Dr. Veraswami and U Po Kyin struggle and position to get the best of eachother through the book.<BR>	The style of the book isn't the greatest I've ever read but it's adequate. Orwell could have been more descriptive at various points in the book with how characters are feeling and thinking. Orwell also has a tendency to tell rather then show in this novel. Over all though it is a good book with many complex issues that Orwell exposes and explores very well.</span>
