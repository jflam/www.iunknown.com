                    <span>This is the book that the famous literary genius, Jack London ("Call of the Wild", et al) wrote a "broadside" intro about: "Here it is at last! The book we've been waiting for these many years! The Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery! Comrade Sinclair's book, The Jungle! And what Uncle Tom's Cabin did for black slaves, The Jungle has a large chance to do for the white slaves..." and, "It is alive and warm. it is brutal with life. It is written of sweat and blood, and groans and tears. It depicts, not what man ought to be, but what man is compelled to be in this, our world, in the Twentieth Century...". (From Sinclair's 1946 republication Intro). A fitting summation from a fellow humanist.
<br />
<br />Upton Sinclair (1878-1968) was a tireless agitator for the rights of the working class and immigrants of America and a good part of his literary talents were dedicated to exposing the deplorable working conditions and labor abuse rampant in the early 20th century. "The Jungle" had one of the most profound effects on society of any novel ever written in it's time. With it's stomach turning expose' of the filthy conditions of the Chicago meat processing industry, it put a serious dent in the sale of meat for decades after and it also lead to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.
<br />
<br />Sinclair helped establish the League for Industrial Democracy and started the California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.
<br />
<br />To get a feel for the background in "The Jungle", Sinclair immersed himself in the Chicago industrial areas and living quarters and interviewed a broad spectrum of immigrants, stock-yard workers, slaughter-house workers, meat packing business owners, political figures, etc., so when his scathing expose' was published, he had done his homework and all of his facts were irrefutable- a good thing, for it caused an unprecedented uproar and protestations from the meat industry.
<br />
<br />The story follows a typical immigrant, "Jurgis Rudkus", from his entrance to the U.S. and his eventual migration towards the meat industry in Chicago. His trials and tribulations are detailed in an agonizing, but gripping tale of survival in his new country. Overtones of the deplorable working conditions for immigrants in New York City exposed by the famous women's advocate and nurse, Margaret Sanger, are very apparent.
<br />
<br />Although "The Jungle" has been a favorite of school teachers and their students for  a century now, this is a book that should be on a nationally required reading list for all graduate courses.
<br />
<br />The current "Jungle" type expose' is Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal" (2002), another scathing indictment of not only the American fast food industry and it`s assembly-line meat production activities, but it's predatory business history as one of America's most ruthless industries. All of the big names in this industry are touched upon, but with special attention to the biggy of them all, McDonalds and it's ruthless ruler, the late Ray Croc. Upton Sinclair would no doubt have been proud of Schlosser's book!

                    <span>I don't doubt its power.  I don't doubt that it was a significant tool for change in America.  I don't doubt that it has influenced the way many of our laws stand today.  The Jungle revolutionized America much the same way as did Uncle Tom's Cabin.  The only difference is that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a masterpiece of a novel, character's, and story, while Sinclair's The Jungle has many flaws, and at its best is a good, but not a great piece of fiction.  I know it changed America, but I am looking at it clearly from the standpoint of a novel and a story.  
<br />
<br />The story opens marvelously at a wedding.  A lone bright spot among the midst of depression to come.  Young Jurgis, our main character and protagonist is getting married and has no idea the turmoil that is to come.  His family is from Lithuania.  They come to America with the goal of finding the American dream, like most immigrants do.  They have no idea what is in store for them.
<br />
<br />Jurgis and his family move to Chicago.  At first Jurgis is full of optimism as he gets a new job at the meat processing factory.  He can't believe how foul of a mood the rest of his co-workers are in.  His family is excited to move into a brand new home and begin living their dreams.....then all hell breaks loose.
<br />
<br />First, Jurgis' family realizes that they have been conned into thinking they got a good price for their new home.  They realize it is going to cost them more than they thought.  His family struggles to stay alive, nearly starving some months.  Jurgis' attitude quickly changes at the meat factory.  He becomes sickened at the grueling hours and unsanitary conditions that prevail.  Things only will get worse, however.  Pretty soon, his wife has to sleep with her boss for extra money, and when Jurgis finds out about this he nearly kills the man and gets sent to jail.
<br />
<br />After being released from prison, Jurgis suffers two devastating deaths in his life.  This sends him on the road and he becomes a drifter for a period.  He feels free for a time, but his sadness returns and carries him back to Chicago.  Once there, he becomes a gambler and a crook.  This leads him to eventually becoming a manager at his former place of employment-the meat factory.
<br />
<br />Another tragic event occurs and Jurgis finds himself again in jail.  It doesn't seem like life could get any worse for him, until he discovers socialism and it changes his life.
<br />I have condensed the story as down as I could without giving away too much information.  At the core, The Jungle is about a man's struggle to make it in America.  His life, his struggles, his desires, and his transformation as the cruel outside pressures of society beat down upon him.
<br />
<br />This is a relentlessly depressing depiction of the conditions that existed for lower class working America.  Some of the passages are sickening and harrowing.  They had to be this way, however, in order for action to be taken.  The entire food industry and the conditions there were reformed, due in a large measure to Sinclair's graphic description of the things which took place there.  They have to be read to be believed.
<br />
<br />I wish The Jungle would have stayed more true to its character and not given us a fabricated ending.  The ending of this book almost ruined it for me.  It was purely a vehicle for Sinclair to unload his socialistic propaganda and didn't give us the ending that we, as the readers, deserved.  It totally deviates from what it is all about.  This ending comes out of nowhere.  I felt cheated at the end.
<br />
<br />The only other problem with The Jungle the narration.  I wish that Sinclair would have just told his story simply and straight-forward.  It seems like he always has to throw in his two cents about everything instead of giving us more credit.  We are smart enough, we can decipher what is being told without having us told what to think.  Give us a bit more credit.  I grew tired of the labels and exclamation marks and the repetition that was involved.  This would have been a much better story without Sinclair's narration.  If he would have just shown us and not told us, I could have seen an even more powerful theme and message burst through. 
<br />
<br />Despite its flaws, The Jungle has to be given its due.  It should be read, but it is not a masterpiece of fiction.  It just saddens me that as a novel (not a motivator for change), it could have been so much better.  This book had the potential of being not only one of the greatest novels to motivate change (which it did), but being one of the greatest personal stories ever told (which it did not).  It is too bad so many novels sell us short and don't give us what they could have in the end.

                    <span>When you read this book you start to think please no more but it keeps coming. Relentless pain and suffering with no hope and its grasp of abject misery can one spirit hold? The ending felt like a flat tire as if the real ending was % 75 of the story but that would be a reasonable reaction in the face of such organized evil. I give 5 stars despite this propaganda end because of the time the book was written.  If you use experience of Jurgis you shall never feel sorrow.

                    </div>
                    <span>Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is a dark, depressing look at the American immigrant experience around the turn of the Twentieth Century. In addition to the obvious attacks on the Chicago stockyard barons, Chicago politicians, labor practices, and food standards, The Jungle represents Sinclair's attack upon Capitalism, as well. 
<br />
<br />We follow the main character, Lithuanian immigrant Jurgis Rudkus, as he and his family establish themselves in Chicago and get to work in the great stockyard industry. He goes from healthy and strong to beaten down and broken, as stockyard accidents, political and commercial swindles, and a succession of personal tragedies eventually drive him to a life of starvation, drunkenness, petty crime, racketeering, and violence. 
<br />
<br />Sinclair does uncover numerous failures of the Capitalistic system, so I will not begrudge him his attack on the system. It should be pointed out, however, that this is a failure of Capitalism under a collection of exceptional circumstances: corrupt government and law-enforcement at all levels (nothing exceptional there, I hear you saying), combined perhaps with a weak or crooked press, and, most importantly, an unending, unorganized, bewildered stream of immigrant labor which did not speak English, did not understand its rights, and was unable, because of these reasons and because of never-ending fear for its livelihood, to complain. Most of these conditions do not prevail in today's developed world, at least, and not to the same extent and all at once, but The Jungle still serves as a warning concerning what can happen when the Invisible Hand is at work while the other hand covers the eyes of society.
<br />
<br />The descriptions of the stockyards are horrifying. Horrifying. The work itself, when it goes according to plan, is grim, filthy, smelly, and difficult, at the best of times. When things do not go according to plan, we find sick and "downed" cattle being slaughtered after normal hours, when the largely decorative government inspectors aren't around; we find spoiled meat left sitting for months boiled in with the rest of the witches' brew that becomes canned meat; we find men slipping on the greasy floors over the boiling vats of soon-to-be canned meat and falling in, after which their bones-the only bits left-are fished out, and the rest stays in the canned meat mixture; we find children accidentally locked inside the buildings at night, where the rats eat them alive before their remains are discovered in the morning. 
<br />
<br />The cynical side of me tells me that people probably were more outraged about their tainted meat products than they were about the treatment of thousands of immigrants, but, in any case, Sinclair's story caught the public's attention. It appears less evident, though, that his rousing battle cry for Socialism, which took up the last 40 pages of my 290-page text, was heeded. I'm afraid Capitalism and its accompanying Pursuit of the American Dream already had taken hold for good by then.
<br />
<br />I had to stop and think for a moment when I considered whether I thought this book was well-written or not. I don't think it matters terribly much, because the point of the story is more important than the quality of the story itself; however, purely for the dark mood of hopelessness running through the work, the writing is effective at worst and grimly evocative of the stark reality facing hundreds of thousands of immigrants at its best. While reading this, I often found myself thinking of the inscription on our treasured Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore." Yes, please send them-we have some use for them. We can keep them tired and poor, and as for huddled masses and wretched refuse, there's plenty of that in the stockyards. Give your family a couple of generations and we'll work on the breathing free bit. Welcome to America.</span>

                    <span>The Jungle is the tale of a Lithuanian immigrant named Jurgis, and the struggles he and his family face when they come to the United States with dreams of striking it rich in the Chicago's Packingtown district.  What the family finds instead of the immediate success that was promised them is cruelty, lies, coldness, and betrayal at the hands of their fellow man.  Upton Sinclair paints a brilliant mental image for the reader, exposing us to the horrors of life in the meat packing district.  Although I won't go as far as other reviewers, who vow that you "will never eat meat again!" or possibly "will go vegetarian for at least a few months" because of this book's graphic depiction of the disgusting and horrendously unclean methods of slaughter and preperation, I will say that if you have a weak stomach and a vivid imagination, you may want to be aware of what this book chornicles.
<br />
<br />With that said, my review is mixed.  On the one hand, Sinclair does well to introduce us to the conflics and daily routine of the poor working-classes who strived for a better life at the turn of the century.  However, I found the book to be too full of summary for my liking.  Too often, instead of telling the story of Jurgis' point of view, the focus was too much on everyone else in packingtown, and Jurgis was just an observer.  True, many very bad things happened to Jurgis, enough to show the reader how bad things really were back then, so little time was spent on exploring the characters in Jurgis' family and life that it was hard to make a connection.  The book is also fairly uneven--the first one-hundred or so pages is about Packingtown, with Jurgis simply thrown in as a human face.  Soon after, however, when tragedy strikes his family, we really begin to find out more about Jurgis; the kind of man he is, and the kind of man he has always been, and how he is changing, be it for the better or for the worse.  His experiences as a homeless "tramp" make up the most interesting story-line in the whole novel.  Up till then, and after then, it is mostly flat and rarely focuses on any characters at all.  As I've said, the first part of the book is mostly summary; the second part becomes a story; the third, and final, is all political testimony, and let me say that because of this the ending leaves alot to be desired.  We find out what happens to the Socialist party in this book, but not of Jurgis and his family!  Perhaps that is where I am the most frustrated by this novel.  By the last chapter, Jurgis has become just a name the author gives to remind (or fool) the reader into thinking we're reading a novel and not a manifesto of sorts.  The fact is, if Sinclair wanted to convince the world the horrible ways of Capitalism and the wonders of Socialism, he would have done far better to continue and finsish the novel through the eyes of Jurgis, and how the world affects him, not by a long-winded "conversation" between high-ranking Socialist Party members!  In the end, the well told story of Jurgis' experiences in America becomes lost in a book that could hardly be called a novel at all.  For his writing skills, I'll give Sinclair an A+, but for his ability as a story teller, I must give him a C-.  So much more could have been written in this book, but instead the reader istrapped by politics.</span>
