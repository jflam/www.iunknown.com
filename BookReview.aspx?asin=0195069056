                <DIV class="ReviewHeading">Book Description:</DIV>
                <span id="Label1">This book is the first volume in a cultural history of the United States, from the earliest English settlements to our own time.  It is a history of American folkways as they have changed through time, and it argues a thesis about the importance for the United States of having been British in its cultural origins.  <P>From 1629 to 1775, North America was settled by four great waves of English-speaking immigrants.  The first was an exodus of Puritans from the east of England to Massachusetts (1629-1640).  The second was the movement of a Royalist elite and indentured servants from the south of England to Virginia (ca. 1649-75).  The third was the "Friends' migration,"--the Quakers--from the North Midlands and Wales to the Delaware Valley (ca. 1675-1725).  The fourth was a great flight from the borderlands of North Britain and northern Ireland to the American backcountry (ca. 1717-75).  <P>These four groups differed in many ways--in religion, rank, generation and place of origin.  They brought to America different folkways which became the basis of regional cultures in the United States.  They spoke distinctive English dialects and built their houses in diverse ways. They had different ideas of family, marriage and gender; different practices of child-naming and child-raising; different attitudes toward sex, age and death; different rituals of worship and magic; different forms of work and play; different customs of food and dress; different traditions of education and literacy; different modes of settlement and association.  They also had profoundly different ideas of comity, order, power and freedom which derived from British folk-traditions. Albion's Seed describes those differences in detail, and discusses the continuing importance of their transference to America.  <P>Today most people in the United States (more than 80 percent) have no British ancestors at all. These many other groups, even while preserving their own ethnic cultures, have also assimilated regional folkways which were transplanted from Britain to America.  In that sense, nearly all Americans today are "Albion's Seed," no matter what their ethnic origins may be; but they are so in their different regional ways.  The concluding section of Albion's Seed explores the ways that regional cultures have continued to dominate national politics from 1789 to 1988, and still control attitudes toward education, government, gender, and violence, on which differences between American regions are greater than between European nations.  <P>Albion's Seed also argues that the four British folkways created an expansive cultural pluralism that has proved to the more libertarian than any single culture alone could be.  Together they became the determinants of a voluntary society in the United States.</span>

                    <span>I hate to use a superlative to describe any piece of scholarly work, because there are so many fine pieces of work out there that I read while working on my BA and MA in History, but I can't think of any single serious history book that has left me more impressed. It is scholarly -- and shows an astonishing command of a truly amazing collection of primary and secondary sources. At the same time, it is beautifully written -- one of the few serious scholarly history books that I can, in good conscience, recommend to any reasonably well-educated person -- and have confidence that they will find it interesting. Mot important of all, it is extraordinarily important, because it shows the still dominant role that America's four British folkways play in creating both the national and regional cultures that still dominate American society. <P>I read this book while writing my book Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early Republic: Dueling, Southern Violence, and Moral Reform (Praeger Press, 1999), and Albion's Seed made it possible for me to adequately determine the origins of the backcountry Southern culture of violence that created such havoc in the early Republic -- and created the structure of violence and weapons control laws that still dominate the current political debate. <P>I can't adequately summarize this massive and wonderful book in the available space, but let me give you just a clue as to the power of it. It provides a persuasive explanation for regional variations in housing design, birth month distribution, naming conventions, cooking styles, and male/female power relationships -- and without ever seeming forced to me, the skeptic of "one theory does it all" approaches. <P>I can't recommend a book more highly than this.</span>

                    <span>While at times I felt the author was stretching to make a point (if you look hard enough long enough many things will support a thesis, but SHOULD they?), all-in-all I believe this is a very important work that will forever affect the way I view regionalism and British/American history. Especially intriguing are the characteristics that were transplanted from the four regions of Britain to four regions of America. I was reared in the Highlands (and yes, I do have many of the characteristics he attributes to men in the Highlands, bad and good, and went to a military school and I am career military...) In the past 24 years I have lived in all four regions of the United States, and I have marvelled at how different the usual attitudes, values, and behavior continue to be, even though it is "accepted" by many Americans that regional differences have been blurred in the past few decades. I think not, and I have lived in Kentucky, Tennessee, Rhode Island, California, Washington State, Texas, Maryland, and now Virginia. The book also helped "round out" some details about my ancestors early days in Virginia immediately following the English Civil War of 1642-1649.</span>

                    <span>For those among us who want to understand America and American culture, look no further. This book is phenominal. This is a profound experience of a book. Personally, I read this book and sensed a true and honest American culture. The four folkways each contributing its influence to American culture, have made this country what it is: A land of freedom and human progress that is possible from that freedom. True, the British transcontinental experiment was founded by people seeking religious freedom, but the essence is that each wanted freedom in its purest sense (The individual sections on "Liberty" are excellent). I am incredibly thankful to Professor Fischer for having an organic perspective to history, he has put together a truly perfect cultural account. Amazing!</span>

                    <span>Fischer uses the sociological concept of "Folkways" to organize his exploration of the cultures which created the United States. Folkways are the "ways of life" that combine to create a distinct cultures. In turn, those distinct cultures combine to create our society.<P>Fischer identifies four relevant folkways: the Puritans of New England, the Cavaliers of Virginia, the Quakers of the Delaware Valley and the Borderers (or Scotch Irish) of the back country.<P>The most extraordinary part of this long, long book was the manner in which Fischer was able to unpack the regional cultures of the British Isles. As Fischer himself remarks, British historians and social scientists have devoted negligible time and attention to regional culture (as supposed to strictly "local" culture, which is often covered in Britain).<P>Once Fischer links up the regions in England with their counter parts in America, the once obscure has become obvious. This, I believe, is one of the hallmarks of excellent scholarship.<P>It's almost impossible to critize anything about this book until the last hundred pages, when Fischer blithely asserts that all events for the past three hundred years are eminently explainable in terms of the four folkways of this book.<P>I was suprised to see him reach so far, especially since this is "volume 1" of a "proposed five volume set". Since this book was published fifteen years ago, I guess we'll have to be patient while we wait for, "The Ebony Tree: African Folkways in America"<BR>, volume two of the set.<P>Still, this book was near revelatory in both method and analysis.</span>
