                    <span>As a strong believer in the concept that there are defined qualities that produce given results I was further impressed with this book. When you consider other books covering the millionaire subject such as the Instant Millionaire or the Millionaire Brain, you can start drawing up your own set of criteria that define this important segment along with the parameters that will allow you to reach out and conduct business with this important market.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Thomas Stanley has become a big name since his book "The Millionaire Next Door" but some of his have been tracking his work since his days as Georgia State Professor.<p>This was his breakthrough work.  Lots of original research and tremendous insights. <p>I work as a financial consultant to people who receive personal injury awards and found Dr. Stanley's writing extremely valuable.<p>Anyone who works with high producers or who wants to be a high income producer should own this book.<p>Don McNay...</span>
