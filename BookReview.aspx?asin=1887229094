                    <span>Who would have thought that a book that tells us how to<br>market something we may not need to people who may<br>not want to buy it could be bright, interesting and worth<br>the price? <p>"Hitting the Sweet Spot" is written to teach students and<br>professional marketers, and advertisers and others how<br>to stay in touch and truly understand their target<br>audiences. That's not necessarily a bad thing, even for<br>those who think we're too busy buying and selling<br>already. <p>I read this from a consumer's perspective and found it educational. Not once, after I opened the pages, was I tempted to sneer at the point of the book--teaching people how to sell. Why? Because the book strikes me as honest. <p>Yes, it's teaching kids and others to persuade someone else to do something, perhaps something they don't want. But at no time is there a hint of deception or arm twisting. It's simply a guide to knowing your market. <p>That's something anyone who works with potential customers in any<br>venue--and that's a lot of us, folks--needs to understand. <p>This book will teach you some terminology--early adopters vs. laggards, account planning, laddering and more--that is creeping into ordinary vocabulary, has applications well beyond plain old advertising and therefore must be understood. For those of us who live in this intensely consumer society, I recommend this book because it's really, after all, about us. <p>The book is written in a comfortably breezy manner, easily read by high school students and up, by Lisa Fortini-Campbell, a top-ranking woman in the advertising/marketing field. She offers us both theory and practical help, in sections ranging from defining the reason for understanding consumers to working with others to achieve goals.</span>

                    <span>Lisa Fortini-Campbell is a professor at the prestigious Integrated Marketing Communications graduate program at Northwestern University.  Her book gives sound advice about getting to know consumers, and gives superb, real life examples for each of her major points.  She describes various tools used to both understand consumers and to convey the knowledge learned to others, such as "attribute mapping," "benefit mapping," "creative briefs," and "laddering."  HITTING THE SWEET SPOT should be required reading for anyone working in Marketing or Advertising.</span>

                    <span>This book stresses the importance of marketing professionals putting the consumer in the center of our thought process. The author is a strong proponent of consumer research leading marketing strategies. Her main focus  is that marketing professionals need to see the world through their  customers' eyes. To address this, she outlines 12 principles of consumer  insight and gives specific examples from well-known marketing campaigns.  <p>The Cramer-Krasselt book club group agreed with the author's point of  really understanding the audience we are trying to reach whether through  public relations or advertising.  Also, we all agreed that the author  provided practical ideas that we could implement. Members of the discussion  group related real-life examples of the twelve principles at work.  For  example, the author belives to gain true insight of consumers, one must  observe consumers in their natural setting.<p>One person relayed the added  insight he now had about his European client's cultural background after  touring historic buildings during a business trip to Amsterdam.  <p>Another  example of "thinking outside the box" was relayed by a discussion  member who recently facilitated a thought-provoking client meeting. In an  effort to show her client how well-known companies have branded their  products across several product categories, the meeting room was filled  with products which have line extensions. For example, Arm & Hammer has  products which run the gamut from kitty-litter deodorizers to toothpaste.  Neutrogena has face washes, shampoos and hand cream. These visuals helped  illustrate well-executed line extensions and challenged the client to  evaluate its product and possible line extensions in a strategic way.<p>The  author contends the "Sweet Spot" is hit when there's the right  combination of consumer insight and brand insight. She cites the  effectiveness fo the Marlboro Man as being on target. Marketing misses  include New Coke, videodiscs, and the USFL.<p>Thanks to its pragmatic  examples and knowledgeable yet down-to-earth tone, Hitting the Sweet Spot  is an easy read and recommended for advertising and public relations  professionals.</span>
