                <span id="Label1">In the second half of the 20th century, "rights talk," characteristic of political and legal discourse in the United States, has been forcefully invoked by minorities and women in their respective quests for equal treatment under the law. In <I>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies</I>, University of Iowa history professor Linda K. Kerber looks at the other side of the rights equation: the issue of obligations. Kerber argues that while men's rights have been bought by their obligations to public service, for women the obligations were to family. Absolution from public service--the constitutional right to be "ladies"--has clear roots in the principle of coverture, by which a woman's legal identity is absorbed by a man's, be it her father, husband, or other protector. This, Kerber writes, is not a boon for women. Women have always had obligations, she notes, it is merely "the forms and objects of demand" that have differed, and disparities between the obligations of men and women have affected women's qualitative ability to exercise rights, such as trial by a jury of one's peers. Kerber presents a series of narratives focusing on particular women whose situations became catalysts for political and legal change and the women, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who helped effect those transformations.  <I>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies</I> is engrossing reading for layperson and scholar alike. <I>--Julia Riches</I> </span>

                    <span>This is an absolutely fascinating book.   The material in it is interesting, detailed and very well written.   She uses legal cases as a starting point to discuss women's civic obligations.  It becomes very clear  that people's obligations have an enormous effect on their rights and the  roles they are expected to play in society.  The individual cases help keep  things grounded in people's lives and not just legal theories.  There is an  amazing amount of information that I never knew which really helped me  understand how things were and how they changed.<p>One case study was two  women who felt that they were being charged more in property taxes that the  other land owners in the area.  They decided to stop paying property taxes  using the slogan "no taxation without representation".  These two women had  received training in political activism with the abolition and temperence  movements which was common among the people who worked for women's  sufferage.  The "no taxation without representation"  was one of the first  legal arguments used to try and obtain voting rights for women and  initially it was a strong one.  It had certainly worked to increase the  various classes of men that were allowed to vote.  With women,  unfortunately, the courts chipped away at the legel precident rather than  following it.  This one case allowed Ms. Kerber to talk about how women  were hurt by being kept out of the political system, the women's sufferage  movement, and the response of the courts and politicians.<p>This book gave  me an immense amount of food for thought.  I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I have read a lot of women's and Constitutional history, and still my jaw literally dropped open several times while reading this book. Her use of real scenarios made the book readable and enjoyable. People have said  lately that we are focused too much on our rights and not our  responsibilities; it's scary to see that whether women must bear the  responsibilities of citizenship is still in many ways an open question.</span>

                    <span>I'm definately interested in reading and understanding more about the situation women face today. This book was an incredibly informative education on the evolution of debate about what exactly is a woman's place  in society. It helped clarify vague confusion I've felt about things being  not yet fully equal, but not having the background or vocabulary to explain  why.</span>

                    <span>This is that rare history book that can keep one up late, utterly unable to wait til the next day for the end of the story. Kerber focuses on little-known women and their conflicts with government over their rights  and obligations as citizens: loyalty during wartime, voting, serving on  juries, paying taxes. She brings these stories to life with dramatic, clear  writing.  If you're interested in American history, don't miss this book</span>
