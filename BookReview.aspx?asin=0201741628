                    <span>This book is the first you should read if you are moving to the .NET framework. It covers everything at a high level, zooming in on specifics just frequently enough to provide a solid basic understanding. Chappell writes and organizes well. 6 stars.</span>

                    <span>I needed to learn the .NET architecture and programming languages.  I wanted to learn about the .NET architecture before learning the languages, so I read this book first.   As the title in my review states, this is a MUST HAVE book for people learning .NET.   <p>This book explains how the .NET architecture works in a simple to understand manner.   An added feature of this book is the "extra asides" in each chapter discussing topics that are important to IT professionals, such as "Java Bytecode versus MSIL", "Why Enterprise Servers are not .NET", and "Making .NET Cross-platform".  This is the kind of information an IT professional needs when one is trying to sell a .NET solution to an IT manager or executive whose only exposure to technology is what s/he saw on "Tech TV".   It is also the kind of information that assists the IT professional who works on other platforms/languages (mainly Java programmers) with understanding .NET in relation to what one does.<p>Also, I believe that if a programmer/software engineer new to .NET understands the architecture, then the programmer/software engineer will have an easier time with learning and using the .NET languages (Well, I find that to be true in my case).   This book will give the new .NET developer or engineer a good foundation to allow one to make informed decisions when designing a .NET application.<p>As an IT professional and adjunct university professor, I would highly recommend this book to IT professionals learning .NET, and I would highly recommend this book as a textbook to be used in a school teaching .NET in their curriculum.</span>

                    <span>The .NET Framework is not just another new technology; it is an entirely revolutionary view of the world of software development.  And it comprises such an incredibly vast body of knowledge that one or two fat books will not make anyone well versed.  Ultimately, mastering this subject will require nothing less than a small library.  David Chappell's Understanding .NET is an excellent choice as a master volume and foundation for this library--as a sort of glue that will hold it all together.  In this book every major area of .NET is probed and placed in context, and Chappell's writing style is extremely succinct and focused.  I highly recommend this book to every software developer and manager.<p>Understanding .NET provides an objective and comprehensive overview of .NET, including chapters on how Web Services work, functionality of the Common Runtime Language, comparisons between .NET programming languages, how to work with the Class Library, new features of ADO.NET and ASP.NET, a description of .NET My Services, and how all of these parts fit together.<p> <p>Most obviously, this book is a perfect starting point for developers who may be skilled in DNA or some other architecture but new to .NET.  The familiar terminology and intelligent references provide engaging, informative reading, and there is enough density and new information to make every paragraph worth reading.  This is not one of those easy-listening books where the reader is advised in the preface to skip the first three chapters.<p> <p>This book also has much to offer developers who may have been working with .NET for some time but somehow missed the beginning of the movie.  When plunging into a particular area of a new technology, especially one as vast as .NET, it is quite easy to never be completely clear about the main plot.  By placing each major aspect of .NET clearly in context Chappell enables developers to back off for a moment to see the big picture, quite likely leading to exploration of new areas and a more comprehensive "understanding" of the environment.<p> <p>For technical managers who want a clear understanding of the workings of the .NET Framework but naturally can't afford to make a career out of the details, Understanding .NET is a must read.  This is perhaps as far into the details as a manager needs to go, but it should be mandatory material for any technical manager worth his or her salt.  Because of Chappell's focused writing style, this book is even suitable for a layperson who needs to be a step ahead.<p> <p>Understanding .NET is no sissy book, and at the same time it's not rocket science.  It is an aptly titled volume with a wealth of information that everyone involved with .NET needs to know.  --Review by David A.</span>
