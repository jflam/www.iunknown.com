                <span id="Label1">Janey Wilcox is an M.A.W. (that's Model/Actress/Whatever to the uninitiated). The problem with Janey, the protagonist of Candace Bushnell's first novel, <I>Trading Up</I>, is not the M or the A part. It's the W. Here is a rare alphabetical anomaly: In Janey's case, W stands for "prostitute." Oh, Janey never crosses the line into actual hookerdom, but she does sleep with extremely wealthy men in the hopes they'll improve her status, her financial situation, or her lifestyle. When we first met Janey in Bushnell's novella collection <I>4 Blondes</I>, she was up to her usual tricks (so to speak)--scamming a guy for a Hamptons vacation rental. At the opening of <I>Trading Up</I>, her fortunes have improved. She's now the star of a Victoria's Secret ad campaign, and as such she's found access to undreamed-of echelons of New York society. She makes friends with Mimi Kilroy, a senator's daughter "at the very top of the social heap in New York." She gets invited to all the best parties. And she finally finds a wealthy man who will actually marry her: Seldon Rose, a powerful entertainment industry executive. Of course, Janey's social ambitions are not stoppered by her marriage to Seldon, and the clash between her expectations (more parties!) and his (normal life) send Janey into a tailspin that leads to heartbreak. Bushnell is clearly trying to channel Edith Wharton (<I>The Custom of the Country</I> is even invoked by Janey as a screenplay idea), but ends up sounding a lot more like a cross between Tama Janowitz and Judith Krantz. This is a novel about shopping and sex, and while it's fizzy enough, it's not Cristal. <I>--Claire Dederer</I></span>

                    <span>Trading Up tells the story of Janey Wilcox, an ambitious blonde who has finally made her mark on the fashion industry by becoming a Victoria's Secret model. Now that she's semi-famous, she thinks she can leave behind the world of sleeping with rich men to get ahead, but her reputation precedes her and she still doesn't get the respect she thinks she deserves. Not about to give up, Janey finds herself a high-class best friend and decides to marry a rich older man who just happens to be an executive at a movie company. But Janey still isn't satisfied...she'll do anything it takes, including stabbing her 'friends' in the back and lying to her husband, to get what she wants. <BR> <BR>Despite these flaws, Trading Up is still a fun, raunchy book that makes you happy you're not rich and famous (and really, doesn't there need to be more things out there that make you glad you're not rich and famous?) Even if you've never read any Jackie Collins books or watched Sex and the City, you should give Trading Up a read. After reading about the despicable Janey Wilcox, you'll feel better about yourself if nothing else. I purchased this book through Amazon.com right after another great purchase, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. Both are fun, recommended books. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I have read Miss Bushnell's other books and bought this one for a trip I went on. While starting out ok it just kept getting worse and I finally put it down without finishing it. Books should not be this painful to get through. The characters have no redeeming qualities and there are parts that drag on forever. Skip this book and read Sex in the City a second time.</span>

                    <span>You keep hoping Janey will have some redeeming qualities or will have an epiphany around her self-centered life.. but she doesn't. The book is entirely frustrating, irritating and unsatisfying, although it does provide a probably fairly accurate glimpse into the inner workings of New York City "society".</span>

                    <span>Janey Wilcox is a modern-day Lily Bart: beautiful, slightly connected and determined to emerge as a scion of society. With updated strategies and a refusal to be beaten down, Janey uses everything within her powers to defeat the powerful men, women and social structure that threaten to pull her back into her middle class roots (or at least into obscurity).<P>Candace Bushnell understands human drama and New York society better than any mainstream writer in the current publishing world. Creating characters and situations that make the reader eagerly turn pages while cringing with shock, Bushnell successfully delivers the hierarchical world that is New York - with none of the pretentious, apologetic or hack "insider" views currently popular in today's "literary circles". <P>This isn't for the "chick-lit" culture: Leave Prada and the Nannies on the shelf. "Trading Up" delivers in the style of "The House of Mirth" (and will create in the reader a desire to read the older classics of New York society fiction).</span>

                    <span>What a disappointment this book was. Granted, I had not read a Bushnell book and my only knowledge of her is the very wonderful Sex and the City on HBO, but I do know books and this was like a glossy depiction of shallow people in an unbelievable social setting. I finished the book only out of curiosity to see how she would wind things up, and ended up thinking, Who Cares? I'd never want to get to know these people and couldn't care less about what happened to them. It read like a corny nighttime soap on Lifetime. I'm not impressed with Bushnell's writing at all and cannot recommend this book.</span>
