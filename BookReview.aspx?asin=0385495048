                <span id="Label1">After nearly a decade of bull markets, Americans have come to equate free markets with democracy. Never one for mincing words, social critic Thomas Frank, editor of <I>The Baffler</I> and author of <I>The Conquest of Cool</I>, challenges this myth. With his acerbic wit and contempt for sophistry, he declares the New Economy a fraud. Frank scours business literature, management theory, and marketing and advertising to expose the elaborate fantasies that have inoculated business against opposition. This public relations campaign joins an almost mystical belief in markets, a contempt for government in any form, and an "ecstatic" confusion of markets with democracy. Frank traces the roots of this movement from the 1920s, and sees its culmination in market populism as a fusion of the rebellious '60s with the greedy '80s. The overarching irony is the swapping of roles--suddenly Wall Street is no longer full of stodgy moneygrubbers, but cool entrepreneurs "leaping on their trampolines, typing out a few last lines on the laptop before paragliding, riding their bicycles to work, listening to Steppenwolf while they traded." Meanwhile, "Americans traded their long tradition of electoral democracy for the democracy of the supermarket, where all brands are created equal and endowed by their creators with all sorts of extremeness and diversity." Frank's close reading of the salesmen of market populism nails such financial gurus as George Gilder, Joseph Nocera, Kevin Kelly, and Thomas Friedman. Their writings, he contends, have served to make "the world safe for billionaires" by winning the cultural and political battle--legitimizing the corporate culture and its demands for privatization, deregulation, and non-interference. Frank's incisive prose verges on brilliant at times, though his yen for repetition can be exasperating. In either case, his boisterous reminder that markets are fundamentally not democracies is worth repeating as the level of wealth polarization in America reaches heights not seen since the 1920s. <I>--Lesley Reed</I> </span>

                    <span>As usual, Mr. Frank is good at spotting some issues. However, he misses the mark with the cause. People have lost the bright line distinction between a free market and mercantilism. When the government fosters certain larger endeavors at the expense of mom and pop stores it is NOT capitalism. We have government paying for new stadiums for billion dollar sports clubs. We have government finding excuses to take the property away from small stores to give it to chain stores. Chain stores are given taxpayer backed incentives to move into towns by local politicans who get campaign contributions. When corporations are allowed to easily file bankruptcy on 100s of millions of dollars of debt but we crack down on consumer bankruptcy and eliminate it entirely for student loans, it is clearly the disparity in treatment under the law that is the problem. On and on, the law is benefitting the enormous businesses at the expense of competition with the smaller endeavors and private consumer. These things are the antithesis of a free market, yet both parties practice it regularly, eagerly, and unpatriotically.</span>

                    <span>Having read Frank's "What's the matter with Kansas?"---which I quite liked---I started this book.  I looked forward to reading a critique of the "Emperor's New Economic Paradigm": that the almighty *Free Market* is the answer to all of America's problems.   However, after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages, I cried "uncle".  Frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum.  And to add injury to insult, the book's tiny, thin-line font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses.</span>

                    <span>Before I say anything else about this book, I want to address the very strange claim made by a couple of reviewers that Thomas Frank doesn't understand economics.  What is bizarre about that statement is that nowhere in the book does Frank talk about economics.  If you look at most of the books by people like George Stigler or Gary Becker or Kenneth J. Arrow or any of a host of economists, you will find none of the issues discussed in this book.  What is closer to the truth is that Frank discusses some of the assumptions that people make about business and the market.  But this is unrelated to economics.  When Martin Friedman argues for a radically free market economy, he has ceased speaking as an economist and has become a political philosopher, just as when Amartya Sen ceases writing about economics and begins talking about issues of justice and fairness in a political system, he has become a political philosopher.  One speaks as an economist when stating what the effect of strong central regulation has on foreign investment, but one speaks as a political scientist when saying that deregulation is a bad or a good thing.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, Frank is very definitely concerned with the assumptions that underlie much market-oriented policy of the past decade or so.  In a sense, Frank is trying to revive questions that progressives such as Teddy Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt asked about the fairness of a society in which the needs of the many could be ignored in favor of the needs of the few.  These individuals, like Frank, were deeply concerned with issues of economic equality.  In the past two decades, a revival of Social Darwinism has occurred, with the result that we are in the midst of the most dramatic concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny elite at the expense of the middle class and the impoverished.  A whole litany of statistics can be marshaled here.  Frank notes that according to Federal Reserve numbers in 1979 20% of the wealth was in the hands of the top 1%, a number that strikes me as far too large.  Yet by 1999 37% of the wealth was in the hands of the top 1%.  After several rounds of tax cuts for the wealthy and investor classes, what would that percentage be today?  43%?  45%?  48?  Clearly it is a pattern that has that been reversed.  All economic indicators reveal that in the past twenty-three years there has been a dramatic shift in the wealth of the nation from the middle class to a small economic elite.  Real wages for the middle class have fallen, while we are experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of millionaires and billionaires.  Frank clearly thinks this is completely messed up, and I doubt if many Americans would disagree.
<br />
<br />ONE MARKET UNDER GOD deals with the panoply of problems that result from the allied beliefs in market populism (which is one of the ultimate oxymorons) and extreme capitalism.  The passion for making all roads straight for rampant capitalism, the mania for deregulation, the utter disregard for all criteria for the economic health of any nation other than how the markets are doing, are all unquestioned manias that dominate current social and political discourse.  Yet FDR insisted that it was a shameful situation where we as a nation considered that the nation as a whole was doing well if the majority of the citizens were not doing well.  But in the market craze of the past two decades, most Americans have not done well.  Frank implies that we might want to rethink a society that thinks that America benefits from a company laying off 20,000 workers because their stock goes up as a result.  As Frank points out, consideration for workers and the masses has largely dropped out of the picture.  
<br />
<br />Frank chronicles the obsession with extreme capitalism that characterizes our society (and continues to do so even after the bubble collapse suffered in 2001), and the vast array of prophets that harkens not its desirability (in fact, no one even thinks to argue that the hyper capitalism that has gripped our society is a good thing; they merely assume this as a given) but to its inevitability.  Frank finds all this more than a little nutty and the obvious point of the book is to make us all stand back a bit and reconsider whether this turbo capitalism will truly result in a kind of world that we truly want.
<br />
<br />Frank brings a number of strengths to the table in this book.  First, he is a fine historian, with a much deeper grasp of trends and developments in American history than is needed for this study.  Second, he is a fabulous writer.  He isn't quite as funny as a comic such as Al Franken, but he is the equal of a Molly Ivins.  So, in addition to being incredibly informative and to being crucial in making us rethink our national goals, it is also a pleasure to read.
<br />
<br />I'll close with a personal anecdote.  As I was reading this book (which I interrupted to read his more recent and equally superb book, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS?), I mentioned to some friends over Thai food that I was reading a great book by Thomas Frank.  One of my friends remarked, "Oh, I had a friend at the U of C who had a brother named Tom Frank.  They roomed together and threw some really great parties.  He edits THE BAFFLER now."  Well, the author of this book is the founder, of course, of THE BAFFLER, and I find it somehow comforting that such a pertinent and morally powerful book was written by someone who knows how to party.</span>

<br />
<br />If you have an interest in advertising, marketing and or American sociology within the modern "consumer" context, this book is for you. Further, regardless of your political/ideological leanings, if you are intelligent and prize facts regardless of how they make you feel (assuming you have an interest in the subject area of the book), you will appreciate this book.

                    <span>This thoughtful, well researched, highly praised, and cogently written book was published three years ago, so why all the recent vitriol from negative reviewers? In fact, these harshly negative reviewers are *really* annoyed at the favorable response to the author's new book (see the just-published WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS?). And in their zeal to trash the author and his useful discussion of how conservative voters have ceded their own true economic interests to calculated -- but essentially dead-end -- appeals to conservative values, these frustrated rightwing critics have extended their campaign to all things Tom Frank-related. If they actually read any of Frank's books, they might find much in his work that is sympathetic and fair-minded. Unfortunately, they have yielded to the right-wing preference for shrillness and black and white thinking over  nuanced argument and real debate (but alas, that's what's the matter with liberals). Ignore the bombast and read this book -- and decide for yourself.</span>
