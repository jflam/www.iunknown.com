<h3 class="title">Merry Christmas to me ...</h3>

<p><P>You knew it had to happen someday, and it did last night. Since Carolyn's a school teacher, I was able to get the teacher discount from Apple (it's not much - maybe 5% but hey, it's better than nothing). This is a picture of what I ordered:</P><br />
<P><SPAN><br />
<TABLE align=center><br />
<CAPTION align=bottom><br />
<TBODY><br />
<TR><br />
<TD><br />
<CENTER><IMG height=180 alt=[Image] hspace=4 src="Images/beautyshotpwrbookg4.png" width=250 border=0 cd:pos="6"></CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></SPAN>Now for the (abridged) geek specs:<br />
<UL><br />
<LI>G4 867MHz<br />
<LI>512MB<br />
<LI>60GB disk<br />
<LI>DVD/CD-RW drive<br />
<LI>Airport card<br />
<LI>2nd battery</LI></UL><br />
<P>I couldn't justify the extra money for the 1GHz G4 and the Superdrive, but I did spring for the bigger hard disk, since that is almost always what I run out of first on a computer - my Thinkpad T23's 48GB disk has more than 40GB of stuff on it already.</P><br />
<P>Here's <A href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">a link to the PowerBook site at Apple</A>&nbsp;for more details.</P><br />
<P>Hopefully it will arrive in time for Christmas!</P></p>

<p>Very sexy. But are you going to be able to get used to a single-button mouse ? </p>

<p>Actually, you can use a Microsoft Intellimouse with OS X. Most of the Apple apps don't use the right mouse button, but all MS apps do (like IE and Office X).<br />
The downside is that there isn't a right mouse button on the Powerbook itself. I'll have to get use to the OPTION(?) click pattern for activating a context menu.</p>

<p>No. I thought the 1 year warranty would do. Should I have?</p>

<p>John, first of all congratulations, It is a very sexy machine! I am very looking forward to hear your future experiences with the powerbook. Especially how you productive you will be on the mac compared to your windows boxes<br />
About a year and a half ago I bought the 450 MHz version. I had the excuse that I needed a Unix machine that was non-Intel. There will be moments when I pick it up and will just love it again, but frequently it will not last longer than an evening before I get frustrated again. Whether it is the networking, the server access, the apps, I never seem to get the same productivity level as on XP, even though I used to be a Unix guru. And in the end my Thinkpad wins once more. <br />
I am curious to see whether it is something personal or if others have the same experiences.<br />
BTW For all the praise Apple is getting for their hardware, wouldn't you have expected some more video ram and a higher resolution display?</p>

<p>Let me correct myself, your machine has much better video processor than mine and a heck of a lot more video ram (32 MB ddr). I didn't look at the specs.<br />
Cheers,</p>

AppleCare:  I don't know if you should have, I was just curious.  I am planning on buying an ibook, but I don't think I will go with the AppleCare either.</p>

<p>Thanks, Werner. I'm going to hang out over the holiday's with my friend who's the product manager for ATI's All-In-Wonder RADEON card. I'm going to see whether he can point me to the right guy at ATI who would know just how much more effective the Mobility RADEON 9000 card is at accelerating 2D graphics. It's almost impossible to find benchmarks for 2D graphics these days, especially in the PC world where everyone's obsessed with gaming performance.</p>
