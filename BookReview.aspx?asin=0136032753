                    <span>The first line of the preface should tell you everything you need to know about this book: "Start Your Own Coffee and Tea Store is the result of many hours of in-depth research into the mail order industry."
<br />
<br />Uhh... okay. You'll quickly discover that this is a generic book tweaked just a bit for the coffee business. You'll find anecdotes about carpenters, wildly varying numbers about the profitability of this business, and such sage advice as, "Although it is still possible to rent telephones through certain telephone companies, the best bet is to buy your own. They are inexpensive, come in a variety of styles and colors, and are generally covered by a warranty."
<br />
<br />The information in here is dated (1994) and, given the inconsistencies of dollar figures from chapter to chapter, I have no idea if it was ever accurate. Despite the listing in Amazon.com, nobody had the courage to even sign their name to this book -- there's no author listed anywhere, neither on the cover nor anywhere inside.
<br />
<br />I'm planning to return this book, if I can. Given that there were some marks  in it when I purchased it, I'm pretty sure someone else had bought and returned it before me.</span>

                    <span>This book was good in the general starting a business vein. However, it really does not deal in real depth with the actual coffee/tea business.  A bit of a disappointment.</span>

                    <span>I was sent this book through a library loan.  I wish I would have received this book earlier in my adventure.  It was a great resource for beginning information regarding a coffee shop.  I will go out a get a copy for myself for reference.  I highly recommend this book for any person thinking of beginning a coffee business.</span>

                    <span>The publisher took a generic book on small businesses, threw in the odd coffee & tea reference, slapped on a cover with a coffee cup and viola! a new marketing niche...  No specific tea information is included at all. Even the standard business info is done better in other books- save your money and buy one of those.</span>
