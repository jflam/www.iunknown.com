                <span id="Label1">With its concise explanations, accurate procedures, and excellent index, <I>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant</I> reminds you how to perform common and moderately obscure Windows NT tasks. It won't teach you how to administer Windows NT if you're starting from zero, but it's superior in its ability to refresh a knowledgeable technician's memory. If you know what you need to find--for example, the command for converting a FAT (file allocation table) volume to NTFS (NT file system)--you'll be able to locate it quickly in this book. <p> This pocket guide is the next best thing to having memorized every procedural detail of users, security, file systems, and networking. It makes an excellent review guide for the Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 exam (70-067). In fact, it's better than many books designed specifically for that purpose.<p> Microsoft Press put some thought into the physical design of this book and the others in its series. It's compact and has plastic-coated covers, but the binding won't lie flat--you'll have to use weights or clips to keep it open to a particular page while you use both hands on the keyboard. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>While it may not actually fit in your pocket, what this book does very well in put information in bite-size chunks. It is short and too the point, instead of the usual 20 pages of fluff that one has to read through to find the info they need. This is book is a definite must.</span>

                    <span>Contains nothing but useful information, yet covers everything. If you have at least some previous knowledge and understanding of NT 4.0 this book is an excellent resource. It deals with topics from drive array configuration and TCP/IP considerations to Managing Users and Groups. Everything is laid out and explained in a concise, to the point, easy to read format. Read it cover to cover for an overview/review of NT 4.0 or keep it with you as a reference tool.</span>

                    <span>This Windows NT Server 4.0 Administrators Pocket Consultant has been a constant companion and has never let me down. For beginners and intermediate LAN Administrators, this book covers 4 main areas: LAN Administration Fundamentals, User Administration, Data Administration and Network Administration. In the era of Windows 2000 Server and XP, this book seems a little anachronistic, outdated and obsolete &#8211; its not.<P>With the wide user base of both Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation, it is a most valuable resource. Aimed at high-level users, this book will not be your guide to Kernel and file level troubleshooting &#8211; it is not an MCSE reviewer. It will give you a broad overview of networking and will deal extensively with users and resources. I give it five stars for its logical progression. After dealing with why you even need a network, the Pocket Consultant focuses on User Administration and the relation to the Data/Resources. NT is robust not because it crashes less but &#8220;sharing&#8221; is a really easy method to get users to what they need and fast.<P>Depending on the configuration of you shop &#8211; if you have a high turnover, the printing and network optimization comes in handy. If you have a fairly static staff, the user administration is helpful for user management &#8211; as individuals and as &#8216;groups&#8217;. I found the information on Chapter 10 &#8211; sharing files, directories and drives &#8211; helpful to understand the key differences between the two. Moreover, there was a few key things that I felt this book missed &#8211; the power of the Administrator to manage user machines as the Administrator of the Workstation. Within this framework lies the power of the NT network &#8211; a much missed topic in this book. Notwithstanding, I still give handbook a true five stars.</span>

                    <span>I read the wonderful reviews this book got and ran to the store to buy it. I run a small school district network and had several real world issue's I was looking for resolution to before purchasing it . . . this book did not help with one.<P>This might be an OK book to learn the basics (thus the 2 stars), but it has no troubleshooting tips or advanced network issues that gave me any real world help.<P>Several hours, 3 NT4 books and 2 cell phone calls from my wife asking where I was later, I left with the Windows NT4 Administrators Survival Guide.<P>These other reviews must have been written by the authors relatives!</span>
