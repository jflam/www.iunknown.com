                    <span>I own a pretty sucessful bar in Santa Barbara California and decided last year to give the restaurant biz a shot.  I know I know, but I was drunk. <p>Anyway, before I could back out, the lease was signed, big pieces were moving...I was pretty freaked.<p>I decided to learn all I could about the biz.  From Management, to Design I ordered a blizzard of books on those and other subjects.  <p>In the design genre I was very disappointed with this book.  I (like some other reviewers here) found the interiors to look dated and generally "uncool".  That is very much a matter of opinion, but really, the best teacher for me in design was to simply cruise around and put my head in a bunch of restaurants.  <p>I good book (just outside the design genre) that takes design into consideration (more from a functional standpoint) is a book called "Restaurants That Work: Case Studies of the Best in the Industry".  I recommend that one highly.<p>Good luck.<p>Christian Hunter<br>Owner - Sevilla Restaurant, Santa Barbara California</span>

                    <span>I would not recommend this book to anyone who is seriously looking into the finer points of restaurant design.  Many of the chosen establishments have a very dated look to them, the photography is not up to par (so its not even good enough for the coffee table) and overall this book is a big snore.  I am disappointed enough  to return it, which I will be doing today.  Definitely not worth the price.  For a better read, try Restaurants That Work, by Martin E. Dorf.</span>

                    <span>I truly enjoyed the pictorial nature of this book. The descriptive text is also written in a visual style. I would have liked to read more about the concept inspirations and possibly some costs and expense of the designs. i have visited some of these wonderful spaces and would also liked to have addresses to visit more "Bars, Pubs and Cafes" during my travels.</span>

                    <span>As an architect who has considerable experience with designing Bars, Hotels, & similar hospitality spaces, I applaud Julie Taylor's overall creative vision. This publication's attention to detail, descriptive  project narratives, and beautiful photography will satisfy the most  critical designer; at the same time acting as a wonderful conversation  piece for any casual reader. It's simply a beautiful book to look at! I  reccommend this book as a great resource to architects & designers  looking for inspiration; as well as anyone who appreciates interesting  spaces, as opposed to the same old drabby places Americans have become  accustomed to!</span>
