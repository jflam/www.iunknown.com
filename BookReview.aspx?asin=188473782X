                    <span>I bought this book with the hope to find the 'perfect' plan for every competition need. Actually you can choose among some plans but you must be lucky to find those appropriate for you. It does not provide a way to build your custom plan. If a personalized training plan is your primary need (... as it should), it's better to rely on books as Friel's Triathlon Training Bible.</span>

                    <span>WOW -- I am new to tri and looked and looked for just the right book and found in it everything that I was looking for. <p>This is a great instructional book that includes step-by-step training plans to prepare you for triathlons that range from your first sprint tri to improving your times to preparing you for an Ironman. No guessing involved, just follow the plan. Plans range from 6 weeks all the way up to a challenging 52 weeks; therefore, triathletes of all levels can benefit from this book.<p>Includes specifics on nutrition, weight training, individual swim, run and cycle workouts based in periodization. (Periodization, in my opinion is the training secret to improving performance in all sports.)</span>

                    <span>If you're interested in learning the training procedures for a triathlon, look no more.  The book is great for amateur or elite advice.  There are quiet a few books out there on the sport, but this one beats all i have read. She gives very easy to read workout plans up until race day...  Simply put- This book is a has a wealth of knowledge to anyone wanting advice on "Tri-ing"</span>
