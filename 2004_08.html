<h3 class="title">Security thoughts</h3>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robert_hensing/">Robert Hensing</a> works on the <span class="caps">PSS </span>Security team at Microsoft. He has just started blogging, and has some excellent thoughts on his blog based on his observations as a member of the Security Incident Response team at <span class="caps">PSS. </span>He has blogged about the effectiveness of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robert_hensing/archive/2004/07/28/199610.aspx">pass phrases in lieu of passwords</a> as well as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robert_hensing/archive/2004/08/09/211383.aspx">identifying different hacker personas</a>. </p>

<p>His advanced hacker persona category linked to <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3706599/">this article on <span class="caps">MSNBC</span></a> that interviews a hacker who's a member of an organized crime team in Russia. It's interesting to note that the hacker was still doing remote attacks against Western corporations. </p>

<p>One scenario that has me particularly worried is planting a rogue administrator inside of one of those Western corporations. That rogue administrator could compromise systems by installing a particularly nasty variant of a rootkit- one that hides in the Flash <span class="caps">BIOS</span> of various hardware cards installed in servers. By the time the crime had been committed, the rogue admin would be long gone. It's a simple low-tech attack that one could easily imagine a member of a foreign intelligence service carrying out. It's a scary world out there.</p>

<h3 class="title">Infrastructure Stories Part 2</h3>

<p>After some helpful folks commented on my poor choice of a <span class="caps">RAID0</span> solution on my desktop computer (which is now semi-decommissioned) I decided to rebuild my server with a more robust drive array. I went out and purchased a <a href="http://www.promise.com/product/product_detail_eng.asp?productId=112&amp;familyId=2">Promise <span class="caps">SX4 RAID 5 SATA</span> controller</a> and 4 160GB Seagate <span class="caps">SATA</span> drives. As expected, 4 7200rpm drives are quite noisy, but thankfully the server is now located in my basement (more on this later). </p>

<p>I'm thinking about adding four <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/pro_details_cooling.php?ProdID=75011#">Antec <span class="caps">HDD</span> coolers</a> with built-in temperature gauges to my server because I have a store credit for an extra component that I no longer need. Now that would look just way too cool.</p>

<h3 class="title">Infrastructure Stories Part 1</h3>

<p>I've been a big fan of <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/">SpamBayes</a> for some time now. Until recently, I've had a desktop computer running Outlook constantly so that SpamBayes can filter the incoming email off of my Exchange Server. </p>

<p>In the process of building some new infrastructure (more on this later) I've decided to consolidate servers. So I now have Outlook installed on my Exchange Server, and I use a disconnected <span class="caps">RDP</span> session to run Outlook and the Outlook SpamBayes plug-in. Works like a charm, and I have one less computer consuming power in my house.</p>
