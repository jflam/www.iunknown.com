                    <span>I bought this book over 10 years ago and it moves me every time I read it!  It is a beautiful collection of poetry that is infinitely enlightening.  <p>It's hard to have a favorite poem in this book, because they are all encompassing.  And depending upon the time(s) in your life that you read this book, at least one poem will have a special meaning for you, and then the next time, another will have more meaning than the last.<p>This book also enlightens the reader to many religions, over thousands of years, BC and AD, and it shows that no matter what religion or in what time period, although separate religions, they are "One", with many aliases.<p>This book will truly enlighten you, at one time or another, and in one way or another!  It is a wonderful book for anyone!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after reading about it in my yoga magazine thinking I could really use a good book of poems to ponder and this book is terrific.  The poems really will quiet your mind.  I love that such a wide array of authors are represented - from Rumi to Dogen to Emily Dickenson to Walt Whitman.  A great collection. Glad I bought it.</span>

                    <span>One of the most inspiring collections or sacred poetry ever compiled. The translations are perfect. The sensual/spiritual quality of the words can transport you into altered states. Beautiful. Al Link - 4 Freedoms Tantra</span>

                    <span>Much like Mitchell's Tao Te Ching this selection of poerty from various spiritual traditions is a joy to read and a nice tool for reflection and meditation.  Zazen On The Mountain by Li Po has become my favorite poem and this work has been helpful to me in many ways.  The Enlightened Heart is a lovely book and a great companion to his Tao Te Ching.  Thumbs up for Mitchell's work as editor.</span>

                    <span>Elegantly, Stephen Mitchell has compiled sublime poetry from the world's sacred traditions in this inspiring collection.  In a single reading one can experience the lyrical wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita,  paradoxical  precision of Chuang-Tzu, enthusiasm of Gerard Manley Hopkins, and the  sensuality of Rumi and the Song of Solomon.  When poets of the sacred  explore the divine, whether as a part of a religious tradition or apart  from religious tradition, all rises and all converges.  Beauty reigns.   This collection invites one to hold the whole world of the sacred in one's  hands and savor the mystical beauty of poetry and divinity.</span>
