                <span id="Label1">In fiction, the spy is a glamorous figure whose secrets make or break peace, but, historically, has intelligence really been a vital step to military victories? In this breakthrough study, the preeminent war historian John Keegan goes to the heart of a series of important conflicts to develop a powerful argument about military intelligence. <br><br>In his characteristically wry and perceptive prose, Keegan offers us nothing short of a new history of war through the prism of intelligence. He brings to life the split-second decisions that went into waging war before the benefit of aerial surveillance and electronic communications. The English admiral Horatio Nelson was hot on the heels of Napoleon&#8217;s fleet in the Mediterranean and never knew it, while Stonewall Jackson was able to compensate for the Confederacy&#8217;s disadvantage in firearms and manpower with detailed maps of the Appalachians. In the past century, espionage and decryption have changed the face of battle: the Japanese surprise attack at the Battle of the Midway was thwarted by an early warning. Timely information, however, is only the beginning of the surprising and disturbing aspects of decisions that are made in war, where brute force is often more critical.<br><br><i>Intelligence in War</i> is a thought-provoking work that ranks among John Keegan&#8217;s finest achievements.</span>

                    <span>With "Intelligence in War: Knowledge of the Enemy from Napoleon to al-Qaeda" John Keegan steps into the dark and mysterious world of military intelligence. Keegan attempts to discern the level of importance that intelligence operations have on the outcome of battle. Keegan's final assessment appears to be: not much.<P>Keegan uses seven case studies from history to back up his point. In each case, intelligence played a major preliminary role to the battle but offered little to know help during the course of it.<P>This certainly fits with Keegan's assessment that battles are won on the field not in the intelligence lair. Keegan seems to believe that our fascination with covert operations has more to do with popular literature than with real world experiences.<P>While I mostly agree with Keegan's findings, I do not agree with the structure of his book. Using case studies is fine when discussing a topic that is viewed almost entirely one way; but, using them for such a controversial topic as this is not a good way to do it. An equally skilled historian could very well pick seven different historical episodes and prove his point that intelligence networks are as important to winning as fighting is.<P>The weakness of the case study method aside though, each case that Keegan has selected for his book is an interesting historical story in its own right. There in lies the contradiction of "Intelligence in War". Keegan's chosen method of proving his point is fundamentally flawed; however, he imbues each case study with enough life to make them readable on their own merits.<P>But, since this is a book that is supposed to prove the overemphasis that intelligence activities have been given over the years, I have to say that "Intelligence in War" is a less than average book.</span>

                    <span>This history is well timed in the sense that it appeared at a time when certain people were attempting to spread a myth that the United States should have been able to avoid the tragedy of 9/11. Keegan, a military historian of the first tier, examines the full scope of military intelligence and its ramifications.<P> He convincingly demonstrates that accurate intelligence has almost always been unavailable - and even in the few instances it was available, its impact has not been the decisive element.<P> Keegan examine Lord Nelson's 73 day quest for the French fleet, relying upon merchants, captured sailors, ambassadors and just about everyone else for information. In the end, it was Nelson's experience and intuition that brought his fleet to battle with the French.<P> Perhaps his most telling example concerns the Battle of Midway. The Americans had exceptional intelligence and yet, as Keegan shows, the American victory resolved itself to four minutes of good fortune. So it goes in war.<P> Yes, some governments spend millions and billions on gathering intelligence. No, it is very rare for that intelligence gathering process to produce sucessful results as a norm. War is a business where secrets are not given up easily and are difficult to ferret out.<P> Keegan maintains that in the end, intelligence isn't a handmaiden to victory in battle, but perhaps a cousin once removed.<P>Jerry</span>

                    <span>Keegan was once regarded as the top of the military history profession. In the last several years, however, his star has begun to fall.<P>Intelligence, as other reviewers have pointed out, is a difficult concept to write a concise history of. Keegan makes the attempt, and the result is an average book, repetitive and lacking in a definate thesis.<P>In essence, all Keegan proves with his research is that the commanders of any given battle play far more of a role than any intelligence they receive. Their use of the infomation gathered means more than anything else. Yet Keegan never admits that, through the entire tome. Instead, at the beginning of a conclusion which drones on and on about topics never touched in the rest of the book, he states that force, not intelligence, always wins war.<P>Furthermore, the author overuses naval examples. One would think that ninty percent of the entire history of warfare was fought at sea. Also, utilizing three battles from the Second World War, and then lumping all post-WWII into one chapter seems a bit on the cheap side. Too much extra info to research? We have come to expect more from someone as world reknown as Keegan.<P>Keegan's writing is also slightly transparent throughout the book. Some phrasing is jumbled and the repetition wracks the nerves. Certainly not his finest work. Keegan remains better than most, but this would not be a book I would recomend to many folks.</span>

                    <span>John Keegan's mastery of the material is obvious. However, he picked an amorphous topic: whether Military Intelligence "helps". Keegan uses historical vignettes through the ages to prove his point, that Military Intelligence is usually not decisive.<P>However, the question seems poorly formed. Military Intelligence means different things in different epochs, and in different situations in the same timeframe. Also, the manner in which it may or may not be decisive is also situation specific. Worse, not all of Keegan's historical vignettes prove his point. <P>The result is a book full of interesting tales, but lacking clear synthesis. This great historian's talent and our time are wasted on a poorly formed topic.</span>

                    <span>John Keegan is an amazing writer who makes history accessible and fun to read. He uses careful and exacting research then creates a living world of history into which a reader is thrust. There is no argument in me that this is a fine read. However, as has been pointed out, the case study system makes a great book but a very weak argument. Keegan would have us believe that Intelligence in War has little impact on the actual outcome of the battle, whether it be plethora or dearth. I had a bit of trouble believing that.<P>Now if that was all of my review, everyone could just tell me to bug off. But I wish to explain exactly why I had trouble with Keegan's argument. As of right now I am a college student studying Military History. So I know my field pretty well. I can think of a few case studies where Keegan would be proved wrong...Case in point! The use of the Navajos language as a code by the American forces in the Pacific Theater gave us a distinct strategic and tactical advantage over our enemy, translating directly into lowered casualties and surprise (I think...I am after all a student still and absolute sentences like this are bad bad bad...). While Keegan would point out that armed force was still required to complete objectives, this event was an intelligence coup of some proportion and should not be ignored. I would also have liked to see an explanation of how Cold War Intelligence, especially that collected by nuclear subs, could be explained as being useless.<P>Keegan could not have included all of this...so its basically silly for me to demand it. But when a writer makes a thesis, he or she should be careful about how certain they are. I think Keegan would have benefited from someone giving him a counter argument, even if it would have weakened his argument...<P>But I have a thesis of my own. I make it for all of Keegans books, although I have only read two, this one and The Face of Battle. Keegan's supposedly faulty arguments aside, read these books for the amazing descriptions and analysis of war...you will not be sorry.</span>
