                    <span>The stories in Daughters & Mothers are heart-warming, thoughtful, inspirational and educational. And, the photographs are amazing, too! This book was given to me as a gift, and I have enjoyed reading the stories time  and again.<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It's a great gift to  give!<p>P.S. Check out Girlfriends, also by Jayne Wexler and Lauren Cowen.  It's even better!</span>
