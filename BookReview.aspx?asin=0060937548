                    <span> I bought this book as part of a life-long fascination with motorcycles and the culture that surrounds them. What I got was a treat for the first few times I read it, but as the fun wore off, the reality was glaring through.
<br />
<br />  This is a fun read. It's well written and doesn't drag on in areas like other autobiographies/biographies. It covers a lot of the more well known Hell's Angels fiascos (Altamont, the Monterrey rape trial, etc). And it does show that a life of crime does not come without reprocussions. 
<br />
<br /> That said, it's self-serving for Barger and as the book wears on, his egomania gets annoying. I would never say this to his face though, as I don't benchpress his reported 290 pounds, nor am I surrounded by biker buddies who lack self-restraint. 
<br />
<br /> Of the more interesting notes in the book are his opinions of Harley-Davidsons. Apparently he only rides them because that's what is expected of a Hell's Angel. He goes into detail about the superiority of Hondas and Triumphs. Odd from the poster child for the Harley rebel culture.
<br />
<br /> My advice is to check out the book from the local library. If you really like it, then buy it. But, take it from a guy who read the darn thing about 50 times (it was a good book for the bathroom): the fun is short lived.</span>

                    <span>This book was absolutely fascinating.  On one page, you think Sonny is total derelict who deserves to rot in jail.  On the next page, you're cheering for him (especially after he knocked heads with the wimpy Vietnam War protesters).  For that reason, it's a fascinating book to read - it really brings out the rebel side in most Americans - most of us wish at some point we could just quit our jobs and ride the open roads.  Most of us have a little Sonny in us.  
<br />
<br />But, there are a few nagging questions that need answered:
<br />
<br />- Whatever happened to Sonny's marriage to Sharon?  Maybe I missed that in the book.  Looks like at the end he was married to a woman named Noel.  
<br />
<br />- What did he or any of these guys do for a living to create income?  Was being in the HAMC their "full-time job?"  Did they just sell drugs for income?
<br />
<br />A great book, though.  I recommend it for good reading while on vacation.  Easy to read, but fascinating.  </span>

                    <span>Sonny Barger is one of my heroes, not because of what he believes, but rather because he believes. This book portrays a deeply principled man. We may not hold the same principles, but his aren't that different from ours. The important thing is that the man reflected in these pages holds principles, which is more than many people leading less colorful lives can say.</span>

                    <span>if you think that raping girls, selling adultered drugs (very, very) to addicts and others idiots things like that are "cool" then you will love this book... This bad bad bad guy only dream to drive a Honda or a BMW...what a stupid outlaw!
<br />Yes even in France we have this kind of idiots, but they don't write...Oufff!

                    <span>my father was, thankfully to my "general" public image he was descretely excluded from any incidental mention here-in. There were many then, and now who's automony is important. However, much to my father's chagrin and deep seeded attempts to veil his "sorrid" past, I, having been out cast from home by mother at 12 yrs. old I fell in with the most wild and wildly unlikely honorable bunch, The HA, red&white, 1%. They, not knowing my lineage took me in, raised/protected/trained me. These Vets, warrior-poets taught me more about the Code: respect, honor, dignity, loyalty basically the true meaning of " Semper Fidelis" . the abreviated version of USMCorp. Always Faithful, do or die {in latin; to death}. I am now over 30, single/childless yet find myself teaching the local teens these  codes & ethics with no Direct affiliation to HA. regardless of my predecessors misdeeds, their honorable code will live on, keeping many youths from following dangerous paths of their parents...(grandparents). They'll know the code, or else be wiser-enough not to get caught. Thanks "Uncles" Sonny, Preacher, and in memorandom of Animal, Died 2004, rip, see ya around the bend, I'll spot yer tail lights and feel the pipes roar..</span>
