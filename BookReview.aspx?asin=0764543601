                <span id="Label1">Digital cameras for still pictures have become pretty commonplace, but digital video remains less widely adopted. This must be purely because of equipment cost, because everyone with a recent-model personal computer has access to excellent editing software, and has all the required data ports. <I>PC Magazine Guide to Digital Video</I> shows how to capture, edit, and publish digital movies with the tools available for the Microsoft Windows operating system. This is a fairly comprehensive guide meant for someone who's never had training in videography, doesn't really know about the multimedia file formats Windows uses, and doesn't want to invest a lot of money in professional-grade software for editing and publishing. It's all you need to take some digital home movies, edit them so they're not too boring, and burn them to DVD for distribution to the remote parts of the family.<p>  Jan Olzer explains how to shoot video properly in the first place, offering advice on lighting, composition, and action. Then, focusing on Windows Movie Maker and (to a lesser degree) Pinnacle Studio, he walks the reader through techniques for chopping up the raw footage, disposing of the dull parts, and reassembling the rest into a coherent storyline. Titling and other production techniques get attention, too. His style is highly example driven, and easy to follow. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to capture, edit, and publish (to DVD) home videos and amateur movies. There's coverage of composition, lighting, and sound for when you're filming, and explanations of how to use popular editing suites when you're back home assembling a final product.</span>

                    <span>It would be nearly an impossible task to assemble a coherent book that would duplicate the experience of browsing through multiple subscriptions of magazines, surfing countless forums and websites, attending seminars, testing equipment, and years of actual experience in the field. Even if this was possible, could it be organized well and made understandable to the average consumer? Well, PC Magazine's Jan Ozer has done it!<BR>I did an enormous amount of research before I invested in DV equipment, and I still wish I had purchased this book beforehand. Although I ended up with some great gear, I'll never get all those hours back that I spent gathering my knowledge online. You really can't beat a well-written book. Even if I found similar info online and magazines, it probably would never be collected in a way that I could reference as easy as a book. Consulting this book will arm you with the knowledge you need to make intelligent equipment purchases with far less research time. This book is pretty much a one-stop-shop for almost any consumer budget.<BR>Once you have all your gear, the book really shines when it comes to explaining what to do with it: <BR>*** Clear comparisons are made between all the major consumer editing software packages, while helping the reader understand when it's time to move up to the professional ones for advanced features. <BR>*** Computer hardware and video transfer techniques are demystified<BR>*** Best practices and techniques for lighting, composition and editing are covered. <BR>*** An essential guide to read before you get into DV, and invaluable as a reference guide for your journey as a movie-maker.</span>

                    <span>1. This book covers basic, though fairly advanced digital video topics. The progression of the book is smooth, and easily followed. The author does not assume the reader is a 'dummy', yet he does not frustrate us with overly-technical prose. He explains digital video with plenty of hands-on applications to get you up and running quickly. <P>2. This book also cuts though the marketing hype associated with digital video products. The author frequently provides a product comparison matrix to help you decide what product or feature set will work for your situation. <P>3. Reading this book beats standing in front of a retail rack of product boxes, with wildly varying prices, claims and features. Now, you can shop with confidence because you'll know exactly what to look for, and why. <P>4.The chapter on the Basics of Shooting should be required reading for any new parent - just knowing how to frame my shots and manage camera motion has improved my videos immensely... and you can ask my wife!</span>

                    <span>This book covered all the bases and left no stone unturned. Its kind of funny, as I was reading it, I realized how much time this book would have saved me if I had it just one month earlier. All the countless hours I spent on the web (consumer reports, pcmag.com, etc) doing the research on the proper gear and the must haves to go along with it. This book answered all my questions and a lot more that I had never even thought of. One of the interesting things that I can think of off hand was the audio setting during recording. After reading the manual that came with my camera, it suggested that I left audio setting at 12bit. They claimed that this would allow room for more audio tracks. After reading this book, I realized that most of us aren't going to feed an extra audio track into our cameras, we will more than likely do it post recording in pinnacle or other editing software. So I switched to 16bit and it will stay there. Also another misconception that was pointed out was recording in 16x9. Most of us think that 16x9 will capture more video, when in fact this is true for professional movie makers with cameras most of us cant afford, but not so for just regular consumers. The fact is 16x9 captures less video, then the standard 4x3. This is great book for those considering home video and those well established in the home video arena. I highly recommend this book to those in seek of answers to everything video.</span>

                    <span>Old in years but youthful (senile?) in interests and outlook, a few months ago I decided to move on and convert the travel videos that have accumulated over the years from places as exotic as Xian, China to down-to-earth as the Grand Canyon, most being throughout continental Europe and the U.K. There are 72 two hour VHS analog tapes and fifteen one hour tapes. An embryonic bunch of DVDs, right?<P>With, principally, the logic of a dart thrower I opted for Pinnacle's MovieBox USB to do the "capture" and conversion from analog to digital and their Studio 8 editing software. It was one of my better decisions, for I quickly found my way from the pedestrian manual accompanying the products to Amazon and the book "Visual QuickStart Guide to Studio8," where I learned more than I dared hope for and which is an earlier work of Jan Ozer, author of the subject of this review: "Guide to Digital Video." <P>However, had I found this "Guide..." I'd probably be in even better shape, for my decisions would have been based on logic, solid information and fact rather than gut-feel and cross-the-fingers intuition and the learning curve would have been a ski jump rather than the emulation of a water-bug's skitters from hither to yon. I've not found the book's weaknesses; its strengths are: <BR>1.For anyone at any stage in videography, from the tyro to the near-pro. <BR>2.Specifics and recommendations for fine-tuning your system for movie-making.. <BR>3.Comparative data and hardware and software products that have track records for use in producing video movies. Brands, model numbers, pros and cons covered. <BR>4.A reference book that can be picked up at any time to refresh a point or to review the details at any stage in the process. <BR>5.Last but as significant as the foregoing: Ozer has not only a broad knowledge of the subject but a command of the language to impart it. In a word, he writes with flair. <BR>6.Buy it!</span>
