                <span id="Label1"> The new edition of this best-selling book provides a comprehensive discussion of software  engineering techniques and shows how they can be applied in practical software projects. This book features new coverage of the software process and software process technology, system integration, requirements management, and risk analysis, as well as new chapters on pattern-based reuse, distributed system engineering, and legacy systems. Sommerville has incorporated a more object-oriented approach in this edition&#151;using UML and Java&#151;and has removed much of the material on CASE, formal methods, and Ada, making the book more in tune with current technology and practice. A new discussion of professional ethics in the introduction helps to make readers aware of the responsibilities that come with engineering software.  The sixth edition uses Java for all programming examples, and bases all design examples on UML notation. It includes new chapters on pattern-based reuse, distributed system engineering, and legacy systems, as well as new coverage of the software process and software process technology, system integration, requirements management, and risk analysis.  This book is designed for readers needing a general introduction to software engineering (development, management, and evolution), especially with regard to system requirements engineering and critical systems.</span>

                    <span>I used this book for an introductory course on software engineering.  Although the book gives an expansive view of the field, there isn't enough detail or in-depth examples to make it anything more than an academic treatise.  I don't feel that I could use much of what I've learned in an actual project - I would have to resort to more specific references.  <p>Now, the premise of having an entire book on software engineering may be more to blame than the clarity or presentation of the material.  But software engineering is a practical field, and a software engineering text that doesn't provide practical information isn't useful.  For this reason, I cannot give the book a passing grade.</span>

                    <span>This book tries to cover way too much information in such a small space leaving topics overly vague and generic.<p>Further, the author does not use American English, which is fine - when you don't attend an American university.  Words such a "modelling" and general sentence structure makes the text distracting and confusing in ways it shouldn't be.  If I am going to have trouble reading it, let it be the material and now how the material is presented.<p>If the book isn't forced upon you by a university, you should consider a different software engineering book if you want details.<p>Of course, I won't even go into my professor who is using this book - yikes.</span>

                    <span>I used this book in a 400 level college course on software engineering, and found it to be exceedingly shallow in its coverage of the topic. The work is a worthy attempt at providing a broad overview of the discipline. However, in my estimate it covers too much material in too little space and presents too few practical examples of the type that might be applicable to a "real-world" software project. Further the text only gives lip service to the wide array of tools now available. In all honesty I don't see how any one could give this book more than three starts (apologies to the other reviewers), especially considering that the book is now in its sixth edition. <p>I was at the used book store recently and had the good fortune of acquiring Stephen R. Schach's excellent book: "Software Engineering with Java." If you are a college professor looking for a course text, I would highly recommend taking a look at this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is an encyclopedic volume of knowledge about Software Engineering, and proceeds from the beginning of the process to the end, with tangents being in the last few chapters.  It has the feel of a textbook, with exercises and Key Points at the end of each chapter.<p>That said, it isn't very entertaining and if it hadn't been my course book, I would have chosen a different Software Engineering text.  This book is a great supplemental reference to get more detailed information.  I keep it on my shelf at work as a handy reference.</span>

                    <span>One expects one's textbooks to present material in a structured way. This book is all over the place. It is full of references to material "covered in the next section" or "I explain this later in the book". It is also full of incomplete sentences, spelling errors, and uncoordinated subjects and predicates. For failness' sake onó must admit that some useful information may be gleaned with some effort.</span>
