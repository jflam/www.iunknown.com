                <span id="Label1">Do you know what your doctor really thinks or how your doctor really feels about medicine and about you? The seeds lie in the critical first few years of a medical education, and Dr. Robert Marion, director of the Center for Congenital Disorders at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, draws from his own experiences as student, intern, and resident to provide some surprising -- and sobering -- answers.In the course of twenty gripping, illuminating, and extraordinarily candid stories, Dr. Marion reveals the dehumanizing, slightly insane, and often brutal process of medical training. You will experience not only the intense pressure and chronic exhaustion of the doctor-to-be, but also the price the patient must often pay. While each story stands alone as an adventure in medicine, taken together they are a call to change. With profound eloquence and compassion, Dr. Marion explores ways in which to assure that humanity and idealism survive the grueling and destructive path to technical competency.<br><br><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></span>

                    <span>The writings really poor, high school level, uses boring common words where something much more convincing can be used.  Tries to achieve an impactful effect, but the effort is noticeable and reveals the amateur writer trying to act sophisticated.  Compare this to Samuel Shems HOUSE OF GOD and this things garbage.  When Marion tries (1 or 2nd chapter) to talk about why interns become seemingly evil, Marion tries to convince you with , while SHEM really takes you in there so you get the feeling yourself &#62; real literature, something that Shem knows, and foreign to the doctors trying to act sophisticated and able to manuever in any part of the world... sorry but the literary are not convinced</span>

                    <span>There are only a few books that I enjoyed as much as this book. Dr. Marion is an amazing writer.  He manages to keep readers interested without being unrealistic. I recommand this book for anyone interested in becoming a doctor or even dating someone that is thinking of becoming one. The book explores the shortcoming of modern day medical training and the emotional stress that students go through in the process. A must read for pre-med students!</span>

                    <span>I'm going to keep it plain and simple.  This is one of the few excellent medical books that are avialable.  I have read many and I highly recommend this one.  I just wish I could forget everything I have read so that I could read it again for the first time.  I couldn't put the book down.  In case you are interested some other great books are "When the air hits your brain", and "first do no harm, reflections on becoming a neurosurgeon".  Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book! Dr. Marion is very honest about his experiences. The stories are sometimes disturbing and sad, but sometimes happy and they are well written. This book is much better than White Coat by Dr. Rothman because it is much more honest. When I read this book, I felt like I was right there with Dr. Marion.</span>

                    <span>This book was absolutely the best true to life book I have read about the medical journey.  I could not put it down.  Marion is honest about his medical experiences, and although it is dated it is one of the best books I  have ever read.  If you are interested in becoming a doctor, read this  first!</span>
