                <span id="Label1">Here, in this lavishly illustrated history of the Best Dressed List, is the story of how the list originated and grew into the world-famous event it is today. And, for the first time ever, fashion doyenne and Best Dressed List founder Ms. Lambert contributes her personal story on the subject. Founded in 1940, the Best Dressed List was her brilliant publicity ploy to boost the drooping American fashion industry at the outset of World War II. It quickly became a highly visible and respected barometer of style, a "who's who" of the most glamorous women in the world. Interestingly, the first lists were mostly wealthy society women who were famous for spending entire fortunes every year on haute couture, while movie stars were rarely named to it, as they were dressed by their studios. Today, the list has evolved into a highly coveted placement that includes every sort of public figure, from socialites and models to movie stars and politicians. Featuring four to six of the top women from each decade, this spectacular volume explores the personal style of such fashion icons as Babe Paley in the 40s; Grace Kelly and Diana Vreeland in the 50s; Jackie O. and Verushka in the 60s; Twiggy and Bianca Jagger in the 70s; Princess Di and Tina Chow in the 80s; Sharon Stone and the Miller sisters in the 90s; Chloe Sevigny and Nicole Kidman in the 21st century. The Best Dressed List will be reproduced in its entirety in the back of the book.</span>

                    <span>What a disappointment. Although when the back cover photo credit is wrong, you should know what to expect. An uninspired, cliched collection of frequently used photos and text. The publisher does a good job of choosing subjects that get lots of attention - I guess that eliminates the need to do any work editorially. If you are really interested in this subject, get the recent Vanity Fair article.</span>

                    <span>I say this because there could've been a lot more personal information about the lives and styles of the selected ladies (and a few more pictures of their outfits!), and there were much better pictures available of some of the ladies. There were missed opportunities to show better pictures of Wallis Warfield Simpson, C.Z. Guest, Nicole Kidman, Paltrow, Coco Chanel (there was a spectacular Cecil Beaton portrait of Chanel that was in the Vanity Fair issue--they should've printed it in this book), and the pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis were rather poor choices. This book reminded me a lot of "The Power of Style" (which I think is still available). I still liked it enough to purchase it because the book is very elegant and does contain some nice pictures. I just think it was a lost opportunity to really "lay on the style" by including MORE and BETTER pictures. I also didn't see much good in just printing the LIST of names of the ladies who've made the list--we have no idea of WHO or HOW these ladies looked! Why not at least a small picture of these ladies and their sartorial choices? Overall, a nice addition to a fashion lover's book collection, but I was a little disappointed by what COULD have been (yes, I keep repeating myself)...Don't forget to try to get "The Power of Style" (and "The Power of Glamour", which is about movie star style)--you would really like these books if you like Ultimate Style.</span>

                    <span>Amazingly beautiful book - fabulous pictures of the most stylish people - decade by decade. A great foreword by Eleanor Lambert - doyenne of the best dressed list! Love, love love this book - beautifully designed etc. Great for research, for browsing and for just dreaming over! Love the large format - this one's going on my coffee table for all to see! A classic book on classic style...better than Vanity Fair's crappy attempt recently to do their own best dressed list! Shame on them and kudos to Assouline for doing it right!</span>
