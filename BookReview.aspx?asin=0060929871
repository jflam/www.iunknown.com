                    <span>Brave New World, the title taken from the famous Shakespearian play, The Tempest, succeeds on a grand scale what so many other similar books have failed to do.  1984 was not as believable; Fahrenheit 451 was not as bold or daring.  Brave New World stands on its own plateau as the greatest, most imaginative and believable book ever written about mind control and the future.
<br />
<br /> It begins with a detailed and often confusing description of the world Huxley has created in the future.  People are divided into a caste system.  Identities are eroded away.  Life is made simple and easy.  People are free of pressure and pain, and left to themselves to indulge in pleasure.  Sex and drugs run rampant, but they are "controlled."  Everyone belongs to everyone else.  Emotions exist to a limit, love does not develop.  Stability and happiness are the substitutes for freedom and individuality.  Children are conditioned young to think and behave in the way society would want them to, according to the caste they were born into.  There is little crime, all seems perfect.....right?
<br />
<br />The second part of the novel takes us to a world called the "Reservation." This world exists outside of the civilized world.  This is our world as we know it.  John, a "savage" from the outside world is brought into the "Brave New World" by two people taking a vacation.  One of them is Bernard.  Bernard is an outcast and teeters on the edge of rebellion, but lacks the courage to take a strong stand.  He is on vacation with Lenina.  She is a typical beautiful woman from the "civilized" world.  She is sexually active, like all the people in the "civilized" world, and feels a strong attraction to this new outsider.
<br />
<br />Bernard and Lenina take John back to their civilized world where John is given the dubious title of "savage" and invokes curiosity and fame from the people living there.  The rest of the novel is an attempt for John to adapt to the new philosophy and ideas of this new world.  He never does.  He reverts back to his individual self and plummets tragically towards despair and pain.  He cannot cope with the "happiness and stability" of this new world of the future.  He longs for the "freedom and pain" he had in his old world (which is a direct parallel to our world, and the "new world" is a parallel to the world Huxley envisioned for the future)
<br />
<br />The single most brilliant aspect of Brave New World is how deeply it grasps us in its philosophy and vision.  Finally a book you can think on, think with, and think long after you are done reading it.  There are two contrasting views presented here.  It is difficult to decide which view we support.  Is it the safe, happy, "new world" views of no individuality, but safety and pleasure galore?  Or do we sympathize more with the "old world" views of freedom, pain, and individuality.  Before reading this book, I would have definitely leaned towards freedom and individuality, of course, but Huxley does one hell of a job describing the benefits of the other side as well. 
<br />
<br />The real choice, as Huxley intended, was for the reading to choose somewhere in the middle of the road.  There are positives and negatives to each societal view presented here.  The real truth is for us to decide.  The story is not preached at us, but rather is told is such a marvel of a way, it actually opens doors to for our mind to expand into the depths of our own selves and how we really view the world. This is stuff we don't think about enough, but we should.
<br />
<br />Another wonderful element Huxley uses is that of his main character, John.  He is not an outright hero by rebelling against this "new society."  He is an anti-hero, if you will.  He struggles with his own self doubt and inclination towards violent behavior.  It is all he knows, it is how he was raised.  In the end, he is overtaken with temptation, and abandons the morals he had previously fought so hard to protect.  Huxley exposes that we all have weakness and that no one is really a true hero.  John is one of the most complex characters in the history of fiction.  All the characters are beautiful and unique, and quite ironically, those who you would think to be the most ugly end up being the most likeable, and vice versa.
<br />
<br />I loved this book.   It doesn't settle for easy answers or easy solutions.  Huxley bravely attacks his material and does not let up the entire novel.  He has created a world like no other, a world that might not possibly be so unrealistic in the future if we don't watch ourselves.  This is a radiant and dazzling novel.  An intelligent and heartbreaking journey.  It is a Brave New World indeed.

                    <span>With its vivid description of everyday activities such as the "feelie" movies and classification of every human into one of five letter and color groups, Huxley's Brave New World is a fun read for young adults and teens.
<br />
<br />The Brave New World is a sort of Utopia, where humans are not born to mothers; they are bred in bottles and slowly travel by way of a huge conveyor belt through various machines during the gestational period. Those babies who will become astronauts spend a majority of time upside-down in the bottles, and those who will work in the jungles are submitted to a higher than normal temperature throughout the process. The embryos which are destined to be in one of the lower classes (Epsilons or Deltas) are purposefully deprived of oxygen so that they will not be "born" too intelligent for their class. In light of the current progressions that we have made with cloning and genetic alteration, it seems that Huxley has shown us one distinctly possible direction that society could wind up taking...
<br />
<br />The book begins with a tour through the "decanting" factory.. recently fertilized eggs are artificially multiplied in the "Bokanovsky Process", which can create almost 100 identical embryos from a single egg. The lower classes will be multiplied to the highest degree, while the Alphas (the upper administrative class) will be individuals. The tour continues up to the nurseries where the children are conditioned every day to enjoy their lot in life. Some of this conditioning is done through aversion therapy, while some of it is drilled into the childrens' heads while they sleep. This sort of conditioning is what leads to a perfectly controlled world. (The controlled drug called Soma which is distributed faithfully to the masses doesn't hurt, either).
<br />
<br />It is easy to determine which caste one person is in by the color they are wearing; each class wears a different color. The classes range from Alpha (highest) down to Beta, Gamma, Delta, and finally Epsilon. Deltas, for example, wear only khaki and are conditioned to hate books so that they will not waste their time reading. Betas, by contrast, are conditioned to be glad they're smart, but not as smart as Alphas because Alphas work too hard.
<br />
<br />The older folks are so ingrained with these thoughts that they know nothing but happiness with their lives, regardless of whether they are the hard labor force or in one of the upper classes. However, the people in charge, as a result of knowing what is actually going on, can become a little bit jaded. When one "Alpha" decides to take a holiday, he sneaks off to a reservation of "savages" (folks who don't want any part of the Brave New World's society) and sees his illegitimate son. This is soon discovered, and he is brought forth before a committee which is shocked because they consider natural birth to be downright barbaric. The mother and son are brought into the "civilized" society, and everything quickly falls apart.
<br />
<br />This book is fascinating in every way, from the colorful images that Huxley paints for the reader, to the parallels it draws to our current society. Brave New World is absolutely a must-read for anyone who is old enough to understand the implications, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to the science fiction, but very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, a fun, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>This book is quite simply on of the better sci-fi books that I have ever read. Aldous Huxley, has done a wonderful job predicting (back in 1932) what he thought might become of our world. 
<br />
<br />The story starts of in Central London's Hatchery & Conditioning Centre. In this world, which takes place in approximately 2500 A.D. (or in the book 632 A.F.) people are 'made' in tubes, and conditioned in the way that they should go. Similar to 1984, the totalitarian government is based on a simple motto, "Community, Identity, Stability". Nonetheless, this government does not rule its people by force as in 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. Instead, the government provides it people with constant "happiness", thus ensuring social stability. There are five distinct groups that make up the "Brave New World" and each group has an intricate part in the social system. There are Alphas, Betas, Deltas, Gammas and Epsilons that make up the entire caste system. Basically the Alphas are bred in a way that suits them (they hold the most important positions) while the lower caste members are bred to be laborers. From their manufacture (or birth) these toddlers are conditioned in a number of ways in order to fit into their part of society. They are taught nearly everything that would condition them into having a happy life. From the early ages children are encouraged to partake in heavy sexual activity and drug use (and other vices that will keep them happy). The major aim of the government is to make the people happy, thus ensuring social stability.
<br />
<br />The story follows a few different characters, as they live in this world. In the beginning, the reader is introduced to Bernard Marx and Lenina, a man and woman living in this dystopia. The story follows their experiences in the world as they know it, and then it follows them into a trip to visit the Savages. Without giving too much of the story away, a new character emerges, John, who is a savage. The latter half of the book deals with his experience in the "other world"
<br />
<br />All in all, this book was a great read. I believe that Aldous Huxley did a wonderful job in predicting what the world would become. Although Orwell's 1984 gets more attention, Brave New World is a better vision of what our world has become. It is difficult to read the story without seeing allusions to our modern day government. For example, sexual promiscuity was used by the world state in order to distract people from the real problem. Arguably this is the same thing that is happening today. In the foreword (written in the early sixties) Huxley joked about "marriage licenses being sold like dog licenses, good for a period of twelve moths, with no law against changing dogs." Huxley speculated that as political and economic freedom diminishes sexual freedom usually increases. Similarly, people are encouraged to become involved in mindless activities in Huxley's world that includes drugs and music (similar to what goes on today). The point is, the happier that people are, the more unlike they are to care about what goes on around them. Huxley did a wonderful job of explaining this compared to our current state. This book should definitely be on every high school students reading list. It provides a fascinating account of religion, philosophy, and social stability wrapped into a great story. Read it!

                    <span>Back when I was a  high school student, many many years ago, this book was on the reading list, but our teacher decided not to require us to read it, opting for the Great Gatsby and Hiroshima instead. So I went down to the local bookstore and purchased a copy to read on my own. 
<br />
<br />Along with Sun-Tzu's The Art of War, I consider this book to be a good investment. 
<br />
<br />The mark of Good Alternate History is seeing something that could have happened if things had gone a different way. How might the Civil War have gone had McClellan not lost his nerve before Richmond in 1862, or finished off Lee after Antietem? Or what if Robert E. Lee had accepted Lincoln's offer to command the union armies? Or what if Hitler had been asasinated? What if the Soviet Union had fallen to the Gemans? What if Ben Franklin formed the Albany Congress into a successful government during the French and Indian war? Or what if these brainless 'Drop of Ink' race laws that once dishonoured this great country were never adopted. 
<br />
<br />The Mark of Good Science Fiction is seeing something that could 
<br />come if we do or not do certain things. 
<br />
<br />The science fiction shelves of every book store are packed with garbage of lazer beam robats and elves that will never happen. Some set in the future. Others set in the past or in alternate worlds. Garbage callsed sci-fis. Absolute trash.
<br />
<br />It is a rare book that can be called Science Fiction. Science fictin like Brave New World. 
<br />
<br />Brave New World. Look at the news of our present world. The decline of moral values in today's society plus Dolly the sheep clones and the growing power of the UN. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is coming unless we change. That makes this book great science fiction.    </span>

                    <span>Brave New World is one of the landmark books of the twentieth century, now widely regarded as a classic. Like many, I first read this book at school many years ago; it is a tribute to the power to the book that even after that experience I still hold it in high regard.
<br />
<br />Brave New World is Aldous Huxley's dystopian (not utopian) vision of the future (the far future when he originally wrote the book, although it seems much closer now). As such it blends together science fiction and social commentary.
<br />
<br />Huxley's future is one of universal happiness although it is a facile, passionless happiness. Children are created on a production line with their social status (denoted by Greek letters) predetermined; this social status is then reinforced through chemicals and conditioning (in their sleep). Happiness is maintained chemically (mainly through a drug called soma) and by allowing the people to lead largely responsibility free lives devoted to pleasure, principally sex. Physical perfection is the norm, nobody reads (or thinks), religion has disappeared (God manifests himself by his absence), and there is no conflict: it is a global society of peace, harmony and happiness for all.
<br />
<br />Into this world Huxley introduces his principle protagonist - John the Savage - a young man raised outside of this society. John is self-educated, largely through reading the works of Shakespeare. The book examines John's impact on this society (minimal) and its impact on him (huge and inevitably tragic).
<br />
<br />Huxley writes well and creates a compelling book describing a society that fascinates and repels. However, the book is not without problems - the characters have no depth (because they really do have no depth). John is an unrealistic, unconvincing character, he is only there to generate conflict. I suspect the passage of time has been unkind in this respect - we struggle to empathise with John, as his attitudes no longer reflect those of the reader. Huxley is not interested in people; he is interested in exploring the society. He does this effectively and entertainingly but this is not a character led story. 
<br />
<br />Brave New World is often bracketed with 1984. This is a difficult comparison for Brave New World as Orwell is a better writer and 1984 is a much better book with a more complete and better-realised vision of the future. For much of the twentieth century 1984 also seemed to be a more accurate & realistic vision of the future but in my opinion that has changed. Today, the scenario envisaged by Brave New World seems quite prescient and much more likely - at least in the sense that happiness will be used to control society (at the expense of freedom).
<br />
<br />A great book and well worth reading - highly recommended
