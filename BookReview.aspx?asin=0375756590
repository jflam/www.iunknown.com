                    <span>I read this book long time ago. But I remember the main charcter being a STRONG BLACK MAN! He was raising his two girls by himself. Any book that displays a positive message about the black man is cool with me! Nice job author.</span>

                    <span>Who told this child that she could write?  I haven't heard her as a motivational speaker, but her writing leaves PLENTY of room to be desired!  This story is entirely too sugary and honky-dory.   It makes a reader angry to spend their hard earn money on a book that was recommended by lying reviewers, only to be disappointed.  And you can't get your money back.  The only thing you can do is to give it away or to sell it for the low-low.  It would make great for a fire.  Just to think some upstanding tree sacrificed its life for something like this.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful book. This is the second book that I have read from EbonySatin Brown that had me crying like I really knew the characters. At one point my coworkers thought that I had problems at home. It is so true that we never give fellas a chance in this literary thing. But I want to applaud my husband for being one of  those men who will take the shirt off his back for me, my children and anyone else who needs his helping hands. We as woman always blame men who seem unwilling to do this for us but many times it is our own faults for being to judging. Also we OURSELVES sometimes are not willing to take our shirts off.Think about this ladies.</span>

                    <span>This is book was very refreshing. There was not an ounce of a man or woman disrespecting the other in this book. Black love is a beautiful thing when a couple release all their inhibitions and just love. Ms. Brown did a fantastic job in positively portraying these couples. <br>I definitely recommend this book !!!</span>
