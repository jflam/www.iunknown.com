                    <span>A conscientious effort written by a musician concentrating on Mr Evans' recorded legacy with considerable detail and assessment on the various records issued. As Mr Evans was more concerned with music than any other thing in his life, I'm sure he would approved.  But the feeling that was the essential element in everything Mr Evans produced is somewhat absent in this bio. Not a gripping read but one I would not be without. </span>

                    <span>This book is like one of those holographic images at a science fair - you can see the image clearly, even from different sides - but you can never touch it, hold it or otherwise feel it.  After reading through this highly-detailed text I believe I could answer any Jeopardy question on Bill Evans, but that I don't really know much more about the man. 
<br />
<br />I won't re-hash what so many other reviewers have put so well, but emphasize a few points.  First, this book is by a musician for musicians, or at least jazz lovers.  Pettinger could have been much more technical in his descriptions and most readers would have understood.  Second, there must be some people out there that could provide more color on Evans to help understand why he himself could not hear the repetition in his work over time.  That is, why his own attempts are re-inventing himself personally and musically failed.
<br />
<br />Sadly, it may be almost too late (2004) or will be in the next 20 years to interview those with firsthand experiences with Evans to try to capture the essence of this musical genius, who's life work changed so much.

                    <span>This book is more of a commented discography than a biograhpy, at least as compared to most bios. The story of Bill's life is presented here more through his recordings than anything else. The early part of his life is sketched briefly, but once he started making records, each individual disc is mentioned, and the circumstances discussed.<p>For fans of Bill Evans, who tend to be obsessive, this is the ideal guide to his work. While some of the author's judgements about the quality of certain recordings or live performances are perhaps a bit subjective, this is the companion that all Bill Evans fans must have.</span>

                    <span>Let me start by saying I am a tremendous fan of Bill Evans. There is no other pianist who has influenced my own playing as much as Evans. I have spent years transcribing and absorbing his music. I believe that he was constantly refining his concepts, honing them down to their essence, until his untimely death.<p>When this book first came out I rushed to my local book store  with the intention of buying it. I excitedly perused its pages and was sadly disappointed to discover that while this book shared Bill's disciplined, academic approach with regards to its subject, it committs a sin that  Evans was never  guilty of:  it is bone dry and for the most part devoid of emotion, that is except for its unbridled enthusiasm for Evan's music.<p>As far as I could see, this  book  is more of a glorified discography than a biography.  As a reference tool, I suppose it might be useful, although many of the boxed sets now provide similar details of the sessions.<p>If you are looking for Evans the man, you will not find him here. But as this is still the only book out on this extraordinary artist, it may be worth picking up for the few interesting passages that pepper it.. There is certainly  a more engaging , definitive portrait yet to be written.</span>

                    <span>Pettinger should be commended for taking the high road by focusing on Evans' music and not the sordid details of his long years of addiction. However, there is more to biographical writing than merely presenting a sequence of events. Pettinger's research in the area of recordings, live performances, and collaborators is exhaustive, but I found the reading tedious (and I'm a fan of Evans) due to the repetitive construction of the chapters. <br>On some occasions, his writing captures the music with uniquely employed details, and the reader sees that he is genuinely passionate about Evans' body of work. As a musician, I enjoyed these parts, and I respect Mr. Pettinger's insight. <br>But there is an implicit focus on the importance of classical training in Evans' pianistic development, and I have to disagree with the emphasis placed on this. Evans' sound and nuanceful playing are more a result of his dedication and vision as an artist. Classical training does not necessarily make a great pianist, and Pettinger stresses in various ways that Evans' knowledge of classical music infinitely aided him in revolutionizing jazz with his sound. Perhaps--but this is a bias of the author. <br>Had he written about Thelonius Monk, he probably would have criticized his unorthodox technique, though clearly, someone like Evans had nothing but respect and admiration for Monk--precisely because Monk was unafraid to develop a unique approach that worked for him. Both pianists were obviously most noted for the unmistakable personalities of their sounds. <br>The refinement of style through years of practicing, performing, and introspection is more important--and exciting--than the author's erudite allusions to classical pieces pertinent to Evans' compositions.<br>Pettinger's writing is solid but incomplete for fans who want a dimensional presentation of this genius of the 20th century. Essentially, the writer lacks a risk-taking style and presents us with a thorough, well-documented companion piece to Evans' recordings. <br>When Evans is quoted, this biography comes alive. I only wish he had written a book (he was noted for excellent commentary in liner notes), for I believe his writing was just as eloquent as his music.</span>
