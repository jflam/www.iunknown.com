                    <span>It is a great idea and so much fun to think about as you travel around. A lot of objects maybe junk for some people and poetry to others. A kind of "Poems a Penny Each". A well done book about personal adventure. You can define yourself.</span>

                    <span>This book was great on pictures--pictures that showed the "after" of transforming junk. The book, though, lack information on exactly to transfer that junk. It did not get down to the "down and dirty." I have seen better information given on the television show, Decorating Cents, on HGTV. <P>If you like pictures and use them in your transformation, this is the book for you. If you want detailed instructions, there are other well-informative books that can do a better job.</span>

                    <span>American Junk is not a how-to book as its subtitle suggests. Far more specific advice about hunting and haggling is available in flea market directories, and there really is no rescue or transformation involved: items acquired move directly to the table top, shelf, desk, floor, wherever. This is a celebration of cheap old stuff that others might ignore or take pains to avoid, an annointment of its value by someone of influence (the author is a vice president at Ralph Lauren, I believe). It's a quasi aesthetic, with loving photographs of the items in assembled in haphazard tableaus. It is of an innocent age, published before e-bay seized collectibles from the trash, before absolutely everybody got into flea market hunt, before Antiques Roadshow--and that was less than 10 years ago! The author does not explain to a doubter's satisfaction how one lives and cleans with so much stuff. Not all of it is really junk, of course--a vintage set of Zane Grey novels, some folk art carving, old textiles are not what I'd call junk. Dirty old Tupperware or small harvest gold appliances that no longer work are what I call junk and they are not to be found in this book. Ah, well; it is fun to give or receive, but take the author's approach and try to get it cheap.</span>

                    <span>And this book is sure to have something for everyone. This is the encyclopedia of "shabby chic"! If you are a lover of flea markets, antique malls and garage sales (and if you are a closet interior decorator) you will LOVE this book! Pull up a chair, prop up your feet and take delight in another fabulous picture book that can double as a coffee table conversation piece.</span>
