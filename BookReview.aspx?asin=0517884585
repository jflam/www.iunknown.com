                    <span>For years I read self-help and motivational books. Like 7 habits for highly effective people, Life strategies - Doing what matters doing what works and the likes. But never having dedicatede the time and effort to start the procces to actually put my knowleged into practical application.<BR>My new-years resolution for 2001 was "More love for me, More love to what I do!" And come feb. life handed me an oppotunity to drop off the radar and start practicing what I had been preacing to my self for years.<BR>I had been over weight since I was 13-14 years old.<BR>Simplyfied but true, at 137 kg, being fat was my ultimate excuse for anything wrong that happend in my life.<BR>So I decided to focus my attention to turn the tabel and start showing myself the love I felt I lacked.<BR>I had known about Chopra for years and when I came across this book I thought "Why not this way!" and bought it.<BR>To cut an already long story short :-)<BR>Now a year and a half later I'm at 88-90kg (Down some 50kg)<BR>Wow, but the most important points I will stress to you wanting to use this book as inspiration and guide. Drink the boiling water and don't focus on how much you loose in Lbs./Kg's, but how much you show your self that you're worth it, by sticking to your plan. And don't forget... If you fall of the horse - TRY AGAIN! Best of wishes and loads of love to you all - You ARE worth it, you just wait and see ;-)</span>

                    <span>Dr. Deepak Chopra has done it again, this time with a book that focuses on one of America's main concerns: weight loss. Rather than doling out questionable information about low-carb, high-protein, or low-fat plans, Dr. Chopra turns to Ayurvedic medicine and offers a plan which anyone can follow. It's quite simple: determine your main body type from the three doshas -- vata, pitta, or kapha -- and then follow the suggestions provided so as to achieve balance in not only weight, but life as a whole. Most of Dr. Chopra's lessons should strike a chord within us -- they are inherent pearls of wisdom that many have unfortunately chosen to forget or have disregarded. Once you recommit yourself to this healthy way of living, get ready for incredible changes! In other words, *don't* expect instant weight loss (this is not a "too good to be true" program), but *do* expect healthy weight loss and a new outlook on life beyond food. As Dr. Chopra points out, the mind and body work together -- and his plan concentrates on both.</span>

                    <span>This book was less than helpful for me. First of all, the section on figuring out your body type was confusing and I did not come up with a clear-cut answer. Although this book contained some interesting theories and ideas, the majority of the techniques and suggestions are completely impractical for anyone with a normal life, schedule and job. For example, I work from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and most days without a lunch "break". I eat in the car on the way to my next client. So how am I supposed to eat a large, hot meal at a specific time, made of freshly cooked food and not leftovers? Really, unless they invent microwave ovens for cars, it's not going to happen. Also, some of the other ideas were just downright unappealing to me, bordering on disgusting (drinking boiled warm milk and sipping hot water with ginger all day while eliminating cold drinks). This plan may be very effective for the independently wealthy who are able to sit meditating in a beatiful natural setting and have a personal shopper and chef to wait on them. But for the rest of us, this book does not contain much practical advice for people with busy lives. I know myself and this is a weight loss program requiring too many radical changes and impractical ideas that I would never get past the first week. I found this book to be a not-so-perfect weight loss theory.</span>

                    <span>This is a well written and informative book. Unfortunately for me it is not a practical one. Sure if I changed my life around completely I would be able to follow the guidelines of the book - but who can do that when they have to earn a living?<P>If you are retired or without any permanent committments then Deepak's book may just work for you. Read it enjoy it but don't necessarily expect to use it.</span>

                    <span>I was amazed at how much information was packed into such a modest looking book. I read it twice and made so many notes. I borrowed this copy but am buying one for my own reference. I also researched blood type dieting and it all ties in together. The guidelines and information detailed in Perfect Weight make dieting obsolete and transforming my lifestyle into changes my body is craving naturally. Stress free and pleasurable. Simply the best advice I've ever read on the subject.</span>
