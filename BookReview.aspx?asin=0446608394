                    <span>Cynthia Cooper could be a role model for anyone. She knows how to play the game of life as well as basketball: when to hold, when to fold, and a whole lot more. <br>What impressed me most? Signed to play in Italy, Cynthia didn't hang around being homesick. She took the opportunity to learn and grow. <br>My favorite scenes: <p>(1) New to Italy, she'd never even heard of famous cathedrals that someone asked her about. Later, she could have discussed the architectural history and features -- in Italian.<p>(2) She asked Ford to give her a marketing internship -- and she felt right at home with the men. I use this example a lot when I talk to parents who are concerned that their daughters are more interested in sports than school. <p>(3)  She takes us behind the scenes of the championship Comets.<p>Hard to put down, well-written, honest -- the perfect gift for any WNBA fan or any young woman looking to her future, in or out of basketball.</span>

                    <span>This autobiography is one of the best, if not the best, that I've read. It's amazing how Cynthia Cooper writes her own story to motivate and make readers have more confidence. She's a real example of a true athlete hero, someone that can be a role model to all. Thanks to her and her success in the WNBA, she's given Women's Basketball a new meaning. Her determination and motivation to become successful is admirable. This book is really an inspiration to those who lack self-esteem and self-confidence. I enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone because is really interesting and inspirational. I'm proud of Cynthia Cooper because she's a real good representative of Women's basketball and a great example of determination and success. She also proved that with God's help, anything is possible.</span>

                    <span>Cooper's book has made me relieze that nothing can turninto something. Also Cooper provides a positive role model for anyonewho wants to better themselves and improve their way of life. This is a book that can be enjoyed by all. There was problems growing up, college, overseas (work) love, and death of loved ones. This tells the reader that everyone faces problems at many different stages of life. Also how they could be overcome with the correct outlook.  END</span>

                    <span>This is the best book I have ever read because this book shows how you can start out with so little, but if you try hard you will have so much! This is a truly inspirational and uplifting book about the life of Cynthia  Cooper. Cynthia was always the underdog in sports and in life. Cynthia grew  up in a money wise poor family. Her mother was a single parent who raised  eight children by herself when Cynthia's father left them. Cynthia lost her  best friend/brother when he was murdered. Cynthia played basketball in  other countries, but was always the second best. Cynthia Cooper's mother  died because of breast cancer one year ago, and her best friend and WNBA  teammate died because of lung cancer that spread to her brain a half a year  ago. Cynthia currently plays in the WNBA. She was named MVP for the first  two years of the WNBA and has helped the Houston Comets win the  Championship every year that the WNBA has existed which is three years.  Even though Cynthia went through so many hardships in life she is no longer  an underdog. She has claimed a triumphant victory and will always be a  Champion!</span>
