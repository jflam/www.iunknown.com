                    <span>If you come across an old spell calling for bat wings...what is it really asking for? If you don't know, then this book is for you!<P>Garden Witchery is a jewel! I would recommend it to any pagan who loves nature and is drawn to digging in the dirt.<P>It is practical and full of useful information. Especially meaningful to me is the way it explains how to design your sacred garden space and what planting material to consider. I especially enjoyed the careful way the author tied together how to use magical plants in the proper phase of the moon, as well as the most opportune day of the week in order to enhance success.<P>This book is enjoyable to read. The author's warm and friendly writing style and the glimpses she provides into her magical home life, makes for a fun, relaxing reading experience.<P>Garden Witchery definately rates a place of honor in my magical reference library.</span>

                    <span>Ellen Dugan is a Master Gardner received from the University of Missouri and has many years experience in nurseries and gardens. In this book, Ms. Dugan gives us the basics of gardening and she does it well.<P> Ms. Dugan is also a Witch, and her gardening techniques include the basics of craft correspondences and practices. Discussions include seasonal plantings, using trees, herbs and plants to enhance your yard, garden and home. Included are histories behind plants and trees and the associations with our holidays, folklore and even faerys making this a well rounded guide. There are some nice correspondence tables for everything from tree and flower magic and meanings to suggested layouts for your beginning gardens. This book is nicely researched and includes practical material for both the beginners and seasoned gardeners alike. <P>There are also special little "magickal" additions to be had in the book. From charm bags, to garden supplies,to bath salts with herbal additions from your garden, Ms. Dugan has included many nice additions to make this an all around garden book.<P> There is a table of contents, an index, a glossary, a nice bibliography and even a gardening journal for you to keep notes. The illustrations by Kerigwen are are simply icing on the cake.<P>This is a nice volume on witchy gardening, and is intelligent in its approach while being easy to use and a good overall reference book.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. Ellen Dugan is funny, down-to-earth, and no-nonsense. She's so charming and informative that it's easy to forgive her unabashed adoration of knick-knacks and over-the-top holiday decorations. A real treat for a kindred garden witch. Thanks and write some more books please!</span>

                    <span>dugan's book is a basic, broad collection of practical gardening tips, lore and herbal/garden magic. i found it fairly helpful, since i'm new to the realm of magic, in coordinating gardening practices and magical ones. however, i'm not new to gardening and would recommend that those who are new acquire books that deal specifically with gardening, whether on veggies, herbs, fruit trees, etc. one thing that i appreciated was that the lists of common herbs, flowers, and trees for her area (missiouri) corresponded quite nicely to my area's native plants, with a few exceptions. i must admit that although i am still searching for that "perfect" herb/garden book filled with practical tips, regional lore and magical hints, dugan's book has helped pacify my craving for now.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited when I found this book. Gardening and Wicca - what could be better!?! Obviously, quite a bit could be better. I was very, very disappointed and quite honestly very disturbed that a self-proclaimed practicing witch condones the use of pesticides and chemicals. Excuse me, but what happened to "HARM NONE"? Anyone with an elementary knowledge of nature knows that any chemicals and pesticides used in the garden kill bees (an extremely vital link in our ecological chain), not to mention other beneficial insects. After one season of being plagued with squash beetles, she gave up and used chemicals!?!? What does that teach anyone? If you truly want to be in balance with nature, you must be a purist or at the very least practicing organic methods (beware some organic products harm bees too). There are ways to save your crops and not damage the environment. The great wise women and men of old didn't have Miracle-Gro and bug spray. Please. They learned to live in balance with nature and let nature help them.</span>
