                <span id="Label1"><I>The Trouble with Normal</I> argues passionately against same-sex marriage, but here's the twist: not because it denigrates the institution of marriage, but because it perpetuates the cultural shame attached to sex between consenting but unmarried adults. When gay men and lesbians try to claim that they're just like "normal folk," Michael Warner writes, they do a profound disservice to other queer folk who choose not to live in monogamous or matrimonial bliss and who believe that the solution to being stigmatized for your sexuality is not to pretend it doesn't exist. Same-sex marriage advocates, he continues, often seem to be willfully blind to the cultural ramifications of their position, viewing marriage as "an intensified and deindividuated form of coming out." They don't seem to realize that if society validates <I>their</I> relationships, other types of relationships will by necessity be invalidated. (He also makes a strong case for the fight against sexual shame's being more than a queer issue, citing 1998's presidential impeachment crisis: "[Bill] Clinton, certainly, was not the first to discover how hard it is in this culture to assert any dignity when you stand exposed as a sexual being.") Extending his analysis, Warner shows how the championing of married gays and lesbians as "normal" is part of the same cultural climate that leads to "quality of life" crackdowns against queercentric businesses--as is already underway in New York City--and a deliberate sabotage of safer-sex education that puts millions of Americans at continued risk of exposure to HIV. Warner's precise, straightforward argument is enlivened by numerous sharp zingers, as when he accuses Andrew Sullivan of "breath[ing] new and bitchy life into Jesuitical pieties" about sexual morality. <I>The Trouble with Normal</I> is a bold, provocative book that forces readers to reconsider what sexual liberation really means. <I>--Ron Hogan</I> </span>

                    <span>In this excellent book, Michael Warner explains how gay and lesbian activists are pursuing the wrong goal by advocating and working for the right to be legally married.  <p>Warner points out that, instead, the focus ought to be on separating certain legal benefits and perks that are now only available to those in a legal marriage from one's marital status.  Such marriage-linked benefits not only discriminate against gays and lesbians, but also heterosexuals in nontraditional relationships, and singles of all categories.  I found quite a bit in this book that was relevant and useful to me as a nonmonogamous heterosexual.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>As a straight woman and a strong advocate for gay marriage, this book did not at first appeal to me.  What could I learn from a book by a gay man arguing against gay marriage?  It turns out that I had a lot to learn.  Although I still believe that anyone who wants to marry should have that right, after reading this book I no longer want to get married.  This breaks down the descriminatory nature of marriage and the politics of sexual shame in such an interesting way.  This should be required reading for everyone--gay, straight, single, married, whatever.  It's not an argument that you hear very often, but it's a very important one!  Read this book--it might upset you, but it will force you to examine ideas like homosexuality, marriage, and sex in new ways.</span>

                    <span>This is a book that could serve as a wake-up call.  ... .  Warner grounds his arguments in contemporary politics and offers an intervention worth reading. Even if he doesn't change your views, you will look a little more carefully at fund-raising mail from mainstream gay organizations.  It would be nice to see this analysis extended to other issues, but the marriage debate serves as a boiler plate for other arguments.</span>

                    <span>Warner starts off well and almost had me convinced for a while, until he becomes an obvious hypocrite.  He claims that he wants homosexuals to be accepted, but in reality, he is just an ancient relic of the old struggle for gay rights and refuses to accept that perhaps homosexuals will have little more to struggle for when they are allowed to marry and given other rights.<p>He trashes Andrew Sullivan, the author of "The Politics of Homosexuality" - published in the New Republic in 1993, for claiming that homosexuals will no longer need to be political once they are allowed to marry and given the same rights as everyone else.  So what's wrong with that?  Sullivan seems to think that homosexuals should not "conform" with society and marry.  He essentially says to all those homosexuals who want to marry that they are sellouts to the movement.  However, he fails to recognize that indeed that is what most hetrosexuals and homosexuals want.  We want our society to be more cohesive.  By allowing homosexuals to marry, we are not making them hetrosexual in any way.  <p>One could defend Warner by saying that he is actually criticizing the institution of marriage.  However, his criticism is weak and unfounded.  He claims that people get married because they want to change their name, get huge benefits, and engage in confidential conversations with their spouse.  No one says to their future spouse, "Marry me so you can change your name and we can have confidential conversations."  That's just silly, and with regards to the issue of "significant" benefits, there is not a particularly significant advantage, economically speaking, for married people.  In many instances, it is actually a disadvantage.  Also, he completely ignores the importance of marriage as an institution that is so crucial to the survival of our society.  A state and society's goal is to recreate itself, to go on, and without marriage, there is no foundation to provide support for children (whether they be living with hetrosexual parents or adopted by homosexual couples).  Warner just sounds like a libidinous man who wishes to remove marraige as an institution because he does not see the value in state-sanctified bonds.  Why?  He doesn't really say.  <p>Also, he completely overestimates the power of sexuality in our everyday lives.  He claims that we are all governed by our sexual shame.   However, this is not really the case.  Most of us do not spend our entire lives worrying about that relationship we had with someone back in college or something else like that.  His trouble with the normal is that it's just not palatable to him.  His goal is to remove all norms essentially (although he claims that this is not it) so that nothing will be abnormal.  <p>One can make a Millisian argument against such a trivial idea and say that norms are necessary to each society.  Without norms there is no society, no culture, no identity.  Warner's vision of the world is a world where you can't group any two people together.  In the great succession of sad, dead-end thinkers such as Foucault and Geertz, he does not believe in any classification or generalizations.  Why is he even an academic then?  OK, so perhaps that is getting away from his argument a little, but nonetheless, Warner fails to provide a convincing vision of his ideal world and why it would work.  He's just disappointed that the rest of the world doesn't agree with him and blames it on the state and society for enforcing rigid conformity and punishing all of those who do not comply.  I guess he didn't read Mill - society must have some way of establishing itself and its members should be able to hold their own opinions, and if a certain set of opinions create a norm or standard, than that is how it should be.  However in a Millisian spirit, we should probably still read Warner, realize he's full of it, and move on.  <p>If you want a true argument for homosexual rights, read Andrew Sullivan - he's a far better writer and far more convincing.  Sullivan's goal is unity and cohesiveness, not war of all against all as Warner would hope for.</span>
