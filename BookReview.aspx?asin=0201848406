                <span id="Label1"><I>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</I> is the most exhaustive overview of computer graphics techniques available. This textbook's 21 chapters cover graphics hardware, user interface software, rendering, and a host of other subjects. Assuming a solid background in computer science or a related field, <I>Computer Graphics</I>gives example programs in C and provides exercises at the end of each chapter to test your knowledge of the material. The guide has over 100 beautiful, four-color photographs that illustrate important topics and algorithms, such as ray tracing and bump maps, and also inspire you to acquire the skills necessary to produce them. Encyclopedic in its coverage, the book has a good table of contents so that you can immediately turn to information on the z-Buffer algorithm or the chapter on animation.</span>

                    <span>I see that this book is getting a 4.5 average star rating.  I really think many of these ratings are based largely on nostalgia.  I bought this book 7 years ago or so.  I definitely can say that I learned a great deal from this book, and it is a classic.
<br />
<br />However, it hasn't been updated since then, and I think that, considering the price tag, it really doesn't make sense for most modern readers to buy it.  (Especially if they don't have Real-Time Rendering, which is my recommendation.)
<br />
<br />Let's scan through the table of contents and see which chapters might be worth reading:
<br />
<br />1.) Introduction
<br />2.) SRGP - if you don't know what this means, it's because it stands for a graphics system that nobody uses anymore.
<br />3.) Basic raster graphics algorithms for drawing 2d primitives - this is a good reference for this stuff.  Of course, a lot fewer people need to know how to do software rasterization nowadays
<br />4.) Graphics Hardware - circa 1996
<br />5.) geometrical transforms - standard material as covered elsewhere, though more difficult to understand
<br />6.) viewing in 3D - This is actually a pretty unique chapter and worth reading once you've read other books (which will be easier to learn from).  There's some unique information about different types of projections, and some alternative ways of looking at the problem.
<br />7.) Object heirarchy and SPHIGS.  Another graphics programming system nobody uses anymore.
<br />8.) input devices, interaction techniques, and interaction tasks - I never read these chapters because they were about UI design.  Maybe you'll find them useful - but they aren't really about "graphics"
<br />9.) dialogue design - Same comments as Ch 8 - probably not what you're buying the book for.
<br />10.) user interface software - Same comments as Ch 8 - probably not what you're buying the book for.
<br />11.) Representing curves and surfaces - there's some good meat here, most of it pretty timeless.  But again, I think the information is contained in plenty of other books, as well.
<br />12.) solid modeling - some interesting material here that isn't the same old stuff found in every other graphics book.
<br />13.) achromatic and colored light - gets into the theory of color and different color models.  Interesting and useful.
<br />14.) the quest for visual realism - largely out of date, but some decent information
<br />15.) visible surface determination - covers a wide variety of algorthims, many of which are more interesting than useful.
<br />16.) illumination and shading - gives the standard local lighting model.  Mostly this is standard information you can get elsewhere.
<br />17.) image manipulation and storage - discusses filtering techniques, etc.
<br />18.) Advanced Raster Graphics Architecture - out of date
<br />19.) Advanced Geometric and Raster Algorithms - Mostly out of date, but with some standard information you can get elsewhere
<br />20.) Advanced Modeling techniques - fractals, particle systems, etc - doesn't cover much in detail
<br />21.) Animation - not much can be covered in 23 pages...
<br />
<br />For most people, I would suggest "Real-Time Rendering" as a more modern "survey of computer graphics".
<br />
<br />This is not a book for beginners - there's so much information in this book that none of it is covered with any sort of decent explanation.
<br />
<br />And the code is all really old-school K&R C style with the type of the function arguments declared in between the closing paren and the opening brace.
<br />
<br />The reasons to get this book are:
<br />
<br />1.) To "complete your bookshelf" with a book that all good programmers are "supposed to have"
<br />2.) As an interesting (but expensive) read on algorithms and ideas that you probably won't use directly, but you may find interesting and learn altative ways of looking at problems.

                    <span>I have found this book to be _the_ most useful book in my line of work yet. I have been involved in computer graphics and software development for about 10 years, and this stands out as the ideal reference book.<p>Dont bother with this book if you just want source code. This book is all about explanation of the fundamentals of computer graphics. It is excellent in helping with design descisions and implementation strategies. Dont overlook this book if you are in anyway involved with the creation of a computer graphics application. The theory and algorithms described are old, but these are still used today - interestingly other reviewers seem to think this is bad, its not. It saves you spending months researching a method only to find it was already mentioned in this book, and the benefits and disadvantages are often written well with solid references.<p>In my opinion, in Computer Graphics, this is the Bible. The theories and algorithms assist in solving any problem you will find in the computer graphics world. It wont give you the code, but it will give you a solution.</span>

                    <span>Once upon a time any student interested in computer graphics was referred straight to this book, and indeed what you've got here is an amazing smorgasbord of nearly every technique that was state of the art several years ago. Unfortunately the times have moved on and Foley et al. have not quite been able to keep up with them; entire chapters are still devoted to PHIGS, while modern methods of rotation such as quaternions are covered in only the most cursory way.<p>Another problem is the book's extremely terse, high-level approach to many important concepts; often a mathematical approach or an algorithm will be mentioned as a solution to a given problem (quadtrees, let's say), but once you try to take that knowledge from the chalkboard to the compiler, you begin to realize that there are some important pieces missing. Of course, no one expects a text like this to be a cookbook of code snippets, but as a primary textbook for an applications programmer this falls short. The tiny print and unhelpful illustrations don't improve matters much for pedagogy.<p>So, even though this is the Classic Textbook, I've found myself better served by a combination of other, more recent books -- Alan Watt's text on graphics in combination with Eric Lengyel's on 3D Mathematics, specifically. They won't cover *everything* there is to know, but they'll do a better job of getting you started than Foley, and the stuff they don't address can be found in other books or SIGGRAPH papers.</span>

                    <span>This book mentions almost every concept useful in computer graphics.  This is actually where the book fails.  There are so many concepts, it can't cover all of them adequately.  Things like rendering primitives, scanline conversion, and shadows are explained in detail while other concepts like quaternion interpolation, environmental mapping, and image filtering are barely summarized.  The choice of SPHIGS as the language of examples is also questionable at best.</span>
