                    <span>I got this book as a present before i went to south africa. I was excited because I have heard that these books are really good. But after reading through the book, I quickly realizied that it did not give me enough information. I am in South Africa, I see how beautiful it is. I don't need to see pictures, I need maps, (there were only maps for Capetown)information about what i am seeing, costs of addmission, times, ect. There were none, and it became really annoying and unpleasant at many times. These books are good for people who just want to see how other countries/cities look like, but not travel to them. If you want a good travel book, look for the Lonely planet series.     </span>

                    <span>Before I went to Cape Town, a thoughtful friend gave me this book, and I couldn't thank her enough.  And although my comments below apply to the South Africa volume, they could well be applied to the entire series, which is excellent.  
<br />
<br />The layout of the book is immediately arresting.  Rather than imposing blocks of sheer text, the editors use tons of photographs, maps and other graphics.  Just randomly flipping through this book is entertaining, which is not always the case with these types of publications.  The typefaces are clear and well-chosen, and the enticing pages include many illustrations, the most unusual of which are cutaway diagrams of major buildings.  These drawings are quite beautiful, and an unexpected delight in a book like this.  
<br />
<br />Other sections deal with history, art and business.  And still more sections cover "nuts and bolts" items like hotels and restaurants, and vital information such as availability of banks and ATMs, doctors and hospitals, and other trip considerations that one might overlook in the rush to depart.  The book is a nice size to tuck into a bag, and will give hours of pleasure even after the trip is over.
<br />
<br />I've used guides by Fodor, Michelin and others, and although those are quite good, these Eyewitness publications really raise the bar.  </span>

                    <span>I bought South Africa (Eyewitness Travel Guides) and have found it very helpful.  We already had an itinerary planned and this guide showed us where we would be visiting, the weather, and gave useful background on each area.  This guidebook gives pictorial views of historical sites, attractions etc.  This was enlightening information, some of the places we will be going are far larger in area than we would have imagined.  Also the attraction maps will help us keep oriented so time is not wasted being lost.  With this guide and a good detail map of South Africa we gained insight about the length of travel needed each day. The biggest plusses were the pictures and drawings, they really are worth a thousand words as used in this guide. There is plenty of "survival" information; important phone numbers, medical suggestions, lodging recommendations etc.  Lots of fun to read just for enjoyment!</span>

                    <span>I first discovered these books (a series Eyewitness Travel) by accident in a Stockholm bookstore. I had just come from Gothenborg by train and was a bit dazed. The book I bought by accident was in swedish but it still useful because of all the photos, cut away views, museum pictures, and maps and historical details. When I got home I bought a pile on Amazon.com of different places that I was going or had visited - but in english. <p>On a cold day back here in the USA (or Canada) or elsewhere, have a glass of wine and sit in a nice chair or in the garden on a warm day and read this book. For a moment you will be back in South Africa. You are back in a small restaurant overlooking a busy street in Cape Town. <p>The photos and desicriptions and cutaway drawings are excellent. Plus they throw in some history and details on the art and many other things of interest. A solid 400 page effort - lots of stuff to see and absorb. What is attractive about this book is that South Africa is not a well traveled country so we are not so familiar with the coutry. But the book brings it all to life with just magnificent photos and maps.<p>Jack in Toronto</span>
