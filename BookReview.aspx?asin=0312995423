                    <span>I read every Dan Brown book and Digital Fortress is the last one so far. I did like it better than Deception Point, but it pales in comparison to the Langdon novels. 
<br />In Digital Fortress we are presented a dilemma by a hacker that has hacked into National Securities (NSA) most powerful computer. If the Hacker gets his way electronic destruction will occurr unless the heros can locate the special code that can unlock it and end it's countdown. Problem is the Code is in Spain and there are sabateurs out there doing thier best to make sure the code falls into the wrong hands.
<br /> The pace of DF was well maintained, the clues were fair, I didn't care for the hoaky dialogue, as well has the 2 dimensional chacters. But over all it was a decent read, just to fluffy for my tastes.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am an information technology student, and base on my knowledge I can tell you Dan Brown did not do his research well, there are several things that are not right about the "facts" of this book. Many of them are merely technical, but others are really bad mistakes that are the base of the story. For instance, you can only do a brute force attack on an encrypted text if you know the algorithm used to encrypt it. So if they didn't knew the algorithm used to encrypt the "unbreakable code" because it was encrypted with itself, trying to break it with TRNSLTR was senseless. Second, if with a key you could decrypt the code, you need a decryptor program for that algorithm, and so the decryption part of the algorithm needed to be decrypted for the "key" to be useful. If the whole algorithm was encrypted with itself, then there was no way to decrypt it even having the key. So there was no sense in putting it in TRNSLTR or in any computer, besides, the idea that it was in fact a virus and not really an unbreakable code came to my mind at the very begining of the story, so if I am just a student, someone as "experienced" as Strathmore could not be so stupid to make that mistake. Next, the "Caesar code" is simply called a "column transposition" algorithm and was not used in Rome. I could just list tons of other facts to destroy Dan Brown's story here, but my review would get very boring. Why did I gave it 3 stars then? It's a very entertaining story, as Dan Brown's normally are, so even with those severe mistakes I could enjoy the book, but it could have been a lot better if the "facts" were more real.
<br />
<br />An additional thing: for those who care about it an "unbreakable code" actually exists: if you use any algorithm, no matter which, with a key longer than the cleartext, you will have more keys than cleartexts and that would make a brute force attack useless because by trying every possible key you will also get every possible cleartext, and there's no way you could identify the real one.</span>

                    <span>What an absolute crap - totally technically drab, and tries hard to create a calamity when there is none. You keep hanging with a faint glimmer of hope that it will pick up the pace - you secretly hope David will get out of Spain and do something interesting, and pray boss Stathmore doesnt turn out to be the villian, you would think that it is too cliched for Dan Brown to work on plot twists so dumb - but yes, he did, he went over the top. His climax is dumb squid, characters unidimensional, and greatest crime of all - made up crisis - you almost feel sorry for him when he tries again and again to whip up the tempo - he throws insane roadblocks, predictable twists, and you can hear him plead "Please be afraid - this is the end of the world" - Sorry Dan, maybe yours, not ours.

                    <span>If you are thinking of picking up this book because you'd like a cerebral thriller, don't. It's fast paced (2 day read) but very shallow and not particularly well researched.
<br />
<br />The fact that the Corgi edition paperback of "Digital Fortress" is covered with quotes praising "The DaVinci Code" and yet contains no glowing review snippets for "Digital Fortress" itself should be warning to the reader. This is a poor book.
<br />
<br />Brown's NSA seems to be populated by petty egomaniacs with no respect for protocol and rules. We are introduced at the beginning of the novel to characters that are supposed to be mentally brilliant. Our heroine is supposed to have a 170 IQ and everyone around her is exceptional in one way or another. Yet none of them can think clearly, and all seem to be severely emotionally retarded. Suffice it to say that identifying with, or forming an attachment to, any of the characters is not possible.
<br />
<br />The author gets the characters to use a lot of tech and crypto buzz words in order to lend them credibility. He falls wide of the mark however and ends up displaying his own poor understanding of crypto, security and other technical matters. Any reader with more than a passing knowledge of any of the subject matter (you know who you are!) will be frustrated by the inaccuracies contained in the book.
<br />
<br />Truly interesting concepts are not explored in any depth. The issue of privacy would have been something that Brown could have discussed intelligently without needing to resort to ill informed techno babble.
<br />
<br />Readers who would like a techno thriller that's well researched and more involving are advised to look elsewhere.

<br />"Applied Cryptography" by Bruce Schnier
<br />(Cryptography text by an industry expert and proponent of good public cryptography. This book is an education ;¬) )</span>

                    <span>Characters are not credible.
<br />
<br />No evidence of serious research.
<br />
<br />Plot is much too far-fetched. The action scenes become more and
<br />more ridiculous as the book goes on.</span>
