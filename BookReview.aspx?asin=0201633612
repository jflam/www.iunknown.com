                <span id="Label1"><I>Design Patterns</I> is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs.</span>

                    <span>This is, of course, one of the cornerstones of OOP. This book definitely influenced programmers at all levels and richly deserves the acclaim that it enjoys.
<br />However, this book is not for everyone, especially beginners. To be able to get the best out of this book, you need some solid experience in object oriented programming. This book is ideal for people who have been developers and are moving up to designers/architects. The foundation of real world experience makes a very good base for absorbing the experience captured in this book. 
<br />This book is not theoretical by any means. In fact, it captures the experience gained by many people in the course of their careers and offers practical solutions to typical problems encountered in software engineering, specifically object oriented  programming. 
<br />The material in the book is authoritative and terse and would be daunting to a newbie. Most of the explantions and examples are offered without much ado, and expect a certain level of not just knowledge from the reader but also awareness about practical applications and typical scenarios encountered in practice. 
<br />I would say that this book is suitable for full time object oriented programmers (whatever the language) with at least a couple of years of experience looking to further strengthen their knowledge of OOP systems and looking to gain an insight into the practical aspects of how to solve typical situations in real world projects. </span>

                    <span>... well, it's over. "Patterns" have not revolutionized the world. Nor does this book need to be "studied" for deep insights.
<br />
<br />What it seems patterns are actually good for is giving common names to popular solutions to problems, to make them easier to call to mind, and easier to discuss with others. Even this much is overrated. Before the advent of patterns, you could have said "callbacks" and people would have understood. Now you say "the Observer pattern".
<br />
<br />_Design Patterns_ is none the less valuable, because it is one of those few books that EVERYONE is expected to have read. This is helpful in practice, as you can expect everyone to be familiar with its vocabulary. Few books truly fall into this "required reading" category. The only other that comes to mind is the MIT algorithms text. Many tech pundits claim that every next book is "required reading", and the claim becomes tiring after a while, but this is one of the few that really is.
<br />
<br />I would not necessarily purchase it, though. The "pattern" schematic is verbose, and requires pages upon pages to describe something that, once you have seen it in practice once or twice, you will recogonize immediately. Omitting the appendixes, the book is barely 350 pages, and presents only 23 patterns. Only 5 or 6 of the patterns are truly famous: Singleton, Observer, Template Method... and a few more. A number of them are poorly presented. Chain of Responsibility, for instance, is just one of many ways to define an event framework and does not belong in a book that doesn't present the alternatives. Mediator is another; there must be dozens of ways to create a Mediator, which most people would call an "event registry" or something else, rather than a Mediator. "Mediator" itself is little more than a name, and won't help you in design.
<br />
<br />Some patterns are boring, since modern languages tend to provide them, and we've heard about them many times already: Iterator, Proxy, Memento (serialization), etc. Others, like Command, are geared towards GUIs, and provide little value to other types of applications. Then there are the State and Strategy patterns, which are two sides of the same coin, and needn't be given two different names.
<br />
<br />And so on. Definately do not "study" this book if it seems you "just don't get it". Chances are the book is wrong. It is worth a read through, and a second read through if the terminology doesn't stick the first time, but stop at that. My gut feeling is that this book is most appropriate for someone working on his or her first large project. After that, once the terminology sinks in, the book has little else to offer. And if taken dogmatically, or considered "inspired" or infallible, the book is a hindrance. Finally, overuse of patterns can result in a "kitchen sink" design, instead of a simple one that takes a few patterns, that may or may not be ones from this book, and implements them cleanly. Take the book for what it's worth, but remain skeptical.</span>

                    <span>This book is only for OOP black-belts, or those who wish to be.
<br />
<br />The information in this book should be common knowledge for any software architect and in fact is required reading (along with UML Distilled, Enterprise Patterns and Refactoring, all by Martin Fowler) for anyone who wishes to advance beyond "Developer" at my company. This is must-know information for both designing systems and being able to describe those systems to others. If you look closely at any WELL DESIGNED system, you will see that it is simply of composite of the patterns in this book, implemented in a thoughtful way.
<br />
<br />I have found few problems/issues/riddles in software design that cannot be addressed by the information in this book. It should be on EVERY serious developers bookshelf, or better yet, in their head!</span>

                    <span>I dont understand why this book is highly praised.  This book is overated.  First of all, the authors give little explanation to how these patterns are used.  After reading the patterns, I could not apply them to my code. The book is very hard to read.  If you are going to learn about design patterns, I suggest buying head first design patterns.    </span>

                    <span>I first read this book six years ago. It was the right time at my carrer. I had just finished a C++ project that hadn't gone so well.
<br />
<br />With all the failures of the project still fresh in my mind, it was easy to appreaciate how useful the book was. We could have used many of the concepts in the book in that project.
<br />
<br />And here is the catch of this type of book: it is not appreciated until you go through a project wihtout it. Giving it to a college student as reading assignment will be a waste of time. It is more useful to the professional with some experience under the belt.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it remains little read by professional programmers. It deserves a lot more attention and careful study.
