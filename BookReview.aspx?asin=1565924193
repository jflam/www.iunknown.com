                <span id="Label1">The appearance of the second edition of <I>CGI Programming with Perl</I>  heralds the beginning of the neoclassical era of Web service. CGI--or common  gateway interface--is the original back end for client-driven, dynamic Web-page  service and deserves consideration as the Romulus of the Internet Empire. But,  where first-edition author Gundavaram described the lonely Romulus laying the  brick foundation of dynamic Web-page service in 1996, second-edition  collaborators Guelich and Birznieks have pitched in to resurrect Romulus amid  the crowded streets of modern Rome. Why bother? Surely four years have brought  technological revolutions (Java, PHP, ASP, ColdFusion) that render CGI's  original brick-by-brick approach as obsolete as, say, Roman mythology--or bricks  and mortar.<p>  And yet not. It is an ambiguous blessing that the original CGI persists,  adhering to the underside of Web service by the duct tape that is Perl. This  point is not missed by Guelich, Gundavaram, and Birznieks, whose advocacy of CGI  is both bolstered by the growing applications module base of Perl and tempered  by their awareness of CGI's structural limitations. Both new and returning  readers of <I>CGI Programming with Perl</I> should browse the last chapter first  in order to appreciate the proposed solutions to CGI's greatest sin: its  impractical slowness in a world of a million-hits-per-day Web service. The  chapter describes CGI-compatible FastCGI and mod_perl technologies that  circumvent the process-spawning slowness of the simple CGI. Advanced users might  want to skip directly to O'Reilly's fine mod_perl tome, <I>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and  C</I>, by Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern.<p>  The authors' second pass at CGI pedagogy is a lucid, honest, and expanded  account that develops functionality of dynamic Web pages in a rational  progression--from HTML client-server and CGI syntax basics to general  input/output, forms, e-mail, graphics, and simple database applications,  including maintaining client state and data persistence under the otherwise  stateless HTTP protocol. The authors offer synopses of cookies, JavaScripting,  server security, and XML, all of which are described in detail in other  books.<p>  Whether or not neoclassical CGI is fast enough for your purposes--perhaps for  guarded intranets--bear in mind that CGI is the standard to which every other  Web server has had to respond. The second edition of <I>CGI Programming with  Perl</I> is still the best introduction to the classics. <I>--Peter Leopold</I></span>

                    <span>I purchased "CGI Programming with Perl" thinking it was, like many O'Reilly books, a bible of programming how-to for the working programmer. It's not. What it is, in fact, is a pretty good introduction to writing CGIs with Perl for someone who has some basic knowledge of Perl and HTTP, but who has never done any CGI programming. And that's just the position I was in when I bought it.<P>The first third of the book is introductory in nature, with an introduction to how forms and CGI scripts work, some discussion of parsing forms in other languages, and some simple examples. The bulk of the book contains more complex examples of tasks like writing questionaires, interfacing with relational databases, maintaining state, graphics and so forth. I did glean a lot of useful information there.<P>The biggest problem with this book is a problem that's really common to all book on Internet programming: Standards are changing so fast that a year old book is likely to contain chapter upon chapter illustrating obsolete techniques and libraries. In "CGI Programming" there are a lot of examples using Perl modules that haven't really caught on, while some of the newer modules (obviously) aren't meantioned. Another problem is that the book is kind of scattershot in the attention it gives different topics. <P>Still, I think this is one of the better books for someone with basic Perl skills looking to get started with CGIs. There's enough detail here to start writing CGIs, and enough information out there on the web to go on learning.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a very complete, well written description of CGI programming. It's informative reading and also makes a great reference.<P>There've been lots of CGI programming by example books out there that try to show you a few examples and go from there. As this book claims, its approach is to teach you to understand how things work and use examples to support this instead of the other way around. It's complete, and the topics it covers even extend beyond CGI programming to other forms of web programming (especially mod_perl but even Java too).<P>This book doesn't try to teach you Perl, but I've not seen a good book that succeeds in teaching both together. Perl isn't just for CGI programming and there's a lot to it. If you need an intro to Perl, buy "Learning Perl" by Randal Schwartz (also by O'Reilly)... it's not too long and very well written, and after reading that then you'll be ready to learn to apply Perl to CGI.<P>I looked at the errata and there were some errors in the initial printing, but they're fixed in my copy so I can hold that against them.</span>

                    <span>I've got the July 2000 printing and was amazed at the errata and the errata items yet to be "confirmed"! As an example of the latter, just beyond half-way through the book there's an address book cgi script some 10 pages in length of which only the first page or so is explained. The script is an attempt to use the Perl DBI along with the DBD::CSV modules (utilizing SQL statements) to explain the database role in "Data Persistance"! The problem is that the "getQueryResults" subroutine in the script doesn't return any records when searching for particular field values (and returns every record in the database if no values are entered in the "search" form). In addition the "doUpdate" module reports that an update has been completed when in reality there has been no change to the database! If you're planning on using the book to learn some CGI with Perl, then you're going to be set back by this and other code malfunctions scattered throughout the book!<P>Even though it's a step up from the CGI Primer Plus for Windows book (and gets a 4 star rating), it still leaves much to be desired for the person who learns by coding!</span>

                    <span>This book pales in comparison to Learning Perl and Programming Perl, which are both essential books to read before you can even attempt to understand the examples in CGI Programming. <P>The essential information contained can easily be discovered on countless internet tutorials, and with more depth. CGI Programming only skims over each topic, never going in to much depth, and the topics that it covers are much to varied and vast.<P>I own this book but rarely use it. By the time you have read Learning Perl and/or Programming Perl, you will find CGI Programming obsolete.</span>
