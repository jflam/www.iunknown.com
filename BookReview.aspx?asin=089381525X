                <span id="Label1">More then those of any other living photographer, Sebasti&atilde;o Salgado's images of the world's poor stand in tribute to the human condition. Salgado defines his work as "militant photography" dedicated to "the best comprehension of man"; over the decades he has bestowed great dignity on the most isolated and neglected among us-- from famine-stricken refugees in the Sahel to the indigenous peoples of South America.<br><br>With <i>Workers</i>, Salgado brings us a global epic that transcends mere image making to become an affirmation of the enduring spirit of working men and women. In this volume, three hundred fifty duotone photographs form an archaeological perspective of the activities that have defined hard work from the Stone Age through the Industrial Revolution to the present. With images of the infernal landscape of an Indonesian sulfur mine, the drama of traditional Sicilian tuna fishing, and the staggering endurance of Brazilian gold miners, Salgado unearths layers of visual information to reveal the ceaseless human activity at the core of modern civilization.<br><br><i>Workers</i> presents its subjects on several interactive levels: Salgado's introductory text expands his passionate photographic iconography, and extended captions, also written by Salgado, provide a historical and factual framework. Evoking the monumentality of Baroque sculpture, images of oil-fire fighters extinguishing Kuwaiti wells are informed by data detailing this perilous venture. Heroic photographs of Cuban and Brazilian peasants harvesting sugarcane are enriched by an overview of the history of the sugar trade, which documents centuries of colonialist exploitation.<br><br>On the eve of the millennium, <i>Workers</i> serves as an elegy for the passing of traditional methods of labor and production. Yet its ultimate message is one of endurance and hope: entire Indian families serve as construction crews to build a dam that will bring life to their land, and laborers using contemporary technology connect England and France through Eurotunnel. Honoring the timeless and indomitable spirit of the manual laborer, <i>Workers</i> renders the human condition with honesty and respect.<br></span>

                    <span>Salgado's eyes capture a world forgotten to most of us: a world where humanity is subjected to hard, unending labor. Here machines tower over their workers as hapless captives, as if man and machine have traded roles in some dark nightmare. And even amidst this bleak picture, Salgado has found a spark of humanity, still afire, testifying that their struggles are, in a way, still our own. An engrossing book.</span>

                    <span>Mere words cannot do justice to the images contained in this book. To describe them as powerful, moving and dramatic only hints at the impact that they can have on the sensitive viewer. Salgado has poured his heart and soul into these photographs, and it shows in the intense humanity contained therein. I find myself returning again and again to "Workers" and each time feeling greater empathy for the people whose lives of labor are so stunningly displayed. Salgado's technique and vision are unsurpassed, but it is his passion that makes these photos so awe inspiring. He has indeed performed a great service to manual laborers everywhere by showing their struggles to the rest of us, who now must accord them a very large measure of respect and admiration.</span>

                    <span>At first glance this book is very intimidating by size. I was overwhelmed by the amount of photos Salgado took of his subjects, which in this book were the workers around the world. As I flipped through each page I began to think of rather than looking at a book of a photographer's work, it seemed as if I was looking at a photo album dedicated to hard laborers. Each photo is extremely vivid and beautifully shot. In addition, each photo gives the impression that Salgado puts thought and emotion before shooting his subjects. This is apparent by the many angles he shot his subjects and more importantly the extreme close-up shots he had. In many of his pictures Salgado appears to capture not just the action of the subject, but the emotion and story as well. You can't help but sympathize for each worker. Furthermore you start to realize how much the world depends on this type of labor in order to move forward. In a sense, this entire book give a view into all the hard work it takes to create all the luxuries we take granted for. <P>The entire book itself is very high quality. Each picture is printed clearly and at a large scale to show each detail of Salgado's work. It's also neatly organized rather than photos jumbled everywhere. Photos are separated by the location where they are shot. Moreover, aside from the large scale photos in this book which take an entire spread, there are some fold-out pages that contain smaller photos which give it that "photo album" feel. <P>This book is evidence of how great of a photographer Sebastiao Salgado is.</span>

                    <span>These are some of the most powerful photographs ever made. They are at once disturbing, thought provoking and astonishingly beautiful. Salgado is a genius of the medium. He is one of the very few who has managed to elevate photography to a genuine art form. By comparison, the work of most other contemporary photographers seems like paint-by-numbers dreck.</span>

                    <span>Skin covered with goosebumps, I slowly turned each page of Workers while my lower lip trembled. I couldn't believe the power that those images had. <P>It's a big heavy volume worth every cent I paid for it. To be honest I was a little cautious when I saw the price, but my gamble paid off. The pages hold the detail and tone beautifully. Salgado drags you into the lives of these people from vast mines of thousands of workers to the effort of an individual. Looking into their eyes will appreciate not only what they go through, but how photography can take you anywhere.</span>
