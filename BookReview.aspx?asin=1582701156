                <span id="Label1">Begun in the late 1990s, the simplicity movement is growing faster than ever, as more people discover the sense of release and freedom that comes from clearing out unwanted items and straightening out chaotic homes and workplaces. Unclutter Your Life addresses visible clutter - jammed-full garages, messy desks, closets of old clothes - and exposes other kinds of "clutter" one may not see, such as unfinished taxes, stressful noise, environmental irritants, emotions such as guilt and worry, and even toxic relationships. These are obstacles in people's lives as surely as piles of newspapers or packed attics.   Written in a lively and entertaining manner, the book combines expert perspectives with stories and insights of ordinary people to help readers learn to let go of any possession they no longer really use or want; tackle difficult clutter issues such as what to do with gifts, heirlooms, paper, books, and clothing; attack invisible clutter with action and clarity; and make more room in their lives for beauty, spontaneity, and adventure.</span>

                    <span>Unclutter Your Life: Transforming Your Physical, Mental, And Emotional Space is an absolute must-read self-help book for the ever-looming, ever-confusing, and ever-demanding twenty-first century. It directly addresses how to take control of one's space, possions, priorities, relationships, and free time in order secure that which is most precious - the opportunity to focus on achieving one's goals and dreams. From learning to distinguish true friendships from toxic or parasitic relationships and disentangling oneself from the latter, to limiting the physical clutter of needless consumerism and consumption of knickknacks, to setting aside time for oneself despite the ever-present encroach of technology that blurs the distinction between work and home, and much more, Unclutter Your Life offers the best possible advice to reasonably become better organized and accomplish more with less mess.</span>

                    <span>While the author is not a therapist, she has much to teach the mental health community in this ground breaking work.<BR>It's been all too easy to clutter my life with possessions, projects, papers, and people. Until I read Unclutter Your Life, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of space ...physically and emotionally...that I was "renting" to things that I don't need in my life. What's really amazed me is that I've put many of Gibson's "clutter buster" suggestions to the test, and they work! I can see clearly now.</span>
