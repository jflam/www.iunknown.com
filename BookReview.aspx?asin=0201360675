                <span id="Label1"><I>Using UML</I></B></U>is designed to help any developer master effective software design with UML. This new edition has been fully revised to reflect UML 1.3.Experienced modeling language instructors Perdita Stevens and Rob Pooley focus on superior design techniques, comparing the available methodologies and offering advice on when to use each. They begin by describing the software process and lifecycle, and explaining how object-orientation and component-based engineering affect the design process. Next, they review each key UML 1.3 feature, including patterns, components, concurrency, types, and more.<I>Using UML, Revised Edition</I></B></U>contains extensive case studies of real-life design, including real-time systems, data-oriented, and component-based designs. The book also contains a full section addressing the wider issues related to software design, including quality, testing, and organizational management. (Previous Edition: 0-201-36067-5.)For every developer interested in mastering UML.   </span>

                    <span>If you have a general idea of SDLC, this is a perfect book for you. It doesn't bring you into detail but good enough to give you a general idea of all the static and dynamic diagrams. This is also a great book for students who do not want to dig too deep into a concept and not knowing how to apply them.<p>EQ.</span>

                    <span>I found this book very hard to read at times, and tedious at other times. If you can stick with it long enough, it starts to make sense, and there as a ton of very good information to be found. It is well written and logically organised, I just wish it were a bit more enjoyable to read.</span>

                    <span>This book touches on all the right subjects but does not go -in my opinion- deep into any. I like the sequence in which the information is organised and presented. It is nice to include case studies, but I am not sure about the completeness of the case studies or if, in fact, these can be implemented from the design provided. It is a novelty to provide discussion topics very often throughout the text, but it would have been better, if not essential, to discuss the issues in the text or direct us to some other resource where the discussions take place. All in all, there are other books that do the job better of introducing UML or discussing advanced issues, but this text is probably the best to be used on an undergraduate course. Its value to software engineers in the industry, though, is questionable.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book is written in an Question/Answer format (i.e., FAQ).  Very different from the rest of the UML topics, narrative or reference styles provided in most UML books.  Unfortunately, the price seems a little steep,  until you consider that there are some valuable bits of information in this  book that seem to be missing from most UML books.  Mostly the  "why?" of UML.  That makes the book worth every penny.  If you  are deep into UML and want answers to some of the more obscure issues, this  is a good book to read through.</span>
