                <span id="Label1">Back in 1993, the editor-turned-designer Kate Spade made a splash in the fashion world by turning out a small collection of boxy, utilitarian handbags, each elegantly accented with her name stitched in discreet, lowercase letters. As a result, the simplicity and unabashed refinement of the Spade moniker on those Lilliputian labels has come to define the very foundation on which the designer has since built a fashion empire, one that now, in addition to handbags, includes shoes, clothing, and smart home things, all of which embody the Spade formula of timeless style--a seamless merging of cheerful colors, clean shapes, and well-chosen embellishments. Not bad for a Kansas City-born girl who used to comb vintage stores for fun. Having perfected and expertly marketed her own brand of personal style (one that has famously been counterfeited throughout the world), the designer has emerged with an equally elegant trio of books whose topics Spade has become a virtual authority:  <I>Style</I>, <I>Occasions</I>, and <I>Manners</I>. <p>  Spade overhauls and replenishes our wardrobes in and celebrations in <I>Occasions</I>. With <I>Manners</I>, the designer steers us through the more sensitive arena of etiquette, showing us how to pull it all together with grace and style. Common conundrums like tipping, thank-you notes, and maneuvering embarrassing moments like "toothsome tidbits" (spinach between your teeth) are all succinctly addressed. But Spade picks up where Emily Post left off by dealing with more modern mysteries like "Cell Hell" and sample sales with wit and wisdom. Best of all the approach is decidedly un-preachy, which makes this new twist on the manners mix a fun read.  <I>--Christene Barberich</I></span>

                    <span>Kate Spade's "Manners" is a delightful book. After reading "Manners", I was left with ideas about how to incorporate politeness and respect for others back into my busy and fast paced life. Ms. Spade gives a number of wonderful suggestions for displaying manners in the business world, at home, while staying with friends, etc. I also loved that she included etiquette rules for when traveling to foreign countries. <P>"Manners" succeeds in reminding its readers that how you treat others has a strong impact on the quality of your life. While this book is not designed to compete with Emily Post's writings or other etiquette anthologies, it is a lovely reminder to readers that thoughtfulness and kindness can bring yourself and others much joy in your day to day lives. <P>"Manners" will make a wonderful addition to your book collection. Kudos to Kate Spade for a job well done!</span>

                    <span>When I first heard that Kate Spade was delving into the world of book publishing I was skeptical and I was correct. After reading this installment and the other 2 in the series, "Occasions" and "Style" I have come to the conclusion that Kate should stick to what she knows, designing handbags and accessories. While the illustrations are quite charming the book lacks substance. These books would be better titled "Kate and Andy's Favorite Things" or better yet "How to be the Perfect WASP Wannabe". It's all a bit too contrived for me. My advice would be to save your money and buy a handbag instead.</span>

                    <span>Kate Spade is no etiquette expert, which may be why this dull little book seems to have no viewpoint and seems to be basically a lightly rewritten selection of other etiquette books. Does the world really need another book on "how to behave" written by a superrich socialite with little or no contact with the real world? I say no. Plus, Kate Spade really has nothing to say on this subject. Now, all that said, it is a very lovely-to-look-at book, which says to me that Spade should stick to what she knows: design.</span>
