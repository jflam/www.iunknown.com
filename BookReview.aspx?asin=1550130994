                    <span>This is a good book on composition and related matters but Freeman Patterson has a much better one in "Photographing the World Around You: A Visual Design Workshop".  Buy that one instead of this. This book would rate about a B, B+ or at best an A- whereas the other would be solidly in the "A" category.  Freeman's text is clear and easy to understand and his photo's are fine but the other book is better in all ways IMHO.</span>

                    <span>Of all the photography books I own, this easily rates as <br>the worst. It seems more concerned with the author and his<br>interpretations of images than it does teaching/demonstrating<br>ways to improve your work. "You may have a different<br>emotional response to brown than I have". Too damn right I do.<br>Maybe the author is a good photographer in his own right, but<br>it comes across very poorly here.<p>Overall the photos are pretty uninspiring, dull sombre colours,<br>abstract subjects that are hard on the eye, uninteresting compositions ... and so it goes on.<p>It's all oppinions I suppose in photography, but I suggest<br>your hard earned cash is better spent elsewhere. <br>"Photographic Composition" by Grill & friends is how it <br>should be done, or try "Composition Techniques" by Ernst Wildi.<p>Regards,<p>Adrian</span>

                    <span>Take this book as an inspiration. It offers you new appraoches for the search of subjects and the way to cature them on film.<br>The book is relatively poor in instruction and something like "swirl your camera with an open shutter at its strap but be carefull that the strap is carefully fixed" can only be taken as an invitation to be more creative. And jumping up and down in a forrest with your camera's shutter open might also not be everybody's idea of innovative photography.<br>You need to like Freeman Patterson's photos in their simplicity to appreciate his explanations. I do, and I like the book as well!</span>

                    <span>I had hit a wall in my photography. I was uninspired. This book helped a lot.  This book can aid you in seeing in abstract form. He offers exercises. This book is fantastic.</span>

                    <span>This book is mainly for advanced photographers who have a thorough knowledge of the basics of photographic composition and are looking to explore new areas.  It's goal is to get you to extend your techniques beyond the usual and develop your own personal style.  The basics of composition are addressed only in a cursory fashion.<p>For a beginning to intermediate photographer like myself, it would help to have a solid grasp of composition before departing from it. If this is your situation, then you would be better served by "Photograhic Composition" by Grill and Scanlon (which is currently in print) or better yet "Image:Designing Effective Pictures" by Michael Freeman.  The latter book is by far the best discussion of composition that I've read.  Unfortunately, it's no longer in print, so you'll have to find a used copy.</span>
