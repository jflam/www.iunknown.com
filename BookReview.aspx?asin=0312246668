                    <span>Kenneth Davids writes a lot of information on history and the art of making espresso coffee.  The only thing that really bothered me was his method of writing.  At times it was very clear, then it dropped off when it became more interesting, almost like "running out of room." The section on machines and equipment was fairly good, but it didn't give more details on each type of machine.<p>The source section was very limited on where to buy machines or coffee.  Could have been better at rating coffee and machines.<br>The book was a little hard to read with very small type, and the monotone brown color of the illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Ken Davids writes with his usual engaging style and authority in terms of "cuisine de caffeine" [this is, after all, one of three of his coffee guides.] The style of the book itself, however, makes this a sometimes less than coherent read. Numerous sidebars [or, espresso breaks] weave their way throughout the volume, causing the reader to page forward and back through the text in an attempt to follow the thread of the conversation. <p>There's good stuff here -- and frankly I wish every barista wannabe behind the counter would be required to read it. If only somebody would revoke the publisher's stylistic license....</span>

                    <span>Pretty much tells history of coffee.  Provides in depth information on how to buy Espresso blends (various characteristics).  Also explains the history of how Espresso was developed along with the machines that make it the joy it is.  The author has a subtle humor which makes the book fun to read while teaching you about Coffee.</span>

                    <span>Kenneth Davids has written an excellent book about the history of coffee and espresso and its development into a western cultural phenomenon. He describes all phases of coffee and espresso production and refinement from  cultivation to recipes for use. An excellent read for a beginner or coffee  guru.</span>
