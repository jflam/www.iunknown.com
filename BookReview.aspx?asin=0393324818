                    </div>
                    <span>Let's see ... as of April 2005 Jeremy Brown (one of the picks highly touted by Billy Beane in the 2002 draft and detailed in Chapter 2 of the book) is playing double-A ball with the Midland RockHounds.  His stats for 2004 were .256 BA, six home runs and 49 RBI.
<br />
<br />As of April 2005 Jeremy Bonderman (2001 1st round pick for the A's; this pick so enraged Beane that he threw a telephone through the wall, and in part led to the dismissal of the scouting director) is 2-2 for the Detroit Tigers, with a 4.28 ERA.  In 2004 he was 11-13 with a 4.89 ERA.  He has been starting games for the Tigers since 2003.
<br />
<br />It's a bit too early to say that Bonderman will be a success or Brown a failure, but this and other examples in Moneyball lead a questioning mind to wonder if Beane may be using sabermetrics to an extreme.  Unfortunately the author doesn't question anything in this book.  His writing is filled with slavish praise for Beane and his like-minded front office, and derision for those who haven't embraced sabermetrics fully.  The book also doesn't mention the effect of the A's pitching trio (Mulder, Hudson, Zito) on the team's success.  As a result, I agree with an earlier review that this book resembles a PR piece more than an unbiased review of Beane's methods.  Even as the author admits he "fell in love with the story", being more objective or even playing devil's advocate on occasion would have this a much more interesting read.  Disappointing book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for baseball fans, or for anyone who loves a good underdog story.  If you're the latter, you'll find yourself rooting for the Oakland Athletics as they march towards the playoffs with a $40 million payroll, one of the lowest in the leagues and less than a quarter of what the Yankees spend on their roster.  The fascinating thing about this sports book is that most of the action takes place in the GM's office, not on the field.  But that doesn't make it any less exciting.  Reading the play-by-play of how Billy Beane orchestrates a deal for an undervalued minor league prospect can be just as gripping as a bottom-of-the-ninth playoff situation.
<br />
<br />What is really fascinating about this book is the notion that you can analyze the game without ever watching it, that the value of a player can be found in the box scores without ever seeing him play.  And there is something truly satisfying, something so American, about the notion that spending lots of money doesn't necessarily guarantee success.  In this book the little guy comes out ahead, or at least has a fighting chance.

                    <span>there was a general manager of the A's.  He had all the physical talent he needed to become a great professional baseball player, yet he was defeated by his own mind when he went up to bat.  While those around him with less physical gifts rose to greatness, he took the less-travelled road of baseball administration.  This book  starts by contrasting the man's entry into professional baseball and his entry into a new paradigm in the art of picking the right players for a professional baseball team.  It seems to be continuously answering the question: what makes a professional baseball player successful?  In this book the author notes the attributes that made the main character falter whereas his peers (e.g. Daryl Strawberry) went on to greatness.  Wonderfully entertaining book for which I made time to read every night.</span>

                    <span>Moneyball refers to the growing practice in the MLB, spearheaded by Billy Beane and the Oakland A's front office, to exploit market inefficiences which undervalue over-performing players by paying them less than what they're otherwise worth until the market catches up, at which point, those players will be traded and new undervalued players acquired.  It is a fascinating subject, partly because it is unbelievable that no baseball insider before the late '90s blew the whistle on the ineffective and expensive manner in which baseball was (is) recruiting players.
<br />
<br />Secondarily, the book focuses on the rise of Bill James and other amateur statisticians and the use of their work by Moneyball GMs like Beane.  I thought the book was a page turner because these subjects were so interesting.  However, the author rolled out his best attempts to make these subjects boring and dense with his overly verbose writing style.  Is he writing for meatheads because he hits the reader over the head with a baseball bat (no pun intended) over-explaining every obvious concept.  Likewise, even though the reader can predict where the plot is turning, he has to tell you before it turns, just in case you might miss it.  Furthermore, the book is disorganized and several grammatical errors led me to believe his editor was out to lunch.  
<br />
<br />The writer's most notable offense, however, is his repeat babbling explanations of concepts that he had explained ad nauseum in prior pages.  At points, I wanted to scream, I GET IT ALREADY!  Simply put, it's been a long time since I've read a book where the author does his best to bore you.
<br />
<br />One substantive flaw in the book occurs towards the end, when the author essentially concludes that it is the continued thick-headedness of non-moneyball General Managers which allow Moneyball GMs like Beane, Paul DePodesta and Theo Epstein to continue to exploit the market inefficiencies.  But the logical corollary to this theory is that if the other GMs "smarten up" and operate in a moneyball fashion, will the lower-budget teams like the A's stop winning as bigger-budget teams more effectively compete for the (previously)undervalued players?  It's clear that the author disagrees with Bud Selig's conclusions about the ability of low-budget teams to compete fairly with high-budget teams.  But the writer doesn't explain whether Selig will "become" right if big budget teams begin playing moneyball and valuing players in the same fashion as Beane and his cohorts do.</span>

                    <span>In Moneyball, author Michael Lewis sets out to show how you can win as a major-league franchise when your roster looks more like the Bad News Bears than a professional outfit. Whether or not he convinces you the reader of his purpose is up to you (I don't necessarily agree with it), but it makes an interesting and illuminating read.
<br />
<br />In many ways, it is an alternative history of baseball in the modern era: in a time when home-run sluggers are prized above all else (nevermind how they got those homers), the Oakland A's of Billy Beane take a different tact. Smallball is king in Beane's view, one that he formed while as a member of the Oakland management team. Beane's own brief career is documented by Lewis, as well as the rise of baseball stats guru Bill James and the cult of numbers he helped inspire (sabremetrics). Beane is one of the few baseball men who not only reads James's theories, but tries to apply them to his team.
<br />
<br />The story almost speaks for itself: at the time of writing, the A's had managed to continuously appear in the playoffs. Doubters will scoff that Beane's methods fail in the long run: where are the World Series rings? The fact that a small-market team like the A's can manage a run like they have, with the limited resources they have, seems to be overshadowed by that glaring lack of wins when it counts.
<br />
<br />And so, without denying the veracity of James's arguements as they are presented in the book, I personally didn't buy Beane's approach. Too often, it seemed, Beane and his cohorts were reducing the game on the field to a series of continuous data sheets, typing out the player's ability to get on base over their ability to hit home runs or run the bases. While it's good to try and overthrow some of the baseball "traditions" that have actually served to harm the modern game, Moneyball offers a solution that is almost "scorched earth" in its approach: throw out the old rules and concentrate on stats previously ignored.
<br />
<br />On some level, Moneyball doesn't necessarily champion Beane's approach, but Lewis plays into the hands of the A's by (inadvertantly by his postscript account) making Beane out to be a wizard at figuring out the game. This is the same Beane who traded Johnny Damon to the Red Sox (readers in the post-Red Sox Series win last year could be forgiven for laughing a little at Beane's short-sightedness). This is the same Beane who traded two of his "big Three" pitchers in the past offseason. This is the same Beane who struggles to manage what little cash he has, and he is prone to mistakes. While Lewis doesn't shy from that side of the equation, he almost never addresses the failures of Beane's system as much as its successes. There is something unique about Beane's approach, that is for sure. But Lewis almost destroys his own arguement by leaving out those details that don't fit with his hypothesis. 
<br />
<br />Also, for a baseball book "Moneyball" is totally lacking in terms of giving the reader a "feel" for the team in question. Beane and his hired helpers are (rightly or wrongly) the focus of the tome, to the exclusion of players like Barry Zito or Tim Hudson. In a way, it's misleading to list it as a "sports book"; it would be a more accurate fit on the business list.
<br />
<br />All in all, "Moneyball" is a flawed but necessary read for those wondering what modern sports culture is all about. You come away from it feeling some sympathy for the way Billy Beane has to run his business, but you don't get a feel for the players affected by that business. You never really see the success on the field; you just get Beane and Lewis telling you "it works". That part of the equation keeps me from endorsing this as accurate or solid. But it will challenge your view of our nation's pastime for the better, as you learn what smaller teams have to sacrifice in order to surivive.
