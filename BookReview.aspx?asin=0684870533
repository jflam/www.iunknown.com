                <span id="Label1"><P> In his seminal work <I>The Clash of Civilizations</I> and the <I>Remaking of World Order,</I> Samuel Huntington argued provocatively and presciently that with the end of the cold war, "civilizations" were replacing ideologies as the new fault lines in international politics. <P> His astute analysis has proven correct. Now Professor Huntington turns his attention from international affairs to our domestic cultural rifts as he examines the impact other civilizations and their values are having on our own country. <P> America was founded by British settlers who brought with them a distinct culture including the English language, Protestant values, individualism, religious commitment, and respect for law. The waves of immigrants that later came to the United States gradually accepted these values and assimilated into America's Anglo-Protestant culture. More recently, however, national identity has been eroded by the problems of assimilating massive numbers of primarily Hispanic  immigrants, bilingualism, multiculturalism, the devaluation of citizenship, and the "denationalization" of American elites. <P> September 11 brought a revival of American patriotism and a renewal of American identity. But already there are signs that this revival is  fading, even though in the post-September 11 world, Americans face unprecedented challenges to our security. <P> <I>Who Are We?</I> shows the need for us to reassert the core values that make us Americans. Nothing less than our national identity is at stake. <P> Once again Samuel Huntington has written an important book that is certain to provoke a lively debate and to shape our national conversation about who we are.\</span>

                    <span>Huntington is to be commended for writing such a great book.  As we learn in elementary school, Truth is not an opinion or a matter of interpretation.    
<br />
<br />The U.S.A. is only nation with a unguarded 2,000 border with a massive 3rd world nation.  Europe, Japan, Australia, etc are by geography separated from the 3rd world.   
<br />
<br />If you do not believe that U.S. is next a massive 3rd world nation, all you have to do is walk over the Texas or California border with Mexico.  
<br />
<br />The streets are unpaved, children sleeping on the streets, shanties towns on hills, massive over-population.   A few steps and you are crossing from a developed nation to poor, polluted, corrupt, 3rd world nation.  
<br />
<br />The simple truth is that Mexicans bring the 3rd world to the U.S.  Mexicans in U.S. have incredibly low economic, academic, and social achievements in the U.S.  
<br />
<br />The are surely NOT over-represented in colleges, medicine or Nobel Prize winners but are surely over-represented picking strawberries, working the night shift at Burger-King, McDonald and Taco Bell.  
<br />
<br />Americans are getting the 3rd world of crime, poverty, low-achievement when Mexicans bring Mexico to the U.S.
<br />
<br />Huntington avoids the one letter word at the heart of the issue:  IQ = 85.   Mexicans have an IQ centered around 85.  Fifteen points below the norm of medians of average Americans of 100.  IQ 85 versus IQ 100 can mean a great deal in terms of achievement.  
<br />
<br />IQ is fixed by Nature.  Nature made human beings and Nature endowed Mexicans with an IQ of 85.    Unpleasant but True and unlikely to change tomorrow.   
<br />
<br />Truth is not an opinion.  The U.S. is bordered by a massive, poverty-stricken 3rd world nations at its southern border.  With an IQ of 85, Mexicans bring low achievements, low level of success to U.S.  The simple quesiton is:  do you want live in the 3rd?  Do you want the U.S. to turn into a 3rd world nation?</span>

                    <span>Do we have a National Identity? Can't a National Identity change over time?  If we didn't expect our nation to change over time, then the constitution would not have permitted the amendment process. 
<br />
<br />Disccusing all sides of what makes up our National Identity and our cultural values is important.  We do not want to forget who we were nor who we are.  Perhaps it is important to remember from a biologist's point of view we are all "Out of Africa"
<br />
<br />This book begins the discussion and evokes much thought. America is what America chooses to be.  </span>

                    <span>Sam Huntington gave us the phrase "clash of civilizations", which seems to descibe the post-cold war world. Now he has written an intentionally provocative book about the threat to American identity of multiculturalism and multi-lingualism. Even if he overstates his case, what he talks about must be discussed and cannot be swept uder the carpet. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Aside from any polemic agenda which may be seen in this book Huntington poses thought provoking issues that verbalize what many people often feel.  My reading is that an American "Creed" is not sufficient to hold a national identity.  It may be easy to attack him for saying that.  The "Creed" need to be anchored with more visceral, tangible qualities.  A good accompanying work to this book is John O. King's "The Iron of Melancholy" which outlines the origings of the settler religious psychology.  </span>

                    <span>Anyone arguing that the Founders' intent was for the US to be Christian anything is a revisionist. This nation is not founded on Christianity in any way. The Founders said it themselves repeatedly, were very public about the basis for American values, which obviously everyone else agreed with. It does not take a degree in history, or even a high school diploma, to know what the Founders intended. Anyone can literally just ask them. Their words, written and from speechs, are publically available.</span>
