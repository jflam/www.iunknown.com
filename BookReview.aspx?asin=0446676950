                <span id="Label1">" Many a starry-eyed megalomaniac has followed the siren song of Wall Street. Money, prestige, and power await them as they waltz off into the promised land...or so they think. They soon discover that the seductive sirens are actually a band of bowlegged sea hags. The promised land, it turns out, is always one more twenty-hour workday and another lap dance away. MONKEY BUSINESS is the hilarious confession of two young investment bankers, John Rolfe and Peter Troob, of what it's like at ground zero on The Street. Forget what you've read, forget what you've heard, forget what you've been taught. MONKEY BUSINESS pulls off Wall Street's suspenders and gives the reader the inside skinny on what working at an investment bank is all about. <P>Fresh out of Wharton and Harvard business schools, the authors ran willingly into the open arms of investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Once there, they discovered themselves foot soldiers in an investment banking army of overworked and frustrated lemmings furiously trying to spin straw into gold. Escaping with their sanity only partially intact, John and Peter have perfectly captured the chaotic essence of the Wall Street carnival and the outlandish personalities that make it all hum. <P>Uncensored, unsanitized, and uncut, MONKEY BUSINESS is as riotous as Animal House. It's more fun than a co-ed slumber party, and it's the smartest, most entertaining investment that you'll make this year."</span>

                    <span>Having worked in that socially Darwinist and cutthroat institution we call Wall Street, I can attest that this book has it right. Besides being accurate and hilarious, the book is replete with investment banking lingo--hell, there's even a chapter dedicated to valuation!</span>

                    <span>A lot of people compare this book to Liar's Poker, and with good reason.  Both tell the tales of young MBAs and their experiences at invesment banks.  The big difference here, is that this book answers the question of what it's like to be a junior investment banker in your first year.  Liar's Poker is more of a book about the climate on Wall Street in the Reagan years, spliced with personal stories.  Monkey Business is ALL personal stories, most of them quite funny, about what you can expect if you're considering being a junior investment banker at a bulge-bracket firm.
<br />
<br />Of all the Wall Street books I've read (I've read several) this one offers the least insight into the financial climate of the times, what kind of business was being done, etc.  It's basically a diary of two guys, one who worked on Wall Street and should have known better, and one rookie to the world of I-banking, from enrolling in top-tier MBA programs to their last frustrating days as co-workers at DLJ.   Because of this, it's a quick read and highly relatable.  </span>

                    <span>being a 20-something in nyc, you're just surrounded by friends in banking, complete with cufflinks, corporate cars, and $1250+ monthly rent.  sometimes, though, it's really hard to understand why anything (even in the name of saving someone's life) would make someone stay at work overnight, fly all over the place, ruin their physique w/beer and bad food, whine loads, and party until 3 in the morning.  the money definitely flowed freer back in the day, when the book was written, but the work concept hasn't.  you might still be miffed when your banker friends (or your overworked son/daughter) call to cancel on dinner, but at least you'll have have an idea of what on earth's keeping them after reading this absolute riot of a book.  (and warning to the conservative: bankers are only marginally more civilized than traders, so don't expect purist language or stories.)</span>

                    <span>It's not often that a book can make me laugh outloud but this one did just that on multiple occasions. The authors' descriptions of their lives as associates gives a different perspective on what's viewed by most outsiders as a glamorous job. The book is engaging throughout and is a quick read. I highly reccomend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the inner workings of the I-banking world.</span>

                    <span>Wow.  Such blatant mysogeny is surprising in the 21st century.  I was getting annoyed by it, and then the language suddenly turned extremely vulgar and borderline homophobic, too.  Unapologetic descriptions of company sponsored visits to strip clubs and sexual harassment are what made me eventually decide it was not worth any more of my time.</span>
