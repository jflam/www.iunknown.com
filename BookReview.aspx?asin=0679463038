                <span id="Label1">Ordinary middle-class Americans have often tried to assuage their jealousy of the rich by repeating the axiom "money can't buy happiness" to themselves. But according to <I>New Republic</I> senior editor Gregg Easterbrook, "the rich" are, in fact, those same ordinary middle-class Americans and no, they're not happy at all. Wages have soared over the past fifty years and regular citizens own large homes, new cars, and luxuries aplenty. Better still, the environment, with a few exceptions, is getting cleaner, crime is on the decline, and diseases are being wiped out as life span increases. So why do people report a sense that things are getting steadily worse and that catastrophe is imminent? Easterbrook presents a few psychological rationales, including "choice anxiety," where the vastness of society's options is a burden, and "abundance denial," where people somehow manage to convince themselves that they are deprived of material comforts. The sooner we accept how good we have it, the better off the whole world will be, he says, because if we would just realize that we have this wealth, we could be using it to alleviate hunger, provide health care for the millions who lack it, and otherwise address the ills that actually do exist. While at times the book's attempts to make the world a better place seem a bit of a stretch, it's admirable that Easterbrook is willing to make that stretch and not suggest people simply light up cigars and bask in their newly discovered joys. One might look a bit askance at some of Easterbrook's sunny perspectives on our societal fortunes--he celebrates rampant consumerism while skating past the rampant consumer debt that lies beneath it, for instance--but it's hard to deny that the pessimistic viewpoint is much more widely stated than that of optimists. Is the glass really half empty or should we, as Easterbrook indicates, enjoy the wonderful world in which we secretly live? --<I>John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>This book is eloquently written, with a subject that is both inspiring and troubling. Mr. Easterbrook writes about how today's population is gaining in many indicators of quality of life, yet seems to be declining in our ability to gain happiness. It's a book that will appeal to many different audiences, not just the Washington policy wonk crowd. It really makes you think about the meaning of our lives, and what we can do to make ourselves happier and America a better place for all. Plus, there's even some humor in it, which is always a plus.</span>

                    <span>As one who is growing to question our consumer culture more and more with each passing year, I was genuinely intrigued when I cam across "The Progress Paradox." I think Easterbrook makes a valid case that, when looking at things with historical hindsight, we are in many ways better off than our ancestors. It is difficult to argue with his litany of improvements in health care, education, conveniences, access to information, etc. Given this, Eaterbrook then explores the issue of why so many of us appear to be more unhappy than our ancestors. He offers that our cultural experience of gratitude has eroded, and we simply have come to expect more, and appreciate less.<P><BR>This is well and good, but "Progress Paradox" fails in one glaring way. It paints a picture of the "good life" of the average U.S. citizen, but then sidesteps an important and idisputable trend -- over the last several decades, the U.S. has experienced unprecedented consolidation of wealth in the hands of the elite few. If the life of the "average" U.S. citizen is so good, then why shouldn't the wealthiest Americans be happy to embrace this lifestyle (with gratitude!) and joyfully pay taxes to help support the public good? I may be wrong, but my suspicion is that Easterbrook may be either intentionally or unwittingly helping the elite classes maintain their priveleged status. Focusing on how average Americans are better off than previous genertions may, in the end, be an effective way to deflect public consciousness away from issues of growing inequality.<P><BR>I am all for an "attitude of gratitude" -- provided that it is practiced by all, including the elite. If the average American lifestyle has so vastly improved over the years, then why should there be such a push towards hoarding more and wealth at the top, and doggedly defending tax cuts for the wealthy? In the year 1973, real (inflation adjusted) wages of American workers began to fall for the first time, and they have not kept pace with economic growth since. In the meantime, we now see a nation where the wealthiest one-percent own a whopping 40 percent of the available wealth. Globally, the top 200 corporations (out of 45,000 or so) pull in 25% of the profit from the world economy. So again I say, if "average" Americans never had it so good, then why the obsessive pursuit of more and more wealth at the top? I'll practice my "attitude of gratitude" when I see the wealthiest Americans saying, "You know, we really CAN live comfortably and well with far less than we have -- By God, we have a key role to play in maintaining the public good, and we'll pay our taxes with a profound happiness in knowing that our legacy has been to improve the lot of others, and not dwell on our selffish interests." Now THERE'S a real "attitude of gratitude!"</span>

                    <span>Greg Easterbrook informs readers that our perceptions of life today are wrong. By every objective measure such as life span, overall health, income levels, housing, luxuries, leisure time, etc., life is better today than it ever has been. So why aren't we happier than ever?<P>The first few chapters explain how life is better than ever, which left me feeling quite inspired and grateful to have been born now vs. in the past. No matter how much we romanticize the past, life is just better today! <P>Small personal note here, I think that I may disagree with him a little bit. I believe my parent's generation did do a little better than us. Almost everyone my age were kids when their parents were my age, and we remember our houses when we were kids being bigger, and generally having better vacations, cars, etc., then we can afford now that we are that age. But that may be peculiar to just my social circle.<P>The following chapters discusses new problems brought about by improved living conditions, such as traffic, noise, feeling rushed, too many choices to make, etc. All are better to deal with than the old problems that had existed before. They also deal with why people, who are living better than 99% of the people who have ever existed, aren't happier than they are. Lack of spirituality, lots of spare time to be depressed, and a constant barrage of negative news seem to be the answer. This is one of the reasons I find it difficult to watch the news any more. It's 24 hours a day of terrorism, war, crime, death, global warming, and predictions of bad things that will come.<P>The last couple of chapters is where Mr. Easterbrook misses the mark. He points out we still have serious problems like lack of universal health care and poverty. He is alluding that government should step in and solve these problems, not realizing he is contradicting almost everything prior in the book. Our lives have improved largely due to freedom and the marketplace allowing us to create and grow richer. Why does he believe gov't is the solution to these other problems? Why not turn the marketplace loose on these problems instead so people can find ways to enrich themselves by helping others? <P>I also believe he doesn't explain what poverty is in the US today. If your family of four lives in a two bedroom apartment, with power, heat, tv and no one starving, does that sound like being poor? Well, that's how many poor families in the US live today. That lifestyle would be considered well off in much of the rest undeveloped world, and living very well considering the lives of people of generations past. <P>Overall, I enjoyed the book and have become more appreciative of just how lucky we are today.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent, well-researched and uplifting book. Easterbrook has an amazing command of his material, and a fresh, positive perspective that I found to be a nice change from the daily litany of woe one hears from the media. The book is well-written and easy to read. <P>P.S. I also enjoy Gregg's football column on NFL.com.</span>

                    <span>2500 years ago, Siddhartha enunciated the law of Dukkha,<BR>having realized how unsatisfactoriness is inherent in all<BR>sensory experience.

If this book<BR>had shown a little more insight into the sociobiological<BR>necessity of insatiable craving for species survival, <BR>it might have been more than just an interesting read.<BR>Perhaps a dialog with Barbara Ehrenreich of 'Nickel and<BR>Dimed' would help to educate the author a little about<BR>the realities of actual life and work.</span>
