                    <span>In the book Brian's Winter by Gray Phaulson, a 13 year old boy gets stuck on an island by himself; after a plane crash. This book is interesting and exciting. <BR>Brian Robeson had just been in a plane crash on his way to visit his father.

Using his intelligence, his instincts, and the only weapon he had a hatchet. As he lives through the fall he learns to make a fort to live in, a bow and arrowheads. He also leaned how to hunt.

Another reason why this book is exciting is because; he lives every day of his life that he is stranded as in adventure. Those are just some of this novels major strength.<BR>In other words this novel was interesting and exciting because of what Robeson does and what happens to him.

                    <span>In Brian's Winter, Brian Robeson a 13-year-old boy stranded in the Canadian Wilderness. Learning how to survive on his own. He makes himself a home to sleep and eat. He hunts for food using the tools that he made. He used bow arrows to hunt his dinner and his knife to skin them. Plus it is winter and his clothes are ripped up almost. His clothing is bad. He uses rabbit's skin and deerskin for clothing. He makes snowshoes to walk around in the snow. One last thing he is stranded for 94 days all alone. <P>What I liked about this story is that it is descriptive; when he kills the moose and skins it. Also when he learns how to make bow arrows, snow shoes. I like this book because it keeps you hanging at the end of each chapter. What I liked about is that you can imagine all the things that Brian does in the wilderness. What I didn't like about the book is sometimes there is nothing going on and it is boring. What I didn't like about the book is when he describes in details when he skins the moose. He is very descriptive then. <BR>The genre of this book is Realistic Fiction. I would probably give it from a scale of 1-5, a four. I like the book, but parts of it was boring. Also some parts you can easily misunderstand. Some parts you can imagine how he feels, just the way he talks. Also when he acts you can understand, why acts that way. All in all I liked this book; I really enjoyed reading this book.</span>
