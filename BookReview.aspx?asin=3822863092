                <span id="Label1">Jungles are mysterious and even threatening places, among the least explored landscapes on the earth--and just the sort of place, therefore, that you might expect to find the ever-intrepid wildlife photographer Frans Lanting. "The tropical forest may be a naturalist's paradise," he writes, "but for a photographer it can be a nightmare. Once you are inside it is all blood, sweat, and leeches. Whatever you take into the forest becomes part of the food chain, whether it is your equipment or yourself."<p> But difficult conditions come with the work. In this oversized portfolio of 120 full-color images made over two decades on four continents, Lanting chronicles the life of the world's jungles, organizing the work by themes (water and light, color and camouflage, anarchy and order, form and evolution). As befits the jungle's manic pace, few of the images are static, as Lanting captures macaws and butterflies and even frogs in flight, orangutans brachiating their way from vine to vine, turkeys and snakes scrambling and slithering. Some of the images are nothing short of astonishing, among them views of an otherworldly cloudforest lobelia thicket in Hawaii and of treetop expanses that exhibit the phenomenon called "canopy shyness," an arboreal version of animal territoriality. Admirers of Lanting's previous books, such as <I>Okavango</I> and <I>Eye to Eye</I>, will prize his new collection, while rainforest devotees will find much to inspire them in the images he brings before us.  <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>"I . . . show jungles in their natural spendor, and their animal inhabitants with the dignity they deserve." "I want to show what is at stake . . . ." "It is about the feeling of the forest rather than the science of it." -- Frans Lanting<P>This book contains some of the most stunning jungle photography that it has been my pleasure to see. The images contain amazing contrasts between breathtaking vistas and intricate close-ups. The contrasts continue with great use of both stillness and motion. In some cases, very fast exposures capture images that you could never see in real time with the human eye. In all these scenes, you will see incredible detail that will impress you with nature's richness. <P>Mr. Lanting's view is that only by knowing the jungle, can people want to save it. The whole book is designed to serve a conservationist's purpose.<P>You and I could spend a lifetime in the jungle and probably not see a quarter of the stunning images that are here. These photographs are the result of 20 years worth of work in trying conditions all around the world. <P>The photographs are grouped into four sections to emphasize elements of the jungle. "Water and Light" looks at the interplay of these elements with plant and animal life. "Color and Camouflage" looks at the contrasting needs to hide and desire to be seen for procreative purposes. "Anarchy and Order" surveys impressions of growth and movement. "Form and Evolution" shows many wonders of natural selection.<P>My favorites include the following:<P>Victoria's Crowned Pigeon<P>Raindrops on Leaf, Peru<P>Rainforest Sunrise, Borneo<P>Fern, Borneo<P>Waterfalls, Brazil<P>Swimming Snake, Madagascar<P>Palm Savannah, Brazil<P>Great Argus Pheasant Plumage<P>Nightjar, Belize<P>Lichen Katydid, Borneo<P>Scarlet Ibis Bathing<P>Urania Moth, Peru<P>Proboscis Monkey, Borneo<P>Mount Kinabalu, Borneo<P>Pitcher Plant Growth, Borneo<P>Chameleon, Madagascar<P>Tree Ferns, Australia<P>Butterflies on Sneaker, Peru<P>After you finish enjoying these marvelous color reveries of the natural world, I suggest you think about how you can help save the jungles. They offer practical benefits (like providing biological diversity, places where life-saving drugs can be found, and offsetting the carbon dioxide build-up) as well as aesthetic ones that we all should take seriously. If you can afford a donation, do that. If you can donate your time, do that. If you can help inform someone else to help, that's a wonderful thing to do as well. <P>Walk and act in beauty!</span>

                    <span>Well,when I was 14-15 years old,I was mostly interested in underwater photography and therefore,I had only a few photo books. But later,my interest for other animals too,grew much larger and therefore,I received this book as a christmas gift from my mother. It was really not a bad book,and it made me love Lanting and buy two more books with his pictures later.<BR>It is a huge book,weighing perhaps 1,5 kilograms and with dimensions "14" x "10". It contains 150 photographs of plants and animals living in jungles around the world. Among the animals included are a series of pictures of red macaws in Peru,<BR>dancing lemurs of Madagascar,cute little frogs in giant flowers in Borneo,incredibly strang-looking insects of various jungles,bats fishing at night in South America,and the shining eyes of caimans in Brazil. <BR>But don`t just look at the animal pictures. The part which I find most inspiring is the jungle habitats. Especially the morning light in Borneo and Peru,and the palm savannah of Brazil. They all look humid and there are fog clouds in the dawin. Very beautifull. The australian jungles look very exciting too. Many pictures,especially of birds,are very windy to make a real impression of the movements of the animals. Lanting`s capability of capturing details of animals has never been as well presented as in this book. Especially in this huge format and double-page photos in the half of the book. <BR>Over all,this is a fantastic book recommended to anyone interested in jungles,animals,or just in beautifull natural photography. You`ll be amazed,whoever you are.</span>

                    <span>Frans Lanting is a god among nature photographers. This book's *gorgeous* imagery takes me to another world completey, and I can only hope to follow in his genius footsteps with my humble little SLR. For anyone who loves to look at up close and personal pictures of animals or of lush jungle vegetation/rivers, or anyone who loves nature photography, I highly recommend this book. No wildlife photographer's shelf should be void of it.</span>

                    <span>This is really an excellent portfolio with some stunning photography that really inspires one. I am a fan of Lanting's work and this book does not dissapoint. <P>My only issue is not with Lanting, but rather with Taschen (the publisher). The book is really very poorly bound and the glue just does'nt seem to hold the book together. This is not just an isolated case with my copy. I found that most of the copies (even those on the bookstore shelves) that I handled has this problem. I must say that this is quite dissapointing work from Taschen.</span>

                    <span>JUNGLES takes you to a world you are not likely to visit in person. From Africa, to Australia, to Central and South America, you are afforded a view usually reserved for exotic and otherworldy animals, vegetation, and even insects (some such alien-like beings are pictured here). Such beautiful creations! <P>My favorite portion of JUNGLES is the depiction of the beautiful Makaws of the Amazon jungle. In one shot, you see at least thirty of these magnificent creatures sitting on the side of a cliff, gathered there to eat the chalky red clay-like rock that provides them with the necessary calcium. These photographs had previously been published - in fact, were the cover story - of an edition of "National Geographic" magazine, which should give you an indication of the quality of photography you will be treated to in JUNGLES.</span>
