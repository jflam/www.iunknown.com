                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>   <p>   ASP is the future of the web. If you're looking for a way to create attractive, intelligent web pages or, if you're just looking for a way to extend your HTML know-how, then ASP is an effective way to achieve your goals. With ASP, you can customize your web pages to be more dynamic, more efficient and more responsive to your users. It's not just a technology, though &#8212; to get the best out of ASP, you'll be using it in tandem with HTML, and with one or more of the web's simple scripting languages. The book will teach you everything you need to create useful real-world applications on the web.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>    <ul>    <li>Teaches VBScript as an integral part of learning to use ASP    <li>Describes how to make your pages more dynamic with HTML and script code    <li>Covers writing and debugging script code    <li>Explains how to set up ASP, what software to use, and how to administer your pages    <li>Shows how you can access databases to give dynamically updated web pages    <li>Introduces object-based programming and shows you how to use ASP objects    <li>Provides the foundation for you to write useful, real-world dynamic web pages    <li>Includes a fully worked sample application to demonstrate the power of ASP    <li>Loaded with examples and useful tips    <li>Introduces XML, one of the latest web programming technologies, and explains its use in conjunction with ASP    </ul>   <p>   <b>Who is this book for?</b>   <p>   This book is for anybody with a grasp of HTML who wants to add more to their web pages. It also covers VBScript &#8212; a simple Internet programming language. This makes it the ideal first step for the aspiring web professional. It's also useful for more experienced programmers looking for a practical, no-nonsense introduction to ASP and programming for the web.   <p>   <b>What do you need to use this book?</b>   <p>   To get the most out of this book you should be running Windows 2000, which includes ASP 3 &#8212; the latest version of this popular technology.    </span>

                    <span>Get free code and learn it yourself; no need to buy thisbook!<P>In spite of the deceivingly good ratings, the book explains something very simple in too many words. Even though I had no knowledge of ASP (but had good knowledge about programming), I found the slow, repetitive, hand-holding approach an insult to my intelligence. Reading/digesting this book isn't challenging at all. Rather, I had to page through all the wordy pages to find the little information to add to my knowledge. If you have basic understanding of programming of any kind, don't waste your money/time on hundreds of pages explaning what is a "variable", how if/for/while control structures work, what are objects/properties/methods... Instead, buy/read Wrox's Professional ASP 3.0 or ASP Programmer's Reference. They will return you 100 times as much knowledge and confidence as this book. Also, the bad grammar/writing style, typos, and careless errors in code are intolerable... Go to the wrox website to download all the code for this book, try them out with your browser. That's all that the book gives you. No need to read the 1200 pages. The code is all free. That's my sincere advice to ASP learners of at least average intelligence.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be absolutely amazing!!!! It is so easy to learn from and the format is extremely easy to follow. And although it is a beginners book, you'll already be writing some very useful code about a quarter of the way through.<P>The best part of it is that it gives the reader an exercise in every section of the book, to review and practice what's already been covered. After that, the authors go through the example step by step to explain exactly how it works.<P>I already have some programming experience in C++, Java, JavaScript, Assembler, and Pascal. Now this book covers VBScript throughout the book and introduces the reader to it almost from the start. So already knowing other languages made it even easier for me to learn VBScript, but even if you've never touched programming, this book makes it easy to learn VBScript. The authors teach it in a way that anyone at any level can learn it quickly. The explanations are excellent, the terminology clear, and it just teaches you what you need to know to program ASP. Nothing more, nothing less. In other words, I'm sure that you'll be very well prepared to program ASP after using this learning tool.<P>The next best thing about the book is that it teaches you to apply your new-found skills in VBScript to programming ASP, and that's part of every exercise in the book.<P>The authors even went as far as explaining how to install and configure IIS (Internet Information Services) which comes with Windows 2000. IIS supports ASP 3.0, and since most people run ASP on an NT or Win2k server, this was a definite added bonus.<P>In other words, this book doesn't skip a step when it comes to learning what you set off to learn in the first place, namely ASP3.0. If you're interested in learning ASP 3.0 and would like to program in it using VBScript, then this is a must buy. I give it 2 thumbs up!!!!</span>

                    <span>All programming books are both overwritten and underwritten. <P>When you begin reading and learning the content is simply too much. As you progress you find yourself seeking other resources for "filler" information.<P>I didn't realize until I grew frustrated with the book how effective it was. I had gone from a complete beginner to someone who could put together access driven web applications and I didn't even realize how far I had come.<P>I now have over 30 programming and database books that is use as resource guides for particular problems etc. Each book helps me get past a certain problem/hurdle. Like a lawyers library I couldn't proceed without it.<P>That is simply the nature of programming these days. We beginners often underestimate the amount of knowledge expert programmers have. The trick is to take what we can from each resource. In order to progress we must keep adding to the resource collection.<P>This book is the staple of my collection. I refer to it almost daily and as my knowledge base expands I find myself making better use of it.<P>So its a must for the beginner in my opinion. Whether you just want a foundation to take free script from ASP Programming sites, edit it, and add it to your projects or you are looking to chase a programming degree or career this book gets you rolling.</span>
