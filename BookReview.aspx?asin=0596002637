                <span id="Label1"><i>Practical RDF</i> explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects.    The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML.  If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, <i>Practical RDF</i> is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF. </span>

                    <span>Normally, I like O'Reilly books. I've probably bought over 50 of them over the years. This one, however, is not up to their usual standards. While the subject, RDF, is interesting and I feel that the pace and content of the book are good. I find that there are so many typographical errors in the book - at least in the copy that I have - that it takes more effort to figure out what it is that the author means, as opposed to what the text is actually saying, than it's worth. There are places where the text contains contradictions, there are places where the examples are incorrect, and there are places where the information presented is downright wrong. I do not feel that the fault is solely the author's, nor do I feel that the fault lies solely with O'Reilly's editors. But what could have been a good, informative book has been brought low by a lack of proofreading.<P>If you're really interested in RDF, you may well do better by going to the W3C web site and reading the specifications there than by reading this book.</span>

                    <span>I found the prose of this book tedious and in the way of the material. Normally I appreciate O'Reilly books because I actually sit down and read them, away from the computer, but in this case the prose does nothing to illuminate the material. For example, in the first chapter, which provides an overview of the technology (independent of its XML implementation), the author talks about a particular tool for graphically representing an RDF graph. But (1) the tool is never really introduced -- why should it be in this chapter? and (2) she writes as if the graphical views of the tool are somehow literally the RDF graphs, which are mathematical constructs. In short, the author has done none of the important work of getting to the essence of RDF and presenting it in a logical and convincing manner. The thinking behind RDF is complicated and subtle, in spite of the superficial simplicity of the technology. What I expected was a book that would provide some real explanation, rather than an exhaustive and wordy review of all the concepts in series. This is not the book.</span>

                    <span>For a book about 'practical' RDF this book is mainly about theory. The book doesn't get into applications until chapter 10 and it's coverage of the RSS applications is pretty minor. However, there are some good points. The XML examples are highlighted, which makes them very easy to read. The tough subject matter, meta data about meta data, is well covered in-depth. <P>I gave it four stars because it is merely mis-titled. The first ten chapters do a solid job, with excellent graphics, explaining RDF. So if you are looking for an general RDF book, you have probably come to the right place. If you are looking for a book to explain why your blog's RSS doesn't validate, you shouldn't buy into the practical title, or this book.</span>

                    <span>This book seems to have it all there, but unfortunately I don't "click" with Powers' writing style.<P>I had to read the initial chapters several times before I finally managed to get my head around the concepts.<P>If I were asked to recommend a text, however, I would probably still suggest this one as I have not seen anything else better.</span>
