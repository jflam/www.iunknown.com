                    <span>I'm not really an artist but have a lot of things that can be used to make a shadow box. I bought this book last weekend at the Latino book festival along with this author's other book because I thought maybe I could try to put this art style to the test. Even if I don't I'm happy I bought this book, it is so inspirational and I'm happy to support Latina authors, we need more of them!</span>

                    <span>As a crafter, I am always looking for new and unique ideas. This book was such a great inspiration for me to create so many fantastic projects that I am recomending it to everyone I know, and it makes the perfect gift. Kathy Cano-Murillo has collected exquisite projects for this book, and the most wonderful thing is that anyone, from beginner to craft addict can make each and every one of the examples. I love that you can customize each to your own taste and let your individuality through. This is one of the best craft books--not just on the market now--but that I've ever seen. I'd give it ten stars if I could!!!!</span>

                    <span>I am a fan of Kathy's and I have to be honest and say that I am much more impressed with her website and "La Casa Loca" than I am with this book.</span>

                    <span>After getting La Casa Loca as a gift I just had to go and get all the other books by Kathy Cano-Murillo. I've always been into collage art but never thought of making them diminsional like this book shows. There are so many rich and gorgeous pictures and so many beautiful ideas that I don't know where to start. Aside from the colorful and inspirational projects, my favorite part of the book is Kathy's opening letter, it literally made me cry. So sweet. This book will make you feel good inside and out.</span>

                    <span>Regarding the "mean reviews" - clearly these folks don't know ANYTHING about Latino folk art, or the art of assemblage greats like Joseph Cornell! Mixed media and assemblage are very popular artistic outlets right now and Kathy's book does a great job of covering several different styles - from classic "collections" style assemblages to Day of the Dead shrines and wacky/kitschy pieces. <BR>The book is very well written and the photos are gorgeous. If you are looking for traditional arts and crafts shadow box type art work, you are better off getting idea sheets from the craft store. However, if you are a mixed media artist looking for imaginative inspiration, Kathy delivers!</span>
