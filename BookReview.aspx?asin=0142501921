                    <span>   I loved this book. All of the excitment, puzzeling information, and thoughts of being prejudiced all in one book. Like when Hiram's grandpa wemt to the White Citizens Concils. Nobody in the Mississippi Delta really wanted to desegrigate. They mainly based all of their beliefs on the old southern ways.Not many people even cared when a "Negro" (as they say it, but we just would like to see them as other people)boy came up missing. To see what really happened you'll have to read this great book. Then there was all of the trouble hiram was trying to figure out between his dad and grandpa. He finally had some idea of what it was in the end though. Hiram always got along with his grandpa when he was young so, he really didn't know why his father didn't. Hiram loved to go with his grandfather fishing on the Tallahatchie River.To find out more on this great book just go out and read it.</span>

                    <span>	Reading a book that keeps your interest really makes reading enjoyable. The book Mississippi Trial, 1955 is a phenomenal book that teaches important lessons about prejudice; segregation; and being truthful to other people; but most of all, it teaches important lessons about your self.  So if you really want to read a great book that has a bunch of terrific lessons in it, then Mississippi Trial, 1955 is the perfect book for you!
<br />	
<br />    I am not someone who likes to read a lot; and when I do read, it takes me quite a while to finish a book.  To my amazement, I finished this book in four days!  The reason I read it so quickly is that the author, Chris Crowe, kept the suspense building.  It was so suspenseful that I was not able to put the book down for a second.  Every word I read in the book really got me thinking.  For example, when Hiram (the main character) and his grandpa were listening to the verdict of a case, I was appalled and shocked to learn that the men were found innocent of the murder of a young black boy.  Everyone knew what the verdict should have been, because all the facts were right there.  I think they just refused to admit that someone of their own race was guilty of murdering someone of a different race.  When I took a minute to think about it, I realized that that's how life really was in the South during the 1950's.  I really do not think I would have been able to live in that area during that time period.  So as you can see, it really did get me wondering how people could have lived in that area during that time, with the knowledge that people were not acting fairly, with honesty, or with kindness.
<br />	
<br />    History is very important to learn about because it teaches us about the past and sets a foundation for us to build on.  It helps us understand why things are like they are and about changes we would like to make.  Segregation in the south during the 1950's is a part of history that we learn about in school and is explained in this book.  It provides examples of things that could have happened during that time period, and probably did.  Although those things may be hard to hear about, I for one think that it is very important that people are aware of it.  By reading this book, you will learn many things about segregation.  For example, I thought that everyone who lived in the south agreed with segregation and were all for it.  In the book some of the people who lived in the south did not agree with the segregation of blacks and whites.  That is one important thing I learned in the book.  I think a History teacher might find this book helpful when teaching her class about the south during the 1950's, because it will allow the students to see how hard it was for black people during that time, and the students can learn from the lessons in the book.
<br />	
<br />    Every book has its own message that it is trying to get across to the reader.  In some books the message is silly like "Always tie your shoe!"  Personally I would not like to waste my time reading a book about how important it is to tie your shoe, and I doubt you would either.  That's why I think you should get the book Mississippi Trial, 1955.  As I told you before, it has many lessons about segregation and how bad it was.  It also has lessons about the importance of being truthful to other people and yourself.  In the book, the main character Hiram faces some obstacles.  When he gets asked to go to court because he may know something that may help solve a case, he knows that he must go.  He also knows that he doesn't know what he will say if he actually gets called up to the stand.  If he tells the truth, R.C. (a very dangerous boy) may come after him and try to harm him.  So if he doesn't tell the truth he'll feel much safer, but on the inside he will feel guilty that he lied and could have made a difference.  In the end Hiram ends up making the right decision (which is telling the truth).  Being truthful to yourself and other people is very important, but sometimes people forget this.  This book is a good reminder of this important characteristic which is another reason why I recommend this book.
<br />	
<br />    When people are looking for a good book to read they look for a book that is very interesting, has a great lesson, and maybe even a book that teaches them something and gives some nice reminders.  Mississippi Trial, 1955 has all of these things in it.  You can't go wrong with a book like this.  Since it is important to read a book that keeps your interest, I think you should get Mississippi Trial, 1955.

                    <span>The Raving Review<p>   Hiram Hillburn loves spending time with his Grandma and Grandpa down in Greenwood, Mississippi.  But then his Grandma dies and Hiram's parents decide to move to Tempe, Arizona.  Then in the summer of 1955 when Hiram is 16, his parents decide to let him go back to Greenwood.  But Hiram feels it is not the same Greenwood that he remembered as a young boy.  Then a young African-American boy is murdered because of an ugly racial incident.  Hiram is starting to learn why his father was trying to not let him go.  <br>   I liked the book for the most part, though there were a few parts I didn't care for, like when Hiram witnessed the ugly racial incidents.  This book is based on real events.  So, if you like true stories that are part of our country's history like this, then I would recommend this book to you.  The author did a good job of making this book very descriptive.  I give it 3½ out of 4 stars.<p>                          <br>                                   <br>                                                                   By: Adam ...</span>
