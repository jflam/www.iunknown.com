                <span id="Label1">Precious Ramotswe is the eminently sensible and cunning proprietor of the only ladies&#8217; detective agency in Botswana. In <b>Tears of the Giraffe</b> she tracks a wayward wife, uncovers an unscrupulous maid, and searches for an American man who disappeared into the plains many years ago. In the midst of resolving uncertainties, pondering her impending marriage to a good, kind man, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, and the promotion of her talented secretary (a graduate of the Botswana Secretarial College, with a mark of 97 per cent), she also finds her family suddenly and unexpectedly increased by two.  </span>

                    <span>Here is the second in Smith's acclaimed new series about the only female private investigator in Botswana. Although more episodic than his debut volume, it maintains the latter's quality with its lyrical style, careful pace, and rich evocation of culture, country, and characters. (I am inevitably reminded of my all-time favorite detective writer, Dell Shannon, who invariably kept one major-case thread running throughout each book while cleaning up assorted smaller ones--sometimes humorous, sometimes grave-- along the way.) <P>We find Precious Ramotswe newly engaged to her longtime friend, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and in the process of promoting to assistant detective her loyal secretary Mma Makutsi. The emphasis is more on the couple's domestic affairs--the search for an engagement ring, the decision as to which house they will live in, and Mr. Matekoni's thoroughly unexpected acquisition (his bachelorhood notwithstanding) of two foster children--than on casework, but there is still a wife's faithlessness to expose, the fate of a long-missing young American to determine, and Mr. Matekoni's vindictively jealous housemaid to deal with.<P>Like Shannon, Smith skillfully blends the humanizing details of his characters' private lives with the work they do, and although the New York Times called Mma Ramotswe "the Miss Marple of Africa," to me she seems more like Mrs. Pollifax (another old favorite). At least two further titles are in the wings. If they're as good as this one, they'll be well worth the reader's time.</span>

                    <span>After reading Alexander McCall Smith's first book in this series "The #1 Ladies Detective Agency" I felt I had to read the following books as well because they are so enjoyable.<P>"The Tears of the Giraffe" reads almost like a fable allowing us to determine whether or not lying for good or bad reasons can be wrong. It is an interesting delimma. I absolutely enjoy the way that Smith writes his characers. Precious Ramotswe, her secretary/assistant Mma Makutsi and her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are immediately likable and often shyly funny in the way that they interact with one another. This book brings two orphan children into Mma Ramotswe's life and leaves a door open for the next installment. <P>The ending of the book is left with a wonderful fable-like suggestion about baskets being woven from the tears of a giraffe because that is all they have to give us. We can all give something no matter how small or insignificant it may seem and Alexander McCall Smith has given us a true treasure here.</span>

                    <span>The obvious success of this book is due to the #1 Ladies Detective Agency. And the desire to see what comes next is understandable. This is one great series of books and they deserve their place on the bestseller lists. The main character, Precious, solves the few actual mysteries in the sequels in creative ways that surprise the reader. These sequels, particularly "Giraffe," are a bit more about Precious' relationship with J.L.B. Matekoni, a bit less about the detective agency. But they follow smoothly from "#1 Ladies..." and are equally good. Set in Botswana, the books give such a clear and beautiful picture of that country today that now I would like to learn more about it. Would also recommend Life of Pi and The Bark of the Dogwood.</span>

                    <span>Mma Ramotswe is at it again! The No. 1 Ladies Dectective Agency has taken on some new and interesting cases. In this story things are not as clear cut as they seem and Precious Ramotswe ponders the morality of telling the truth, telling lies and in general the imperfection of the human condition. Her insights into the psyche of human nature are all to true. Alexander McCall Smith has again created a wonderful vignette of stories that delight the reader with their simple storyline, yet complex implications into the nature of women, men and children. In this series we get to know several characters more intimately including, Precious Ramotse's fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni. He is a wonderfully rich character that adds much to the story and I am looking forward to reading future installments that include the evolvement of their relationship. I am constantly enthralled by McCall Smith's description of the African continent and it's people and find these descriptions both heart warming and heart breaking. It seems there are many changes ahead for Mma Ramotswe; a new family an assisant dectective and a new husband. I look forward to the continuation of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and the unique insights that Precious Ramotswe has for the readers.</span>

                    <span>I am so happy she finally decided to get married and chose a well known person for his integrity and kindness. She made it clear though that she accepted his proposal not because she is a woman who needs a man to protect her nor to be his servant NO she was satisfied with her life and her job and hurt from her experience with one failed marriage that was still so fresh in her memory..<P>I love the series because of Mma's character. She wants to change and wants to learn about the modern world and life in the new century but doesn't shun her past .. on the contrary she is proud of her heritage and of her country and what makes it special. Through her investigations, Smith tackles various issues, he states Mma's point of view as the opinion of the learned people and leaders of her country and shows how a foreigner would percieve it... true and simple. He uses simple language, affirms the traditions of the country, draws the difference in behavior between past and present... Africa and the west.<P>It's a funny sad book, clash of culture and modernization. Enjoy reading as Mma unfolds the mysteries of life!</span>
