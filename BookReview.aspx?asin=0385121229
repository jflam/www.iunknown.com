                <span id="Label1">No small themes for historian William McNeill: he is a writer of big, sweeping books, from <b>The Rise of the West</b> to <b>The History of the World</b>. <b>Plagues and Peoples</b> considers the influence of infectious diseases on the course of history, and McNeill pays special attention to the Black Death of the 13th and 14th centuries, which killed millions across Europe and Asia. (At one point, writes McNeill, 10,000 people in Constantinople alone were dying each day from the plague.) With the new crop of plagues and epidemics in our own time, McNeill's quiet assertion that "in any effort to understand what lies ahead the role of infectious disease cannot properly be left out of consideration" takes on new significance.</span>

                    <span>Men and infectious organisms have long had an uneasy relationship: diseases like smallpox, the plague, measles and in more recent years influenza have carried off huge percentages of the population when they met a new population with no immunity. After 5 to 6 generations the grown-up population had developed enough immunity to turn the dreaded disease into a childhood affliction.<P>William McNeill reasons in this book that for full-blown plagues to occur one needs large groups of people, such as cities and he theorizes about the influence that micro-organisms and plagues may have had on such diverse historical events as the development of civilization in China, the downfall of the Roman empire, the origin of the Renaissance, the conquest of the Americas and the industrial revolution.<P>Even though definite proof is often lacking, the reasoning at most times is quite convincing even though it may be somewhat simplified here and there. The original version of this book dates from 1976 but is still very valid for our days. It is a shame that in the 1998 preface the author does not mention that diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which are in the original text described as disease that have been fought successfully, are very much on the rise again and nowadays form the part of the "big three" of most lethal infectious diseases together with HIV/AIDS.</span>

                    <span>Every high school history student knows that the Black Death swept through Europe, and that diseases like smallbox, measles and so on were decisive in allowing the colonization of the Americas. But these two statements while universally accepted, are generally left at that and the causes go unexplored.<P>This book is a very concise history of plagues and what built up to these two grim realities. McNeill goes much beyond these basics and provides in intricate details the events that allowed that to happen. What allowed these disease pools to eventually come into being? This book provides the details to the answer to that question from the early days of civilization in Mesopotamia to the effect that plague had on the periphery of the Roman and Chinese empires to the effect that the Mongols had in fully unifying this disease pool, and once a reality, the devasating effect that they had on the world.<P>In short, if you want to understand in fine detail the causes and events that built up the "eastern hemisphere disease pool", read this book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of a very tiny number of books which I have bought in bulk and distributed to friends and colleagues. Although the prose style can be unnecessarily turgid and academic and will win no prizes, the ideas are so stimulating intellectually that one gradually ceases to notice the style. McNeill's central thesis, both original and plausible, allows one to review the entire history of civilization in a new light and to make testable and almost always correct predictions. Few books have the ability to so change one's view of history. I first read this book many years ago and it has held up well. Read and ponder. It may change your world view.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those handful of books that will change the way you look at our world. History will never seem quite the same when you finish.<BR>Several earlier reviewers have done a great job of summarizing and analyzing the book. It is unfortunate that this book was given as a high school assignment, and then the students were asked to review it on Amazon. Is it any wonder they gave it 2 or 3 stars, and said it was difficult to understand? Most 15-year-olds do not have the background to fully appreciate this type of work, and unfortunately their reviews skew the book's rating.</span>

                    <span>When you go through school, the history books pretty much focus on "this group conquered this group who conquered this group" and it leaves with the impression that it was all guns and steel. Plagues and Peoples reveals just how huge an impact disease has had on the outcome of human history, and why some populations were more susceptible to outside infection than others.</span>
