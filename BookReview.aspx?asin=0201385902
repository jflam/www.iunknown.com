                <span id="Label1">The newest edition of the classic <I>An Introduction to Database Systems</I> incorporates the latest developments in relational databases, including semantic modeling, decision support, and temporal modeling. There's better information on distributed databases, security, and the mathematics of relational databases too. With the same strong coverage of fundamental theory that made its predecessors stand out, this book ranks as the definitive textbook for those studying database systems.<p> This is an extraordinarily academic book. In his preface, C.J. Date goes so far as to lament having to use Structured Query Language (SQL) in some of his examples because it's "so far from being a true embodiment of relational principles." What's more, he writes in a very academic style, peppering his heavily footnoted prose with mathematical expressions and words like relevar and tuple. The academic style and highbrow language isn't a bad thing, since this book deals with complicated, largely abstract phenomena in depth. <p> Be aware that <I>An Introduction to Database Systems</I> is a far cry from the highly graphical, problem-focused books that target the community of commercial database developers, and as such requires more careful study. This book is about theories, concepts, and ideals rather than problems, solutions, and specific implementations. Per se, it will enable you to become a better database programmer--but only if you supplement it with practical guides and hands-on experience. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>Of the several books i have refered to on DBMS (including the one by Silbershatz), I found C J Date's book most helpful. It starts right from the basic and touches the core of any topic. This book is all about precise and minute detail (Which actually makes the small topics look really BIG).<p>In the context of exams this will always be my first recommendation to all computer and IT students. In fact class mates often asked me how I had that EXTRA peice of information at all the times. I topped the DBMS exams this year (and; Yes sir, full credit to C J Date) thanks to the reference of this really wonderful book.<p>This is a best buy for both Graduate + Under Graduate students. In fact learners can also get a great deal of insight into this really interestiing subject. It is important to get a good start into DBMS; because this is a very boring and dry subject "At First Sight". Others authors had made this subject eeven more dry and uninteresting.<p>OVERALL:<br>1) Every students MUST have.<br>2) Every learners MUST have.<br>ALSO<br>3) Good reference for teachers and lecturers.</span>

                    <span>This book introduces the fundamentals of database systems by emphasizing the relational data model, and that a database is really "a collection of true .. propositions".  Although his use of Tutorial-D (rather than SQL) may seem odd, Date emphasizes thinking about data rather than an implementation.  This book provides great fundamental thinking about relational variables (relvars), domains, relational algebra, and data normalization.<p>The further topic of missing information contrasts to Codd's four-valued logic, and even if your particular database system supports different Nulls the chapter helps when thinking about your own data.  Whether or not you agree with his thinking about object-oriented databases, his "Two great blunders" are a challenge to any software vendor.  His chapter on decision support does not provide much of an introduction to such broad topics as warehousing, OLAP, and data mining, but there are other sources.   This is not an easy read, but working through it will pay off when coupled with product training.</span>

                    <span>This book clearly explains how relational DB systems are designed and gives a solid foundation for you to do anything in the DBMS field!<p>This is the best book I've found so far to cover this complex topic.

                    <span>This book is an introduction to database systems as seen from the application developer. It covers the basics of databases (most importantly the relational databases), SQL (and variants) normal forms and many other things from ther viewpoint of the application programmer. It explains why things are done like they are. It does not provide a good guide on how to design database applications or databases, nor does it help you implement your own database system. It is mostly just a theoretical text book to give an introduction to database theory. However all in all it does contain some useful information.<p>Unfortunately this extremely poorly written and uses far too many words to explain so little. In fact, I often found myself almost falling asleep while reading it and then missing important information when it finally was there.<p>This book are constantly updated to new editions - and this shows in a bad way. It is full of notes, asides and footnotes and the structure is terrible. One place it has a foot note that spans over three pages. This is unacceptable!<p>In the end I cannot recommend this book. It is way to long, not focused and extremely dull. There are much better books on databases out there. Avoid this one.</span>
