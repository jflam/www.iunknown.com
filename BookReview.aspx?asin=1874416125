                    <span>this is a great book.........a must buy for anyone wishing to learn assembly.......i would suggest that you read Peter Nortans Assembly Language Programming book before this one.........i did that and everything really fit together nicely.....it only took me one month to read both books.....make my own hex editor.......an addictive game.......and many many many useful util's and apps.......i am now entering the exciting realm of 3d games programing with ease.....and believe me i needed assembly......i needed and still need this book.......excellent reference............</span>

                    <span>Now this is a VERY good book. It covers all the basics and more. The disk that comes with it is sort of useful at first, but the book itself is the best for all you potential assembly freaks. Trust me on this one, you can't do with out it! I gave it a nine just because there are no perfect books.</span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of useful information on low level stuff. There are chapters on Disks, Video and Bios/dos services.<BR>Some of the material belong in a history book but I found the book very useful in my research on operating systems.<BR>If you don't mind learning 16 bit assembly language, you should consider this book. However it helps if you know a bit of assemly language before you attempt to read this book.<BR>A good introduction is "Assembly Langauge Step by Step" (if you dont mind authors who keep telling boring stories in between the material).</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I got this book when I was twelve or thirteen and I only knew how to code BASIC at the time... I must admit that at first it was a bit overwhelming; however, after reading this book I must say I had become a competent assembly language programmer. This book is superb, PACKED with info, and great for beginners.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>If you know some high level language (concepts, structure, procedures, functions) and have a basis in assembler (know what mov means) Then this book can be of value. Has a lot of good examples for each subject covered. Covers a subject that I don't see covered much in alot of the assembler books I have read, writing macros (like writing a function in a high level language, sort of). I would recommend these books in order: ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE STEP BY STEP, REVOLUTIONARY GUIDE TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, MASTER CLASS-ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE.</span>
