                    <span>Stop right now.  Do NOT buy this.  Buy the actual book instead!  I know, I know, crazy idea in this day and age, but Cliffs Notes are exactly what is wrong with the world of literature these days: too many people reading the Reader's Digest version, and not enough actually reading great literature!  I mean, come on people, the book is less than 200 pages long.  You can read it in one sitting.  And it's not even that difficult to understand--the prose is limpid and the plot engrossing.  Don't cheat; don't take the easy way out.  Do the right thing.  Read the book, not the Cliffs Notes.</span>

                    <span>"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (Cliffs Notes)" is a great way to help you understand what you're reading, if you're having difficulties.  If you're not having a problem reading "The Great Gatsby," this will give you questions to test your knowledge of the book.  Of course, you should read the Cliffs Notes AFTER you read "The Great Gatsby," not instead of.  I recommend.</span>

                    <span>I am not a student.  I wanted to read The Great Gatsby but I had no one with whom I could discuss the story.  I decided in a momentary lapse of judgment to supplement my reading with the Cliffs Notes.  Unfortunately, it was full of grammatical errors and what I found to be very superficial commentaries.</span>

                    <span>Reading the cliffnotes of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby definately got me  out of big trouble in an american lit class i've been in. They are great  study guides and can help you review more than they can get you through the  test. Most teachers read the cliffnotes and come up with questions that  were not included in the cliffnotes version. However! This does give you  much better understanding of the book as the themes and characters are  explained in an easy table of contents. You could slide with a B by just  reading these cliffnotes, it all depends on how you use what knowledge the  book gives you</span>
