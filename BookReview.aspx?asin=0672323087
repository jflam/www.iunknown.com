                    <span>Concerning OOP in C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms in Java<P>I've been a software engineer for roughly two years now. I was fortunate to have learned C++ and Data Structures by books written by Lafore. In my time in the field, I've noticed that I have a much stronger understanding of C++ and Data Structures than many of my senior programmers. It appears that the books they learned from in college were so esoteric and academic (Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science))that they actually fear opening the book, let alone creating binary trees, heaps and weighted graphs. Of course they are also C spaghetti programmers and they have no problem with global variables.<P>When I was in college the required C++ text was Deitel and Deitel's C++ How to Program. The book was just plain boring to me, fell apart and looked like it was written in some sort of linux text editor. Although the other half of C++ programmers prefer this book over any other, I eventually used Lafore's Object Oriented Programming in C++ to learn the material. OOP in C++ is actually fun to read compared to the snoozers the old guys used to read. <P>In my opinion, there is no other technical writer that compares. He makes the material so easy you are convinced that you are missing something. When I hear a senior programmer talk in fear about data structures and that scary "Object Oriented Programming" I always have to question if they know something about OOP and DSA that I don't know about? Is there? Cuz I'm still questioning it. I'm ok with the OPP but that spegetti code scares the daylights out of me.<P>Drawbacks: Lafore only brushes the surface of Big O notation and pseudo code in his data structures book. He also worded the book so nicely that many of my senior programmers have made degrading comments about how the book was written for grade schoolers, yet they use my Lafore's Data Structure book 10 times more than they do their "MIT algorithms" book. That's got to say something.<P>If your taking a college course, use Lafore's books as backup text books. You'll be thankful you did.<P>I like this guys writing so much I wait for his next book as if it he was Stephen King. I feel like a groupie. <P>Well anyway..<BR>Thanks, <BR>Dave</span>

                    <span>This book is used as a text in a number of college venues and it's not hard to see why. It's well-written, explains difficult concepts in reasonable language, it doesn't try to talk over the reader and it presents the concepts of C++ in a logical and sequential manner. I particularly liked that LaFore decided to get into structures relatively early in his book (in chapter 4) because, as he rightly points out, an understanding of structures is useful in the path of learning from the basic sequential and structured programming to the object-oriented concepts and programming that are illustrated later on. Of the many books that I have had a chance to review for use in an academic environment, it's hard to go wrong with this one; and it edges out my other favorite, Prata's "C++ Primer Plus," mostly because of his sequence of concepts and he doesn't spend a lot of time talking about what some of the older and, frankly, less used compilers are doing with respect to the inclusion of headers and library files. I also liked the exercises that appear in this book. Learning to program is like learning math and another language at the same time - the only way to learn it is to do lots of programs and apply the language. However, I find fault in that solutions are not provided for all of the exercises, which takes away from the usefulness of this book as a tool for self-teaching. Still, that and a couple of editing misses are the only flaws. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>It has always been my firm opinion that Robert Lafore's book is the best book to start learning C++. Although people use and talk about other books like C++ Primer, or the C++ programming language by Bjarne, or the book by Deitel. <BR> Lafore seems to be an excellent teacher and uses many diagrams to illustrate his thoughts. I had the third edition of the book, and I had read it so many times, that I used to revise this book in just two three hours when I wanted to refresh my C++ basics. The fourth edition is similar but has the latest keywords and updates. It removes the chapter on C++ graphics which is welcome change. <BR> I must also advice that this book is for beginner and not advanced level. It's also not a reference book. Its for learning, for starting onto object oriented programming. Its not that expensive too, and I would highly recommend it to be the first book to start learning C++.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely one of those books suited for people who have a small or growing grasp of C++, but need help with the things like templates, pointers, arrays, and the like. It has tons of useful information on C++ concepts and the last part has a good number of books that are also all very good.<P>Overall, the writing isn't the best itself, thus the 4 stars; however, you can learn a ton from this book. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is learning C++ - especially CS Majors!</span>
