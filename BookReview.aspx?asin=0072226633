                    <span>This is a very nice book. A lot of time and effort went into the research for this one. Many of us are just beginning to find out what an "Easter Egg" is in DVD terms. Of course we all know the Easter Bunny, but this is different. An "Easter Egg" is a hidden gem you may not find listed on the back of your DVD container. It is a hidden, a "secret" image or words that you click on to or click a special sequence or code. It brings up a "secret deleted scene, blooper, features, "secret" conversations by an actor not meant to be heard, almost anything these days. The "Easter Egg" in the film "Boogie Nights" is definatly an extra scene for adults only, if you can find it. This book will help you find all the "Easter Eggs" you may have on your DVD movie at home right now. This book will tell you exactly how to find that "Easter Egg" and what to do to get it. 147 movies are listed. I bet there will be many more sequel books to follow too.</span>

                    <span>Dead in a casket, decomposing for ten days on a wagon destined for a far-off town is the main player in a novel of courage, falsehood, and family. They dying wish of this mother sends her sons, daughter, and husband on a perilous journey that lends itself to reveal the inner thoughts and emotions of all involved. <BR> Throughout events such as the crossing of a raging river and the burning of barns, Cash, Darl, Vardaman, Dewey Dell, and their father, Anse, come together and fall apart to deliver their burden to a final resting place in the Southern town of Jefferson. <BR> Narrated by all of the different characters, As I Lay Dying offers a wide spectrum of views of the expedition and of character development tactics. An excellent novel in the way of psychological and emotional rawness, much can be learned about ourselves and those around us from William Faulkner's offbeat tale.</span>

                    <span>Okay, you've watched "Gladiator" for the hundredth time and you say now what? Well, how about watching the hidden Easter egg to the "Rhino Sequence", or how about the hidden Angel Wings Easter egg in the Castaway DVD. It's so much fun looking for these hidden eggs, especially with the more bizarre ones that require multiple button presses and combinations. I flipped through this book and loaded up my DVDs and had a blast!</span>
