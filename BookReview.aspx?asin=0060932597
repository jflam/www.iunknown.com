                    <span>As a beginning diver, I picked up this book while looking for some travel/diving guides. It was great read, as I didn't put it down until I was done.
<br />
<br />Superbly written to keep the readers attention, although the author, Bernie Chowdhury, went off on tangents every once in awhile, but not to the detrement of the story.
<br />
<br />The accounts and detail of the Rouse's technical diving in caves and wrecks, were wonderful. The history of underwater breathing apparatuses throughout the ages, was very interesting, especially for a uneducated beginner, such as myself.
<br />
<br />Accounts of nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness (the bends), were vivid and enough to make a inexperienced diver such as myself take notice, allthough I will not be diving deep deco technical dives, such as the one's described in the book. It makes you think...
<br />
<br />The book grabbed me right away, although the outcome was readily apparent from the title. This story could have been fiction, knowing that it was not, made it all the more interesting.
<br />
<br />The end was riveting and tramatic, allthough I knew the outcome of the Rouse's. What saddened me most was that almost all the people in the book ultimately meet their end or have serious medical conditions that may or may not be attributed to their deep dives.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I read the excellent book Shadow Divers after hearing Dick Estelle read from it weekday evenings on public radio, and wanted to know more about Chris and Chrissy Rouse.  "The Last Dive" covers their story plus many stories about the history of diving and the stories of many other wreck and cave divers.  I did some easy warm-water recreational dives in the 1990's and my instructors and dive masters always spoke of cave diving as being extremely hazardous and something to stay away from.  Without intending to, this book strongly reinforced those admonitions.  
<br />
<br />Although I loved both of these books, I have to strongly question the judgement, common sense and responsibility of the people described in them.  Was it really that necessary that all of those hazardous dives be made on the unidentified U-boat, even after three people had died trying?  Maybe instead of calling the boat the "yoohoo" they should have called it the "who cares?"</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a life long wreck diver this book, though a bit uneven, riveted me from start to finish. The author furnished a lot of information that was new to me, primarily about cave diving and the Rouses. Some of the other players were people I knew or knew of which made the book doubly fascinating. 
<br />
<br />One phrase that constantly ran through my head (a hundred times) as I read the book was "Gee, that was stupid". Stupid and diving don't mix. 
<br />
<br />It was fascinating to read about the dysfunctional Rouses and their motivation for this type of diving. Diving for fame or recognition is asking for trouble. It is like flying, the best pilots and divers are those who pursue their avocation because they love it, all else being secondary. 
<br />
<br />When I got to the end of the book and read the part about the Rouses fatal accident my skin literally crawled and I cringed in an empathy of pure terror. I know what it is like to be trapped in a wreck with zero visibility. I also know that panic equals death in diving and it must be controlled at all cost. Part of a good divers job is to work diligently at extrication from a problem right up to the end, calmly, and then if you have to die, to die quietly. Reading between the lines a bit I feel that the younger Rouse, after being freed from entrapment by his father bolted from the U-boat and went straight up in wild panic. The father followed.
<br />
<br />Also sad was the author's thoughts on the last pages of the book on an expert cave and wreck diver whom he held in high regard as a personal friend. After the book was published this diver, too, died cave diving. By himself.
<br />
<br />The book is an utterly fascinating litany of everything not to do as a diver or a dive boat Captain and belongs in the library of every serious scuba diver. </span>
