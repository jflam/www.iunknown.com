                <span id="Label1">Jim Dent's <i>Monster of the Midway</i> is the story of football's fiercest competitor, the legendary Bronko Nagurski. From his discovery in the middle of a Minnesota field to his 1943 comeback season at Wrigley, from the University of Minnesota to the Hall of Fame, Bronko Nagurksi's life is a story of grit, hard work, passion, and, above all, an unstoppable drive to win.<br><br><i>Monster of the Midway</i> recounts Nagurski's unparalleled triumphs during the 1930s and '40s, when the Chicago Bears were the kings of professional football. From 1930, the Bronk's first year, through 1943, his last, the Bears won five NFL titles and played in four other NFL Championship Games. Focusing on Nagurski's 1943 comeback season, and how he miraculously led the Bears to their fourth NFL championship against the backdrop of World War II era Chicago, Jim Dent uncovers the riveting drama of Nagurski's playing days. His efforts were the stuff of legend, and his success in 1943 accomplished in spite of a battered frame, worn-out knees, multiple cracked ribs, and a broken bone in his lower back. <br><br>While chronicling the drama of the '43 championship chase, Dent also tells of both the Bears' colorful early years and Bronko's improbable rise to fame from the backwoods of northern Minnesota. Woven into the narrative are the sights and smells and sounds of one of the most romantic, flavorful eras of the twentieth century. And laced through it all are stories of legend: Bronko rubbing shoulders with colorful characters like George Halas, Red Grange, Sid Luckman, and Sammy Baugh; Bronko running into (and breaking) the brick wall at Wrigley Field; Bronko winning All-American spots for two positions; Bronko knocking scores of opponents unconscious; and Bronko reaching the heights of football glory and, with rare grace, turning his back on the game after winning his last championship.<br><br>Rich in unforgettable stories and scenes, this is Jim Dent's account of Bronko Nagurski-arguably the greatest football player who ever lived-and his teammates, the roughest, toughest, rowdiest group of players ever to don leather helmets, and the original Monsters of the Midway.<br></span>

                    <span>Jim Dent tells the story of Bronko Nagurski's football career. "Monster of the Midway: Bronko Nagurski, the 1943 Chicago Bears, and the Greatest Comeback Ever" is not a biography. It is about a football player and why he became among the greatest players ever, with special emphasis on one season (1943). Dent, however, can't help but to provide the background of Nagurski's early life.<P>Bronko Nagurski was the Babe Ruth of football. No one was greater, more dominant, more powerful at their sport than Nagurski. Others have played well: We all know about Michael Jordan, Mickey Mantle, and Lance Armstrong, but few have embodied the essence of their sport with such successful excellence. I should mention Muhammad Ali. He often bragged he was the greatest, and he was.<P>Someone needs to make a movie of this story. Bronko began the Hollywood/Horatio Alger as a hardworking, not too complicated future football hero. He had heart and the physical strength size to back it up. Good true football movies are sparse. There's "Rudy" and "Brian's Song," but that's it. A Bronko Nagurski story could add to this short list.<P>Most of the book reads like a docudrama, utilizing storytelling techniques rarely found in sports books.<P>If I were a high school football coach, I would have my players read this book. Bronko Nagurski played the game before the lights shone brightly on the pocketbooks, when the swagger and dance of endzone celebrations were still years away, and the game was still played by big, tough men not pretty enough for white-toothed smiling products endorsements. Nagurski was the kind of player the NFL needs today.<P>I fully recommend "Monster of the Midway: Bronko Nagurski, the 1943 Chicago Bears, and the Greatest Comeback Ever" by Jim Dent.<P>Anthony Trendl</span>

                    <span>The name Bronko Nagurski. You know this man was not a ballet dancer. This is more than a book about "The Nag" and the Chicago Bears. It is also a book about a number of other old football names I have heard of, but knew nothing about. Sid Luckman, Hunk Anderson, Don Hutson, Johnny "Blood" McNally, Clyde "Bulldog" Turner, Beattie Feathers, George Preston Marshall, Curly Lambeau, Slingin' Sammy Baugh, and, of course, the Papa Bear himself, George Halas. This was a period of players playing both on offense and defense, no hash marks, the fat ball, the quarterback being fair game until a play is blown dead by an official, and other rules that had not been placed into the game. George Preston Marshall, owner of the then Boston Redskins who played in Fenway Park, spoke to the conservative owners about the need to change some rules to jazz up the game to make it more exciting to the public. He was lucky to have a sympathetic listener in George Halas as support for his ideas. The demise of the fat ball made it possible to throw more passes, and put an end to the endless amount of running plays. One of Marshall's best ideas was to split the league into two conferences, and setting up a championship game each year. For all his good ideas, he stated he wanted Negroes out of the game. Black players had been part of the game since 1920, but Marshall's appeal banned black players from further play. Bronko Nagurski played for the Bears throughout the 1937 season, and left the team over a difference of $500 that The Nag and Halas differed over. Nagurski made money wrestling, and eventually came back to play for the Bears during the 1943 season. What surprised me was the number of college coaches such as Amos Alonzo Stagg and Knute Rockne who discouraged college players from entering the professional ranks. In 1990 Nagurski traveled to the Mayo Clinic to fuse bones in his ankles. A doctor asked for an autograph for his son, and The Nag wrote, "To Jeremy--Do Not Play Football. Bronko Nagurski." This is a book filled with colorful anecdotes, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</span>

                    <span>junction boys was great. the undefeated was very good. monster of the midway doesn't even compare to those books. dent shows a shaky grasp of history that will irritate any true sports afficianado. chicago fans were not enraptured with hack wilson at the expense of bronko nagurski in 1935. hack was well on his way to alcoholic oblivion by then and hadn't played for the cubs since 1931. that is just the most glaring example, and it makes you doubt everything else. it does not make the early days of the nfl truly come alive, certainly not like the experience of bear bryant's texas a&m team at junction in 1954. but bronko nagurski and those great bears teams deserve a book. the literature of pro football is so woefully behind that of baseball, and this book is at least an attempt to put a dent in that situation (no pun intended).</span>

                    <span>Readers looking for objective history here will be disappointed. Dent is not interested in presenting a critical biography of a public figure. Rather, *Monster of the Midway* is hero worship in its grandest form. Bronko Nagurski is depicted as the toughest man in a world of tough men. Even when hobbled with arthritis in his mid-30s, Nagurski is shown as a intimidating, powerful football player capable of dominating younger, better-conditioned men through sheer force of will. <P>Dent's use of voice in this book adds to both its realism and its characterization of Nagurski and his cohorts. The author's voice is very formal, disdaining the casual language often found in sports biographies. On the other hand, when quoting football men, Dent uses the gruff, unpretentious, occasionally crude dialect that we usually associate with aggressive, masculine athletes. The contrast here is effective. Dent does not try to be "one of the guys", and his implied acknowledgement of the distinction between authors and football players is refreshing.<P>Dent also makes good use of liberal tropes in presenting Nagurski and his Bears as heroic figures. The Bears' 1943 quarterback, Sid Luckman, endured disgusting Anti-Semitic epithets from both opposing fans and players. Dent shows Nagurski and the other Bears exacting retribution for these taunts, with Nagurski himself facing down a bench full of Anti-Semitic spectators in Henry Ford-era Detroit. Their fight against bigotry adds a moral thread to Dent's heroic portrayal of Nagurski's Bears, and it plays well here.<P>Through all this idealization, Dent is never overtly dishonest. He quotes Nagurski as brushing off the more grandiose tales of his prowess, including his shattering of Wrigley Field's brick wall and giving directions in rural Minnesota by pointing with his plow instead of his finger. According to Nagurski, the only thing anyone ever saw him plow was the defensive line. Through all the adulation, one gets the sense that Dent's superhero is not too far removed from the real Bronko after all.</span>

                    <span>I am a long time member of PFRA (Professional Football Researchers Association), and have read (on microfilm) the actual Chicago Tribune newspaper stories of all the games covered in this book. My sense from reading these is that Bronko Nagurski was not treated in his own time as the legendary player he has since become. For example, I don't recall in my reading of the newspapers any accounts of Nagurski carrying the ball on 19 of 21 plays (or some such) as is reported in this book, though of course the newspapers didn't report every game detail. Nagurski's season and career stats also don't necessarily support that he was the dominant runner usually depicted. His career stats indicate he carried the ball on average less than ten times per game, and in 1931, for example, this book itself states that teammate Red Grange outrushed him 599 yards to 401 (not counting one game with incomplete stats). To me these facts call into question the "Bronko as Superman" thesis.<P>A lack for me in the book is, though the book does include some statistics, it does not summarize Nagurski's career statistics anywhere. Personally, as a reasearcher, I would have liked to have seen Bronko's career summarized game-by-game in an easy to retrieve format; in effect, a more scholarly book. <P>On the other hand, this book includes much personal interest information not usually found in newspaper stories, but I would have preferred that the author not use so much "salty language" in quoting players to report this info. Perhaps this is realistic reportage, but I feel it makes the book unsuitable for young people, particularly if we are trying to teach the sportsmanship much lacking today. I am also dubious that the many direct quotes in the book were all actually spoken. <P>I also didn't like the author's habit of jumping around in chronology, even within the same season, as it made the sequence of events often hard to follow. And though the author clearly has done more research than is usual for books of this type, I still picked up on the ocassional questionable statement. For example, the author states that Red Grange ran 94 yards on the second play of the 1924 Illinois-Michigan game whereas every other source I've read says Red returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. (Interestingly, the book spends quite a lot of space on Red Grange. Since I am interested in Red's career, I often found this the most useful part of the book!) <P>In sum, if you like personal interest stories from the early days of pro football, you will undoubtedly like this book; if you are primarily interested in facts and statistics, as I am, you my be somewhat disappointed, as I was.</span>
