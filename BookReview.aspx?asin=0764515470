                    <span>I apparently misinterpreted the intent of this book. If it had been entitled: "Start A Business Using Ebay" I would have understood. I noticed that many existing businesses have expanded into EBAY sales by opening stores there also. I needed to know exactly how that would work. This is NOT the book for you if you already have an Internet outlet and wish to expand into Ebay to increase sales. It doesn't cover what you would need to know and it covers what you already know.</span>

                    <span>Although the Internet bubble burst, that does not mean that money can not be made via the Internet. Discounting all those spam e-mails about Making Money Fast, Collier provides solid strategies on starting a business using eBay. One of the best well-written business books I've ever read! I definitely recommend this to anyone who either wants to take full advantage of eBay or even just sells the occassional item. Collier's book reminds me of Guerilla PR: Wired, which details strategies for low-cost, but effective public relations coverage. Both deal with how to maximize your business's efforts and reap the rewards.</span>

                    <span>There are lots of books on eBay, but this one really helped me get organized for setting up my ebay business. It's written in a friendly authoritative style - it made me feel like I was getting advice from a very knowledgable friend.<p>I've heard Ms. Collier teach at ebay University, and this book really expands into everything I wanted to know about my business. Like where to get licenses, what to do about taxes, where I can buy merchandise without laying out hundreds of dollars (there will be plenty of time for that as my business on ebay grows).<p>I reccommend this book to anyone who's been selling on ebay casually and is ready to take the next step.</span>

                    <span>I would rate this book lower than one star if there was an option for that.  I cannot say this book is a complete loss, you may use it for a door stop.  It has not one iota of what people want to know in a book of this type.  It doesn't even address the subject, where to find things to sell.  If you are looking for a book on starting and on line store forget this book.</span>
