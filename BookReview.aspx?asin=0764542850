                    <span>This book is Outstanding.  Peterson does a great job of telling you about all the Important places in Yellowstone. Anyone who wants to travel there should by this books.  Peterson's eloquent prose delivers the goods.  A tour de force!</span>

                    <span>this book is a lot better than Petersen's previous efforts.  Well written, well organized, thoroughly detailed, and chock full of insightful insights.  Bravo, Mr. Peterson!</span>

                    <span>Can you imagine writing 243 pages on just 2 National Parks? That's why I say it's right to the detail!<p>Like all Frommer's books, the author starts with his recommendations - best vacations, best hotels, best eateries, best sights etc etc - with regards to the region in question (in this case YST & GRT). And it's really not about pure reporting the facts, but personal opinions that encourage rather than dictate your own opinion-forming process. <p>Other useful information includes month-by-month temperature information, road closures, where to get money, ATM machines etc, and, my favorite of all, When-to-go guide. There's even a section that talks about towns and cities bordering Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Parks, though they are not part of the region proper! <p>As we go deeper, the book will further the divide the regions into smaller sub-regions, such as Old Faithful Area, Norris Jct Area and Jackson Hole. You want to know which town really suits you and will make your vacation a memorable one. There's even a map showing which town is nearest to which attractions. For example if you love the Old Faithful, you won't want to fly into Jackson Hole; or if you wanna river raft in the Snake River, Cody is not the right place to reside during your stay!<p>By the look of how much I know as mentioned above, you know how good the book is! ;O)</span>

                    <span>As my wife and I were planning our vacation to Yellowstone, we stumbled upon this wonderful resource.  Mr.  Peterson has done an excellent job presenting accurate and insightfull information that made our preproduction a true breeze!  The format of this book was extremely user friendly and it allowed us easy access as we navigated through all of the endless routes and hotels surrounding the park.  Bravo!  This guide was instrumental in helping us to plan a very wonderful and memorable trip!</span>
