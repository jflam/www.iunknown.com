                <span id="Label1">Aimed at forward-thinking software developers and IT managers, <I>Software for Your Head: Core Protocols for Creating and Maintaining Shared Vision</I> provides an innovative set of procedures and reusable "patterns" for improving the way teams work together. <p>  This book's amalgam of the lingo of software patterns and management theory (and even New Age and popular psychology) helps make the text one of the most challenging you'll ever read about team building. Based on the authors' considerable experience with Microsoft and their simulated developer boot camps run with hundreds of teams, this book eschews providing practical evidence drawn from real projects. Instead, it formulates a unique vocabulary of terms, protocols, and patterns that arguably should allow teams to carry out decisions and build better team focus. <p>  The tour of tools and techniques begins with ways of getting individuals to commit totally to their work in teams. (The authors show how individuals can "check in" to work environments or "check out" as necessary.) They offer a set of techniques that can allow teams to work together more effectively, as well as obstacles (or "antipatterns") that can get in the way. Early sections culminate with a "team equals product" philosophy, arguing that highly calibrated teams will produce insanely great software.<p>  A cluster of tips and patterns for better decision making comes next. Here, the Decider pattern offers a step-by-step protocol for voting and resolving disputed items effectively. For anyone stuck in interminable meetings where egos instead of good ideas triumph, such ideas may well help change things. Alignment patterns come next, which allow teams to overcome perceived shortages of people or time to get the job done. The most far-reaching sections here argue that teams need a long-distance vision to drive their work lives. (This is considerably more ambitious than a standard corporate mission statement and involves a guiding principle that will change the world 20 years into the future.) A final, intriguing group exercise walks teams through a protocol to do something "perfect" in a group setting, with steps to refine the "design."<p>  The text closes with appendices covering Core Protocol terminology, as well as the opening statement delivered to participants at the authors' five-day boot camp (where their techniques are played out). The Core Protocols themselves, wittily released under the General Public License as open source, close out this often fascinating book. <p>  Long on theory but consciously short on any practical examples, this title offers an uncompromising vision for getting teams to work together. Though it's doubtful that your average IT department will be able to commit to such a different set of terms for the everyday workplace, <I>Software for Your Head</I> provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of highly committed and collaborative teams written by two legendary ex-Microsofties. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to the Core Protocols (protocols and patterns for team-based development), the "Check In" protocol (for centering team members on work efforts), the "Check Out" protocol (for individual time-outs), the "Passer" pattern (for not participating in group efforts), the "Connection" protocol, problem behaviors (antipatterns: "Too Emotional," "No Hurt Feelings," and "Wrong Tolerance"), additional "Check In" patterns (including "Team = Product," "Self-Care," and the "Greatness Cycle"), "Decider" protocols (for making team decisions), the "Resolution," "Work with Intention," and "Ecology of Ideas" patterns, "Decider" antipatterns (including "Resolution Avoidance," "Turf," and "Team Quackery"), guide to personal and team alignment, patterns and antipatterns for team alignment (including "Investigate," "Web of Commitment," and "Ask for Help"), building shared vision in teams, patterns and protocols for shared vision (including "Metavision" and "Far Vision"), shared vision antipatterns (including "Blinder," "Technicality," and "Recoil"), the "Perfection Game" protocol (for building team vision), appendices for the lexicon of terms used in the Core Protocols, transcript of the authors' boot camp development scenario, the Core Protocols 1.0 and General Public License.</span>

                    <span>I give this book eight out of ten.<BR>What I like about it:<BR>The ideas in this book have enormous power. They could (and can) change the way people work with each other for the better.<BR>The book presents the function that team = product. The better the team works together the better the product. This is so obvious and yet gets constantly overlooked.<BR>The patterns and anti patterns of behavior are very well observed and described.<BR>After reading this book the second time I have been to a McCarthy boot camp and the book does an admirable job of describing what is achievable.<BR>I have tried each of the protocols described in this book and I can tell you they rate amongst the best ways I have discovered of helping teams work well together.<BR>The title describes the book well, it takes some time to work this out. It is a clever idea that we can load new software into our brains and therefore become better at doing something - such as interacting with other people (or even ourselves!)<P>In order to get a ten:<BR>It would be easier to read. The book is written too much like a software manual. The McCarthy's previous book - Dynamics of Software Development - was much easier to read and proved to be very popular with the development teams I introduced it to. Software For Your Head requires commitment to read to the end.<BR>The examples would be clearer. Throughout the book are stories which serve as examples of the ideas being presented. I often have to read these a second time to get the full meaning of them.<P>For more of Dr. Neil's reviews go to http://www.Roodyn.com/BookReviews.aspx</span>

                    <span>This book is a true gift. Jim and Michele presents an excellent set of "protocols" that will help you create and be a part of a great team with shared vision.<P>I worked as a programmer, and then as development manager for years. I lived the times when my team was closely knit, and then times when things were not going as well. I really I wish I had the "Software for Your Head" experience much earlier in my career. <P>I recommend you to put your skepticism aside, keep an open mind and read it all the way. The "protocols" are very simple to execute, and surprisingly enough, you will see that it makes a huge difference in your daily life even when you are the only one in your office who knows about the protocols.<P>< Of course, I also highly recommend attending the Bootcamp itself. I believe it is a "must have" experience for every professional. ><P>Happy reading,<BR>Tolga.</span>

                    <span>I've read the book and sponsored several of the Boot Camps in a company. The protocols work and they are not just for any IT or high-tech team as some reviewers have noted. We took groups of Sr. and Executive management as well as mid-management and technical professionals through the boot camp and it really helped solidify these groups and raise their performance level. Several of them then took the BC to their teams. One particular exec takes his team through the BC almost every year. <P>Yes, there's some pretty deep psychology and maybe a little new age in the text but there's nothing harmful about it at all. The Core protocols are great and I continue to use them all and teach teams these protocols.<P>The book is a tough read, but worth it. The boot camps are really good and will blow you away.If you really want to jump start a team and get them firing on all cylinders then read the book and get a boot camp quick. It's worth the investment. But I do recommend you ensure it's a fit for your culture. The authors are very knowledgable but will pretty much tell you how it has to be to be successful with the Core and a boot camp. This can be too painful for some organizations but if you really want to change then it may well be for you.</span>

                    <span>In Chapter 20 of _Peopleware_ Mr. DeMarco and Mr. Lister tried to list things that would make a team jell. They came up with the un-inspiring 0(zero) things you can do to make a team jell. From this stopping point, they came up with their famous reverse-angle chapter 'Teamicide'.<P>This is the book that should have been written in place of that chapter. Devotees of the people side of IT development will find this book useful in diagnosing what's wrong on their team, and they will a good idea of how to start fixing it. This book has probably advanced the sociology of IT teams past where it has been since DeMarco & Lister. Warning, this book is not for the timid, or for those that think the people side of IT is unimportant.<P>One thing the authors don't make clear is if one has to take their bootcamp course to implement these procedures, or if this book can be used as-is.</span>

                    <span>The material in this book was derived from years of intense experimentation with real teams. This experimental nature really appealed to me and so I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, the book does not feel polished and so that experimental nature really shows through.<P>The lack of polish is a result of poor editing, not necessarily poor experiments. My main gripe is that the sentences and paragraphs are just too hard to read- there's no flow. "By accepting or practicing a lack of integrity, you leave the better parts of your presence behind." Sentences like these make me feel like the authors pulled "eureka!" type statements from their bootcamps and plunked them down in the book naked. The surrounding material often doesn't support complicated statements like these well, and so the complicated material is that much more ambiguous. "What are they trying to get at here?" is the sort of question I found myself asking too often while reading the book. <P>I disagree with the statement in the Richard Dragan review that says this book is "long on theory but consciously short on any practical examples." SFYH is *mostly* concrete things you can do to foster a team that is engaged and strives for excellence. However, it puzzles me that the book does not provide any anecdotes from their bootcamps that support the protocols they are proposing. I think the material would have been a lot more friendly if it would have stepped away from technicality now and again to illustrate the material with examples: "this one time.. in bootcamp.. Frankie was acting like such an ego dork and we.."<P>I see a lots of parallels between the ideas from Covey's "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" and this book. Covey does a great job of explaining how highly effective people operate, and SFYH implements many of their habits in its patterns. Additionally, Lencioni's "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" does a great job of illustrating a dysfunctional team and I see a lot of synergies between the dysfunctions outlined in that book and the problems that SFYH aims to address with concrete things you can do, and mindsets that you must take.<P>Despite my criticisms, there are lots of ideas in this book. I happen to like a lot of them. The way you think about how you work will be different after reading this book. It's just a shame the authors didn't express their ideas more clearly and more succinctly.</span>
