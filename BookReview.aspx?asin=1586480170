                <span id="Label1">"As a child of the movies, I was torn between wanting to be Julian Marsh, the Broadway producer in <I>42nd Street</I> ... and Hildy Johnson, the hellbent-for-leather reporter in <I>The Front Page</I>," writes Don Hewitt in his engaging autobiography. Luckily for him, he found a way to be both at CBS News, most notably as producer of <I>60 Minutes</I>. Hewitt barely knew what television was when a fellow print journalist told him of an opening at CBS in 1948 ("You mean, where you sit at home and watch little pictures in a box?" he asked), but his decisive personality suited the new medium's spontaneous techniques. Born in 1922 and raised in New Rochelle, New York, he sees himself as an average guy whose middle-of-the-road political and social attitudes are shared by the American television audience. He modeled <I>60 Minutes</I> on <I>Life </I> magazine: "a family friend in the home of millions of Americans each week, serious and light-hearted in the same issue" with one prime directive--to tell a story. <p>  In chatty, colloquial prose, Hewitt hits the show's high and low points, including a frank discussion of the compromises made to air an interview with Big Tobacco whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand and a blistering critique of the way those compromises were depicted in the movie <I>The Insider</I>. He pays warm tribute to his reporters, particularly Mike Wallace, writes appreciatively of CBS founder William Paley, and candidly discusses his differences with Paley's successor, Laurence Tisch. Hewitt doesn't pretend to be a saint; he accepts the mingled imperatives of journalism and commerce that drive TV news without (usually) sounding too defensive. His memoir pungently chronicles the evolution of broadcast journalism and expresses faith in the idealism that still fires the men and women who practice it. <I>--Wendy Smith</I> </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've always enjoyed reading the stories of industry pioneers, no matter what industry and Hewitt is a living pioneer of early television news.  From his career as a merchant Marine in World War II up unto his creation and production of 60 minutes, Hewitt shares anecdotes and accolades of the people he's worked with and against.  
<br />
<br />He began in television news back when the Murrows and the Cronkites wouldn't have considered leaving radio.  He produced the only Kennedy-Nixon debate and is convinced that not wearing makeup on TV cost Nixon the election.  He didn't really care for Nixon much post Watergate, but unlike most of the newsmen of his generation, he didn't really fall for the aura of John Kennedy either.  
<br />
<br />Hewitt tells of how he convinced Frank Sinatra to sit down with Walter Cronkite in the mid 1960s, and how Sinatra blew up when questioned about his mob ties.  Luckily for Hewitt he was around long enough to outlive Sinatra and get the real story from his daughter Tina 30 years later.  The story gives more plausibility to the Kennedy assassination being a mob hit.  
<br />
<br />The latter half of the book focuses on Bill Clinton's infamous interview during the 1992 election and how Hewitt's treatment of James Carville got the show barred from the White House.  
<br />
<br />Near the end he goes in to a deep explanation of Lowell Bergman and the inaccuracies of the film THE INSIDER.  After explaining for pages and pages of how Bergman is disingenuous, he catches us off guard by saying that he would have forgiven the filmmakers everything had they cast Robert Redford in his role.  Philip Baker Hall isn't an actor, that's a dormitory, Hewitt jokes.  
<br />
<br />Hewitt is an interesting guy with a great life and it's hard not to like this book.  </span>

                    <span>Ok, so he isn't a writing genius, but he KNOWS television and how to keep a quality broadcast show on top. The premise of the 60 minutes show is to "tell us something we don't know!" And that it does! Don Hewitt is a pioneer. When you read his book, you find out the conception of ideas that began with Hewitt. 
<br /> 
<br /> He is humorous and shares some funny anecdotes, and yet, he keeps the story going with a cool conversational voice. It's an easy read. Hewitt shares facts about the birth of the show, the cast, and the excellent collection of guests. There are several pictures of him with Presidents and other celebrity notables. 
<br /> 
<br /> Take time to read this book. You will not only be entertained, but you will be informed. He knows his history!!....MzRizz</span>

                    <span>I expected of Don Hewitt's book something on par, at least professionally, with "60 Minutes"; not so with "Tell Me A Story." This is an okay book-- always straight forward,  occasionally telling, a few juicy tidbits-- it's just not a well-crafted, fascinating book. Don Hewitt is a masterful producer with a keen instinct for a good story. The medium of television is his, hands down. Hewitt is not a fine storyteller however. When Hewitt breaks into a sprint of passionate interest, the reader soon begins to realize that the excitement is all about Don, written by Don, and relived through Don's (perhaps) revisionist memory. <p>In brief, if this were lying about at a church booksale, I'd recommend you snap it up at a tenth the price-- great beach or bath reading.</span>
