                    <span>Historical reviewer Carter was correct in putting Diggins in the synthesis camp. Diggins acknowledged the revisionist view on many events. He agreed with the revisionist view that Roosevelt could have done more to save Jews in the concentration camps. But Diggins also pointed out the traditionalist view that Roosevelt felt defeating the Nazi war machine was the best long-term salvation for the Jews.<br>He showed both sides over the debate on dropping the atomic bomb.  He brought up the revisionistsï¿½ opinions that Truman could have simply had a demonstration of the bomb on an island near Japan, and that the second bomb was dropped too soon after the first, not giving the Japanese government time to react. Yet Diggins also admitted that Japanese soldiers had not shown a willingness to surrender and that an invasion would have killed more people than the bombs killed. He wrote: ï¿½The sorrow and the glory in this period of Americaï¿½s past are inseparable. To be worthy of truth, history must make us shudder as well as smile.ï¿½ Diggins is a true synthesis historian.</span>

                    <span>Having been assigned this book for a UCLA history course, I expected the usual leftist slant.  I found no such slant, however.  This book was bold: chapters on not only the basics of the era (WWII, Korean War, McCarthyism), but on American social trends.  The standard political history I thought I was to read turned into a unique blend of the political and social aspects of America through the "proud decades".  Blasting away any such slant I cynically assumed would exist, the author writes on such figures as William F. Buckley, Jr. and F.A. Hayek.  I must admit, such references are brief, but the fact that were indeed there says a lot about the work as a whole.  I commend the author for producing a "one-stop shop" for America in the 40's through the 50's.</span>
