                    <span>Conquer your clutter. Stop being a slave to your stuff. Understand why it's so hard to get rid of things.<p>What would your life be like if you could accomplish these three things? How much happier would you be? How much more peaceful would your life be?<p>Author Harriet Schechter gives you a step-by-step solution in her book, Let Go of Clutter.<p>In the first chapter, Why Letting Go is So Hard to Do, Schechter explains why we may be biologically programmed to accumulate, why the fear of regret keeps us from discarding stuff, and how society encourages us to gather more and more.<p>Chapter 4, Purging Paper and Preventing Piles, is another favorite chapter. The author walks us through the method she uses with her clients to quickly sort and purge paper piles. She recommends a File Index, and shows you how to set it up for your household.<p>The last part of the book looks to the future and explains how to keep your home clean once you've decluttered it.<p>This book is filled with lots of fill-in-the-blank forms and step-by-step pathways to take you from clutter-filled to clutter-free.<p>If your clutter is taking over and you've reached the end of your rope with no idea where to start, check out Let Go of Clutter.</span>

                    <span>Got a kid, then you understand the true meaning of the word pandemonium. I bought it for the wife hoping we could figure out how to clean up after "the kid" our 3 y/o son, and organize her accumilated junk(wife's a pack rat).  Needless to say, she nor i read it through to the end, but the bit i read was an interesting approach. I still trip over tonka trucks & lego blocks, the insects need a treadmill and the newspaper pile is now a permanent corner structure. Maybe one day I'll finish the book....its a step in the right direction. Buy it.</span>

                    <span>This is a workbook, complete with checklists, that will help you assess & conquer your clutter problems.  I've read many books on this subject; this is one of the better ones.  I found her sections on "purging papers" to be particularly useful -- as papers are often an overwhelming problem area.  Schecter also discusses the value of being choosy, and give tips on how to maintain a clutter-controlled environment once you've established it.  I found this to be a useful tool book, with solid, practical tips.  For motivation to get started decluttering, for inspiration and funny (as in "yikes, that sounds like me") stories about people with serious clutter issues, read Don Aslett's "Packrat" and "Clutter" books -- they're very entertaining & you'll want to stop every chapter or so to clean out a drawer or closet.  Follow up Aslett with this book, which has more practical tips</span>

                    <span>Clutter can really control and ultimately destroy your life. Some people hang on to little things, insignificant things. They can't let go. I may need it some day. I think I'll hang onto it. Soon you find that you have no place to sit. Soon you find that you have no place to stand. You have to let go of the clutter. You see it. You recognize it. You know it's destroying you. But you can't let go. This book is a rare find. It identifies this trait and examines it. But most important is just the fact that it lets you know that you are not alone. There is hope.</span>
