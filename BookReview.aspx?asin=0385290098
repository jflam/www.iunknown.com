                    <span>He says there is a need for better education, and I have no doubt in my mind that there must be a good reason for teachers to reform schools, or else, this could not still be relevant today.<P>But, there must also be a new way of perceiving things. I guess he needed to quantify an understanding of how things must be ingratiated into a person's life so as to be relative to their causal needs--<P>But let's stop for a second. Isn't this getting a bit too complicated for the purposes of a school with very little to teach but what's gone on in the teacher's mind the previous night?<P>I myself went to school, and had to drop out. There was no need for me to go back anyway. Many times I wanted to go deep--really deep--into something that astounded me, but time ran out. I was often left irritated with a void that had faded into the outer world, including everything that may have been there to begin with.<P>Several weeks passed after I fell out of the old high school system. I wandered into alternative schools and ended up hiring a tutor, taking several tests (forgiving myself kindly that there was no measured place for me to go), and finding not very many locations to go to in order to find someone beyond myself with a keen eye for knowledge--basically, a good teacher.<P>I really needed somebody who was different until I found out one day who it was I was looking for: myself! I found in myself the needs and the wants, the desires to strive to achieve beyond myself and through myself, through life itself, and seeing the art of it all.<P>So in the end, what does education really want? I for one think that we should have less intervention, in whatever way possible. Because there is that part of us still believes we know more about the world than we ever will. But is this part of us wrong? Ultimately, there are many ways to break free from the surface of our thoughts. By giving up our ideas of ourselves, and understanding reflexively our lives, our changing shades, we can come to a conclusion that's definite that the world and the school of our lives are interconnected, as all the reasons for learning come back to us, and always as one.</span>

                    <span>I first read this book in 1972 when I was in undergraduate school and it was "news." It still affects how I think about teaching / learning to this day. <BR> Useing the truths found in Postman's book will help foster a fundamental change in the way our children learn - a change which could (literally) change the world for the better - one person at a time. It is as fresh today as when it was written and whether you are a student or a teacher - I recommend you find a copy and read it NOW.</span>

                    <span>Quite simply one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. However hard it is to get a copy, it is MUST reading for anyone involved in educating people. Heavily influenced by McLuhan, this book is devastating in showing what classrooms REALLY teach - that there is one right answer, that the teacher has it, that memorising facts is important, that fellow students have nothing to contribute, etc etc - and how to construct an environment in which REAL learning takes place - where people learn how to learn themselves. This is one of those books that shakes one's previously-unexamined foundational assumptions of education. I cannot recommend it too highly.</span>

                    <span>When the first chapter of a book on education is called 'Crap Detecting', you know you are on to a winner! Postman's provocative look at the nature of the classroom and how we educate our children is a must read by anyone who has a real interest in education being about more than tests and tick boxes. I have read this book many times and have never failed to be challenged, enthused and uplifted by it. My classroom and teaching style has been transformed by it - read it!!! Your teaching will never be the same again!</span>
