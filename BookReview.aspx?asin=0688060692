                <span id="Label1"><p>When Robert Pirsig's <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> was first published in 1974, it caused a literary sensation. An entire generation was profoundly affected by the story of the narrator, his son, Chris, and their month-long motorcycle odyssey from Minnesota to California. A combination of philosophical speculation and psychological tension, the book is a complex story of relationships, values, madness, and, eventually, enlightenment.</p><p>Ronald DiSanto and Thomas Steele have spent years investigating the background and underlying symbolism of Pirsig's work. Together, and with the approval of Robert Pirsig, they have written a fascinating reference/companion to the original</p><p><i>Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> serves as a metaphorical backpack of supplies for the reader's journey through the original work. With the background material, insights, and perspectives the authors provide, <i> Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> is destined to become required reading for new fans of the book as well as those who have returned to it over the years.</p></span>

                    <span>The inclusion of edited material from ZAMM was welcome. I found I was distracted when I was actually reading ZAMM andreferencing the guidebook. My suggestion - read ZAMM completely then refer to the guidebook to explore a section more deeply. The reviews of ZAMM were of passing interest, from the early reviews published after the book's release to later ones and their criticism. <br>I'm not a deeply devout person of any given persuasion, so the religious comparisons and references were of lesser importance. I think they would be helpful if one were looking to delve deeper into Buddhism or other philosophy. This Guidebook DID ADD to my overall understanding and enjoyment of ZAMM.</span>

                    <span>This is a high-level overview of related to the ZMM philosophical material, fairly interesting both as a commentary to the book itself and by itself, as a means of general edification. Part of this book is an extensive bibliography that can be resorted to to in order to go beyond the information in the book itself. The page-by-page commentaries and fragments of the original manuscript lost in editing are interesting too. One section of the book that I found unnecessary was reprints of the ZMM reviews in the press, not much of interest there. All in all, a very curious book, if you've read the ZMM itself, you'll like this one too. And btw, even though I did read the ZMM, I did not like it, I found it artificially obfuscated, pompous even, with too many literary tricks at the expense of the original thought. What I'm getting at is that the "Guidebook..." is still interesting to read, whether you liked the ZMM or not, or even read it at all.</span>

                    <span>For fans of ZMM, this is an incredible book that summarizes various aspects of the ZMM book.  First and foremost, it gives you the necessary background on philosophy to get a better understanding of where the Pirsig is coming from.<p>Secondly, it is great studying material for those of us who're interested in getting deeper into the issues that Pirsig gets to in the ZMM.  Particularly, I liked the section in this book that relates Quality with Taoist principles.<p>A must have!<p>It can be read without reading ZMM, BTW.</span>

                    <span>Additional background material, both philosophical and historical, really illuminates the original Pirsig book.  The bonus is sometimes startling insights, and new questions (often unanswered for the reader to work out).  Think of it as an informal but well-written textbook by teachers who care  both about the material and the student.  It lures the reader into further  self-study in epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, and ethics.  Contains  valuable passages that were edited out of the original Pirsig book.</span>
