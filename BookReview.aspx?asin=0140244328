                <span id="Label1">If you've ever made a secure purchase with your credit card over the Internet, then you have seen cryptography, or "crypto," in action. From Steven Levy-the author who made "hackers" a household word-comes this account of a revolution that is already affecting every citizen in the twenty-first century. <i>Crypto</i> tells the inside story of how a group of "crypto rebels"-nerds and visionaries turned freedom fighters-teamed up with corporate interests to beat Big Brother and ensure our privacy on the Internet. Levy's history of one of the most controversial and important topics of the digital age reads like the best futuristic fiction. <br><br> "Gripping and illuminating."

                    <span>This easy-to-ready short history by writer Steven Levy, who has written numerous articles for Wired, is a very well-researched volume on the human side of public-key cryptography. <P>Levy has interviewed all of the major players: Diffie, Adleman, Chaum, Zimmerman, and others; he's done nearly a decade of research on the subject, and monitored the sci.crypt.* newsgroups. Clearly, this is an authoritative account of the short 30-year history of public key.<P>The main theme of the book is how the NSA tried to stifle new developments by the researchers, placing secrecy orders and classifying their patents and papers. Throughout the book, as Levy draws out the characters, it's the crypto community vs. the government, until ultimately the cypherpunks win out.<P>This book doesn't contain a single diagram; no photos, and no equations at all. So if you're looking for a technical introduction to crypto, look elsewhere; this is purely an informally-written account on the people behind the scenes.<P>Five stars, for what it is; sure, Levy writes with magazine-style prose, but this fits the high-level view he takes on the subject. Most importantly, this volume was exhaustively researched and has the collaboration of all of the key players, which lends Levy's account great credibility.</span>

                    <span>This book is a contribution to the History of crypto and computing, assuming that this history changes very much our everyday life even if we are not into computer field. <BR>It focuses on the story of the people who opened the crypto Pandora's box, allowing todays e-business long before the word was even invented. It starts with Whit Diffie (Diffie-Hellman) in the late 60's, through Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) and ends with Zimmerman (Pgp) and Helsingius (remailer). It also follows other conributors to crypto and business people (eg. : from RSA, Lotus) as well as some politicians and people involved at the NSA.<BR>The author describes the oppositions between the pro-crypto-for-everyone and the US government, the government self-contradictions and oppositions with the tech firms. This includes facts about the NSA, the Clipper Chip issue, the patents problems, etc. These are always seen from the viewpoint of the various people involved at that time. <BR>It is easy to read and does not need any technical or maths background. If focuses on the people. It does not discuss the subject : it tells us the story. <BR>If you are looking for a book about crypto in order to understand "how it works", forget this book. If you want to understand how people with one obsession can change the world, just read it. <BR>The author manages suspens very well, from the beginning to the end. This book is hard to close : you really want to get to the next page. <BR>So why not 5 stars ? Because I think this book could have been perfect with just a few diagrams showing the crypto algorithm (eg. : differences between Diffie-Hellman and RSA are not clear). Ok... ok... I give 5 stars only to books which change my life. This one is exciting, informative and well written, but not to that point.</span>

                    <span>According to the flyleaf, David Kahn (who wrote "The<BR>Codebreakers") said of this book that "Steven Levy has written<BR>cryptography's 'The Soul of a New Machine'". There may be some<BR>truth to that, but mostly it implies a level of prose that is not<BR>in evidence in this book. Steven Levy is no Tracy Kidder, aside<BR>from an occasional tendency to let his prose override his<BR>writing. What Levy is, however, is a pretty good technology<BR>journalist, and the book is at its best when it trades on that<BR>background. Indeed, Levy used a great deal of research in this<BR>book which doesn't appear to have been used for his earlier<BR>magazine articles. While the book is not footnoted, there is an<BR>extensive "notes" section at the end. There is also a<BR>bibiliography, and an index.<P>One thing that Levy fails to do is make his "characters" come<BR>across as fascinating individuals. This is not for lack of<BR>trying -- clearly he finds them fascinating himself. However,<BR>his prose fails him, particularly when trying to raise what a<BR>journalist would call "human interest."<P>The strength of the book is not in its revelations of fact<BR>either. The events described are already well-known to anybody<BR>with an interest in the subject (in a number of cases,<BR>particularly for events over the last decade, this is due to<BR>Levy's own journalism in "Wired" and elsewhere). Aside from<BR>filling in the history for those previously unaware of it, Levy's<BR>interviewing skills turn up new evidence of the answers to one of<BR>the most frequently repeated questions in the history of open<BR>cryptography: "what were they thinking?"<P>For me, that is both the most important and the most interesting<BR>question that Levy needed to face, and he takes it head-on. In<BR>particular, he adds considerable scope (although little depth) to<BR>describing the history of the Clipper chip. What were the NSA<BR>(and the politicians) thinking? Well, as Levy describes it, the<BR>key was the conflict between the FBI and the NSA, and the<BR>illogical government approach was largely driven by the resulting<BR>schizophrenia. Conspiracy nuts won't like that conclusion, but<BR>it makes more sense than believing that the government really<BR>expected it could put the crypto genie back into its bottle.<P>For those who don't appreciate the importance of crypto in the<BR>Internet-connected age, this book is the best education in that<BR>area. There is room for a better one to replace it, but it<P>doesn't exist now, and likely won't be written.</span>

                    <span>I've read Simon Singh's book on the history of cryptography, and had some doubts whether this book would add much, but having enjoyed Levy's "Hackers", I bought this book as well.<P>This book focuses on the second half of the 20th century, and on the subjects of privacy in the digital era, and thus has little in common with Singh's book.<P>The book covers a lot of ground in a relatively short text (about 300 pages) in a clear and fascinating way, and I've enjoyed the book and finished it in a couple of days.<P>Other reviewers noted that the book contains little technical information. I think it makes for better focus on the larger issues of privacy, security, e-commerce, etc.<P>For the gory details, one can read books such as Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography.<P>My only problem with the book is that it is somewhat biased against the U.S. government's position.</span>
