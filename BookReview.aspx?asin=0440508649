                <span id="Label1">In the grand satirical tradition of Swift, Rabelais, and Twain comes...<br><br><b><i>Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot, and Other Observations</i></b>...<br><br>a scathing--but uncompromisingly fair--look at America's largest talk show host and the rest of the Republican right.<br>  <br>Penned by the Emmy award-winning <i>Saturday Night Live</i> writer whom John Podhoretz of the <i>New York Post</i> has called "the man responsible for some of the most brilliant political satire of our time," <i>Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot</i> tackles the issues--and the politicians--in ways few have dared...<br><P><br>Exploding Medicare Costs: "Why not shoot the elderly into space?  Stay with me.  Because I'm not just thinking about the budget here.  I'm talking about science.  Just think how many more manned space operations NASA could undertake if they didn't have to worry about getting the astronauts back."<br><P><br>Crime: "I have a radical gun-buyback idea that I guarantee would be a huge success.  Here's how it works: hand in a gun, get a free vial of crack."<br><P><br>Newt Gingrich: "Many of us, like Newt, have acknowledged smoking dope and reading Toffler in the early 70s.  But after reading his book, I think Newt's dirty little secret is that he smoked dope and watched <i>The Jetsons</i>."<br>   <br>Phil Gramm: "If you get beyond the fact the Gramm is ugly, mean, hypocritical, has a boob fetish, and drives his wife like a mule, he does have a certain folksy charm."<br><br>On the subject of Rush Limbaugh, Franken lets the facts speak for themselves. Listen to Rush, the "rugged individualist" and enemy of government handouts, explain how his second wife made him stop sitting around the house eating just food and go file for unemployment insurance.  And learn all of Rush's several explanations for how he avoided the draft.<br><P><br>Of course, when it comes to draft-dodging Republicans, Rush isn't alone. Reading Al's Vietnam short story, "Operation Chickenhawk," you'll savor the exploits of Privates Limbaugh, Gramm, Quayle, Buchanan, Gingrich, and George Will as Lieutenant Oliver North leads them kicking and screaming into combat.<br><P><br>And don't miss Al's informative discussion with the man who has "the easiest job in America": Rush Limbaugh's fact-checker.  And much, much more.</span>

                    <span>I've listened to Limbaugh's show a couple of times and have come to the conclusion that Limbaugh's show is not very thoughtful or compassionate. He attacks people all day on the radio and displays so little class. This book is also negative, but you get what you give, and it shows that Limbaugh is a human being with flaws, something Limbaugh seems to forget when passing judgement on everyone under the sun. Skim through it and see what a hypocrite Limbaugh is. It is just returning to Limbaugh what he has given to others. And for that, I applaud it.</span>

                    <span>I read this book knowing very little about Rush Limbaugh and some of the other people like Newt Gingrich that were included in this book. After reading this extremly funny work of satire I had to buy  more Al Franken books. This book tells true events turned into a great read and will leave you laughing outloud. If dislike Rush Limbaugh you will enjoy this book 100% and if you don't know who Rush Limbaugh is read this book and use it to create your opinion on one of the most repulsive men alive.</span>

                    <span>At first I didn't get it. Was this book really about the famous American radio star Rush Limbaugh. Then it began to dawn on me. This book is actually a novel telling about the slow decline into mindless insanity of its narrator and protagonist, a sociopath who calls himself by the same name as that great American comedian Al Franken. Clever. Whoever the real author is, he has been ingenious in the way he presents the narration. Most of the time you really think that this is Al Franken speaking. But as the distortions, half-truths, and outright lies mount, the real theme of the novel becomes evident. In the era of identity theft, this novel makes a serious contribution to what could become a new genre. The twist of an identity thief writing about a fictional character and naming that character as though he were a real well-known person is diabolically clever. One of the tip-offs is that in the novel, the Al Franken character refers to Rush Limbaugh as fat. I saw Rush Limbaugh on television recently and he is not fat. So much for reality. 
<br />
<br />I think this novel would make a great movie. Rush Limbaugh could be cast as the Al Franken identity thief. It could be a tour de force. If the real Al Franken had some sort of cameo role, say, as Newt Gingrich, the movie would present some of the same twists as the novel.</span>

                    <span>Turds?  What are you 5 years old?  Grow up.  All these rich conservatives are trying to warp the minds of the simpleton Americans (like some of these reviewers).  They use the crutch of religion to fool people into believing them.  Al Franken knows this and he's not going to let some conservative moron like Rush Limbaugh get away with lying.  Rush Limbaugh has the brain of a vegetable and a heart of coal (by the way, i think this is only time that Rush Limbaugh and vegetable have been used in the same sentence).
