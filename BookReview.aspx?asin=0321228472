                    <span>This borders on being one of the best computer books I've ever worked with. It does an excellent job of covering the topic in the sense that the example that you build is extensive enough that you really learn how to do the job. It's filled with excellent best-practice tips and tricks and it really helped me get to grips with the Eclipse environment.
<br />
<br />But as I said, it only borders on being great. It has several serious failings. 
<br />
<br />1) The code examples (even those downloaded from the the website) are devoid of decent comments explaining why things are done or what methods in a class are new and what are implementations of interfaces or overrides of super classes. This makes figuring out what is going on very difficult and unless you write the examples yourself, you are going to have a tough time with this.
<br />
<br />2) There are large sections of the book (especially in Chapter 7) where the authors take for granted that you will figure out what is happening from the code. That's fine, but put comments in the quoted code to help. That they don't do.
<br />
<br />3) There are several places in the code examples where you have to figure out why you are getting warnings and more often than not they are because of deprecated methods that are no longer applicable in Eclipse 3.0. Although the book has a disclaimer warning you of this, it is unacceptable to me that the book claims to cover 3.0 and then doesn't do it properly.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I got a lot out of this book. It's really valuable, but be prepared to sit with the book, a browser open on the author's web-site for the errata, and a lot of focus on looking at the Eclipse documentation. 
<br />
<br />This book will take you a good 4 weeks to work through if you go cover to cover. And I'm talking 4 weeks of full working days. It's excellent material but I think the presentation could use a little work.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a good book to learn about Eclipse to get our NineSYNC product to be ported into the Eclipse platform. This book helped us extensively to port the product to Eclipse. The book is very clearly explained and covers almost every practical aspects of Eclipse. After reading this book you can create commercial quality plugin with confidence just as the book states. One only topic this book is missing is about RCP (Rich Client Platform), which allows  creation of independent applications. But the eclipse.org site already contains the required sample applications to get it started.

                    <span>This book is the better one I have found for learning about plugin development for Eclipse. Most books present a very simple example which fails given the scope of Eclipse and the multitude of extension points. This one doesn't. It tries to address all the things that you may want to do (put an action in different places, integrating with different resource types (files,etc) and existing views (editors,etc), saving, UI, UI decoration, and on and on).
<br />
<br />It takes a project and puts it through a complete development cycle building and adding features through the book. While I typically don't like books that take a single example and develop it throughout, this has enough meat to make it very useful. Sections that introduce different concepts/areas, will also give you extension points/view names for those areas so I can see the book as a valuable reference after the initial read.
<br />
<br />One very cool thing with the sample project is that the authors develop JUnit tests for the UI actions and things. This shows not only how to automate testing of the UI features, but how eclipse calls your plugins. This provides additional insight that is useful not only in testing, but also in feature development. As it shows you how to load/find certain things programmatically.
<br />
<br />If you use books as a tutorial from end-to-end, and tend to type over the examples to build mechanical memory of code, you may run into a few small snags. Chapter 7 misses listing some of the classes you are going to need (minor types, which you can figure out), and some minor disagreements in the code will create errors in the project, but these are easy to fix.
<br />
<br />The code style is OK, but could be more concise and streamlined at times.
<br />
<br />I would have given the book 5 stars if it wasn't because the book was developed under a pre-release of Eclipse 3.0. This made for some of the screen shots to be inconsistent, and very few of the api calls used in the examples are deprecated. This is more for Addison-Wesley than for the authors. Publishers always want to release books early, and this is hard on both writers (writing against a changing target) and the readers getting something that doesn't match the actual product.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book and it has been a tremendous help for me in developing an Eclipse plug-in at my work.  I am new to Eclipse much less developing plug-ins for it; but this book goes step by step with plenty of examples.  I like how the authors shared various tips and techniques to help you save time.  The book is nicely details on all aspect of Eclipse workbench, wizards, views, and perspectives.  It has everything that I need to get started on developing plug-ins.  I wish I had this book before I started researching about this topic on my own with the Eclipse help files.  Use this book as a references or your guide - just use it.  It saved me at  least two weeks of trying to research it on my own.  The other part that I like about this book, is that, it dives directly into the topic with necessary details and examples; rather than sugar coat it with boring information that will make you get another cup of coffee before you start coding.  You can litterally pick up this book and start coding your plug-ins.  
<br />
<br />Also, the author developed some useful tools to help you with your plugins, such as, the "SWT Spy" and "Part Info View" tools.  I wouldn't even know where I can get these type of information without these tools. </span>

                    <span>I want to love this book but I can't. The topic is really great. But the book itself relies too much on screenshots and code fragments to carry the weight of the topic. That's a great way to present information, but not a great way to teach the topic. The text is adequate to hold it all together, but frankly I think the topic deserves a little more. I think this is the only book out there on the topic, and it's good enough to get you through. So if you are actively looking to build a plugin you may want to stop by your local bookstore to give this a look see.</span>
