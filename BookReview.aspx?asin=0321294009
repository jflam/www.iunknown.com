                    <span>After some hesitancy in upgrading the software, I decided to buy the upgraded Classroom in a Book (CIB) for Adobe Acrobat. Other than covering the new features, the format remains the same as CIB for Acrobat 6. This is a good thing as the new version carries the same clear concise instructions as its predecessor. One major improvement is one book now covers both Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Professional. In the book, features that are specific to the Professional version are set in an italicized type face and are preceded by the Acrobat logo.
<br />
<br />If you are a beginner to Acrobat document preparation, the lessons will guide you through the basics and take you through the more advanced features. While there is not substitute for experience, a first time user of Acrobat should have no trouble completing the lessons and applying the knowledge to their own projects.
<br />
<br />Experienced Acrobat users may wish to use this book as a reference and to quickly get up to speed with the new features. Depending on your level of experience, you may wish to bypass the first three chapters. Even so, I suggest spending some time reading about the Organizer, a new feature that functions like a Bookmarks applet. While not a major breakthrough, it is useful.
<br />
<br />The chapter dealing with forms creation using LiveCycle Designer is invaluable. While this is not a tutorial on successful layout, it does provide a very in depth look at the mechanics behind the creation of a form that may be filled out and printed. Features such as text fill in boxes, radio buttons and check boxes are presented along with tips on how to use them effectively. If you are not used to using Acrobat as a creative tool, this section may be an eye opener.
<br />
<br />There are also excellent sections on designing pages that make the best use of the medium and how to improve accessibility of your electronic documents. Again, while these are not definitive, the guidelines will point the way to using the features of the program to make the best use of medium in getting your message to as many people as possible. The other chapters are all equally well written and provide good groundwork for such areas as pre-press and electronic publishing.
<br />
<br />So far, I've found the Classroom in a Book series to be excellent values. This latest edition is no exception. Whether you are a seasoned veteran looking for a desktop reference or a neophyte just getting started in electronic publication, you will find something here for you.</span>
