                    <span>I teach a master's level course in facilitation and team dynamics.  Justice and Jamieson is by far the most useful and popular book in that course.  Students use it heavily in designing facilitation processes during the course, and I hear them recommending to others that they KEEP their J&J handy because they'll continue to use it.  Especially helpful:  the quick overviews of group dynamics, overt/covert issues, team member roles, leadership processes.   It helps to provide this background knowledge for the students.  The options and explanations list many more choices and rationales than usually seen in a book like this.  Examples:  multiple approaches to brainstorming, agenda development, session evaluation, interventions to manage conflict, etc.   J&J's second edition (if there is one) could be a little slicker, but you wouldn't have to change much content except perhaps to have an added section on virtual facilitation.    Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Most comprehensive book on the topic I've seen. Very practical info. I interned with a small consulting firm that did excellent facilitation work, but their only training strategy for facilitation was "watch what I do and then do it" -- no real framework for a beginner. I wish I had known about this book; it put it all into logical structure and process, and allowed me to make sense of what I had seen a few times as a beginner. I've used its many practical checklists to become a respected facilitator, and still improving thanks to this manual.</span>

                    <span>This books is a "manual" on facilitation that prepares you very quickly.  Great examples, good checklists, good index - well worth the price.  My only quibble is a small one: charge a few dollars more and improve the paper and printing quality.</span>

                    <span>This book is an encyclopedia of practical guides and scripts for all levels of facilitators.  I was able to immediately implement the carefully scripted process techniques in my University teaching and consulting work  with other organizations.  A real must for practitioners who are serious  about making groups work!</span>
