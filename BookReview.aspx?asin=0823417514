                    <span>I liked this book so much! Once I started reading it, I did not want to stop.
<br />Willy Wilson does not seem to fit in with his family. He feels like he never lives up to his parents expectations. When he is offered the chance to spend the summer with his interesting and fun Aunt Bridget he jumps at the chance. Aunt Bridget is sewing an order of 30 gorilla costumes and recovering from the death of her husband. Willy settles in to life in her apartment which is across the street from Gill Park.
<br />
<br />Music is an underlying theme to his stay and the book. Music plays continuously in Gill Park and the different styles become the rhythm of his life.  One day the music suddenly stops and the news spreads that the eccentric owner, Otto Pettingill is going to sell the park to shopping mall developers.
<br />
<br />The book has a great cast of characters who are determined to save the park. Willy grows and gains confidence in the events that follow.  Baseball games, an elevator to a tree house, gorilla masks, a wild girl, violins--this is a very unique story line with an upbeat message about the difference individuals can make in their community.</span>

                    <span>The spirit of Pippi Longstocking,  Mrs. Piggle Wiggle and Momo live in the Amy Gordon's Gorillas of Gill Park.  The people who inhabit Gill Park exhibit spunk and zest.  When Willie visits his Aunt Bridget,the feelings he brings with him (of exclusion, being different, and not quite good enough) become secondary to the need to save Gill Park and help Liesl.  This is a story in which the wit and resourcefulness of the characters, not magic, save the day.  Drawings by Matt Cordell perfectly capture the whimsical tone of the writing as well as the characters depicted in the story.</span>
