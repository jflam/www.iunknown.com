                <span id="Label1">Anyone preparing for Sun's certification exam 310-025 will find <I>Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Study Guide</I> of use. It provides a fast-paced tour of essential Java features and do-it-yourself sample test questions that will improve your chances for success on the exam.<p>  This fact-based approach highlights material that will be on the test. This means that it pays special attention to certain topics (for example, public-, protected-, and private-access rules), even though you may not normally need to think at this level of detail. Besides the basics, the text explains the details of class design and string processing particularly well. Exception handling and garbage collection in Java is also discussed, as well as class design as it pertains to the certification test. The book includes plenty of tricks and tips for what's covered on the test, along with what to watch out for in certain areas.<p>  A longer chapter on AWT for building basic user interfaces in Java rounds out this text. Every section provides challenging sample questions (usually about 20 for each chapter), which let you test your knowledge. An appendix contains more than 100 pages of answers and explanations for these self-test questions. (The companion CD-ROM features a computer-based test, similar in format to the actual certification exam.) If you have some Java experience, this book will quickly help ready you for official Java certification. <I>Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Study Guide</I> definitely delivers the goods. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B>  <table cellspacing="7" border="0"> <ul><ol> <tr><td> <li>Test-preparation guide to the Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 exam 310-025  <li>The format of the certification test <li>Java language basics  <li>Data types, arrays, and strings <li>Declarations and access control  <li>Operators  <li>Equality testing <li>Flow control  <li>Exception handling (try, catch, and finally blocks) <li>Checked and unchecked exceptions  <li>Java garbage collection  <td><br><td> <li>Mark-sweep algorithms  <li>Encapsulation and class design in Java  <li>Overloading and overriding methods  <li>Inner classes  <li>Threads and synchronization techniques  <li>Math, String, and StringBuffer classes <li>Java collections  <li>The AWT user interface classes  <li>Event handling (events, sources, and listeners)  <li>Sample test questions and answers </ol></ul> </table></span>

                    <span>I started with the first Stanek edition which had too many errors and weak treatment of some important subjects.  I found this book at a Java conference.  I found it to be well organized, well written and learned a lot from it.  There were a few errors and some an annoying inconsistency in the discussion of threads but nothing of any significant consequence -- I passed the exam easily on the first try.   One of the things I like most was that the more challenging self test questions were more difficult than those I had encountered on the exam.  Most of the questions in the self tests were very close to what I saw in the exam.  The part I like least was the CD.  It had most of the same questions as the book.  After the first two chapters I gave up the CD and went back plain old pencil and paper.  The reason I gave it four stars is that the book isn't perfect and I didn't really benefit from the CD.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book seems to have been rushed into production; it desperately needs a revised second printing.  As it stands, however, there are just too many errors and misstatements for it to be taken seriously.  Also, the topics are somewhat out of line with the questions on the exam.<p>Finally, a tough blow for people who are studying hard for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam:  in nearly every one of the practice tests at the ends of the book's chapters, one or more of the book's suggested answers to their own test questions are simply wrong, wrong, wrong.  If this book's practice exams give you high marks, you probably will not do very well on the actual exam.<p>If I hadn't switched over to the Sybex book, I probably would have failed the exam, but I passed it the first time.  However, it cost me a week or so of finding and unlearning all the misinformation that I had already absorbed.  So I recommend avoiding that.</span>

                    <span>What I like about the book:<br>- Writing style, easy to follow, good examples<br>- End of chapter summaries (a few diagrams would help)<br>- End of chapter exam with answers (good measure of progress)<br>- Simulated exam (although I would like more that than just one test)<p>What I did not like about the book<br>- Errors in text of book, - way to many of them<br>- Errors in end of chapter exams, - again way to many<br>- Errors in simulated exam (had the least errors once the update was applied)<p>If the publisher could fix the errors, this would be a great book. Web site has an update for the simulated exam (still had errors), but I could not find anything for the text or end of chapter exams. Accuracy is a must when you are buying a book to study to pass a java certification exam.<p>Update: took the Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Platform 1.4 Examination on Oct 3rd, 2002 and passed.</span>

                    <span>I had ONE goal - to pass the certification exam. I had ONE book to study from - this book. And it did the job. It covered all the objectives for the exam. The questions at the end of chapters are a good shakedown to highlight your weaknesses.<p>If you can notice each and every little typo, that's a compliment to the book, it has prepared you well enough to notice the right from wrong. All you need to pass this exam is: this book + mock exams (beyond what's available on the CD).</span>
