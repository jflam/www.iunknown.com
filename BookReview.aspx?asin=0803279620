                <span id="Label1">Fred Lieb, who covered his first ballgame in 1911, continued on to prowl pressboxes across the land for nearly seven decades. His <i>Baseball as I Have Known It,</i> is aptly titled; over a long and distinguished career, he knew just about everyone worth knowing in the game, and saw pretty much everything worth seeing. His recollections of the 1919 Black Sox, the Yankee dynasties of the '20s and '30s, and his affectionate reminiscences of Christy Mathewson and Lou Gehrig make <i>Baseball as I Have Known It</i> particularly worth knowing, too.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this.  Fred Lieb does a remarkable job covering the major events that occured in baseball during his career in baseball as a writer(1911-1975).  It begins with him as a young sports writer covering the 1911-1912 World Series witnessing players like Christy Mathewson, Homerun Baker and Fred Snodgrass.  He then dedicates individual chapters talking about his relationship with Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Lou Gherig, Pete Alexander and Christy Mathewson and his opinion on their place in baseball history.  He talks about the effect the 1919 World Series fix had on baseball and how Landis was the games savior as he calls him.  He also has chapters on some of his favorite mangers that he covered including Connie Mack, Casey Stengel and Joe McCarthy.  He concludes this excellent book by comparing and contrasting how the game has changed since his youth(1890s to early 1900s) to today(mid 1970s at time of writing) then picking his all-time teams in 25 year spans from 1876-1975. Any baseball fan with an interest in the games history should definately pick this book up.</span>

                    <span>Fred Lieb knew the players he talks about personally.  Anything written by Fred Lieb about baseball is coming from a true authority on the subject.  Baseball has a history unlike any other sport.  No other sport can touch  it, and in reading about it from Fred Lieb you are getting it from a true  master.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy the book.</span>

                    <span>The romanticism of baseball's glorious history is well documented by Fred Lieb. His unique perspective of having followed the game as a young fan growing up in Philadelphia, then covering it as a sportswriter, allows the author to offer great knowledge of his beloved sport. Lieb also allows the reader to experience the thrills he enjoyed covering the game, as well as the human side of the ballplayers, on and off the field. This is absolutely a must read, both for the casual fan of the game, as well as those who thrill in baseball's glorious past.</span>
