I tried the publisher, who was no help. I performed searches, read forums, and then finally typed the authors name in as the web address and sure enough finally have the code. So, if you purchase this book first make sure you can actaully get your hands on the code. ...</span>

                    <span>Finally a book that didn't assume I was coming from a C/C++ background. I have between eight and ten different books that looked like "the one" to teach me what I wanted to know in Java. I have little interest in learning applets or SWING based interfaces...my interest is in web based interfaces. This book spoke in terms I could understand easily based on a ColdFusion frame of reference. Eben Hewitt does a great job comparing and contrasting java data structures with ColdFusion ones and letting the CF developer know exactly what the pros and cons the different approaches entail. Th examples are good and applicable to the types of applications I would build. I strongly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>A common experience for someone who wants to learn Java is to end up buying too many books, each covering a different aspect (servlet, JSP, Jakarta Struts, ad nauseum), with overlapping topics, and at times even contradicting one another. Eben Hewitt, who has written extensively about ColdFusion and also authored a ColdFusion training course on CD-ROM, has probably written the only book book on Java that you'll need if you are a ColdFusion developer. <P>His writing is clear, concise, and he tries everywhere possible to relate Java to some aspect of what a ColdFusion developer does in CFML. His coverage of Java may not be as thorough as a Java purist (or fanatic) would want, but everything you need to know is really there within one book, instead of maybe ten. It is enough to wet your appetite, and if you then are still a glutton for punishment, you should seek more detailed and specific reference for the particular platform that you are working in, be it SUN's, IBM's, BEA's, or whatever vendor software your company happens to be using. But, Java is platform-independent, you say! Well, there is this bridge in Brooklyn...</span>

                    <span>This was a great book, a few of the chapters you have to read through again, but that is more due to the complexity of Java than the writers fault. The one thing I really liked about this book is that it deals specifically with real world application of Java with Coldfusion on the server and was very easy to follow, unlike some Java books that jump all over the place using snippets of code or techniques that were not covered in previous chapters.</span>

                    <span>When I began reading "Java for ColdFUsion Developers", I was excited to see how similar writing a Java program is to the syntax used to write CFScript or Action Script. This is an excellent time to learn all three!<P>The author has organized his information in a logical manner that builds from the basics and moves throught topics that include programming structures and object-oriented application design. Specific to CF developers is the chapter on "Extending ColdFusion with Java" to leverage ColdFusion use in J2EE environments.<P>Hewitt has an easy tone that makes you feel as though he's talking directly to you. He includes code for creating class files as he moves along to allow you to write and compile as you go. An experienced author with two other CF books behind him, he introduces Java to experienced CF developers who may come from a web background instead of hard-core programming. The book covers the basics thoroughly without breaking your back (unlike other books in my backpack!)<P>It's not a book for those new to ColdFusion or other types of programming, but it's an excellent resource for those of us who are overwhelmed by the current number of cryptic Java books available. As the introduction to Hal Helms reads, Eben Hewitt achieves his goal by "helping us leverage our ColdFusion knowledge into Java expertise."<P>Lisa Wilson, Manager, Sacramento ColdFusion User Group</span>
