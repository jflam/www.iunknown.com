                    <span>A serviceable summary of one of the Church's most tumultuous periods.  A pretty quick read as the text is written at a reasonable level for most introductory readers.  Provides good coverage of the whole church during this period, including Catholic and Orthodox reformations.  It is generally my contention that church history texts are not written for spatial or visual learners due to the common lack of maps and timelines, but this text sets a new standard as it only contains two total maps/figures/pictures.  Not referenced, light recommended readings, good index.  On the whole an enjoyable and helpful book for the front end of a study of the reformation, but not my favorite.</span>

                    <span>Owen Chadwick tackles the world of the 16th century. Anyone familiar with this period knows that religion, politics, and sociological factors in each of the countries in Europe created a tangled web which requires much study to understand.<p>Chadwick goes for the big picture, touching lightly on major factors, as well as some of the smaller people and problems. The chapters on Luther, Calvin, and radicals read quickly and enjoyably. Other chapters are complex, particularly the Reformation in England. It is easy to get lost or bored trying to follow the key people and events as the author gives the reader a barrage of information. <p>It appeared to me that Chadwick assumes the reader will have some knowledge of the 16th century prior to reading the book. He will at times mention someone without explaining who that person was, as he did on page 298 when he mentions Luis de Molina only by last name.<p>Overall, Chadwick's book presents the historical information in an interesting way. He gives you the big picture, wetting the appetite for more studies on some of the people events he discusses in his book.</span>

                    <span>I would give it 5 stars, but I was somewhat displeased with Owen's take on John Calvin's Geneva. There is room for criticism in Calvin's life (ie, his semi-involvement in a burning), but I felt like Owen was trying to show Calvin as being too much like a tyrant. <p>His take on Luther is excellent however! I'm a big fan of Luther, and his works - and Owens dealings with Luther were wonderful and right on target! <p>Owens take on the Counter-Reformation was also great, and his describtion of the spread of Christianity soon after, the rise of the Jesuits, etc. were wonderful. <p>Overall it was a great book!</span>

                    <span>Being a proud Protestant as I am, I wanted to research the Reformation, so I read this book.  This book is excellent.  I will bring the Reformation and all of her issues to life for you!  Few hisorical books can do that, but this book is an exception.  It's filled with passion and devout study.   If you're a Prostestant and proud of it, this is the book for you.  Learn  about your heritage and what great men like Luther, Wesley, and Tyndale  went through to purify the faith.  This book will definitely teach you  everything you've ever wanted to know about the Reformation. I've read  books about the Reformation before, but this is the only one that satisfied  me.</span>
