                    <span>If either HTML or XML is a serious part of your livelihood, you need this book. With every property of CSS level 2 explained in a compact manner -including examples- the book can be a real time saver. <P>Eric's experience in the application of this advanced technique and his participation in the Web community is expressed in the organization and clarity of this book. No hand-holding tutorials here, just the facts and the context which gives those facts meaning.<P>And if that is not compact enough for you, Chapter 8 "CSS2 Quick Reference," condenses the material even more. Also handy is the lengthy chart on browser compatibility. <P>I can only fault the book for not going beyond its purpose. That is, the book covers the CSS specification properties only. In particular, styles implemented by Internet Explorer, which may be extremely handy yet not officially approved, are not covered.</span>

                    <span>I've probably learned more about CSS from Eric Meyer than from any other single source. As a desktop reference, this book is a must-have for anyone serious about style sheets. The breakdown of styles into media categories: Visual; Paged; Aural. Outstanding!<P>While this book is not the place to start for a CSS newcomer (that would be Eric's other book!), it is the place to come for making sure you have the right property for the right browser, and for the right media.<P>Well done!</span>

                    <span>This book is by no means an easy read and I would recommend it for reference only. In his writing, a lot of terms are not clearly explained (if at all) and I got lost many times (despite being very familiar with CSS).<P>If you are looking to learn CSS or just have a guide book, go elsewhere. As a reference book, this would be a good buy.</span>

                    <span>Since I've gotten this book, I've used it constantly as a reference for what I'll need within my detailed style sheets for my websites. It is extremely useful, but I would caution against beginning to intermediate level people using this book in high hopes of it showing how to use CSS effectively. The book clearly assumes that you have a proper understanding of CSS structure (only touching on it briefly within one section) and knowledge of what it requires within the context of HTML to make it work. None of this is clearly demonstrated. It is a resource akin to a dictionary when you're not sure of something's usage or meaning. In that sense, it is excellent. I would have liked, however, if there was some section for anticipated things within the progress of CSS (moving toward version 3.0 and any addendum aspects such as RUBY within the 2.0 scheme), so that developers and designers alike can 'think forward' for future sites and how they would be implemented.</span>

                    <span>I normally don't write reviews, but recently this book has been helping me out a lot so I thought I'd share.<P>As someone previously familiar with CSS, and fluent in a slew of other web based languages I needed a book that had all of the information I needed about CSS so I didn't have to troll the web everytime I ran into a problem. Well, this book is it. Eric Meyer is known for being the man at CSS and this book is well written and concise. I'd recommend it to anyone using CSS, fluent or not.</span>
