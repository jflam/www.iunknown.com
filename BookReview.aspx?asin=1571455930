                    <span>Earlier I had the opportunity to read Josh Leventhal's book Take Me Out to the Ballpark.  Leventhal's passion for the game was evident in his well constructed book.  Ballparks Then and Now had about half the content and sounded like it was being told by person who was totally bored by baseball.<p>Take Me Out to the Ballpark actually described the stadiums (outfield distance, peculiarities, history, fence hight, home runs hit, milestones, interesting anecdotes, etc.).  Whereas, Ballparks Then and Now came across like an eighth grade report on baseball.  "And then the Yankees played at the polo grounds and then they built their own stadium and then the Mets built their own stadium and then the Dodgers moved to Calfornia ..."<p>What was most bizarre about this book was that the text rarely lined up with the photos.  The text would talk about New York baseball in 1900 and the picture is of Yankee Stadium.  Later we see pictures of the first baseball games in New York ... while we read text about ... Yankee Stadium!<p>Do yourself a favor and get Take Me Out to the Ballpark instead.</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed several of Mr. Enders' published articles, particularly his list of the 25 greatest works of baseball art in the 2001 All Star Game program (headed by "Who's On First" and including Lou Gehrig's farewell address and the baseball box score, which he further celebrates in his "Play Ball! Baseball Scorebook").  Enders' sense of art and engrossing writing style play together brilliantly in this celebration of ballparks.  The photos are excellent, the commentary profound, and what really intrigues me are the fact boxes he creates for each stadium.  These include stadium aliases, opening dates, home teams and stadium capacity, and finish with a "Greatest Moment" from the history of each stadium.  Truly, Enders has opened himself to swift rebuke in some instances (can Kirk Gibson REALLY own the greatest moments in two historic ballparks?), but some of his chosen moments are insightful.  One of my favorites is the story of a fire that broke out at West Side Grounds in Chicago, during which two players beat down a fence to allow fans safe passage to the field.  Enders also reminds us, in word and photo, that several Major League parks hosted Negro League teams as well, and his "Extra Innings" has some nice nods to non-Major League fields of interest.  All around, well done.</span>

                    <span>I bought this a few months ago, not thinking it would be different from other books on ballparks.  To my surprise, I am still glancing at the book today!  The pictures are great, even of the older ballparks.  The book has great facts about the ballparks, too.  I highly recommmend to buy this!</span>

                    <span>Given the spate of good "Then/Now" books available which line up old photos with new ones--I find this book's title highly misleading. There is not one comparative photo set in the entire book (and many of the photos are available in other books.)</span>
