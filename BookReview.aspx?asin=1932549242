                    <span>It is unfortunate how these guys write a single book and publish 20 or more covers for it.  This book, or other ones in the series "The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training..." has no sports-specific information in them, period.  And, all the positive reviews are curiously vague.  At least, they are really bad writers, and that helps to distinguish fake praises from genuine criticism.  The bottomline is that you are not going to find anything about swimming in this book.  If you want a 60-page manual on weight lifting, go ahead and buy it but there are certainly better books out there for this purpose.  </span>

                    <span>As one other reviewer has said, this book was totally empty of any swimming-specific exercises or information. I have the feeling they simply do a find and replace and substitute "Swimming" for "Football" or "Squash" or whatever. The positive reviews for this book all look like they were put in there by friends or employees, because they obviously a. weren't swimmers, and b. didn't read the book. I wouldn't pay 99 cents for this book, much less twenty bucks. There is nothing here that couldn't be found in other less expensive and better-written books.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent training guide for the swimmer at any level.  I have been swimming for many years and after reading this book I have taken my skills to a higher level.  I feel much stronger in the pool and my endurance has really increased.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to anyone who loves to swim.</span>

                    <span>Of all the training books out there today, this is the only one i have seen that really speaks to the swimmer specifically!  This is an invaluable resource for any swimmer or coach.  I would recommend this to the novice swimmer or a pro. Two thumbs up!</span>

                    <span>I found that this book increased my speed, strength, and endurance.  Often times, by increasing strenght, swimmers lose efficiency in their strokes.  I found that this book did a great job increasing stroke power, while reiterating the need to maintain stroke efficiency.  A GREAT BUY!</span>
