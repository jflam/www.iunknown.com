It is full of relevant information including topics such as motorcycling history, chosing your first bike, safety, routine maintenance, etc.  It's an all-around solid resource for those who have the "itch."  </span>

                    <span>I've been riding motorcycles for 35 years, and while I may or may not be a complete idiot, I do know a thing or two about the sport. After reading this book, I know even more. A lot of the stuff in here I already knew and there are a couple of things I might take issue with, but overall I learned a lot from this book. For an old idiot like me this book is useful. For a new rider, it would be essential.</span>

                    <span>This book covers everything from the history of motorcycles to basic riding techniques, street strategies, maintenance, advice on buying a motorcycle, a buyer's guide in the back of the book, etc. If there is a more enjoyable, informative read on the subject of motorcycles, I haven't found it. Great book, highly recommended and well worth the money.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book Immensely. My wife and I became excited about motorcycles.  We visited at least twelve dealerships just to find out what our particular flavor of bike would be.  We began reading all types of books on Motorcycles, Motorcycle touring, etc.  The idiots guide gave me an in-depth look at the different types of bikes.  Although I finally decided on a Honda Shadow VLX as my first bike, this book opened the door for me regarding sport touring types as well.  What you have in this book is an unbiased look at bikes.  A great street wise road education is included here.  Much of this taken straight from the Motorcycle Saftey foundation.  The author/editors are not Just Harley men/women, but open to all makes and models.  Personally I can't afford a Harley.  Because of this I needed to buy a inexpensive and Reliable bike.  The Honda fit the bill on this.  Good Maintainence area is included on the chapters, and a good talk on the differences between shaft drive and Chain drive type bikes.  If you can't explain your passion for motorcycles, this will feed the your unexplained passion then continue to educate you in the process. Ride for Life with your tires on the road always.<br>One Excellent Book!!!<p>Dave Carlin, Philly</span>

                    <span>Like most "Idiot" books, this is a great introduction.  Not a lot of depth in some places, but that is better left to specific subject books. What this book does well is get you acquainted with terms and different varieties of bikes so that you can avoid making a complete fool of yourself.  Also gives good resources for further education. You wouldn't want this to be your only bike book, but it is a good place to start.</span>
