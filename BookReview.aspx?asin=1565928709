                <span id="Label1"><i>Java Network Programming</i> is a complete introduction  to developing network programs (both applets and applications) using Java.  It covers everything from networking fundamentals to remote method invocation  (RMI).  It includes chapters on TCP and UDP sockets, multicasting protocol  and content handlers, and servlets.  This second edition also includes  coverage of Java 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.  New chapters cover multithreaded network  programming, I/O, HTML parsing and display, the Java Mail API, the Java  Secure Sockets Extension, and more.</span>

                    <span>This book covers all the important things to know about network programming in JDK1.3 and Java2. The content and quality is how you expect it from O'Reilly books: thorough, complete, practical with clear examples, and with a good theoretic foundation.<P>The first three chapters provide theory about basic network and web concept and explains what you can do with Java networking. A lo of very interesting things, and that motivated me to read further. Chapter 4 and 5 are about Java I/O and threads and might be redundant for Java programmers, who already know basic Java stuff. But those chapters are necessary to understand the examples in all the following chapters. Chapter 6-19 deal with all the various networking topics and Java classes that deal with URL's, Internet addresses, sockets and datagrams, protocol and content handlers, RMI and JavaMail. The organization of these last chapters is topical; in most of the times you can understand a chapter without reading the previous ones, just pick out the one that you are interested in. (Interesting chapter about parsing HTML with JEditorPane, Swing has some unexpected applications!)<P>I think the author gave a complete and thorough coverage of all the necessary topics. The author does not stray from its topics, is sometimes a bit dry in his explanations, and gives some important side information, e.g. about security aspects of the different Java versions in regards to RMI.<P>Take in mind that this is the second edition from August 2000, updated to Java2, with some 200 or more extra pages, and we can use this book for the next couple of years.</span>

                    <span>Java Network Programming is a great topic and very challenging to write about. In the past decade, Client Server and Networking where the most popular topics in the industry. <P>Initially, Java was not an Internet/Web language oriented. Later versions, the language migrated into a more network oriented and became the language of choice among financial institutions, and others, because of its high productivity capabilities (mainly, shorter development curve.)<P>Here are a few points that I'd like to make concerning this book:<P>1.	The authors took on themselves a very large assignment, rather than reducing the scope of the book, so they could deal efficiently with the content and represent it in more technical details and depth, just as O'Reilly publication does so often. The variety of topics discussed in the book could be topics for books themselves, such as Web Concepts, Threads, Java I/O...<P>2.	A few topics are not directly affiliated with Networking, such as Threads, Java Mail API, etc. I was surprised to find the "HTML in Swing" chapter, which is a total shift from the Networking Layer to the Presentation Layer.<P>3.	The book is missing important and advanced topics in Networking, such as IIOP, Distributed Objects, EJB and maybe CORBA. I was surprised to find a chapter about RMI - an old form of distributed objects, which was replaced by IIOP and EJB in recent years. RMI was combined with IIOP (RMI/IIOP) because its poor performance. Why would anyone want to study an old topic?<P>4.	This book is lacking of a conceptual discussion about Networking Layers in general, to help users understand why with Java, Network Programming could be a piece of cake... Conceptually speaking, indeed, with Java it's a much easier task. <P>5.	The bright spot here are the samples that are almost in a "copy and paste" condition. They are easy to understand and implement.</span>

                    <span>I read this book and really enjoyed it. It is easy to read, and has lots of useful code. I like all books written by this author. If you like this book, then you should try his book on JAVA and XML. That book is well written. I would recommend this networking book to anyone who wants to learn JAVA and Networking. Some LAN experience or a networking course will help you. Buy this book -- it is worth an investment!!!</span>

                    <span>Avoid. This book appears to have quite a reputation, but despite being in its 2nd edition, it is riddled with errors. The book exhibits some fundamental misapprehensions about TCP/IP; as a result it perpetrates some astonishing misinformation, much of it quite basic. Partial list: the nature of a socket close operation; what IOException when closing a socket means; what happens when the listen backlog is exceeded; specification of the ServerSocket constructors; Nagle's algorithm (Socket.setTcpNoDelay); linger; keepalive; etc etc.<P>Of the examples which do work, the PortScanner and LocalPortScanner are provided in versions which perpetrate atrocities on the local machine and network by not closing sockets. Multi-homing very cursorily treated, not even indexed. Firewalls apparently treated in one page. Role of TTL in multicast apparently ignored.<P>The text is verbose and repetitive, and a number of the examples are irrelevant. Fully 50% of the Sockets for Servers chapter consists of a rather irrelevant excursion into HTTP and HTML; the examples have bugs, not that they have much point. Also, what pray have HTML rendering and parsing in Swing got to do with networking? 30 irrelevant pages on this; nice to have, but why here?<P>Author seems to think HotSpot is a JIT. Typos in the index, not encouraging. Many impending JDK 1.4 enhancements will shortly obsolete this book. Avoid it. For TCP/IP and UDP fundamentals, buy W.R. Stevens Unix Network Programming. -</span>

                    <span>Let me start off by saying that the content is very thorough. It covers the topic extremely well, and the examples are good. This book, however, is not for the newcomer to Java. It is assumed that you are fairly familiar with the language, and the examples are not explained very well. The text is also a bit dry. I found it hard to sit down and read. <P>Dispite the minor issue of user friendliness, this is an excellent reference on the subject of networking, and I recommed it to anyone who knows Java fairly well and wants to expand their horizons.</span>
