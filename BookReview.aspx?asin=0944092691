                    <span>I asked for (and received) this book for Christmas a few years ago and have been touched by it ever since. I've always kept it in the same spot and now that spot almost feels holy or haunted to me. 
<br />
<br />Within the covers of this book dwells the secret (but of course not secret) history of America. More than just a book of pictures... more than just a history book... this book is a stark commentary on the dreadful state of the U.S. educational system, since most school kids (even university) think lynchings were just that. A few people were hanged. The ritual, spectacle, "communal spirit", and various methods of torture and murder involved in these events are all but unknown to the majority of White America. Conveniently forgotten in the fog of time, although there hasn't been very much time yet. Just one more reason why the "hey the Civil War ended in 1865, get over it!" mentality continues. For most, the truth isn't known.
<br />
<br />"There were postcards of the hanging" is just a Bob Dylan lyric to most people who know it... not knowing the true depth of the history behind that line. Lovingly framed, dated, autographed, etc... some of these pictures lived a life of cherished momento from a good old community picnic...er.. lynching. The two events being so interchangeable sometimes, it's tough to separate them.
<br />
<br />The book is more than that, though. It's also a sacred offering to the people whose pictures are inside it, and to all those whose pictures are not, though they suffered similar fates but weren't photographed. It's a sad, grim "We haven't forgotten you" to them, their communities, and those still among us who lost loved ones this way.
<br />
<br />In an earlier review I saw mention of not liking the layout of the book... the way the pictures are alone and then the last half of the book has the corresponding date, story, details, etc... Me, I love the way the book is set up. I think having the story right next to the picture may dillute the pictures for some readers. The people in these pictures suffered some of the ultimate violations. At the very least their pictures deserve their own space. The stories do indeed add layers of pain, brutality and American history to the pictures, but the pictures will also haunt you by themselves. I think this book is exactly as it should be. To keep the picture and it's corresponding story together, I just use 2 bookmarks when I read and re-read this book. One in the picture section, one in the stories section.
<br />
<br />This book should be in every American History class.

                    <span>If you are a collector of early photos,and you also collect books on early photo collections,this book is a must as an extremely important part of your collection.It contains several pages of readable text on some noted lynching events in small but sufficient enough detail,descriptions of plates and their photo types in the back,and what other early historical photo collection book are you going such a wealth of this type of portrait?I rate this one up there with Stanley Burn's sleeping beauty(another important photo collector book).There is no doubt that this book is a must!Just get it!</span>

                    <span>Unbelievable. The editor has done a wonderful job of giving insight into Amerikkka's treatment of Afrikans during the Nadir(1877 to 1901) and up into the 1960s. Fully detailed, the editor brings these "Lost Souls" back to life with stunning descriptions of their "crimes" and their tragic deaths. If one wants to gain further insight into the lynch party and their ritualistic purpose, read Orlando Patterson's Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two American Centuries, Book 2, The Feast of Blood. Thank You.</span>

                    <span>I agree with a previous reader about the layout of the book.  The pictures are basically on the first half of the book and then you have to do a hunt and search to the back half to find the accompanying story.  This takes away so much of the books value and I hardly every have anything bad to say about a book.  It's a shame this wasn't organized better.  <br>The content is extraordinary,however and I had no idea what a lynch-happy society had existed in U.S. history.  So much of our history we don't learn in school!</span>

                    <span>After reading this book cover-to-cover, I can only agree with the other reviewers with respect to content.  However, with respect to page layout and organization -- this book is a disaster area.  The pictures are accompanied by minimal text explanations.  There is a large section of the book (pages 165-201) called "Notes On The Plates" which does provide detailed text background information for each picture.  Problem is that this way of organizing the book is EXTREMELY user-unfriendly, especially considering that there is so much wasted "white space" on the paper containing the pictures (the plates).  I was forced (and so will you!) to constantly bounce back and forth between the page number containing the plate and the page number containing the "note on the plate."  Some of those "notes" took up nearly a whole page of text by itself!  There is absolutely NO REASON why all revelant notes for each picture could not have been placed on the same page (or an adjacent page) for each photo.  At the end of the book, it states "Without Sanctuary is limited to 10,000 fourth edition casebound copies."  I would suggest a complete desktop publishing layout overhaul be performed prior to the release of any fifth edition.  The content is excellent, but the presentation is reader unfriendly!  Thus, I only gave it 4 stars.</span>
