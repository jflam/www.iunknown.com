                    <span>This is definitely THE starter book to learn vsm. Yes more examples would help, and yes so much information is covered by such little prose. The more I learn and practice lean, The more I am convinced of the importance in using value stream mapping to insure that the lean implementation process benefits the value stream (the so called critical path of the production process). 
<br />This key concept is where Six Sigma fails, and that is how do you select a Six Sigma Project that is going to impact the value stream?
<br />The authors almost dare you to work through the ONE example you are to analyze on your own but LEARNING TO SEE starts you on the way to becoming a lean sensei.
<br />STUDY STUDY STUDY this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is written just like a book on lean manufacturing should be: short, to the point, and no crap. It's very informative, easy to read, a no academic wishy-washy stuff. A great buy!</span>

                    <span>I have completely worn out my copy of this book. It is the simplest, clearest, most practical book on lean that you will ever find. The first time I used the Value Stream Mapping techniques outlined in this book, I identified an improvement that has dramatically reduced our inventory, reduced lead times and saved over $500K annually.<p>Section III, entitled, "What Makes A value Stream Lean" is especially helpful. By doing the mapping and working toward the seven guidelines outlined in this section, we have made dramatic progress in our lean transformation. Using "Learning To See" in conjunction with another offering from the Lean Enterprise Institute ("Making Material Flow"), you can transform your plant. The only other requirement... get out from behind your desk and just do it!<p>I cannot recommend this book highly enough!</span>

                    <span>Learning to see is very helpful if you want to learn to establish value stream maps of your key processes.  The book is set up like a work book and walks you through the process step by step.  J. Womack is very prescriptive in how to produce value stream maps. It would be helpful to have additional examples from several industries.  Value stream mapping is useful in helping to indentify areas that need improvement projects.  They should be the basis for strategic plans for process improvement.  This book will be helpful if you are new or trying to introduce others to the importance of value stream mapping.</span>

                    <span>The book is a good attempt at explaining how to use value stream mapping in a manufacturing plant.  The format is sort like a workbook which makes it a little easier to use and also great as a teaching tool.  What is lacking is more examples from a wide variety of industries from small to large so the reader can really understand how to apply the tool to their workplace.  There is also a lack of application to areas outside of manufacturing where I think VSM could be applied: product design process and administrative processes. Overall it seems to be a good book, but you'll need some backup material from the web to round our your education on the subject.</span>
