                <span id="Label1">There are a few basic qualities that can help folks of any age live a  happier life: a sense of personal responsibility, good sportsmanship,  willingness to share time and feelings, and the all-important trustworthiness.  These basics can be easy to forget in our busy daily lives, and that's why  <I>Start Something</I> is such a handy little book to share with friends and  family members: it helps you remember what's important. Earl Woods, author of  <I>Training a Tiger</I>, and his  son Tiger have put together a wise and friendly manual for being a better  friend, student, teacher, and community member, and it's so plainly written that  middle schoolers can make as much use of it as their grandparents.<p>  Kids starting a new activity or school will find help in pages labeled "It's Ok  to Be Nervous" and "If You Don't Know the Answer, Ask for Help". Plenty of  grownups can gain from checking out sections like "Control Your Anger" and  "Don't Spread Rumors." Role models, both being one and finding one, are an  important part of this book, and readers are encouraged to look beyond famous  accomplishments to see personal characteristics--as Tiger says, "I don't  consider other athletes to be my role models, although I admire them for their  abilities. My role model is my dad." Each of the book's many sections are short  and to the point; few run over two pages in length. <I>Start Something</I> is an  easy read, one that can be shared aloud and discussed with children of all ages.  <I>--Jill Lightner</I></span>

                    <span>I read the book and am planning to buy three more copies, one for our church library and one for my two oldest grandchildren. Children who are looking for a hero can trust that this book will be an inspirtation to them. The principles used by the Woods family while raising Tiger Woods are extremely admirable for people of all ages. It is easy reading and gives positive ideas on how to live our lives.</span>

                    <span>Earl and Tiger Woods team up in this book to provide great advice for children on how to make the most of their lives. The book begins with an introduction by Tiger that talks about the importance of being a role model, and describes his Dad as his. From his Father, he learned to "share and care." He challenges young readers. "With your help, I believe that we can make a difference in the lives of others across the world. I challenge you to join me." <P>The rest of the book contains advice by Earl for young people, the same advice that he gave Tiger. At the end of many sections, Tiger adds a quote that endorses and amplifies how he internalized these messages. Although explicitly aimed at youngsters, this book is equally valuable as role model information for parents, especially Fathers. <P>The key message is that good habits make for a better life. The book has about 70 brief essays that detail these good habits. Space limitations here prevent listing them all, but I thought they were all well worth articulating. Here are 19 of my favorite sections:<P>Follow your passion, not the pack.<P>Did you help someone today?<P>Unload your past mistakes.<P>Shut down the jerk who teases you.<P>You can pick your friends, but not your brothers and sisters.<P>You are a leader.<P>You have to start somewhere.<P>Notice the kid everyone ignores.<P>Respect your body.<P>Take responsibility for yourself.<P>Complaining is for cowards.<P>Are you listening?<P>Say hello.<P>What are you proud of today?<P>Keep promises.<P>Say you're sorry.<P>Say thank you.<P>Ask others about themselves.<P>Read newspapers. <P>Tiger Woods fans will revel in some of the stories in the book. One of my favorites is about Tiger when he was five. Earl and Tiger were watching a news program, and a story came on about children starving during the famine and civil war in Ethiopia. Earl told Tiger that a friend of Earl's was going to Ethiopia to help. Without another word, Tiger went into his room and brought back some of his cherished gold coins he collected and asked his father to send them to help the children in Ethiopia. Any parent would be proud to have such a child, even if he couldn't play golf! <P>Tiger's great golf ability is handled well in the book. Earl and Tiger make it clear that how well you hit the ball doesn't matter, it's what kind of person you are that counts. This message comes through loud and clear, and should help steer some young people away from the frivolous lives that many professional athletes live. <P>You will be proud of the Woods family as you read this book. It will reaffirm your faith in humanity and in positive role models. It is a truly heartwarming book in every way. <P>After you have shared this book with young people and begun to model your actions on Earl, think about how else you could be a good role model. What is your special gift that can inspire others to become a role model? Let me repeat Tiger's words here. "With your help, I believe we can make a difference in the lives of others across the world."<P>Love being a role model!<P></span>

                    <span>Now we know why Tiger Woods is such a winner--he believes that everyone can make a difference in the world, and this book shows how. Written by his dad (and clearly his best friend), this book has great ideas for kids/teens about how to get involved, make friends, be a team player, get along with parents, and be a bigger, better person. We especially liked the entries that addressed dealing with bullies and racism, and how to be a good winner and loser. Positive role models are so rare for kids, especially from the sports world. Tiger is a real treasure, and so is this book--it will be our #1 gift to give this year!</span>
