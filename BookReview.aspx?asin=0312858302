                    <span>A wonderful book from a refreshing standpoint, giving the reader the feeling of the 'brotherhood' of the love of the Harley -Davidson (and motorcycles in general) which spands the ocean. This book not only gives you the 'present' it goes through the history of the Harley in such a way that anyone who reads it can enjoy and understand it, as well as translating the emotions of the rider on his roadtrips.  FABULOUS  .<p>This book is only one of the many fine works of this author. . .</span>

                    <span>Five Stars and cheers to one of the best.<p>This was one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  I found my self laughing out loud and annoying my wife several times. I have recently seen the fever in full blossom in two of my friends that resently joined me and my riding friends.  The funniest part of all this is that as the fever hit each one I had them read this book and they both reported back on how funny it was to read what they felt was happening to them.</span>

                    <span>I devoured this book over a couple of days.  It was a great read about another man's love for riding Harley's.  It was easy to see myself in some of LaPlante's expressions of "Hog Fever".  If you live where it is too cold to ride,this is a great temporary substitute.  If you lay awake at night planning your next chrome purchase, you will "get" this book.</span>

                    <span>As a recent convert to the world of Harley Davidson I could really relate to Richards experience.  I'm a life long biker but new to Harleys.  His book captures the Harley "bug" so well and makes for a terrific read for fellow addicts and the uninitiated alike.  I was hooked from page one and followed the onset of Hog fever from Richard's first exposure to the legendary Fred Warr right through to his nirvana, the ultimate HOG.  The book had even more "feel" for me as I know many of the characters mentioned.  Real people in a real HD world all with various degrees of Hog Fever watching bemused as a newcomer starts to show the first systoms.  <p>If you have ever turned your head as a Harley Davidson motorcycle cruised by on the street then you need to read this book.  But beware you too could catch Hog Fever, I hope you do, it could be one of the best things ever to happen to you.  Remember though, there is no cure, thank the Lord<p>Scottie</span>

                    <span>A disease either goes away or kills the subject. An addiction is limitless, like La Plante's interest in Harleys.<p>This is not a book about motorcyles, or even about Harley-Davidson motorcycles. It's about an image, one created by magazines like Easy Riders and In the Wind. La Plante carefully studied that image for years before actually getting a motorcycle. He measures the riders and mechanics he meets by how well they match that image. <p>By chance, La Plante got his first Harley just before they became popular in the UK, so he looked like a pioneer instead of a follower. He bought it on his wife's credit without her knowledge and rode without a license for years.<p>Despite spending hours polishing his machine, La Plante nevers bothers to learn how to fix it. Given the number of time it breaks down, this might have been a good idea.<p>I read this book after Melissa Holbrook Pierson's "The Perfect Vehicle," and this book suffers by comparison. Pierson's book is about discovery, about learning new things about herself and the world, through motorcycling. La Plante's book is about stepping into a pre-existing role, and acquiring all of the accessories to go with it. <p>I freely admit that Harleys are magnificent-looking machines. I'm also probably one of those people who just don't get it. <p>La Plante's prose is a smooth, quick read. However, the book never goes very deep into motorcycling or La Plante's own mind.</span>
