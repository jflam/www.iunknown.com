                    <span>The bottom line is, this book you will cut your study time down to just a few hours a week. Calculus is tough no matter how smart you are, and nothing that deals with calculus walks in baby steps. The reality is that the solutions in this book will make life a little easier for calc students.
<br /> 
<br /> This book covers both Calculus I and Calculus II from its respective text book. Some explanations are great, others are lacking. I found this book to be particularly useful for problems which require some "trick" that you would otherwise never know about. I used this book for both Calc I and II, and it helped me with every problem I faced. By my estimation, if you buy this book and it saves you a few headaches, it was probably worth it. </span>

                    <span>Good enough explanations but not worth to buy. You would get more by asking classmates and proffesors. Just stay tuned in class.</span>

                    <span>This is a lousy solutions manual.  It frequently skips steps and gives you no indication that it did - you're left saying "Where the heck (or something more colorful) did that come from?"  After lots of beating your brains out, you might be able to figure it out if you're good at this or if you have a great teacher.  If not, don't expect this manual to be a good learning tool - it isn't.  You can use it to check the answers on homework, but that's almost all.  And since the answers are in the back of the book, why bother?  And the Teacher's Manual isn't any better, just more of it.  Of course, the book's no prize, either.  You might want to sign up for a math section that uses a different book! <br>If you know you're going to need help, save the $40 for this book and pay a tutor instead.</span>

                    <span>This text is a good companion to the textbook. Starting with the early chapters, it explains every problem in great detail. Many of the problems are often accompanied by word explanations, which make things easier to understand.  This textbook was my first calculus book and this companion helped me to understand calculus much better.  There were two things I didn't like about this book. 1) It contains the answers only to the odd problems. 2) When you get to the later chapters in the book, it often skips algabraic steps leaving you with wonder as to how a certain step was reached.  Even though it has these two flaws, it will generally help you out a lot if you are new to calculus</span>
