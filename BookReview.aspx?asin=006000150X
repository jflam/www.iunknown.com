                <span id="Label1">Doreen Cronin (<I>Click, Clack Moo: Cows That Type</I>) and cartoonist Harry Bliss (illustrator of <I>A Fine, Fine School</I>) shed a whole new light on a creature that spends most of its time underground: the earthworm. Written in diary form, this truly hilarious picture book tracks the ins and outs of a worm's life from the perspective of the worm family's young son. Take June 15's entry: "My older sister thinks she's so pretty. I told her that no matter how much time she spends looking in the mirror, her face will always look just like her rear end. Spider thought that was really funny. Mom did not." Except for the fact that he can't chew gum or have a dog, the boy likes being a worm. He never has to go to the dentist ("No cavities--no teeth, either"), he never gets in trouble for tracking mud through the house, and he never has to take a bath. As long as he can remember Mom's rule "Never bother Daddy when he's eating the newspaper," all is well. Bliss's endearing cartoonish illustrations of anthropomorphized worms are clever visual punchlines for Cronin's delightfully deadpan humor. For example, "June 5: Today we made macaroni necklaces in art class" sounds normal enough until you see the worms wearing one piece of macaroni around their necks, taking up a good part of each worm's body. Children and adults alike will adore this worm's eye perspective on the world. (Ages 6 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>My 3 1/2 year old son loves this book, and so do his parents! I bet my son will think twice next time he wants to step on a worm. I really recommend this book because it's really funny; some of the things I have to explain to my son, in a humorous way of course, but that's part of our bonding while book-reading. It's a great book.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for both boys & girls. In a whimsical manner the reader/listeners are taken through a worm's world showing all from the trivial to the most important aspects of their lives. With his little red baseball cap, our subject says good morning to a line of ants one at a time taking him all day. He points out the dangers he faces and explains his most important jobs. What an excelent way to learn about such an unusual creature in our world. Good for story times for 5 & 6 year olds as well.</span>

                    <span>The author and illustrator are both terrific in imagination and talent. My only criticism is in the one part that plays on children's minds in a negative way. We are told that there are "three reasons" that it is good to be a worm - 1- you don't have to worry about tracking in mud (Fine - that's fun!); 2 - you don't have to take a bath (but kids love baths, until we start to instill this cultural idea that one should resist taking a bath ); and 3 - you don't have to go to the dentist (this is really annoying. Children are so afraid of dentists as it is, why make it worse) Surely there could be 2 other items for this scenerio besides dentists and baths. Just my opinion and, yes, it may be a cultural norm for kids views, but why botch an otherwise fun book. Not for me.</span>

                    <span>My daughter and I borrowed this book from the library yesterday and I have to say it's the first book in a long, long time that has sent the both of us into giggling fits. It reminded me of Gary Larson's The Far Side, but for kids. Also some of the humour is pretty subtle for a new 4 year old, but knee-slappingly funny when you get it. The illustrations are a perfect fit for the story in terms of style and content. Don't forget to check out the inside covers of the book - the snapshots and captions are just as hysterical as the rest of the book.<P>We both highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>My grandson is a beginning reader. He loved Diary of a Worm. He read it with some difficulty at first and then reread it about 5 times,with much laughter each time. After the 2nd time he could read it easily. This is the kind of book which makes a child want to read.</span>
