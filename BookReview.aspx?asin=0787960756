                <span id="Label1">Once again using an astutely written fictional tale to unambiguously but painlessly deliver some hard truths about critical business procedures, Patrick Lencioni targets group behavior in the final entry of his trilogy of corporate fables. And like those preceding it, <I>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</I> is an entertaining, quick read filled with useful information that will prove easy to digest and implement. This time, Lencioni weaves his lessons around the story of a troubled Silicon Valley firm and its unexpected choice for a new CEO: an old-school manager who had retired from a traditional manufacturing company two years earlier at age 55. Showing exactly how existing personnel failed to function as a unit, and precisely how the new boss worked to reestablish that essential conduct, the book's first part colorfully illustrates the ways that teamwork can elude even the most dedicated individuals--and be restored by an insightful leader. A second part offers details on Lencioni's "five dysfunctions" (absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results), along with a questionnaire for readers to use in evaluating their own teams and specifics to help them understand and overcome these common shortcomings. Like the author's previous books, <I>The Five Temptations of a CEO</I> and <I>Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive</I>, this is highly recommended. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

<br />
<br />False harmony (fear of Conflict) is one of the five dysfunctions.  It's amazing how the dysfunctions of a team were condensed into five categories that are all inclusive.
<br />
<br />The style of the book makes you forget that it is a "fable".  You feel like you are personally witnessing all of the action.</span>

                    <span>The author tackles at least 5 dysfunctions which can lead to team stumbling blocks within a bureaucratic organization of any
<br />significant size or complexity. These classic stumbling blocks are:
<br />
<br />- Lack of trust
<br />- Fear of commitment
<br />- Organizational conflict
<br />- Accountability
<br />- Inattention to results
<br />
<br />Trust is difficult to develop unless team members have substantial goal congruency. By fear of commitment, the author
<br />refers to "analysis paralysis" and the fear of failure which
<br />everyone has in one form or another. Some team leaders do not like to deal with conflict of any kind. Conflict can have benefits in refining the methodology employed in the project or
<br />dealing with disagreements which can delay or derail a project.
<br />Accountability is a difficult notion to instill because it inevitably involves assigning some credit or blame to specific
<br />persons. Without accountability, there would be no methodical
<br />or fair way to map outcomes to personal responsibility centers
<br />in an organization. Lastly, the inattention to results is a critical failing point because there can be no improvement without measuring performance against realistic goals .
<br />Overall, this work provides realistic measuring rods for moving
<br />teams of people toward a successful conclusion of any project.
<br />Unless a project manager deals with these classic dysfunctions,
<br />it will be nearly impossible to move any project to finality.</span>

                    <span>This book is making the rounds at the Silicon Valley company where I work. Last week I was asked to read it by one of our technical leaders. I have a couple of major issues with this book. First, as the title says, it's a "fable" -- the people are fictitious, and none of the situations in the book really happened. The author can make up anything he wants to. Second, the author states that the foundation of teamwork is trust. "Trust" is defined as being comfortable enough with your fellow team members to be vulnerable with them. The fictitious characters in the book begin to establish trust at an offsite when they reveal events from their childhoods. I guess this could work if we lived in a perfect world where people don't come from dysfunctional families and everyone you work with is trustworthy. That's just not reality. I'm giving this a 2-star rating because it's an entertaining read -- as fiction.</span>

                    <span>One of the important take-aways from this book is that for a team to be successful, all persons on the team must be loyal to the team.  This is a concept from successful sports teams that us in the business world could learn from.  I enjoyed this mentality and feel that if more businesses were loyal to their work-teams we would have successful cross-team communications instead of the push and pull that often exists.  I would have liked to have seen more of a story-line with the marketing versus analytical teams, but nonetheless this is a good fable for any manager or team leader.

                    <span>I bought this book in an effort to learn more about my least favorite NBA franchise--the Los Angeles Lakers.  Unfortunately, the five dysfunctions of the title are not the starting five for the NBA runner-ups.  Instead, it's some kind of business leadership book and pretty good, actually.  I replaced the cover with a picture of a smiling Kobe Bryant and placed it prominently on my bookshelf next to my favorite James Carlos Blake novel.  Another fine mistake.    </span>
