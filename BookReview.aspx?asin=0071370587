                    <span>The author does a great job at providing the information necessary for Teleocommunications Management. I'm a manager with SBC a large telco in St. Louis. The only item I see missing from this book as with other books is the importanace of the ability to manage management.  As a telecom manager, I'm not very good at managing people or admitedly have much knowledge of telecom, but I'm great at managing my management which has allowed me to progress.  This book needs to not only reflect the managerial concepts of technology, but of salesmanship and the real world scenerios I run into every day.  I do however feel this is a great reference for general telecommunications information and would recommend people read it.</span>

                    <span>Good book but I would recommend Telecommunications Management by Nolan Vincent Jones instead. It provides more insights as to the issues currently going on in the industry and has detailed information regarding how to effectively compete.  </span>

                    <span>I think the book covers a complete discussion of every telecommunication facility development topic. The book starts from basic issues, such as selecting equipments and using them, to the cost analysis of develop the system. This makes the book comfortable for telco manager who never did business telecommunication system development before. I think this book is perfect for every telco manager. This book is, I think, also suitable for engineers and technicians to open and broaden the cost analysis of systems developed. I think the author is an expert in enterprise telecommunication system design and knows what he is doing.<p><br>As a courtesy, I attach the correct table of content...<p><br>Part 1: Principles of Telecommunications Management and Planning<p><br>Introduction to Telecommunications Management, The Telecommunications Act of 1996, Telecommunications Strategic Planning, Current and Long-Range Planning, Feasibility Analysis, Forecasting Telecommunications Services<p><br>Part 2: Selecting Telecommunications Services and Equipment<p><br>Developing Requirements and Specifications, Writing Requests for Proposals, Evaluating Responses to Requests for Proposals, Managing Long-Distance Services, Selecting Local Exchange Services, Managing Internet Services, Wiring Plans and Equipment Rooms<p><br>Part 3: Managing Telecommunications Facilities<p><br>Managing PBX and Key Telephone Equipment, Managing Automatic Call Distributors, Managing Voice Processing Equipment, Managing Local Area Networks and Internets, Managing Wide Area Networks, Managing Video and Audio Conferencing Equipment, Managing Convergence<p><br>Part 4: Telecommunications Cost Control<p><br>Controlling Telecommunications Costs, Benchmarking Telecommunications Results, Contracting and Outsourcing, Sizing and Optimizing Voice Circuits, Optimizing Data Network Bandwidth<p><br>Part 5: Operations Planning and Execution<p><br>Developing a Telecommunications Operations Plan, Disaster Prevention and Recovery, Cutover Planning and Management, Telecommunications Project Management, Resale of Telecommunications Services, Controlling Telecommunications Quality, Managing Telecommunications Security, Preventing Toll Fraud, Network Maintenance and Testing, Network Management Systems<p><br>Appendixes</span>
