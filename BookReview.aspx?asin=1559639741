                <span id="Label1"><p>"As the human population has increased, the marine population has plummeted, and Ellis tells the complex story behind this equation for disaster with a vast array of facts, unfailing eloquence, and bracing frankness."   -BOOKLIST</p>  <p>"Read this book and be inspired, informed, and entertained, but watch out. The latest, most powerful tribute to the sea by Richard Ellis could forever change the way you think about the ocean, about yourself, and about the future we share with the sea." -SYLVIA EARLE, EXPLORER IN RESIDENCE, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY</p>  <p>In The Empty Ocean, acclaimed author and artist Richard Ellis tells the story of our continued plunder of life in the sea and weighs the chances for its recovery. Through fascinating portraits of a wide array of creatures, he introduces us to the many forms of sea life that humans have fished, hunted, and collected over the centuries, from charismatic whales and dolphins to the lowly menhaden, from sea turtles to cod, tuna, and coral.<p>Rich in history, anecdote, and surprising fact, Richard Ellis&#198;s descriptions bring to life the natural history of the various species, the threats they face, and the losses they have suffered. Killing has occurred on a truly stunning scale, with extinction all too often the result, leaving a once-teeming ocean greatly depleted. But the author also finds instances of hope and resilience, of species that have begun to make remarkable comebacks when given the opportunity.<p>Written with passion and grace, and illustrated with Richard Ellis&#198;s own drawings, <I>The Empty Ocean</I> brings to a wide audience a compelling view of the damage we have caused to life in the sea and what we can do about it.

                    <span>In his latest book, marine artist and writer Ellis (Aquagenesis) expresses his deeply felt appreciation for the uniqueness of all forms of marine life and his sorrow at their dwindling numbers or extinction through elegant prose and finely detailed line drawings. He clearly explains the economic, political, historical, and biological reasons for declining fisheries, the plight of sea turtles, disappearance of marine birds, slaughter of marine mammals, and destruction of coral reefs. He notes how through carelessness and ignorance non-native species have been introduced into new habitats where they attack indigenous species or destroy their food supply. However, "the most harmful invader is humankind," writes Ellis. Humans have also discharged "our poisonous or radioactive effluents into the water, contaminating everything from lakes and streams to bodies the size of the Caspian Sea." This volume belongs in all public and academic libraries because of the importance and urgency of its message.</span>

                    <span>Richard Ellis has presented in "The Empty Ocean" a bleak tale of the overexploitation of a common resource- fish and other sealife. Unfortunately Ellis has not exaggerated the problem, which will eventually cause all of us difficulties. From the collapse of the North Atlantic fisheries to coral bleaching to the destruction of turtle populations, man has caused havoc in a supposedly inexhaustible habitat.<P>How did this happen? Ellis points out that the reason that fisheries are collapsing worldwide is because of the super efficiency of modern fishing techniques. In essence they can catch everything, or nearly everything, in the area fished. Radar, huge nets, long many-hook lines and huge fleets of ships are used to feed the ever-increasing demand for seafood, sushi, aquarium fish, coral and rare shells. Since the resource is often less than the demand, especially for high-ticket items like tuna, the profit is high and the "commons" are overexploited for current gain. Not only this, but the number of non-target organisms that die in the process is truly staggering.<P>What can we do to slow down the destruction? We can try to back sound science-based fishing regulations and at least lower our demand for products from the sea, especially for those known to be overexploited. The tragedy is that, despite our efforts, the oceans of the world will probably never be quite the same again. However, if humans do not limit themselves they will soon (as Ellis notes on the last page) know for whom the bell tolls.<P>Read this book- it may make you think twice about current consumptive practices, especially if you value your children's future.</span>
