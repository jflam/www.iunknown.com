                    <span>This is the best book on color I have found. It is a must have for anyone who has ever been confused about matching colors and creating the right mood. Though I was already fairly confident working with color, this book helped me a great deal by letting me see a wide variety of color combinations together. It has been an invaluable reference tool in helping me decorate my home.<P>The book begins by discussing the color wheel. This includes the facets of color such as hot, cold, light, dark, pale, bright, warm and cool as well as a great explanation of all the different color schemes. It is divided into over 20 different themes including romantic, friendly, earthy, fresh, calm, traditional, professional, magical, classic, tropical and energetic. For each of these themes a set of color schemes including monochromatic, primary, complementary, split-complementary, analogous, spilt, clash and neutral is shown. Tear out swatches, clearly labeled with theme and color scheme on the back, duplicate what is shown in the book. A brief tips section for using the themes in graphic design, interiors and fine art is also given. <P>In the back of the book is a process color conversion chart that gives the CMYK values for each of the 106 colors used. Swatches are included for this as well. This is very useful for graphic designers. <P>This book and Color Harmony 2 are pretty much identical in content. However, this one is bigger and contains swatches, while the other contains a great CD with a pallet picker. The one with the CD may be more helpful to web designers and such, but this version is probably better for interior designers and artists using traditional media. If I had to select only one color book, this one or Color Harmony 2 would be my first choice.</span>

                    <span>You will not regret buying this book! The color theory information is brief, to the point, and helpful. And then there are the swatches. Hundreds of tear out swatches of color combinations. I play with them over and over while choosing colors for designing. CMYK values are provided for all colors, making it easy to use them for digital work.</span>
