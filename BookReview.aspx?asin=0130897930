                    <span>This book is a great for beginner and intermediate Web programmers. Some advanced programmers might even get something out of it. In depth examples allow you to learn by reading and implementing code. The content packs several languages into one book. You can learn HTML, DHTML, XML, CGI, Java, JSP, and JavaScript all in one place, without having to buy one book for each. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning Web Programming or learning more about Web Programming.</span>

                    <span>Marty Hall's book is an excellent resource for computer science folks who are interested in developing software on the World Wide Web. If your an experienced programmer, but haven't had the time to figure out how your Web Browser works, this is the book for you! Core Web Programming contains an overview of everything you need to know to launch into the wonderful world of Web Pages, Java applications and applets, CGI programming, and Java Script. This is a "must have" for every computer scientist's bookshelf!</span>

                    <span>Agreed that Marty Hall knows how to write and produces great books. Knowing this, I can heartily recommend his more recent "More Servlets and JSPs" as it provides more relevant up to date information. For the Java side of things, this offers the most bang for your buck.<P>When this book first came out, it was attempting to cover the gamut of web development technology, and tried to go from CGI up through JSPs and the coverage was ultimately spotty. For a more focused approach to servlets and JSPs, read Hall's later books. For a better historical perspective on the evolution of web programming, look at "Web Application Architecture - Principles, Protocols and Practices" by Leon Shklar and Richard Rosen.</span>

                    <span>I would be the first person to say that Marty Hall is a gifted writer. His books on Servlets and JSP are my favorite computer books, but this book is far from great. The style is cold, the material delivered too fast with too little explanations and all in all, the attempt to cover everything in one fell swoop fails. I was using the book in a class that tried to cover the material the book does, and as a learning resource it is way too shallow for thorough knowledge, more as an 'In a Nutshell' style instead. <BR>If you want a good Javascript book, get 'Practical JavaScript for the Usable Web'; if you want a good Java book, well, look someplace else. <BR>Spare yourself a book you will not enjoy reading (and get Marty Hall's 'Core Servlets' instead!).</span>

                    <span>This was used in an MBA-level course on "Development of Web-Based Applications." The course centered on the management of application development, and the actual web-development component of the course was pretty light. However, I've used this book as a resource before and if you use Java this is a must-have.</span>
