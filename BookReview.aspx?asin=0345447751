                    <span>This is a good book, insightful and well written by Mr.Bastfield, it was clearly written as a labor of love and a need to document an intense kinship, that ended before it had a chance to mature in the later years of life.  Since Tupac Shakurs untimely death there have been many people trying to capitalize on his memory, however this author and book do not fall into that category. For those who are interested in the somewhat awkward but always smooth teenager, who would one day become Rap musics greatest legend, this is a heartfelt account of the building of the man behind the myth, the carefree but yet fiercely determined ghetto kid, who had the right stuff to overcome the enormous odds stacked against him. Few have the courage to dream big and then pursue those dreams at all cost, this is a story  and observations of a young man who did just that. The book falls short in some areas but overall is well worth reading, and a job well done by Mr.Bastfield. </span>

                    <span>I liked this book quite a bit. <p>Mainly because it offered a different perspective than most other books about Tupac.<p>This book was written by a teenage friend who experieced the same things Tupac himself experienced. They 'shared the struggle' of trying to better themselves in a very harsh environment. <p>This book shows the almost relentless passion Tupac had to try and influence the world around him in a positive way. And the internal struggle he had with some of his actions. He knew of the contradiction and was trying to evolve. Too bad he was cut short in his quest. <p>One of the most telling insights to the basis of Tupac's personality is the answer to the question one of his earlist teachers asked. "What do you want to be when you grow up?"<p>For those who haven't ever looked too deeply into Tupac's more intellectual and compassionate side, there is a surprise in store, Tupac's heart. For those of us that knew he was much more than a thug, you'll see more and more of his depth.<p>An easy read that kept me flippin pages..</span>

                    <span>Back In The Day is author Darren Keith Bastfield's informative and intrinsically fascinating memoir of the time he spent with controversial rap musician Tupac Shakur, before Shakur was murdered at the age of twenty-five. Recalling seven years of friendship; touching upon Shakur's incredible demonstration of talent; a wild senior prom; Shakur's surprising love of Shakespeare; the Baltimore neighborhood in which he grew up, and so much more, Back In The Day is a straightforward yet emotional remembrance of a young black man destined to make his mark before meeting a tragic and untimely end.</span>

                    <span>THIS IS IN NO WAY A BIOGRAPHY OF THE LATE GREAT 2PAC. THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY DARRIN KEITH BASTFIELD, A GUY THAT WENT TO SCHOOL WITH PAC DURING THE YEARS THAT PAC WAS LIVING IN BALTIMORE. THE BOOK REALLY EXPLORES THE FRIENDSHIP THAT DARRIN HAD WITH PAC BEFORE HE SKYROCKETED TO FAME. THE BOOK IS PRETTY GOOD. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT YOU GET TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW 2PAC HAD GOT INTO ACTING. THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH READING. JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE.</span>

                    <span>Although I Havent read alot of books this is definetly the best book i have ever read. I enjoy how the author talks about his times growing up with him because there is a lot of stuff I have never heard about. I definetly recommend you read this book if you are a big Pac fan or if your just interested in reading about someone who has changed lives everywhere.</span>
