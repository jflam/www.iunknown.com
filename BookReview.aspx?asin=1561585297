                    <span>This book is very comprehensive. I noticed one reviewer said that the book was good for a beginner but lacked information. I disagree. I feel as though the book has plenty of information, except for the use of furring strips when studs or joist do not line up.
<br />
<br /> All that is done is the furring strip is stapled to the joist which is higher than the other joist, or if only one is lower than the other joist (this refers to joist/beams in the ceiling which are similier to studs in a wall, so if your working on a wall and need to apply this information just pretend that the wall your facing is a ceiling above your head).
<br />
<br />For me the book covers more than enough information and I have been drywalling in residential construction. I got this book to help me learn quicker so my first attempts would be high quality. However, this book works great even for one who knows nothing about drywalling.
<br />
<br />The last think I have to say about this book is that it does NOT cover insulation. It is only about drywalling and texturing.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for some time now and have been doing various drywall projects around the house, including crack repair, patches and even replacing a full panel. I found that by following the instructions in this book, and by taking great care to work neatly, all of my repairs are invisible. There is no way I could have done it so well without the help of Mr. Ferguson's book.<p>I have a handful of drywall books but this one comes out tops and therefore I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This book is OK for a beginner. In his book, the author advises using a setting-type joint compound. In addition, he does not use a banjo for setting his tape. ALMOST everyone else in the world uses a banjo or other mechanical device with all-purpose joint compound for embedding the first layer of tape. It works fine and is far, far less time consuming.<br>This book is not as complete as others that are out there. There is a good deal about drywall installation and finishing that are not included.</span>

                    <span>Go ahead, take a tour of my house.  You will be able to tell which walls I did before I bought this book and which ones were done professionally after I bought it.  No question, if you are a mud-smearing homeowner like me and can't stand to pay someone to do it right, this book will help.  You still have to pay attention and do it just like he says. I'm very satisfied and can't stand it when people borrow my copy so they can see how to do drywall like me.</span>
