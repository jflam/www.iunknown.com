                    <span>I was one of the technical reviewers for the Vth edition of this book. This book is meant not only for novice programmers and college students, but also for experienced programmers. It covers all core aspects of Java and introduces the reader to OO-style programming from a Java perspective in an incremental fashion consistently throughout the text. Each example is fully explained with output demonstrations, line-by-line source and API explanation. The book also covers good Java development and design practices e.g. SW Engineering Tips, Performance Tips, Design Patterns.<P>The Vth Edition of this book covers JDK 1.4 release from Sun. It follows the same consistent approach from IVth edition to explain new features newly introduced in JDK 1.4 including Preferences API, non-blocking I/O. This book will be a great learning tool for both people just getting into Java OR for those transtitioning over to the latest version of Java from earlier versions of Sun JDK.</span>

                    <span>This book is simply amazing. I had an incredibly difficult time with the "other" book I used to attempt to learn Java for class. This book absolutely walks all over it. It teaches in a style that I easily grasp. The authors went to great lengths to specify the "why" of each new line of code, and give very detailed explanations of the methodology of programming, along with "good practices" for programming. I recommend this to ANYONE with a desire to learn their first programming language, as well as those who are looking to learn more.</span>

                    <span>You will be able to write Java prgrams, but you will not UNDERSTAND and KNOW object oriented programming language Java. Avoid Deitel's books. They simply do not know Java.</span>

                    <span>I learned Java solely from this book. I had learned several languages prior to turning to Java. With the help of this book, I was able to become quite proficient very quickly. It has also served as my only needed reference ever since. The intended audience seems to be the novice or even completely new programmer, so the more experienced folks may need to do a little skimming. In any case, I have and will continue to highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Most people who purchase Deitel books do so because it is the required course material for their CS (pick a number) class. Deitel book are needlessly saturated with filler material that do not justify their extremely high cost. You could easily save your money and learn Java by going through the Sun tutorials which are FREE, not to mention the countless online Java tutorials out there (just do a Google search "Java Tutorials"). Stay away from this book! If you have to buy it, then please save some money by purchasing a used book.</span>
