                    <span>Very simple, very repetitive (This is Biscuit. Biscuit is small. Biscuit is yellow. Every page includes the word Biscuit, so you either memorize the spelling or the meaning, or both). Perfect for kids in either age range. The only problem with the repetitiveness is that, well, it is repetitive. And without a rhyme or rhythm to hold you through, you might get bored reading it. So I wouldn't advise buying it unless you know you can sit through reading it again and again (or think your kid won't want to read it again and again, though that defeats the purpose of book buying)</span>

                    <span>The world contains a variety of easy reader books.  Of these, most are pure drivel, some are fine but not terribly imaginative, and a very scant few, but the few that count, are remarkably witty for their simple constructions.  "Biscuit" falls into the middle category.  It's not going to knock your socks off or even surprise you any.  But it contains what may well be one of the most adorable puppies ever to grace an "I Can Read Book".  Reviewing "Biscuit" is difficult, if only because it's hardly any more sophisticated than those mind-numbingly dull "Spot" books by Eric Hill.  So the verdict is, as I see it, that if you've found that your child adores reading "Biscuit" books (and there is quite a series of them out there) you could undoubtedly suffer a worse fate in life.  It's a rather sweet story.
<br />	
<br />Meet Biscuit.  A puppy with pretensions of wide-awakefullness.  As a little girl attempts to cajole her pup into bed, Biscuit (by mere woofing alone) comes up with a long list of demands.  A snack, a drink, a story, and several other requests later, Biscuit is alone in bed but isn't sleepy in the least.  So he high-tails it up to bed to tug on his mistress's bed sheets.  Then, just as she peeks over, he snuggles down for a good night's rest.
<br />	
<br />Like so many other books, this story takes an animal and places it in a situation that children will be familiar with the world over.  Now, illustrator Pat Schories's pictures are very cute, yes.  And author Alyssa Satin Capucilli's words are simple and easy for children to understand.  But allow me to point out that the lesson taught in this tale was done in a far more amusing and (dare I say) adorable manner with Shelley Moore Thomas's easy reader book, "Good Night, Good Knight".  Not that the two books are mutually exclusive.  If your child has already fallen in love with Biscuit's antics (I'm just counting the days until there's a PBS tv show about him) then this is a cute tale to reread again.  But if you're casually searching for good beginning reader tales and you'd like a story similar but better than this one, go get yourself a little "Good Night, Good Knight" for your troubles.  This is a nice story.  Just not a great one.

                    <span>My son is almost 21 months old, and he is positively addicted to Biscuit!  As many reviews attest, the Biscuit books would be wonderful for beginning readers, but they are also great for toddlers just learning how to string sentences together. My son now asks us to "curl up" with him, tell us that "Biscuit wants a big hug" and has even named his favorite stuffed puppy "Biscuit."  We read this book (and the two others we have) nearly every night;  they're short, they're simple, and they're adorable.  Definitely a good investment. </span>

                    <span>This book is about a little puppy that needs to go to bed, but little Biscuit doesn't want to. He keeps wanting to play, eat, hear a story, then he goes to the little girls room to curl up with her. He finaly falls asleep when he lays on the girls blanket on the floor. I thought this book was so cute. The pictures were really good. This book teaches the children how some pets need this much attention and how they don't always do as they are supposed to.</span>
