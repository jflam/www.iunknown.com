                <span id="Label1"><div>Beginning in the eighteenth century with the building of St. Petersburg and culminating with the Soviet regime, Figes examines how writers, artists, and musicians grappled with the idea of Russia itself--its character, spiritual essence, and destiny. Skillfully interweaving the great works--by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall--with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, Figes reveals the spirit of "Russianness" as rich and uplifting, complex and contradictory--and more lasting than any Russian ruler or state.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read on Russia. In 500 beautifully written pages, it manages to say an awful lot - not just about the Russian arts and literature, nor simply about Russia as a place, its history, its customs, its religious traditions - but about that thing we call "culture". Figes shows how the arts were intertwined with politics, religion, folklore and beliefs, to create a "national consciousness". His main argument - that Russian culture was defined by a dialogue between the high culture of the aristocracy and the folk culture of the peasantry - is brilliantly developed - and original. <P>No doubt there are minor points where academic critics may pronounce that there is more to say - or something to be said in a more complex way. This is not an academic book (thank God for that!) though Figes does provide a comprehensive guide to academic works on what seems like almost everything...<P>But for the general reader this book is unparalleled. It is more exciting, and a better read, than The Icon and the Axe by James Billington, which is a more traditional cultural history of Russia.<P>In sum - the highest recommendation.</span>

                    <span>I disagree with the reviewer who finds this not quite "heavyweight" enough. It is not an academic book - and thank God for that - but a superb introduction to the history and the culture of Russia.<P>Figes starts with a wonderful account of the building of St Petersburg in the 1700s, and goes on to discuss the meaning of Europe to Russian culture in the eighteenth century. Europe caused a split in the Russian national identity - and much of Russian culture in the nineteenth century was concerned with how to reconcile the two almost contradictory halves of the Russian character: the native Russian (or Muscovite) and the European (or Petrine). <P>The next chapter takes up the story of 1812, when Russia's writers and artist first began to think about the ways of developing a distinctively "Russian style" in contrast to the West. This is when the Slavophiles were born. There are lots of fascinating details here - on the Russian customs of child-rearing, on interior design and Russian fashions. <P>The next three chapters explore various facets of Russian culture in the nineteenth century: the Moscow tradition; the romantic fascination with the Russian peasants (which Figes explores as a search for nationhood); and the influence of the Orthodox tradition on Russian literature and art. <P>Then there is a speculative chapetr on the cultural influence of the Asiatic steppe/ For me, this was the most original and the most interesting chapter in the book (Rachel Polonsky, in her hatchet-job review in the TLS doesn;t even mention it). In this chapter Figes digs down deep into peasant culture and folklore, showing how the shamanic beliefs of the steppeland nomads (the "Decsendants of Genghiz Khan") left their trace on the Russians/<P>Finally there are two long chapterson the twentieth century when Russian culture was divided into two: the first on Soviet culture and the last on the emigration to the West. I didn't quite agree with Figes's argument - that in the end Soviet culture was peripheral and failed to change the underlying Russian cultural traditions (represented by Akhmatova). But I was moved by the tremendous emotional impact of these final chapters, which (more than anything I've ever read before) assert triumphantly the endurance of the Russian people and their culture over politics. <P>I am not surprised that Figes has his critics. He writes too well, too flamboyantly;he tackles bigger themes than most academics dare. But for the general reader Natasha's Dance is a rich delight. On every page there is something new and fascinating. There are sumptuous illustrations. And for those who want to read more "heavyweight" volumes there is a comprehensive guide to further reading at the end. <P>In sum- this is a wonderful, enriching book, for anybody with a psssing interest in Russia, its history and culture.</span>

                    <span>I didnt feel comfortable with author's personality present in every sentence - I found a lot of times he finds examples to support his point of view and ommits the dociments that prove him wrong. I tried to read this book keeping it in mind and make my own judgements ( cause the book is full of them - some right, some wrong) But the last two chapters on USSR and Russians abroad were brilliant.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. Though it is arranged thematically rather than chronologically, timelines are not confusing. The great debates of Russian culture - between east and west, between serfs and aristocracy, between Orthodoxy and the Old Belief - are presented vividly and clearly. The countryside and cities come alive with characters, not just of the great figures of Russian literature and art but of the nameless millions and their beliefs, culture, attitudes and preoccupations. Natasha's Dance made me want to learn much more about Russia, its people, its history, its literature and art. And that, to me, is the measure of success of a cultural history such as this.</span>

                    <span>"Natasha's Dance" was a detailed, creative, vivid account of Russia's rich history. Beginning with Tsar Peter the Great, Orlando Figes illustrates how the Tsar established the first European style city in Russia. Along with the normal text of the Tsars and Tsarinas, military giants, intelligentsia, literary greats, artists, etc, Figes incorporates such hidden topics as the elites only speaking French not being able to even understand Russian, the many balls and operas given in private palace size estates, the connection between elite's children who were unfamiliar with their own parents clung to their nannies even as adults. If you are only interested in Soviet Russia (USSR), this is not for you. However, this is a must read for anyone interested in general Russian history.</span>
