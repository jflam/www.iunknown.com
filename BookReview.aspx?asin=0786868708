                    <span>If you liked Robyn Davidson's book, Tracks, you will like this book. In my opinion this is a great adventure book, a great feminists book and a great travel book. It is about one woman's two-wheeled trip from New Jersey to California to Alaska and return on a motorcycle. One her journey she met fellow travelers (including bicyclists like me,) local folks and her birth family. Larsen is an excellent writer and her trip, like all good journeys, led her to a lot of self-revelations. If you can't make the journey yourself you should at least read the book. It is a great trip!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Early on in reading this book I might have agreed with a couple other reviewers who thought it a little stuffy (some embellishments of scenes were a little over the top) or for whom constant references to "Lucy" (the motorcycle) got a little tedious, but those things are small compared to how well this author does everything else.  I've done this all my adult life - set off to parts unknown on motorcycles - and Ms. Larsen gets so much of it just right.  From the magnificence of the things you see, to the loneliness of being a thousand miles from anyone you know, to the magnificence of the loneliness and the unfettered ability to search your own soul, to the "grit-your-teeth-and-drive-no-matter-how-miserable-you-are" doggedness that you have to endure just to move forward some days.  I like to describe long distance motorcycling as the greatest way I know to be miserable.  In this book I felt all the emotional ups and downs that go along with it.  I envy her ability to capture those extremes very much.  The more I read, the more I looked forward to sitting down with this book again.  I enjoyed it very much and hated to see this ride end.
<br />
<br />P.S.  I would really like to have seen a route map included on one of the inside covers or pages and a small section with pictures.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed the travelog, the descriptions of places, weather concerns, campsites, etc.  The inner turmoil described when the author was contemplating the meetings with her family was exceptional. 
<br />
<br /> I do take offense, though, to the snobby attitude about other bikers she met on the road, especially what she calls the "day bikers".  I am a woman motorcyclist also, and take cross-country as well as cross-town trips on my bike, and I think that anyone I meet who is adventurous enough to ride, whether just for the day or for a month is a pretty cool person.  I thought the "brotherhood" of bikers extended to the whole group, not just to a select few. 
<br />
<br />I was very inspired by the book as a whole, and thoroughly ejoyed reading it.    </span>

                    <span>There is a mode you sometimes get into when a road trip is all but necessary. I haven't done one on two wheels in quite some years, since before she was born, my pickup with a matress in back is much more my style now. But every year or two I get the urge to go somewhere a few thousand miles away. Given three months between jobs, what better way could Karen Larsen have spent the time than to get on a bike and go 15,000 miles.  
<br />
<br />I agree with her completely that you need some time alone just letting the miles go by. At the same time you find yourself talking to people just as though they were there. And when you go find an interesting site, perhaps a National Park, parhaps just a pretty spot on the road you want to share it.  I have never had an unknown father to look up, but stopping off to see friends from the far past is a truly excellent way to spend an evening.  
<br />
<br />Now I'm getting the urge to go somewhere: Death Valley, the coast of Nova Scotia. Hmmmmm!</span>
