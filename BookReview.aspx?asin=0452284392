                <span id="Label1">A cocktail party.  A terrorist cell.  Ancient bacteria.  An international conglomerate. <br><br> All are networks, and all are a part of a surprising scientific revolution. Albert-L&aacuteszl&oacute Barab&aacutesi, the nation's foremost expert in the new science of networks, takes us on an intellectual adventure to prove that social networks, corporations, and living organisms are more similar than previously thought. Grasping a full understanding of network science will someday allow us to design blue-chip businesses, stop the outbreak of deadly diseases, and influence the exchange of ideas and information. Just as James Gleick brought the discovery of chaos theory to the general public, Linked tells the story of the true science of the future.</span>

                    <span>Linked is a very interesting introduction into the emerging science of networks. The book assumes no previous experience in network sciences so it is easily readable by any one interesting in adding to their personal store of knowledge.<P>I particularly enjoyed the author's writing style. He presents antiquated ideas as if they are current fact, then moves on in the next chapter explaining the discoveries that make the previous chapters topic outdated. While definitely not the most efficient way to impart information, it does give the reader a lot of the history behind network sciences.<P>In gene research I see network sciences playing an extremely large part. There are only a handful of genes that have been found to individually cause and illness, or change someone behavior; instead there has been a complex interaction between multiple genes that produce the final outcome: blonde hair, blue eyes, and a happy demeanor aren't stored in three genes, it is left to the interaction of possibly hundreds of them to come to that simple conclusion. As the science of network expands and further rules are discovered, I believe this complex interactions will be simplified to some extent.<P>We can see the result of network sciences, whether known to the individuals involved in the planning or not, in the recent conflict in Iraq. As Linked sets forth, the removal of a significant number of hubs in a network, be it the Internet, economy, or a social structure will render the network inoperable. This is what the US Armed Forces did with the Iraqi regime: they targeted high ranking officials and key cities both of which are hubs in the network of the regime. Once a significant number of these "hubs" had been removed, the regime crumbled.<P>I certainly believe network sciences will change the way not only scientists but all individuals approach their work. Network sciences are applicable in every branch of life where connections between more than one object or person exist. It is only up to those involved in the networks to determine how they wish to apply it to their life.<P>Considering myself decently versed in Buddhist philosophy, I do find it very interesting that this book sets forth as scientific fact that which Buddhists have been saying for millennia: everything is connected to everything else...</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. The author is extremely able to explain difficult concepts about complex systems in a simple and precise manner, using examples from a variety of domains. The richness of applications -- ranging from spread of epidemics to the internet-- is the first strength of the book and of the theory of scale free networks that appear to be a very promising and original tool to understand the web of interactions of complex systems. The second strength is the clarity of writing: a rarity in the scientific world. This book is an example of good writing with the objective of being understood and making science accessible.</span>

This book delivers on that promise with insight, wit and style.</span>

                    <span>Albert Barabasi presents the lay reader with a stimulating description of the origins of network theory and recent applications. He describes random networks, small world and scalefree networks. In nonrandom networks the importance of hubs is emphasized. Small world networks are the ones with a well defined averge number of links, and in scalefree ones the density of links scales as a power law. For the many interesting examples discussed, I would like to have seen graphs showing scaling over at least three decades in order to be convinced of scaling. However, in practice, whether a network scales or not may not be so important. I liked best the discussions of terrorism, AIDS, and biology. If one could locate the hubs, then a small world network could be destroyed, but as the author points out there is no systematic method for locating the hubs. Also, destroyed hubs in a terror network might be replaced rather fast, whereas airline hubs could not be replaced so quickly. The book might be seen as indicating a starting point to try to develop a branch of mathematical sociology. For example, the maintainance of ethnic identity outside the Heimat is discussed in terms of networking. Now for a little criticism.<P>I did not find the discussion of the rich get richer' very helpful because network theory at this stage deals only with static geometry, not with empirically-based dynamics. In fact, the dynamics of financial markets have been described empirically accurately without using any notion of networking. In the text the phrase economic stability" is used but stability is a dynamic idea, and there is no known empirical evidence from the analysis of real markets for any kind of stability. The absence of dynamics on networks means that complexity is not described at all: there is nothing complex about the geometry of a static network! Suggesting that cell biology can be described by networking is empty so long as dynamics are not deduced from empirics. Nonempirical models of dynamics will probably not be of much use for making advances in understanding or treating cancer, e.g. Everything we know about cell biology and cancer was discovered via reductionism, by isolating cause and effect the way that a good auto mechanic does in order to repair a car.<P>Unfortunately, the author lets his enthusiasm get the best of him when he proclaims laws of self-organization" and the need to go beyond reductionism. First, there are no known laws of self-organization". The only known laws of nature are the laws of physics and consequences deduced from the laws, namely, chemistry and cell biology. Worse, every mathematical model that can be written down is a form of reductionism. Quantum theory reduces phenomena to (explains phenomena via) atoms and molecules. All of chemistry is about that. Cell biology attempts to reduce observed phenomena to DNA, proteins, and cells. Believers in self-organized criticality try to reduce the important features of nature to the equivalent of sandpiles. Network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links. In order to try to isolate cause and effect, there is no escape from reductionism of one form or another, holism being an empty illusion. So I did not at all like the assertion on pg. 200 that globalization (via deregulation and privatization) is inevitable, because there is no law that tells us that it is. <P>Summarizng: there is no complexity without dynamics, there are no known laws of self-organization", and reductionism is the only hope for doing science. Anyone who disagrees with this is welcome to explain to me and others the alternative (jmccauley@uh.edu).</span>

                    <span>Written by a leading researcher in the field, Linked offers ordinary people a glimpse into the fascinating and complex world of networks. The book covers everything from social networks, to economic networks, to chemical networks, to the World Wide Web, and exposes some of the underlying principles responsible for network structure.<P>Linked explains the importance and prevalence hubs in networks, it highlights the strengths and vulnerabilities of different types of networks and offers insights into such interesting phenomena as the small world effect (best illustrated by the six degrees to Kevin Bacon game).<P>The book does have its weak spots, and it seems to slow down a bit after about 150 pages. However, the book is divided into very short chapters and is filled with many interesting anecdotes - all this means that even the occasional weak chapter moves along nicely. <P>All in all, a great and easy to read book for fans of popular science, but be aware that the underlying topic is complex and the occasional equation does find its way into the book. I skipped over most of these equations and found that my understanding of the concepts and my enjoyment of the book were not diminished. I highly recommend this book.</span>
