                    <span>The Home Office is a great and unique source of inspiration.  This book has been a wonderful resource for me in organizing and defining my home office.  Donna Paul has written in-depth and high quality chapters on an enormous variety of home offices (totaling 45) located across the United States.  The photographs by Grey Crawford are exceptional.<p>My personal experience with this book has been to be inspired to use what I already have in a creative (and inexpensive) way and to incorporate into my home office personal items and a personal touch that I would not have used in a downtown high rise office.<p>If I could only have one home/decorating book, whether or not specifically for a home office, this would be the one.  It's great!</span>

                    <span>This glossy book depicts some really beautiful and unique home (plus one on a boat) offices. However, it could have been so much better!<p>Missing are floorplans and dimensions of the offices shown in this book. Also  missing are sketches depicting the relation of the office space to the rest  of the home - something useful to those contemplating new construction.  What species of wood comprises those cabinets, and how were they finished?  How was that floor made? The reader must guess at these and dozens and  dozens of other questions the photographs evoke.<p>Instead, the author  chooses to annotate the photos with useless comments such as where a pillow  was made... the owner's collection of inkwells... what artist drew the  prints on the wall... you get the idea. One gets the notion Ms. Paul never  once asked herself what information would be desired by someone buying her  book. She seems more interesed in the interior decoration aspects of home  offices than their design.</span>

                    <span>I'm in the process of building a home office.  I wanted something that had style but not at the expense of productivity.  This book gave me lots of ideas.  The book is full of bold, handsome pictures that cover all kinds of  looks.<p>I checked out a LOT of books for this project, and this was my  favorite!</span>
