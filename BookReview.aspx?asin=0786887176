He offers a "recipe" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn't want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.</span>

                    <span>Seth Godin writes about social observations and then applies them to the world of business. For example, this book is about "viral/word of mouth marketing" whereas his prior book was about permission based marketing and its impact on communications with customers. His recently released book, Survival is not Enough, is about "survival of the fittest" via his Darwinian-like take on business.<P>I read permission marketing some years ago and really enjoyed it as it refreshed my thoughts on customer satisfaction and interaction. Then, this book came out and it really changed my paradigm about the growth aspect of businesses and how "viral marketing" could have a profound impact on an upstart Internet companies growth trajectory. I've read Gladwell's The Tipping Point and I must say, this book is better written and has examples more applicable to business.<P>I found myself reading the book quite quickly as I was consumed by it as it was filled with interesting ideas about how to get people interested in what you have to offer. The principles mentioned in the book could be applied to anything you do in life that you want others to notice but I found the examples on Internet businesses to be fascinating. Counter to traditional marketing wisdom,which tries to count,measure,and manipulate the spread of information, Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer,rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to-customer dialogue the ideavirus and cheerfully egg marketers on to create and environment where their ideas can replicate. <P>If you are an aspiring entrepreneur this book is not a "how-to" book with a step-by-step approach to marketing but, if you read permission marketing and then this book you will have a VERY THOROUGH understanding about how to market on the Internet and grow your business.<P>Other useful books on marketing that I have read or been recommended include Seth Godin's Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus (both great reads), the 22 immutable laws of marketing by Jack Trout and All Reis (excellent authors and a good read), Robert Cialdini's Influence and Ogilvy on Advertising or Wizard of Ads for help in sales copying.</span>

                    <span>Out of respect for Mr. Godin, I will begin my review by stating that I did enjoy his recent work, "Unleashing the Ideasvirus". In a timely fashion, the author favorably addresses the marketing potential for internet-related consumption. His use of product examples was detailed, diverse, and interesting. However, I feel that the textual content was overly lengthy and strewn with unnecessary "buzz words." Mr. Godin's innovative marketing principles would have been more appropriate within a five-page article in "Fast Company", sparing the reader time for snapping Polaroids and checking their Hotmail account. <P>I may have been sneezed upon by a promiscuous and powerful marketing genius through reading this book, but I just don't buy Mr. Godin's logic. He states, "We live in a world where consumers actively resist marketing. So it's imperative to stop marketing at people. The idea is to create an environment where consumers will market to each other. The future belongs to the people who unleash ideaviruses." OK, so businesses need to unleash ideaviruses through smooth promiscuous sneezing. Hmm... sounds more like a TRUTH ad or a movie script than an effective marketing tactic. <P>Mr. Godin states, "instead of always talking to consumers, they have to help consumers talk to each other." However, the author replies, "word of mouth dies off." He refutes himself by stating that talk is cheap, but it is also imperative for consumers to spread the word. I understand Mr. Godin's intention to reach consumers through internet-related marketing, but this ideavirus talk may be a harder sell than what he preaches. <P>If talk is cheap, then Godin misses the boat on his use of terminology. The author conveys his feelings through his own special vocabulary of ideavirus "buzz words." He believes that we should "start using words like hive and sneezer and velocity and smoothness. Why? Because these shorthand phrases make it easy for us to communicate. By using words that indicate we both understand the underlying factors that leverage an ideavirus, we're far likelier to actually get something done." Really... that's news to me? <P>I had the feeling that Mr. Godin was using this book as an ideavirus of its own, increasing sales of his book by stressing the importance of communication through the use of his own "ideavirus" terminology. <P>According to the author, Godinisms, so to speak, are imperative to idea success. The author states, "choose your market by identifying a hive that has a problem and has the right concentration of sneezers, the right amplified networking, the right high velocity of communication and, most of all, an appropriate vacuum." Should this claim make sense to all of us, thereby solving any problems that may arise in today's marketing environment? Apparently so, Mr. Godin believes that through the use of his book, you will be "able to devise a brand-new internet business plan for a product that's useful and also embodies viral marketing...growing from nothing to a million users in a month and making you rich along the way." I guess the marketing departments should close up shop, go buy skullcaps, and give up on reaching the consumer through traditional marketing tactics. Mr. Godin's work, "Unleashing the Ideavirus," may have been entertaining, but I think I'll get my vaccine this year instead.</span>

                    <span>In Unleashing the Ideavirus, Seth Godin says your idea is contagious, like the flu. But hold on - he's not being insulting. If you think of your idea as a virus, says he, you can "infect" the marketplace by motivating customers to talk about your product. He stretches this metaphor to explain how to captivate powerful "sneezers" so they will spread the word. Not a pretty picture, if you are a literal type of person, but you get the concept. For the right product or service, this is an alternative to advertising (or, as Godin calls it, "interruption marketing"). Though he builds on multi-level marketing concepts, Godin distances himself from their negative image. He writes in a breezy, easy style, with examples, charts and illustrations. If you want to spread the word about this book, we suggest that you just cough politely on someone in marketing, advertising or sales.</span>

                    <span>This is a readable and engaging little book on marketing that you can really read in just a few sittings since it's such a quick read. It was interesting to learn about some of the more spectacular marketing successes in recent years and how they were achieved, such as Paypal, Hotmail, Napster, and others. If you're an experienced advertising person you may already be familiar with the basic principles here, but if you're new to the area or are looking for some new ideas or a fresh approach, Godin's book is worth a look.<P>Godin's main idea, however, is deceptively simple, and it really can be summed up in just a few words. He believes that the most successful marketing campaigns are those that are simply spread by means of word of mouth, from person to person. The product was so "infectious," in other words, that the marketer didn't have to do anything but just get the initial word out, and it spread from there until it became a virtual epidemic of consumer consumption.<P>There are ways, though, that you can help this process along, such as Steve Jurvetson's idea of including a little promotional message with every person's email advertising their service, which was then sent by all Hotmail customers to everyone they emailed, and it snowballed from there, growing to 12 million users in 18 months.<P>Godin's enthusiasm for marketing is contagious itself, and in fact he discusses the concept of "sneezers," or people who are able to "infect" others and influence their purchasing decisions through their influence. (As someone with occasionally less than impressive immunity, I would have preferred the author not get quite this cute with the terminology, but oh well :-)). He discusses Oprah Winfrey, who he says is the most successful "sneezer" of our generation in her power to influence millions of people to buy the books from her book clubs and other products, not to mention her ability to make comparative unknowns like Dr. Phil successful media personalities just from the exposure gained on her show.<P>My only complaint about the book is that, as I said, the idea is pretty simple, and probably have been explained in a much shorter book rather than the actual 197 pages. A lot of the text is spent discussing various examples, which, although interesting, could have been pared down quite a bit. But overall, this is a well written, interesting, and enjoyable book to read on some of the most wildly successful marketing strategies of recent years with some useful ideas for putting them to work in your own business.</span>

                    <span>Seth Godin is the master of marketing THINKING. In this fabulous book, which goes deeper than you think it might, Seth takes apart the anatomy of BUZZ... what gets people talking and spreading the word abour products, services, ideas, websites... anything.<P>Far from a brainiac book, Unleashing the Ideavirus is chock full of SPECIFIC and SMART ideas you can implement right now (if you're fast and brave enough) to make a real difference in the marketing profile your company's products and services enjoy. Another classic, and precursor to Purple Cow. <P>You should have both in your library. Period.</span>
