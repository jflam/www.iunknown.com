                <span id="Label1">Few inventions evoke such nostalgia, such deeply personal and vivid memories as radio&#151;from Amos &#146;n&#146; Andy and Edward R. Murrow to Wolfman Jack and Howard Stern. Listening In is the first in-depth history of how radio culture and content have kneaded and expanded the American psyche.  <P>But Listening In is more than a history. It is also a reconsideration of what listening to radio has done to American culture in the twentieth century and how it has brought a completely new auditory dimension to our lives.  Susan Douglas explores how listening has altered our day-to-day experiences and our own generational identities, cultivating different modes of listening in different eras; how radio has shaped our views of race, gender roles, ethnic barriers, family dynamics, leadership, and the generation gap. With her trademark wit, Douglas has created an eminently readable cultural history of radio.  <P>"Douglas&#146;s wonderful book offers a sophisticated history of radio listening." &#151;Journal of American History</span>

                    <span>Radio has become such a background part of our lives, we forget just how astounding an impact it has had on our culture and psyche.  Susan Douglas brings it all back to the foreground in her book "Listening In."   This is not just a chronicle of the development of the media, this book  takes us deep into the social impacts of radio, and how it changed how we  react and interact with each other.  Douglas has perfectly captured the  feel and "tone" of different periods of radio listening, and  explores a lot of the psychological aspects of how radio let us sample and  explore different parts of our American cultue in a safe and nonthreatening  way.  <p>As a present-day radio fanatic, the book gave me hope:  hope that  the medium hasn't been corporatized into complete blandness.  Radio will  continue to evolve, just like our American culture.<p>Whether your're a  radio technology type, an old time radio fan, or just a student of American  history, you'll find something to love in this book.</span>

                    <span>Please take note that Susan J. Douglas' <Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination> (Times Books, 1999) is no mere history of radio. It was triggered by a request from the Sloan Foundation that was preparing  a series of books on technology and American culture; and the emphasis is  not on the details but on the general effect radio has on us from its  beginnings. And take another note. This is too enjoyable a read to be  considered a textbook.<p>   My favorite chapter was the one called  "Radio Comedy and Linguistic Slapstick." Here only a few comics  are used as examples to support her several theses, one of which is the  emasculation of the American male by the use of such high-pitched speakers  as Jack Benny and Joe Penner. Of course there is lots of room for argument,  but she does let the facts speak for themselves (pun intended).<p>   The  other chapters are "The Zen of Listening," "The Ethereal  World," "Exploratory Listening in the 1920s," "Tuning  In to Jazz" "The Invention of the Audience," "World War  II and the Invention of Broadcast Journalism," "Playing Fields of  the Mind," "The Kids Take Over: Transistors, DJs, and Rock 'n'  Roll," "The FM Revolution," "Talk Talk," "Why  Ham Radio Matters," and "Conclusion: Is Listening Dead?"<p>    Which of us has not been affected in many of the ways Ms. Douglas points  out in this book? Therefore, which of us can afford to miss being shown how  radio has helped make us what we are? And I do hope she produces a similar  book about television.</span>

                    <span>I've got Douglas' book today for her take on ham radio (I'm part of the Amateur Radio community) and I was very impressed with the rest of the book.  Though I wrinkled my nose at the over-emphasis on the gender  conflict in radio, Listening In reminded me of a time when people  participate in a common culture instead of idly sitting by listening to the  umpteenth Top 40 hit made by over-commercialized "plastic" bands.    <p>The ham radio chapter was simply great and I give Dr. Douglas her due  for mentioning the American Radio Relay League as the national association  for hams.  From this chapter, I can see why hams have a nurturing touch in  their approach to life! The section on radio comedy is well done (the  comedy bits are good for a chuckle or two).  I recommend it to those who  have a deep affinity for radio and communications.</span>
