                    <span>I was a DirectDraw programmer, but always wanted to move to 3D. I tried reading online tutorials and some books about 3D programming, but still couldn't understand _why_ I need to do so many steps just to see a triangle spinning on the screen. The articles I read didn't explain much about it. I gave up and went back to DirectDraw until this book caught up my attention.<P>The price is considerably cheap compared the other "game programming" books, but the book contains more than that. It explains why you pass a value to a function, what does that value mean, what does it do, what are the alternatives?<P>This book is very useful for those who just started learning Direct3D programming. During the course of making my game, I have to admit that I open this book more than any other books I have.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book has been written that contains source code that compiles! I messed with Direct3D for a few months and couldn't figure it out using a few different Direct3D books. Once I purchased 2D in Direct3D I was drawing triangles in 3D space within a day! Lighting, Alpha Blending, Z-Buffering, Rotations, it all in there. It cuts out all the windows [stuff] and gets right to the point. It's a beautiful reference book for intermediate game programmers. <P>I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner that wants to start making games because it does not tell you how to put all the code together to make a game.<P>It's a really handy book to have around. Its like an SDK that makes sense.</span>

                    <span>this book will not teach you a lot. it will, however, point you into a direction where you should venture into if you want to learn directX 2D or 3D. the matrix lessons are a bit too complicated with the way the author explained it, considering that matrix arithmetic is not too difficult. there are a few pages containg cryptic matrix multiplication examples which could have been explained in a few sentences like in lamothe's tricks of the trade book( lamothe explains math better ). I especially didnt like the chapter where the author stated that he will not teach you how to load an X-file, he wants you to do that on your own. shoulda pointed out where if he wont bother explaning it. but i give it 3 stars for a decent read. it is a good addition to a game programmers collection</span>

                    <span>Unlike many of the other books in the Premier Press Game Development Series, this book is a short 270 or so pages. That said, it's information dense and INCREMENTAL. It's also apparent how the book can prepare someone to make the transition from 2D to 3D quickly.<P>Some of the topics the author covers in this book that I found particularly useful:<P>- Alpha blending for 2D effects<BR>- Z buffering (this topic is covered extensively elsewhere, admittedly; but this author has explained Z-buffering in the most lucid manner I have seen to date)<BR>- Lighting for 2D<BR>- Simple vertex shading for 2D<BR>- Particle systems for 2D (very useful)<P>The later chapters, in particular, were extremely useful. All the code WORKS. This book was written while DirectX 8.0 was the latest and greatest, so there may be some issues with DirectX 9 and higher, but of course that's to be expected.<P>All in all, This book has been one of the best investments I've ever made in my game development education. Furthermore, it has been a constant companion and reference during my own commercial game development.</span>

                    <span>What I didn't like:<P>Okay, this is a bit different than the Microsoft references. However, the "focus" perhaps was slightly misplaced. "Chapter 1 - The Direct3D Architecture" was not the name of the first chapter, unfortunately. It should have been the largest chapter in the book and it wasn't even in it. An appendix, a simple diagram, something?!!<P>A necessary but perhaps overreaching review of Linear Algebra - the long form of dot and cross products for 4x4 matrices. Sometimes you swear you heard the author thinking, "How can I fill another page?" That information would have been better supplemented in an appendix or by referring the user to an online resource (the email address of a good mathematics professor, maybe). Equally, the book could have been written with about half the number of pages conveying the same, if not more, useful information.<P>There are a lot of terms - especially someone who is new to 3D programming. Most of the terms reflect concepts or objects of the Direct3D architecture. Again, where is that critical Chapter 1? While you eventually discover what all these terms are, it is not obvious what the interdependencies are until later.<P>What I liked:<P>Each chapter in the beginning tells you what you should get out of it. So at the end of the chapter, go back to the beginning and see if you agree. If not, re-read, chief.<P>Admittedly, the book breaks down the Direct3D functions one by one. The information is there in case you don't want to search the MSDN. AND with the way the functions are presented, you can easily code along with the first few chapters.<P>Summary:<BR>If you are new to Direct3D, it is less scary than the MSDN documentation. It is a VERY linear book with insufficient focus on architecture, too much focus on function calls, and a lot of reiterated implicit information.</span>
