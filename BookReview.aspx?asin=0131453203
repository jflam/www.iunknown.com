                <span id="Label1"><P><B></B> The seventh edition of this popular book has been updated and revised to accommodate the technical, managerial, and methodological changes occurring at an ever-increasing pace in this field. While retaining the best features of the previous edition, it covers the latest principles, concepts, and technologies. Illustrations help make important concepts and techniques clear. <B></B> It includes object-oriented data modeling and UML, Internet databases, data warehousing, and the use of CASE tools in support of data modeling. Topics are introduced to reinforce principles from other typical information fields, such as systems analysis and design, networking, Website design and development, MIS principles, and computer programming. Emphasis is on the development of the database component of modern information systems, and on the management of the data resource. <B></B> For managers of information systems, as well as systems analysts and database designers.  </P></span>

                    <span>This is a required textbook for an Intro to DB course. Once again, the University of Texas at Dallas has followed a constant pattern of requiring textbooks that are 1) Poorly organized/written books, 2) expensive and 3)The professor haven't read the book themselves AND are not using/following a required book when teaching their course! This said, my review of this book.<p>IT'S POORLY ORGANIZED AND DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW; NOT AN INTRO DB BOOK!<p>For example: "Relational Database" - The book begin this topic on "PAGE 11", but does not define nor clearly explain what this is; the book glorify how "...preliminary studies convinced management of the potential advantage of this approach...modern company should implement..." Then, it talks about "Implementing the Relational Database." Ok, but what the f**k is a Relational database! This continues on until finally at "PAGE 259" when it FINALLY defines what this is.<p>Good luck!</span>

                    <span>Much like Hoffer's other book, which focuses on an earlier stage in the Sys. Devel. Life Cycle (Analysis & Design), this is the next book in "the series".<br>This book goes over some of the fundamental concepts of modeling and relationship diagramming which were covered in the previous book. However, it picks up where the other left off and explain in-depth Database creation maintainence, and so on to a point where most can understand, and all can benefit from. Another good job from these strong Authors</span>
