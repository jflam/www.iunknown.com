                    <span>A COURSE IN COMBINATORICS covers a great breadth of topics under the label of "combinatorics," including graph theory, enumeration, and some algebra. The book is comprehensive; the instructor can pick-and-choose appropriate material from the huge array provided without detriment to understanding. 
<br />
<br />Each chapter is written in a friendly, accessible manner: plenty of interesting and instructive examples follow the clear definitions and preliminaries. To give the reader an idea of the topics presented in the book, a list of chapters follows:
<br />
<br />1. Graphs
<br />2. Trees
<br />3. Colorings of graphs and Ramsey's theorem
<br />4. Turan's theorem and extremal graphs
<br />5. Systems of distinct representatives
<br />6. Dilworth's theorem and extremal set theory
<br />7. Flows in networks
<br />8. De Bruijn sequences
<br />9. Two (0,1,*) problems: addressing for graphs and a hash-coding scheme
<br />10. The principle of inclusion-exclusion; inversion formulae
<br />11. Permanents
<br />12. The Van der Waerden conjecture
<br />13. Elementary counting; Stirling numbers
<br />14. Recursions and generating functions
<br />15. Partitions
<br />16. (0,1)-Matrices
<br />17. Latin Squares
<br />18. Hadamard matrices, Reed-Muller codes
<br />19. Designs
<br />20. Codes and designs
<br />21. Strongly regular graphs and partial geometries
<br />22. Orthogonal Latin squares
<br />23. Projetive and combinatorial geometries
<br />24. Gaussian numbers and q-analogues
<br />25. Lattices and Mobius inversion
<br />26. Combinatorial designs and projective geometries
<br />27. Difference sets and automorphisms
<br />28. Difference sets and the group ring
<br />29. Codes and symmetric designs
<br />30. Association schemes
<br />31. (More) algebraic techniques in graph theory
<br />32. Graph connectivity
<br />33. Planarity and coloring
<br />34. Whitney duality
<br />35. Embeddings of graphs on surfaces
<br />36. Electrical networks and squared squares
<br />37. Polya theory of counting
<br />38. Baranyai's theorem
<br />
<br />The problems in the book are generally very rich and well-written, with helpful hints from the appendix that provide motivation but do not spoil. However, the relative difficulty of the problems is not readily made appparent, so over- or underthinking of problems often occurs with misjudgments. 
<br />
<br />For the interested high-school student to the beginning graduate, this book is ideal for the study of combinatorics. Truly a nice read that connects many areas of mathematics and combines them into a thing of true beauty.</span>

                    <span>The first word that comes to my mind when I think of this text is "encyclopedic". It contains around 40 chapters, hitting most of the high points of combinatorics that a graduate student should see. The exposition is generally good with nice examples. The one thing that I fault it for is the number of statements that the authors claim are "obvious". In a way, this is good, because it makes you pay attention and understand the material, but sometimes the statement isn't obvious until you've thought about it for an hour and written out a lengthy proof. At that point, it does become completely obvious and you can't believe that you ever thought it wasn't, so I can understand why van Lint and Wilson fell into the trap so often. (In fact, I've heard that Wilson even stumbles over some of those points in lectures.) This is a great book to have on your shelf if you need somewhere to look up combinatorial ideas.</span>

                    <span>This book was the text for a graduate-level course I took.  The presentation is very laid-back, much like the lecturing style of one of the authors (Wilson), and so it was quite readable (unlike many other math  books which you have to stop every few pages and pick apart everything  before it sinks in).<p>Combinatorics is a relatively recent development in  mathematics, one which is generally easy to explain, but with many  difficult open questions.  Van Lint and Wilson do an excellent job  explaining, but there are a few places where the reader needs to know some  background to place the particular problem in the appropriate mathematical  context.  Understandably, if the authors were to include all the  mathematical machinery needed, the book would be huge!  Instead, they have  chosen to describe as many facets of the field as possible, and therefore  have written a broad, well-balanced book which approaches the topic in a  non-threatening way.<p>My one criticism, then, is that there is a lack of  depth in several areas of the book, with further discussion of advanced  topics or open problems.  But even so, I can appreciate the omission for  the sake of accessibility.<p>To fully appreciate the subject, the authors  are correct in mentioning that the book is written with the graduate  student in mind.  But by no means does the reader require such a background  to appreciate the remarkable concepts and the exciting questions revealed  in this book.</span>

                    <span>The cover says, "...ideally suited for use as a text...at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level."   WRONG!!  I'm a sixteen year old-- far from graduate school-- and I am reading,  understanding, and LOVING this book.  I cannot think of a greater  introduction to combinatorics-- it has examples and problems to test your  comprehension, and logical flow from one subject to another.  This book is  a rare find-- clear explanations and definitions at a fast pace that  doesn't bore you.  I would recommend this book unconditionally to ANYBODY  interested in mathematics.</span>
