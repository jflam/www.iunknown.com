                <span id="Label1">In his second in-depth foray into the world of professional cooking, Michael Ruhlman journeys into the heart of the profession. Observing the rigorous Certified Master Chef exam at the Culinary Institute of America, the most influential cooking school in the country, Ruhlman enters the lives and kitchens of rising star Michael Symon and renowned Thomas Keller of the French Laundry. This fascinating book will satisfy any reader's hunger for knowledge about cooking and food, the secrets of successful chefs, at what point cooking becomes an art form, and more. Like Ruhlman's <i>The Making of a Chef</i>, this is an instant classic in food writing-one of the fastest growing and most popular subjects today.</span>

                    <span>A couple years ago I read a profile of Thomas Keller's Napa Valley restaurant the French Laundry in Gourmet magazine. I cannot say that many of that magazine's article stay in my mind, but this one did. It was written by The Soul of a Chef's author, Michael Ruhlman. I recall a passage describing prep chef who, after spending hours peeling fava beans, placed them in water that was not at a sufficiently rapid boil. Keller told the chef to start completely over.This incident is included in Soul of a Chef and is an example of the way Ruhlman can select a moment which illuminates person's philosophy. It showed so clearly the lengths to which Keller will go to achieve perfection, and the high expectations he places on his staff.<P>Such characterizations would make this an interesting read even for the non-foodie--although it certainly helps if you have an interest in cooking. This book, together with his first one about The Culinary Institute (The Making of a Chef) are a great pairing.</span>

                    <span>Ruhlman's first book, Making of Chef, was a terrific, in-depth account of his time as a journalist/student at the Culinary Inst. of America. For people with some appreciation for the tradition and craft of cooking, it's full of "So that's how" moments and conveys the so-different challenges of being a professional chef. It's also personal and dramatic. Just a pleasure to read.<P>This book is the uneven sequel. The book is in three parts. 1) An account of one's year's Certfied Master Chef exam/cook-off at the CIA; 2) the story of Michael Symon and his highly successful Cleveland restaurant, Lola; 3) likewise Thomas Keller and his Yountville, CA phenom The French Laundry. Part 1 is a gripping and fitting follow-on to the first book. He follows the contestants through their week of mystery-ingredient cook-offs, portraying their triumphs and failures through moment by moment. After a while, you can predict when that consome is going to break, too. Part 2 covers interesting ground in portraying the day-to-day workings of a successful restaurant. But Kitchen Confidential, Anthony Bourdain's story of NYC's Les Halles, is more insightful and Bourdain's dark, wry voice can't be beat. In Part 3 Ruhlman faithfully details Keller's obsession with craft. It's a love note to Keller and the restaurant that in the end didn't quite hold my interest. Hard to push aside thoughts that it would help sell the cookbook the two wrote together.<P>If you liked "Making", you'll enjoy part 1 enough not to regret having bought the book. Otherwise, unless you're a habitue of Lola or French Laundry, I'd pass.</span>

                    <span>'The Soul of a Chef' is the second of Michael Ruhlman's journalistic explorations into the world of culinary life in America. The book contains three long essays that chronicle parts of the careers of three different chefs at three different levels of achievement. Thus, the journey toward perfection is more the journey of the author than it is a journey by a single chef.<P>The first essay is a telling of the events in one examination for the title of 'Certified Master Chef'. The certification is carried out and bestowed by the Culinary Institute of America, often characterized as the Harvard of American cooking schools. The examination runs for more than a week when, on each day, the candidate must complete a particular task. The candidate knows the object of each task at least a day in advance, so they may at least mentally prepare for their challenge. Almost all tasks are taken from the pages of classic French cuisine, some lifted almost directly from the pages of Escoffier's books on the subject. Out of about a dozen qualifiers competing at each session, held once every six months, usually only two or three candidates pass the test and are awarded the title. The author participates in the competition under the ruse of being an inspector from a fictional qualifying organization that is verifying that the tests are worthy of an imaginary certification. In that way, the author can observe and interview all the candidates without arousing suspicion or apprehension in the candidates. Thus, this book picks up the narrative on American culinary careers at very much the same place the author left off at the end of his first culinary investigation 'The Making of a Chef'. Most candidates have been chefs for a few years and are looking to add to their credentials and marketability, especially those who work as consultants to food service organizations. In many ways, this chapter is the most interesting, as it holds your interest to see if the featured candidates in the narrative will achieve their certification.<P>The second essay had a much weaker hold on my interest, although the quality of the writing was equal to that in the first essay. The essay title, 'Lola' is the name of a major Cleveland restaurant whose owner and head chef is Michael Symon, a CIA graduate, who may be familiar to some of you as one of the co-hosts on the Food Network show 'Melting Pot' where he and Wayne Harley Brachman explore eastern European cuisines. In addition to this distinction, Symon has been recognized as a 'Food and Wine' best new chef, so he really does not need the kind of recognition one achieves by earning the Certified Master Chef award. Symon's position in the middle essay is a sign of his rank above the CIA Master Chef candidates and below the very top of the American culinary scene represented by the chef in the last essay. The most interesting episode in the tale of Symon and 'Lola' is in the story of a visit by John Mariani, a major American restaurant critic where it seems as if just about everything goes wrong. The moral of this story to me is its demonstration of how difficult it is to maintain 100% food quality in a very good restaurant. There is a very good reason why the executive chef stands at the expediter's table and checks on outgoing dishes. The connection between the second and third essays is the fact that Symon and his new wife go to Napa Valley to dine at the French Laundry restaurant for their honeymoon.<P>The third essay takes us to the very top of the American culinary hierarchy of achievement. It deals with the career of Thomas Heller, the owner and executive chef of The French Laundry. He has been recognized as the best chef in California, followed by recognition as best chef in the country by the James Beard awards. His quest for perfection is legendary. It is no coincidence that Ruhlman is the co-author of Heller's 'The French Laundry Cookbook' as I am sure this essay was done at the same time as he was working on the cookbook. Heller's reputation is well known among foodies, so I won't dwell on it here. I will only recommend this essay, plus a chapter in Tony Bourdain's 'A Cooks Tour' as excellent profiles of this very important American chef.<P>For knowledgeable foodies, this book is a pure delight. Just knowing how to make pasta Puttanesca enhances one's enjoyment of the story in the second essay. For non-foodies, the book will appeal as well or better than other famous journalistic essays such as Tracy Kidder's 'Soul of a New Machine'. The book contains some recipes.<P>Highly recommended reading.</span>

                    <span>In this book, Michael takes us into the kitchens of the CIA once again. He shows us some of the best chefs in the country, as they labor under the enormous stress of taking the CIA's 'Certified Master Chef' exams. <P>He then travels to two of America's finest restaurants and explores the character of the Chefs who created them. Along the way, we meet some other colorful characters and some very delightful-sounding food.<P>That's it in a nutshell. The reason I love this book is because it shows the heart and intensity of what I can only call the 'love of food' and the 'striving for excellence' that both of these Chefs possess. The discussion of their ingenuity in creating new dishes is very interesting as well, but it is the sheer PASSION for cooking that Michael communicates to us that kept my eyeballs glued to the pages.<P>I have now read both of Michael's books on this subject: The Making of a Chef and The Soul of a Chef. I finished them both in about two weeks and my understanding of the world of cooking, not to mention my faith in the human race (how could you not love a species that is capable of such positive, again, passion??), has simply been...transformed.<P>Thank you, Michael.</span>

                    <span>Ruhlman divides his work into 3 parts. The first part chronicles the intense Certified Master Chef exam. The second and third parts deal with the lives and cooking of Michael Symon of Lola in Cleveland and Thomas Keller of the French Laundry in Yountville, CA. The book's title pretty much says it all. The chefs portrayed in this book strive for nothing less than perfection, and Symon and Keller have apparently reached that level with some of their creations. Ruhlman's description of the CMC exam reveals what an intense and harrowing experience this test of cooking skill is. He follows seven candidates through ten days of the examination which everyone fails but one. He then proceeds to describe the work of Symon and Keller. Both chefs' stories are inspirational in that they prove that success has as much to do with dedication and diligence as innate talent. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand not only what it takes to be a great chef but what it takes to be successful in any profession. The only difficulty I had with this book was that I did not understand many of the cooking and food terms the author used. A glossary would have been nice. Anyway, a great read!</span>
