                    <span>The 80s must have been a tough decade for Hunter S. Thompson, and the writing shows it.  Easy access to drugs, as well as a rising tide of Republicanism and Conservatism to rail again.  On the the surface, this would make for great writing.  In reality, this is not his strongest work.  Great columns, as well as some of his legendary lucid lines, are interspersed with nominally coherent rants against the political powers that be.  Perhaps that is to be expected from him in an anthology of his newspaper writings.
<br />
<br />This is an important read for those very in tune to his genre.  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a better start if you haven't read anything of his before.  It will also provide better context to his mindset in the 80s.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent introduction to the range of Thompson's writings though the early 1990's. It includes samples of his two early novels (Prince Jellyfish, The Rum Diary) and articles and excerpts from his later journalism and fiction ("Let The Trials Begin" is worth the price of the book).No duplication of material fromThe Great Shark Hunt, his earlier collection. An excellent audio version was realeased when the book was first published.<br> This book gives you some idea of what he was up to during the time covered by the two volumes of letters he's published and shows that his humor and sense of outrage have matured better than, say, Mark Twain's during a comparable stretch of his writing career.</span>
