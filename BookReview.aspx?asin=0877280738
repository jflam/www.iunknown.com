                    <span>What a great book.  This scholar/monk gives his own insight and knowledge on Buddhism for the first half of the book and the second half is a collection of discourses by the Buddha and many of Buddha's followers.  I read this book once front to back and learned a great deal.  The second time, however, I read the second half first, and flipped to the first half accordingly where Thera expounded on each topic.  This book explains Theravada Buddhism well and I learned a great deal.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I was unhappy the moment I started to read this book.  I don't know if its an awkward translation at fault or if the writer is too academic, but try this sentence on for size: "These latter casual remarks of ours point to another contribution to mind-knowledge of a more theoretical character concerning those aforementioned age-old philosophical attitudes which arise from false factual premises, with vast theoretical superstructures framed to fit those premises."  ...huh?  And these we-will-twist-your-arm-to-become-a-believer statements offend me: "To this sick and truly demented world of ours, there comes an ancient teaching of eternal wisdom and unfailing guidance, the Buddha-Dhamma, the Doctrine of the Enlightened One, with its message and power of healing."  Overall, I found sentences too awkward, and paragraphs too cryptic. I kept skipping pages trying to find a good "starting" place but alas, never found one.   This book might be (emphasis on might be) a great fit for an advanced yogi/yogini, but for someone looking to start his or her understanding of meditation and perhaps the relationship between Dharma and meditation, this is not the book.

                    <span>If you are serious about learning Buddhist meditation as practiced by the Buddha himself, and are not just seeking some trendy New Age technique designed to bring you some otherworldly experience, this book is about the real thing. It's written by a respected Theravada Buddhist scholar and sets out mindfulness meditation as it is grounded in the Suttas of the Pali Canon.</span>

                    <span>This book is a commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha's discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness.  I read the book when I started meditation practice five years ago and have reread it twice since then, finishing my most recent read a week ago.  This book explains the sutta in very clear, understandible terms making it and the practice it describes more accessible to modern western readers.  The sutta and the book describe the whole of mindfulness practice both as a meditation practice and as a way of life.  As a friend remarked, "Once I found this book, I realized that I didn't need to read anything else."  If you want an introduction to mindfulness, this is the book for you.  If you want to deepen your understanding of mindfulness, this is the book for you.  It is simply the best book I've found on the subject.</span>
