                    <span>Behind the documents and the interpretations of Native American history, the Native voice yearns to be heard.  It is unfortunate that no body of literature will be able to provide the "true" voice of how Natives actually reacted to the so-called "invasion" or "conquest" North America by Europeans during the early part of 16th century.  However, Daniel Richter's FACING EAST FROM INDIAN COUNTRY:  A NATIVE HISTORY OF EARLY AMERICA attempts to switch the lens from a European perspective to a Native American one.  
<br />
<br />The book's cover shows an amazing picture of the American landscape that is all too familiar to historians and literati with its depiction of the romanticized Indian.  Here we have a glorious painting that does not truly depict the world in which Indians had lived in.  Yes, it is a big wide world that has not yet been tainted by colonists,settlers and traders alike.  However, it was their world that had been considered the New World.
<br />
<br />Richter does a good job at introducing his argument that Natives are at the foreground of American history.  That is, if one looked East along the Eastern seaboard.  This account adds a dimension  to "master narrative," which now included Native  inhabitants to be heard behind European accounts.
<br />
<br />FACING EAST FROM INDIAN COUNTRY may be a good starting point for those who would like to understand American history and its intricacies that involved Native Americans.  This may not be the quintessential narrative, but it is one that is not difficult to understand nor is it complex.  It is a visual perspective that may lead to complex inquiry as an after thought because the book ends where the story of Native Americans further continues, but  with one drastic event after another.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited to read Facing East From Indian Country, having read literally dozens of history titles on the conquest of the New World from the European perspective for school and work. However, I was slightly disappointed with Mr. Richter's writing style, and felt that as an author he did not "digest" his great thesis quite enough. There were too many times that I found myself really trying hard to "get into" particular chapters, and I thought that I was really working too hard to get through this title. <p>That is not to say that this book is poor by any means. It is  a far more academic title than I expected. For help with research it is excellent and offers up a great variety of very rare Native American source documents. But for simple reading pleasure it is a bit too scholarly.<p>The reader's enjoyment of Facing East From Indian Country will depend on whether the customer is purchasing this book for academic work/research or just for casual reading. For the student/historian, it is a fresh take on the history of North America. For the history buff, it is probably a bit too complex. I am both a history buff and a professional historian, and couldn't help be a bit disappointed, especially after looking forward to reading Mr. Richter's book for some time. <br>Hopefully he will publish more work in the future with the same type of freshness and perspective, and make it more digestable.</span>

                    <span>Since the Native Americans themselves have not left behind a body of written documentation describing their thoughts on the earliest episodes of European immigration,  it is up to the author to speculate intelligently... based on the archeological evidence, the known actions of the peoples involved, and his own imagination.  Vast in scope, but generously informative of individual events and particular people, the author has succeeded in creating a scholarly work that transcends the usual. Keen insights, and a clear, graceful writing style makes  this kind of historical reading extremely satisfying.</span>

                    <span>Wow!! What a book. Focusing on the Eastern Colonization of America, Daniel Richter provides an extremely powerful and even handed view on Native American  - European interaction between  the years 1620 and 1812. I loved this book. You will to.</span>

                    <span>There are far too few books like this, that dare to make the imaginative leap to express the point of view of another culture.  Mr. Richter's achievement is to give us a way to stand in the "shoes" of those who greeted us when we arrived on these shores, tried to understand us and live with us, and ultimately were decimated by the policies that we, as immigrant peoples, put in place. I would highly recommend that readers pair this with Kent Nerburn's Neither Wolf nor Dog, another work that takes us deep inside the hearts and minds of those who inhabited this land before us.  We need more books like these.  They show that it is not impossible to enter into the self consciousness and self understanding of people who see the American experience through very different eyes.</span>
