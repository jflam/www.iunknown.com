                <span id="Label1">"I got into Memphis." So begins Dr. King's "Excerpt from Speech the Day Before His Death" at the start of <i>In Search of Freedom</i>.  His arresting, mellifluous voice, heard eerily removed, as if coming through a bullhorn, retains all the splendid vibrancy of timbre and his singular gift for oration. His message is urgent: the stalwart journey into civil rights, civil disobedience, and the path of nonviolence has taken him all the way to "the mountaintop." On this disc these spiritual ideals are perhaps best understood in the lengthy yet clearly flowing "Address to American Jewish Committee," wherein King provides the reasons and constitution of nonviolent protest and the fruits achieved from its labors. Decades after his precious life was taken, King's language dances, resonating the very sanctity of living along with his Atlanta congregation, who affirm and encourage with "yes, sirs" and "amens." <i>--Paige La Grone</i></span>

                    <span>Even at $6.99 this CD is over priced. With the exception of "Address to the American Jewish Committee" and Dr. King's Entrance into Civil Rights Movement", all that is provided are very minimal sound bites. The "I have a Dream Speech" only includes the final culmination of his address. In order to appreciate Dr. King as an orator, his speeches must be heard from the absolute beginning to the end. What made the I have a Dream Speech so great was the way that Dr. King located his groove and began to flow into his spiritual roots. I was greatly disappointed by this collection.  </span>

                    <span>Very little substance. You can't get "into" the speeches because the excerpts are more like sound bites. Look for a better deal.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited to get this CD home but to my disappointment, some of the tracks were just the very famous MLK. Jr. quote or key on-liners taken out of context from speeches that we really need to know more about.  We need to hear more of these speeches just to understand the significance and the strength of King's words and the content of which they came from.<p>However, although most of these speeches are abruptions, King's voice alone does wonders for the soul. At least the "I Have A Dream Speach" is given to us in it's entirity.</span>

                    <span>This is not one of the better collections of Dr. King's speeches, as these are minor excerpts that are far too short. I would recommed "The Great March To Freedom" (1963 Detroit speech, full of barbed humor and excellent points), "The Great matrch on Washington" (entire Dream Speech), "Free At Last" (Mountaintop Speech) and best of all, the "A Call To Conscience" CDs that have all of the above and then some. Also, the breif but powerful Birmingham excerpt from "Sing For Freedom."</span>

                    <span>I bought this CD, and was very excited BEFORE I got the CD.  AFter I heard  it, my excitement had dwindeled.  If you are planning to buy this CD  remember that this only has excerpts from his speaches, meaning that except  for 3 of the tracks the majority of the tracks are only about 30sec long.   I bought this with the intention that I would be able to hear the whole  speach and not just a few seconds of it.  If you want the whole speach, do  not buy this CD, if you are happy with sound bitz then this is a winner.   As for me when I purchased this CD I expected to get some meat--insted I  had to settle for a mear appettizer.  With the awsome speaches Dr. King  spoke, what a pitty to put out a cd that does not do him justice.</span>
