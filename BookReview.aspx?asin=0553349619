                    <span>Mr. McCormack reminds us of the fundamentals and basic goals of business in order to succeed and prosper. The book is quite clear and informative. It's the kind of book that you want to share with everyone, but on the other hand keep it to yourself because what you learn from this book will make you appear like a genius. This is a book that everyone from students to business managers and owners should read. It's a quick and easy read with long-lasting practical benefits. It is a must read.</span>

                    <span>I read McCormack's first book right out of college and use his advice daily. He has a no-nonsense approach to business and understands business is about common sense and relationships. This is an important book that everyone from the recent college graduate to the CEO should read. It is a must read.</span>

                    <span>This book applies by all circumstances and all field of our life to improve its quality. I would like to pay more attention to the following 5 points of view and learn how to control your bad luck.<P>1. In charge of host not guest. He says, "Do prepare the things they are never expecting at the meeting. This means surprised something always can enforce the relationship between you and them. Get ready? Go for it. 2. Know about your customer or client first before you let them purchase your produts. Keep listening and watching their body and oral language to understand what they want rather than emphasize your desire. That's the point. This may lead you high performance.<P>3. Avoid conflicting. Excellent negotiator can be able to endure until right time coming with perseverance to win finally.<P>4. More listen less speak. Open your ears and close your mouth toward others. It will lead to successful businessmen but difficult to do.<P>5. Remind the importance of time management Persuade your time or you will be conquered by it. Manage it minute by minute effectively. In this case, we don't need speed. We need depth.<P>His lesson is still available even though 13 years over from his writing time.</span>

                    <span>The word of "Marketing" has been very familiar with us but "Sports Marketing" since 1960. At that time, Mark McCormack established IMG to promote golfer and assigned himself as a Head. He is now representative of the IMG, has the highest reputation in the world multinational marketing company, specially sports star to become heroes. He mentioned on this book the people never judged by their academic background and racial distinguish.</span>

                    <span>There is No Doubt that Mark McCormack has extensive experience in Management. He has also dealt with top CEO's in fields not relevent to his (as potential or actual sponsors) so he does have what it takes to write a good book about the practice of management (this is not a book about his profession, but about general management). He does an excellent job in conveying everyday managerial situations and he is a very organized communicator. I found this book easy to read, enlightening and practical. I strongly recommend it to people in all sorts of managerial jobs.</span>
