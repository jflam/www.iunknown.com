                <span id="Label1">In this provocative, witty, and thoroughly researched inquiry into what we find beautiful and why, Nancy Etcoff skewers one of our culture's most enduring myths, that the pursuit of beauty is a learned behavior. Etcoff, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and a practicing psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, skewers the enduring myth that the pursuit of beauty is a learned behavior.<br><br>Etcoff puts forth that beauty is neither a cultural construction, an invention of the fashion industry, nor a backlash against feminism, but instead is in our biology. It's an essential and ineradicable part of human nature that is revered and ferociously pursued in nearly every civilizatoin--and for good reason. Those features to which we are most attracted are often signals of fertility and fecundity. When seen in the context of a Darwinian struggle for survival, our sometimes extreme attempts to attain beauty--both to become beautiful ourselves and to acquire an attractive partner--become understandable. Moreover, if we come to understand how the desire for beauty is innate, then we can begin to work in our interests, and not soley for the interests of our genetic tendencies.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In "Survival of the Prettiest," Nancy Etcoff states that beauty is *not* (ahem) in the eye of the beholder. Instead, she claims that beauty exists beyond personal preference, and offers evidence that our "love of beauty is deeply rooted in our biology." This argument is quite convincing. Below is a summary of just two of the points she makes:<P>1. While the ideal of beauty changes with the times, Etcoff pinpoints similarities across time and cultures. First and foremost, people are attracted to those who are similar to them. For example, Brazilians might feel that beautiful Brazilians are more attractive than beautiful Asians. Yet when asked to pick attractive Asians out of a crowd, Brazilians will generally identify Asians who are considered attractive by other Asians. So, people who are very different in appearance can still agree on some level about beauty in others! This indicates that preferences are at work which transcend continent and culture, making "the role of individual taste is far more insignificant" than we want to believe.<P>2. All people everywhere are hardwired to think that babies are beautiful; after all, babies are so needy that their survival depends on their appealingness. Intuitive, yes -- but when the research on infant beauty is juxtaposed with research confirming the worldwide male preference for women who look young, lots of things begin to make sense. For example, it shows that the common male desire for women to be "infant-like" -- or helpless, weak, and in need of a caregiver -- is part of the same process.<P>These are just a two of the interesting points that Etcoff raises in this worthwhile book. It's well written, enjoyable, and unapologetic about its finding that instinct triumphs over common sense. Thus, although the book is about biology, the analysis it presents is sure to provoke thought among those who are interested in Darwinism, the media, and/or women's issues. <P>Etcoff's conclusion: Although we may be dissatistfied with the emphasis our culture places on beauty, our desire to seek out beauty is neither good nor bad. It just is. And that's a good thing to know.</span>

                    <span>"Survival of the Prettiest" collects together hundreds of points of research on beauty, linking them into a cohesive, well-written whole. The relevance of appearance is tracked from its theoretical origins to modern-day society; the author makes good use of both historical and contemporary evidence to make points in each chapter.<P>With an extensive bibliography, this book provides the reader the chance to research further any individual topic discussed. Many points were made that floored me; the one that comes to mind easiest is that the American stereotypical role-model image of beauty has been changing slowly to incorporate the influences of many cultures.<P>This book would make a wonderful coffee-table reader, as well as a useful read for anyone interested in understanding why attraction and beauty have so much influence on our everyday lives.

                    <span>A readable book on one of those things that is constant in our lives. I can testify to the "attractive people are given more personal space" phenomenon Etcoff points out. I was staying in New York for a couple weeks. For the first week I was enjoying seeing all the beautiful women in the city, of which New York has plenty since it's both a fashion and entertainment capitol. And then I was taking the elevator down from my room in the Waldorf Towers, a middle floor of which holds an exercise room guests can use, as well as local residents who pay a monthly fee. The elevator was fairly crowded, and then stopped at the exercise-room floor. On to the elevator stepped an absolutely stunningly beautiful girl. One of those so beautiful you forget how beautiful a beautiful girl can be. She had a gym bag and her hair was loose. She set her gym bag on the floor and bent over to bind her hair. The thing is everyone OVERTLY moved back to give her room, struck by her beauty, and she didn't have to signal "please give me space while I bend over" as most other people would require. Everyone just automatically stepped back, deferring to her beauty, and she automatically EXPECTED everyone to move back. She didn't even think about it, nor was haughty at all. She was just so used to being given instant "status" in any situation, she wasn't even conscious of it. In that small moment, I realized how powerful beauty can be.</span>

                    <span>I checked it out from the library, read it, and decided it belonged on my bookshelf. *If this topic interests you, this book is a must-have.* Dr. Etcoff has produced an exceedingly well-researched book that is written in a straightforward voice. Her qualifications are impressive and thoroughly relevant to the topic. When comparing this book to others that Amazon recommends in related subjects, its brilliance becomes even more apparent; concepts are expressed clearly and it is difficult to refrain from talking to one's cohorts about them as a result! Dr. Etcoff covers MANY trends and patterns so that the reader (this one, at least!) has a number of wonderful "Ah-HA!" experiences!</span>

                    <span>"Survival of the Prettiest", to me was yet more fascinating evolutionary psychology fare. I just love this stuff. Don't be turned off by the introduction. It reads like an editorial and is actually more like a conclusion. It contains few of those juicy research tidbits that makes evolutionary psychology so interesting. The juicy bits of information start in the second chapter and keep going right on into the last. This book read like a page turning murder mystery. If you liked "Survival of the Prettiest" you might also like the following books: Robert Wright, The Moral Animal: Why we are the way we are, the new scinece of evolutionary psychology; David Barash, The Whisperings Within; Matt Ridley, The Red Queen; Matt Ridley, Nature via Nuture; David Barash, The myth of Monogamy; and David Barash, Making Sense of Sex. Other books on my reading list are: Barash & Lipton, The Gender Gap, David Buss, The Evolution of Desire, and Geoffrey Miller, The Mating Mind.</span>
