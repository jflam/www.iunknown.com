                    <span>This book genuinely has more mathematical content, for around $15-$25, than most, maybe all, "bridge" texts for college math majors, costing 5 or 10 times as much.
<br />
<br />This book was written by a master, for an intelligent person knowing only 1950's style high school mathematics (some trig, algebra, and geometry).
<br />
<br />When I fiorst tried to read it as a youngster however I was not used to books that required actually thinking about each statement, before proceeding to the next. Hence I could not read it at the pace I thought normal.
<br />
<br />So this is not a breezy read, but is an outstanding one.  It has literally no competitor to my knowledge at the present time, in quantity of material, quality of material, and quality of exposition.
<br />
<br />Even experts may learn something here about the most familiar topics.  E.g. in presenting the proof of the well known fact that all integers greater than one have unique prime factorizations, the authors show how a clever use of induction avoids developing the characterization of a gcd, which usually precedes this theorem.  I had never seen that before.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a miracle book that treats the reader like a baby, and still covers calculus, this is not it.  But if you have the prerequisites of a good high school course of elementary math, and are willing to spend time on the arguments, there is no better book for beginners and intelligent laypersons.</span>

                    <span>For the most part I love this book. It is informative, and relatively simple to understand. This book is an "elementary approach to ideas and methods" for the whole field of mathmatics. In fact, this book is one of the reasons I changed my major to mathmatics.<p>However, there are two main problems with this book. First the quality of the print varies. Occasionally, whole sets of subscripts are blurred, which makes understanding the equation of the moment difficult, if not impossible.<p>Second, the order of steps for solving or understanding a problem are in an unexpected order, which is confusing. Often, I find that a difficult passage doesn't deal with difficult concepts, its just that the concepts are explained in an unusual way.<p>Aside from those problems, this is an extraordinary introduction to mathmatics.</span>

                    <span>This is a demanding book. One cannot read it listening to Bach. [a clash of complexities]. The construction of he book is `old style' [which is every seeming possible variation is mentioned] which has fallen into disfavor as confusing,<p>That written it is very complete and I really enjoyed many parts of this book.</span>

                    <span>Courant's 500-page text is not entirely suitable for the layman. Its target audience includes those who enjoy reading and studying mathematics and have a good background through precalculus or higher. "What is Mathematics?" is a mathematics book, not a book about mathematics.<p>"What is Mathematics?" is not a new book. It was first published in 1941. New editions appeared in 1943, 1945, and 1947. My soft cover fourth edition by Oxford University Press is in its 12 printing.<p>The authors indicate that it is no means necessary to "plow through it page by page, chapter by chapter". I fully agree. I have skipped around, jumping to chapters of particular interest, but I have now read nearly every chapter. <p>I initially skipped to page 165 and delved directly into projective geometry (chapter IV), proceeded to topology (chapter V), and then jumped backwards to the beginning to explore the theory of numbers. After moving to geometry, I finally returned to the later chapters on functions and limits, maxima and minima, and the calculus.<p>Courant engages the reader in discussions on mathematical concepts rather than focusing on applications and problem solving. "What is Mathematics?" is a great textbook for students that have completed a year or more of calculus and wish to pull all of their mathematical learning together before moving on to more advanced studies. I suspect that it would even be welcomed by students that have completed an undergraduate degree in mathematics.<p>I cannot resist quoting Albert Einstein's comment on What is Mathematics? - "A lucid representation of the fundamental concepts and methods of the whole field of mathematics...Easily understandable."<p>Richard Courant was a highly respected mathematician. He taught in Germany and in Cambridge and was director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University (now renamed the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences). Courant has authored other widely acclaimed mathematical texts including Methods of Mathematical Physics (co-authored with David Hilbert) and his popular Differential and Integral Calculus.</span>

                    <span>Einstein writes..."Easily understandable." And Herman Weyl,..."It is a work of high perfection." It is both for <br>beginners and for scholars. The first edition by Courant and Robbins, has been revised, with love and care, by Ian Stewart.<br>Of the sciences, math stands out in the way some central ideas and tools are timeless. Key math ideas from our first mathematical experiences, perhaps early in life, often have more permanence this way. While the fads do change in math, there are some landmarks that remain, and which inspire generations. And they are as useful now as they were at their inception, the fundamentals of numbers, of geometry, of calculus and differential equations, and more. Much of it is presented with an eye to applications. The book is a classic and a masterpiece. The co-authors are ambitious (and remarkably sucessful)in trying to cover the essetials within the span of 500 plus pages. You find the facts, presented in clear and engaging prose, and with lots of illustrations. The book has been used by generations of readers, and it still points to the future.</span>
