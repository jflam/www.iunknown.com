                <span id="Label1">Many database management system (DBMS) tools run on a variety of hardware platforms. The differences among the tools can be many, but all serious products have one thing in common: They support data access and manipulation in SQL, the industry-standard language specifically designed to enable people to create and manage databases. If you know SQL, you can build relational databases and get useful information out of them.    <p>    Relational database management systems are vital to many organizations. People often think that creating and maintaining these systems are extremely complex activities&#160;&#8211;&#160;the domain of database gurus who possess enlightenment beyond that of ordinary mortals. Well, <i>SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition,</i> sweeps away the database mystique.    <p>    Written in easy-to-understand terms and updated with the latest information on SQL, this handy reference shows you step-by-step how to make your database designs a reality using SQL:2003. But you don't have to be a database newbie to find value in <i>SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition</i>; even if you have some experience designing and creating databases, you may discover a few things you didn't know about.    <p>    Here's just a sampling of some of the things you'll find covered in <i>SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition:</i>     <ul>     <li>Exploring relational database and SQL fundamentals     <li>Building and maintaining a simple database structure     <li>Building a multiple relational database     <li>Manipulating database data     <li>Examining SQL nuts and bolts: values, expressions, operators, and queries     <li>Providing database security and protecting your data     <li>Exploring ODBC and JDBC, and using SQL with XML     <li>Moving beyond the basics: cursors, persistent stored modules, and error-handling     <li>Top Ten lists on common SQL mistakes and retrieval tips     </ul>    <p>    Plain and simply, databases are the best tools ever invented for keeping track of the things you care about. After you understand databases and can use SQL to make them do your bidding, you wield tremendous power. <i>SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition,</i> can get you well on your way to harnessing the power of databases.     </span>

                    <span>This is a book that I really wish that I'd had when I first started doing a web application that was to use an Access database for the backend data. I looked at a lot of Access books, but none of them went into Access SQL. For that alone this book is worth five stars. 
<br />
<br />This book starts with a bit of discussion on the fundamentals of a relational database, but not too much. After all, this is covered in all the Access books. It quickly gets into the fundamentals of SQL itself. 
<br />
<br />I was a bit concerned when he started using the Microsoft graphical design tools to create the database, but he quickly went into using SQL CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE commands. From there on he went on to a reasonable complete but elementary discussion on using most the the rest of SQL. 
<br />
<br />You gotta have a few complaints, so: 
<br />
<br />There is discussion in the book, including a list of reserved words for SQL:2003. But Access doesn't talk SQL:2003. It doesn't even talk SQL:92, it's an extended SQL:89. A list of Access reserved words would have been nice. 
<br />
<br />He doesn't talk about the two database engines in Access, Jet and MSDE; and these two engines speak very different dialects of SQL.</span>

                    <span>I like to start off projects with simple concepts and a few examples to get off the ground.  Well this book does just that.  Unfortunately I would also like to have some example of input and output.  I chose this book because it was not database specific, as I am converting files from an Informix database, through a filter, to a flat file, for later conversion to an Oracle database, with a different structure.  Unfortunately this book (being universal) has no universal explanation as to how to get information from a flat file in or out of the database.  First you have to find the term they use, not ASCII, not flat, not import, not export, not not not.  The term is found in chapter 7 "foreign." The explanation on how to do this is to "...turn to one of the professional data translation services." Great, just what I wanted to know.</span>

                    <span>. <br>I worked with SQL some years ago and bought this book as a refresher.  I've used only one other "dummy" book and that was "ASP for Dummies" and found it so excellent for a subject I was NOT familiar with that I figured getting one of the same series on a subject for which I just needed to refresh previous knowledge was a no-brainer.<p>I was wrong; I've put this book aside and ordered the "SQL: Visual Quickstart guide" (haven't read it yet, so no verdict yet). I've used this series to learn Dreamweaver MX and found it exceptional.<p>The "SQL for Dummies" book seems to have lost track of its intended audience. The examples are arcane and overly complex.  Often, when a SQL statement is presented, it's not fully explained.  Excruciatingly often, the author states he'll explain something later when the situation cries for (at least) a quick explanation NOW.<p>The author is obviously expert in the subject, but presents the material as one who forgets that in his explanation the reader may not have the same background nor is able to read the author's mind to fill in the gaps the author has not shared with the reader.<p>With no offense intended for the author, this reader, at least, recommends you look for another tutorial for learning SQL.</span>

                    <span>I bought SQL for Dummies when I was handed a web project that demanded a high traffic database.  Previous to the purchase I had only worked with flat text files and had no SQL experience.  This book can take you from basic database design all the way up to advanced SQL issues.  Thanks to SQL for Dummies I never lost pace with the project.  It explained terms and issues very plainly.  It also had excellent example code.  I still use the book today as an excellent reference tool.<p>If you were stranded on Database Island, this would be the only book you would need...</span>
