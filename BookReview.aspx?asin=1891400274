                <span id="Label1">Each year about eight million Americans suffer the death of a close family member. The list of high visibility disasters, human suffering and sudden loss is long and will continue to grow. From TWA Flight 800 to Egypt Air, from Oklahoma City to Columbine, daily we face incomprehensible loss. Outside the publicized tragedies there are many families and individuals that are suffering behind closed doors in our neighborhoods, in our own homes, in hospital waiting rooms. Now for those who face the challenges of sudden death, there is a hand to hold. Both authors lost a loved one tragically. Noel's brother was stung by a bee and died instantly at age 27. Blair's husband died of a brain aneurysm. As they struggled to rebuild they found little printed material. I Wasn't Ready to Say Good-bye is the first book to devote all its pages to the unique challenges of sudden loss, written by two women who have walked the path. They cover such difficult topics as the first few we!  eks, suicide, death of a child, when a body isn't found, children and grief, funerals and rituals, physical effects, homicide, depression and many others.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book on death, grief and loss. Sooner or later death will touch everyone's life. We may not all react the same but most will experience the stages of loss and grief from denial to acceptance. It can be a long often agonizing and lonely road to recovery. Sadly the impact of loss and death can leave many with a loss of their own will to live.<P>This book does an excellent job of addressing a topic that most people choose not to address until they are directly confronted. I am an author of a children's book on death/loss/grief titled "ANGEL STACEY" and I personally know the impact on the loss of a spouse and raising young children who have lost a parent. This book is for the adult who struggles with their own feelings of loss and often has other family members to consider and to console.<P>Grief has a tendency to creep up in the odd hours of the day and the night and can be overwhelming to those experiencing loss. To have a title, a book that you can reach out and grab at any hour offers comfort. I wish this title had been available sooner as it often was a book that comforted and calmed me most during my own deep dark hours of despair.<P>Written from knowledge and from a place of understanding and guidance is sure to make this book a winner and a timeless treasure for anyone who has known a deep loss. It cannot take the pain and hurt away but it will help in the knowlege that those feelings are normal. Also that others have experienced the same and made it back to a seemingly normal existence. Death changes lives and changes people forever, many will grow and change for the better. I was never so humble and in essence never so pure and so good as I was immediately following the loss of my first husband and later the loss of my oldest daughter. It was only later with the anger and ultimately acceptance that I found myself once again on level ground. Death or loss can uproot your entire existence. This book is excellent and necessary.</span>

                    <span>I lost my husband, a firefighter, to 9/11. Another widower (who also lost her husband in 9/11) began a group to help other widowers. One of the first things she did was purchase hundreds of copies of this book and distribute them to all of us (they covered this on the local news). At first I didn't read the book, but after a few months I began to fumble through it. It brought so much comfort. Losing a soul mate to a tragedy is brings undescribable pain--you can only understand if you have gone through it. Pam's ability to accurately explore and relate to that topic helped me very much. Both authors have survived tragedy and they don't promise quick-fixes, but a path to move toward healing. There is opportunity for relflection, growth and incorporating our loss into our life as we move forward. In the past few years, I have continued to buy more books on bereavement and healing, but this is the book I always come back to. I keep it by my bedside. I always keep a couple copies on hand to give to friends, too.</span>

                    <span>The death of a loved one is always an emotionally difficult experience. When it comes suddenly and unexpectedly it is even more difficult. In "I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye" the authors take you through the grieving process as well as learning how to deal with such a tragic loss. The first part of the book deals with issues from how to survive the first few weeks to understanding the emotional and physical aspects of grief to dispelling myths about the grieving process. <P>The second part is mainly the sharing of the stories of various people who have experienced the sudden loss of a loved one. The stories include the loss of a friend, a parent, a child, a partner, and a sibling. This section examines the various related problems that sometimes exist as a result of a loss. For example, losing a partner but having surviving children, dealing with a suicide, and the difficulties of couples surviving the loss of a child are all discussed. <P>The third section discusses some of the pathways that people take through grief. Of particular importance is that is clearly dispels the myth that we all have a particular pathway that we use to move on past a loss. Each one of us is different and we all have our ways of dealing with grief. What may take one person six months to recover from may take another ten years, some may cry, some may not, some may experience forgetfulness, some may not, we are all different. <P>Throughout the book the authors discuss how to be a helpful friend for those who are going through the grieving process. The book finishes with a listing of support and resource contacts. For those dealing with the loss of a loved one, or for those who want to help someone who is, this is a highly recommended read.</span>

                    <span>This book addresses a very important issue -- the sudden death of a loved one. As it is one of few books that deal with this issue, it will be of interest to many who grieve over such a loss. I wish, however, that there were a more focused treatment of the topic than these authors provide. Also, the huge number of grammatical and punctuation errors were distracting.</span>

                    <span>While reading the various first-hand accounts was helpful at times, I found myself put off by the author's frequent references to mediums, psychics, and "dream communication." I realize some people believe in this kind of stuff, but for me personally its just another form of escapism, and right now I'm trying to get back on track after the devastating loss of my mother. I don't think its helpful to try to convince myself that I can somehow communicate with her again. My dreams of my mother are my mind dealing with this loss, and I can welcome them and appreciate them without turning it into some delusion of actual contact with the "afterlife." That said, there was comfort to be taken from the stories of the losses experienced by others. It was good to be reminded that I'm not the only one going thru this, and I'm not crazy, just going thru a natural grieving process. I'm not sorry I read this book, but perhaps I would have checked it out from the library, as opposed to purchasing it. Surprisingly, the book I'm benefitting the most from is "Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames" by Thich Nhat Hanh. Its not specifically geared to healing after the loss of a loved one, but the techniques and philosophy are applicable and beneficial.</span>
