                <span id="Label1">According to most accounts, the man solely responsible for reviving the modern Olympic Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin.  Now, in <I>The Modern Olympics</I>, David C. Young challenges this view, revealing that Coubertin was only the last and most successful of many contributors to the dream of the modern Olympics.  <P>Based on thirteen years of research in previously neglected documents, Young reconstructs the fascinating and almost unknown history of the Olympic revival movement in the nineteenth century, including two long-forgotten Olympiads--one in London in 1866 and another in Athens in 1870. He traces the idea for the modern Olympics back to an obscure Greek poet in 1833 and follows the sinuous tale to a small village in England, where W. P. Brookes held local Olympiads, founded the British Olympic Committee, and told Coubertin about his vision of an international Olympics.  <P>Coubertin's main contribution to the founding of the modern Olympics was the zeal he brought to transforming an idea that had evolved over decades into the reality of Olympiad I and all the Olympic Games held thereafter.</span>

                    <span>It's taken as an article of faith that until Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a brainwave in the early 1890s, no one had thought of putting on an Olympic Games in over a thousand years. Not so. de Coubertin, to use Sir Isaac Newton's phrase, stood on the shoulders of giants.<P> Chief among those giants was William Penny Brookes, of Much Wenlock, Shropshire, England. From this obscure town, Brookes, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, began an Olympic movement (the games he founded still exist). David C. Young tracks Brookes, and the games (once national in scope) he founded, and Brookes' contacts with and inspiration of de Coubertin.<P> Young also traces the Athens games, long forgotten, which predated 1896, and another giant, Evangelis Zappas, who gave money and energy to put on these games.<P> Young also traces the struggle to put on the 1896 Athens games, and gives us a blow by blow account of those games themselves--at which de Coubertin was little thanked. He also gives us a brief, but interesting explanation of why the 1906 Intercalary Olympic Games took place in Athens, and their contribution to the Olympic movement, which in many ways exceeded those of the other early Olympics.<P> Young sheds light on the background of the modern Olympics, and on figures too long forgotten.<P> Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded in 1894 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. The first President of the IOC was D. Vikelas.<P>This book shatters the myth that Baron Pierre de Coubertin was solely responsible for the re-establishment of the Olympic Games in the 19th Century. Coubertin was one of many who contributed to the re-establishment of the Olympic Games but most notably: Soutsos (poet), Zappas (philanthropist and founder of the Olympic revival in Greece), Dr Brookes (founder of the Olympic revival in the United Kingdom) and Vikelas (first President of the IOC).<P>The author documents a history of the Olympic revival and describes the national Olympic Games held in Athens, Greece (the Zappas Games) and in Much Wenlock, Shropshire (United Kingdom) in the mid-1800s. He traces the ideals for the revival of the Ancient Greek Olympics to poems published by the Greek poet Soutsos in the early 1800s.<P>The author gives properly referenced evidence that Coubertin was inspired by Dr Brookes and documents how the first modern national Olympics were held in Athens and in Much Wenlock.<P>The first modern international Olympics was held in Athens in 1896 after the establishment of the International Olympic Committee.<P>Highly recommended book. The only book that I have read that has made a real effort to record the facts on Modern Olympic history in the 19th Century. Very interesting and very easy to read.</span>
