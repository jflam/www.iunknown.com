                    <span>For years I too toiled in the rank and file of the Public School system to learn to write with clarity, proper grammar, and the ability to grab my readers by their collective eyeballs and yank them into my thoughts. The techniques described in this magnificent compilation of photographs, and an authors description of each, serve as 'case studies' for great writing using the same techniques the book elaborates at the beginning. Could have used this my sophomore year...glad it is here today.</span>

                    <span>Let me begin by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the Wizard of Ads trilogy. I found them inspirational, educational, and fascinating to read. I noticed a drastic improvement in my writing techniques because of them. This book, however, I did not enjoy very much. The opening chapters are reprints of ones in the previous books followed by pages of photos with submitted stories behind them. While some of the captions were great to read, I found myself quickly bored and never quite made it to the end. I purchased the book under the assumption that it was in same genre of the trilogy rather than a coffee table book- which, admittedly was my mistake- but it just wasn't for me. On a positive note, having an example of the techniques never hurt anyone; and all the proceeds go to charity.</span>

                    <span>A total waste of money! I believed the subtitle of this book: "... Techniques..." There are no valuable or original techniques here, and next to no explanations about how to write.<P>If you're looking for how-to on writing, DO NOT get this book.</span>

                    <span>If you haven't read a book by the Wizard yet, you really should. Once you start reading you'll never want to stop. It covers some of the concepts that exist in the other Wizard of Ads books such as "Seussing" "Being Monet" and "Frosting" as well as more concepts and then a plethora of "literary snapshots" to accompany black and white photographs. It is not only another book I wouldn't want to live without for information purposes but it also manages to stir up creativity and emotions through the writing. It also reminds me of a magazine I once had a subscription to, The Sun....</span>

                    <span>We each harbour amazing talents, including the ability to write as profoundly as the contributing authors to Accidental Magic. Roy H. Williams is a gifted teacher, who shows us how to reveal this talent, and how to apply communications techniques to create written word magic. This is truly a delightful book - at home on the coffee table and in corporate libraries. Both instructional and entertaining, I guarantee one read won't be enough. How I wish I knew Roy Williams, or read his books 40 years ago!</span>
