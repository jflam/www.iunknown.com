                    <span>Reads like stereo instructions. Too many technical graphics terms for a novice photo editor. I usually like the "for dummies" books but this one falls way short of the mark. I would recomend this book only to a seasoned graphic artist that was already familiar with the terminology.</span>

                    <span>I have always loved the Dummies Series and I will continue to purchase these informative books in the future; However, if you are not familliar with Photoshop to begin with, it's not the best choice. 
<br />
<br />A lot of the book refers back to previous editions of Photoshop, but the authors swing from one side to another - either thinking that the reader is using a computer for the very first time, or have just purchased 7.0 as an upgrade. 
<br />
<br />There is no middle ground for folks who have a solid computer background but just need to know what all the Photoshop options and icons do. Way too much of one chapter is dedicated to changing how the main screen is configured.
<br />
<br />I would say anyone who is a complete computer novice, yet managed to have moderate usage of the previous PhotoShop versions should benefit from this book.
<br />
<br />(And I hate it when authors offer to give a hint, but only if you purchase their OTHER book...)</span>

                    <span>According to the authors the RAW file format is mainly for use in transferring graphics between Apple and PC computers and loses a great deal of detail. In other words they wrote a book about Photoshop CS but they know little if anything about the subject.</span>

                    <span>In some parts they assume to much, it misses steps or suddenly introduces new words out of nowhere as if you knew the program. The other thing that its not visual at all, a ton of things could have been explained much easier and faster using visuals. <br> <br>I mean I did find it useful but probably because I read it all, however it was kind of annoying how they tend to forget who their audience is.</span>
