                    <span>Can poetry replace religion as an object of personal "faith"? Wallace Stevens thought so, and in this collection of exquisitely crafted poems he attempted to show us how. This collection contains many of his most famous pieces including the much anthogized "The Snow Man", "Fabliau of Florida", Anecdote of the Jar" and "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Balckbird", as well as, his most famous (anthologized) poem "Sunday Morning".<BR><BR><BR>In many ways the intensely focused vision and complex word play that Stevens employed, which aimed at breaking down the Western metaphysical binary between word and thing, in his poetry is representative of the deeply complect nature of his poetic vision. While not only breaking new ground in form and voice, Stevens, in these poems, sought to promulgate a view of poetry as deeply subjective and personal as our contact with the world and Nature itself. As Stevens himself later explained, his poetry was meant to represent "not Ideas, but the things themselves".<BR><BR><BR>The Snow Man, for example, can be read as a mediatation on death and its place in the natural part of the unending cycles of being. Although, not a new idea, the way Stevens frames it, through his highly complex use of such simple language, brought to bear by the implied interrelationships of the individual words at play, introduces the idea of Gaia to the discourse of modernity. Thus, to understand and experience connection with the world itself requires the abandonment of irrational, socialized fears and a willingness to accept death as a natural outcome of life, without deference to hopeful dogma and superstition.<BR><BR> <BR>As "The Snow Man" illustrates, the message that Stevens tries to impart, through the transformation of language from mere linguistic signifiers into "real" referential elements grounded in reality--in brute being--is simply to force the reader to realize that the same action can be enacted in our individual interactions with each other and the world. Through metaphor and complex word play Stevens shows that the very metaphors that we all live by, simply shroud the apathetic reality that surrounds us all--something that some are just not willing to face. Thus, in a way Stevens poetry, through a redoubling of signification falls back upon itself and reveals that the world and the word are merely one and that neither takes precedence over the other, both mutually informs and defines the other, but only we, through our harmonium with the world, allow them to do so. Otherwise, we simply continue to delude ourselves and fail to see the actual things that lie in the ideas themselves.</span>

                    <span>It has been said many times that Wallace Stevens is one of the five best and most influential American poets. After reading this collection of poems it is impossible to disagree. It is a marvelous experience to pick up this book and read a few poems.</span>

                    <span>Wallace Stevens is a god! If you don't know him than there is definately something wrong with you. Have your head examined. Then, buy this book. It is an excellent compilation of Stevens's great work. If you don't like him than you are a caveman with a shallow brainpan, and I just don't like you. What a wonderful poet. He really really is just a wonderful poet.</span>

                    <span>Our Modernist Master. THE poet of the age, of any age, really. More soulful and jazz-happy than any Slam(e) Poete out stalking the cafes. A chirping metaphysical mind with all the right rhythms setting new tones. <P>Unfortunately, you'll have to buy Opus Posthumous for some of the really great rare stuff.<P>But here!: "The Snow Man", "To the One of Fictive Music", "Re-Statement of Romance", "Examination...", "The Revolutionists..."<P>What a Figure of very capable imagination!</span>

                    <span>The poetry of Wallace Stevens as found in this most harmonious compendium is almost as inexhaustible as Shakespeare. There are times when he is as oblique within his traditional cadences as Emily Dickinson, but like that same poet, the words coruscate and are not cliches. What poet of sixteen, learning what poetry is, wouldn't benefit from a memorization of "Le Monocle de Mon Oncle," or of parts of "Sunday Morning"?<P>Wallace Stevens begins in the tropics and ends in the cold north; his two seasons as a poet are summer and winter; in both climates, he excels. Witness the formidable achievement of Crispin's voyages ("The Comedian as the Letter C") for Stevens in summer, and later poems in blank couplets such as "No Possum, No Sop, No Taters" for Stevens in winter. In between, there is the marvelous tapestry of controlled whimsy and exquisitely orchestrated anarchy of "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction" where we have everything but the kitchen sink (caparisoned elephants, a flag whacking at the halyards, the President ordaining the bee to be immortal).<P>We all know "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird"; we might profit by reacquainting ourselves with "Academic Discourse at Havana," "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," "The Auroras of Autumn," "The Dove in the Belly," and (forgive us if we do not record the full title, with its wince-worthy epithet, of the truly splendid sequence of small but glittering poems) "Like Decorations in a Cemetery."<P>These poems really should slay the thoughtless notion that the pentameter is an insurmountable restriction for the modern poet, because we see that a poet who is hampered by such an alleged "difficulty" is really no poet at all. (It was Mr Cummings who said that no poet should venture vers libre until he has mastered the old cadences, stanzas, & forms.) We really must ask ourselves if the more facile modes of composition are necessarily improvements over these (or any) lines by Wallace Stevens:<P>"Panache upon panache, his tails deploy / Upward and outward, in green-vented forms, / His tip a drop of water full of storms."<P>Or the pasage in "Of Modern Poetry" where we see the actor (poet) as "A metaphysician in the dark [...] twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses." Or yet again:<P>The old seraph, parcel-gilded, among violets<P>Inhaled the appointed odor, while the doves<P>Rose up like phantoms from chronologies. <P>An anthologist of poetry once called Wallace Stevens's universe "solipsistic"; but we demur at this term. It is evident that, in spite of the occasional impenetrability of meaning, the discursus without destination or the "description without place," the missing gist or multitude of gists, the ideas hiding almost successfully behind a glitter-glatter of joy in the sounds of the words themselves, Wallace Stevens had a lifelong conversation with reality that helped to compose these marvelous concertos of the supra-quotidian. His "pick of ebon, pick of halcyon" rarely failed him as he plucked his antique string in an accord of repetition. There is sometimes a surfeit of color, an impression that the poems (however elegant) are all "surface," and the tone can sometimes oppress; but this oppression, if possible, is salutary. Always in evidence, however, is a mind at work on the language, making an ineluctable music, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, consistently if not invariably enchanting:<P>. . . words of the sea,<P>Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,<P>And of ourselves and of our origins,<P>In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.</span>
