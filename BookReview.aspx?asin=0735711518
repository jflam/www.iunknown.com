                <span id="Label1">Attention, Web writers! This book will show you how to craft prose that grabs your guests' attention, changes their attitudes, and convinces them to act. You'll learn how to make your style fast, tight, and scannable. You'll cook up links that people love to click, menus that mean something, and pages of text that search engines rank high. You'll learn how to write great Web help, FAQs, responses to customers, marketing copy, press releases, news articles, e-mail newsletters, Webzine raves, or your own Web resume. Case studies show real-life examples you can follow. No matter what you write on the Web, you'll see how to personalize, build communities, and burst out of the conventional with your own honest style.</span>

                    <span>Contents<BR>This book examines the subject of writing for the web, and how it differs from writing for hard-copy media. <P>The book is divided into the following chapters:<P>Part 1 - Catch The Net Spirit - Who Am I Writing For, And Incidentally, Who Am I?; What Kind Of Thing Am I Creating?; What Will The Web Do To My Text?; Attention!<P>Part 2 - Write Like A Human Being - Idea #1: Shorten That Text; Idea #2 - Make Text Scannable; Idea #3: Cook Up Hot Links; Idea #4: Build Chunky Paragraphs; Idea #5 - Reduce Cognitive Burdens; Idea #6 - Write Menus That Mean Something<P>Part 3 - Fine-Tune Your Style For The Genres - Writing In A Genre; Creating Customer Assistance That Actually Helps; Persuading Niche Markets, Individuals, And The Press; Making News That Fits; Entertaining People Who Like To Read; Getting A Job<P>Part 4 - Become A Pro - So You Wannabe A Web Writer Or Editor<P>Part 5 - Backup - Writerly Sites; If You Like To Read<P>Review<BR>On the surface, you may think that writing is writing, regardless of the medium. You may think that if you can write a 2500 word article for a magazine, that you can successfully use that same style for web sites. And unfortunately, you'd be wrong. The mindset of online writing is completely different than for print, and this book will help you to understand that.<P>People read books and magazines for many reasons, but often it's to be entertained or to learn about a subject in depth. But when people visit web sites, it's usually to find an answer quickly. The reader wants to find the chunk of information they seek and then move on. If they don't see what they think they want, it's off to another site. The authors do an excellent job in this book breaking down the content structure of web writing. To successfully write for the web, you need to organize your information in discrete chunks that can be quickly linked to or scanned for applicable information. They show you how to effectively structure your writing by the use of shorter paragraphs, lists, bullets, external links, and a number of other techniques that will allow your ideas to flourish in an online medium.<P>The tone of their writing is conversational and easy, without the academic lecturing that often shows up in books where opinion and fact can blur together. They also use a lot of "before/after" examples to show you how the techniques actually work. I was actually surprised that I liked the book as much as I did. Many books on web site design go off on "expert rants" in which the author presents his likes/dislikes as expert opinion. Although some of the information in this book could fall into the same category, there wasn't the strident tone that often happens in other books.<P>Conclusion<BR>Writing for the web entails different skills than writing for print medium. This book will help you understand the issues involved and to make a successful transition to online authoring. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>Hot Text is a veritable gold mine of brilliant information for the web content professional. It is very comprehensive and full of practical tips and focused advice. As I read it I had my pen out and was underlining lots of quotes that I have since used in my presentations. <P>Hot Text is written in a warm, friendly and direct manner. I always hate it when people try to be pretentious in their writing, but Hot Text is the very opposite. Jonathan and Lisa Price are passionate and extremely knowledgeable about what they do - and it shows!</span>

                    <span>An excellent book that points out the differences between digital media and paper media. I especially learned a lot in Chapter 3 - What Will the Web Do to My Text? But there is much throughout the entire book. You'll learn about writing in general and writing for the web in particular. And from the web you'll go to email, ezines, enewsletters, weblogs and the gamut. If you're going to write for the web you need this book.</span>

                    <span>I grow weary of reading the books on this subject. So many are poorly written or have very little to offer. This book is one of the better ones. It combines some useful copywriting advice with usability advice. And the two really do go together. You can't know one without learning the other or you only do half your job as a creative.<P>I do think, however, that the book is written in a style that is rather confusing and unappealing. I think this comes from the authors trying to be all things to all people.<P>But this book hits on topics that the lesser books such as Net Words fail to cover. In their zest to get to market and gain new clients, those authors write lots of puff and little meat.<P>Hot Text offers the meat. So if you only buy one book on online copywriting and usability, make it this one. It doesn't cover everything but it gives you the basic background and the knowledge to do a good job on creating a useful Web site.<P>This book is suited for beginners or more experienced people who write for the web or would like to. But it is better suited for those with very little experience or who want a reminder of what works and what doesn't. <P>Those with a lot of experience will quickly do a read-through and pick up a few good ideas and be done with it. But even that is worth the cost of the book.<P>I highly recommend this book to those people who need the information the most.<P>Susanna K.
