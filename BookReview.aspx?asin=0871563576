                <span id="Label1">What makes Rowell one of the world's top photojournalists and sets him apart from others in the field? Steve Werner, editor of <i>Outdoor Photographer</i>, says the magazine's most popular columnist pursues his art the way a mountain climber pursues a peak: "planning the logistics, overcoming the hardships and conquering the unknown." The text, based on Rowell's monthly column for the magazine, is accompanied by images "chosen to illustrate concepts" rather than exhibit his best work -- or so he claims.  Don't believe him; the pictures will blow you out of the water as surely as a well-placed stick of dynamite.</span>

                    <span>The book is great. Rowell's essays are very informative, fun to read, and give a lot of insight into the world of adventure photography. However, the binding from Sierra Club Books is terrible. I'm halfway through the book and the glue came apart, leaving me with hundreds of loose pages. This is especially frustrating since I planned to use the book as a reference, frequently re-reading and looking up pertinent information.</span>

                    <span>I've read thousands and thousands of books of all types, and this is my favorite one of all-time.  This converted me into being a Galen Rowell fan.  The photos were great as usual, but what got me was his writing.  He is an amazing author!  I have learned so much from his writings, and I still learn everytime I re-read the book.  He is funny and in addition to being intelligent.  His passion comes across clearly in this book.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, and you'd probably become a photographer afterwards.</span>

                    <span>It cannot be helped ... I'm partial to Rowell ... have been, ever since I started serious photography in '89 ... His photographs have always left me in awe ...<p>So you can imagine my surprise, when I found myself reading the words with as much care as I was looking at the photos ... Rowell carefully describes his preparations, his thoughts and preferences ... he writes as he photographs ... in a direct manner, with few affectations and no gimmicks ... The reader learns not so much about f-stops or apertures, but is introduced into the mind set of an adventurer, an exceptional photographer ... whose approach to image making is both pragmatic and inspirational ... the photographs are more instructional than usual ... but an exceptionally good read!</span>

                    <span>If you wish to become an active, thoughtful photographer, one who is conscientious about seeing, especially from another point of view, and you are willing to take the time and effort to get a shot, this book is for you. <p>Galen Rowell's essays are richly entwined with clear strands of philosophical, technical, and artistic perspectives. <p>Like Galen has done most of his life--explore and adventure--the book is an exploration of inner and outer realms. Throughout the 60 essays, we explore the outer, physical world, as well as the inner thoughtful and emotional world that accompanies aesthetic photography. <p>Galen becomes our guide as he shows us new pathways of exploring photography. We learn to think about creating visual order out of chaos. We see the relationship between thoughtful preparation and capturing an image. While commonsense techniques are suggested, we learn to validate old technology as well as recent innovations. We are apprised of ethical issues when shooting. And most important (for me) we explore the resonance between spirit, content, and form through photography.<p>This book, with its exquisite images and stories behind them, will likely help you see better, become more contemplative as a photographer, and encourage you to capture that which you see with greater emotional integrity and technical competence.</span>

                    <span>Galen's book offers the novice and experienced photographer inspiration and "common-sense" advice about observing our world.  He articulately describes how he does not merely use his view finder to see,  but how he becomes involved in his subject.  I have seldom read such a  superbly crafted book.</span>
