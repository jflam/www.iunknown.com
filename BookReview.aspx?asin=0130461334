                    <span>I agree with everybody that's been questioning the title of "For Experienced Programmers." As a college student studying computer science, the intro chapters covering C# basics (like variables and control structures) seem pretty redundant for anybody that's ever programmed before. After these initial chapters, however, this book shines. It does a very good job of covering both the syntax of C# and the libraries of the .NET framework. The chapters on ASP.NET and ADO.NET are very good introductions to topics that (if one is serious about learning them) require a whole book to teach. If you don't mind a couple redundant chapters, this is a great book to learn C# from.</span>

                    <span>I agree with several of the reviewers here who state that this book is not really meant for experienced programmers. The first few chapters, including section 1.2 "History of the Internet and World Wide Web" are REALLY not necessary. <P>There's a nice intro to the IDE, but you can get that from the Tutorials that come with Visual Studio .NET. The chapters on control structures, methods, object-based programming, etc. could be covered by putting them in a section simply showing the syntax. An experienced programmer, especially one coming from C++ or Java should already understand the basics. <P>I was really looking for much more in-depth information that I was able to obtain from this book. It's probably good for beginning programmers, or those who have not programmed in C++ or Java before, as it does cover the beginning topics well. <P>Despite the fact that the book isn't named well - the examples are very good (as they are in most Deitel books).</span>

                    <span>I had my doubts when I saw this book. In my experience huge tombs like this contain more fluff then value. But on looking at the topics covered and of course the title I thought I'd give it a try. Didn't take long to realize that it was a waste of time. As my title states this book attempts to cover more than is wanted or necessary.</span>

                    <span>As a professional VB developer of 10 years I was looking for a decent book that would get me started on the .NET enviornment. I chose C# as my programming language so that I could switch between C# and Java later on if need be. This book is a good book that takes you from a refresher course in basic C(#) syntax, OO concepts and brings you into the world of .Net programming. It touches almost every aspect that someone would need to know to be an "intermediate skilled developer in C#". This book is for those who have basic programming background and want to get into C# programming with .Net. Touches ADO.Net ASP.Net, Web Services, Multithreading, Networking. The appendix ranges from A-N and covers a wide range of topics. Overall a good book and I am pleased with it.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a Wrox Professional book, but alas, they were no more. <P>This book attracted me with the promise of 'no introductory material' and so I bought it.<P>Four chapters later I was still skimming deep stuff like 'how to save a file in the IDE' and why an IDE is a good thing.<P>I skipped to a chapter near the back with an interesting title, but it was not much better there. <P>I can't really review the whole book because I didn't read the whole thing. I had already wasted my money and too much time, so I didn't want to waste any more.<P>This MAY be a good book for rank beginners - plenty of introduction and exposition with a slow, deliberate pace - but if you have ever written a 'hello world' in any language then this is not the book for you.</span>
