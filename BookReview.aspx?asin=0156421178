                <span id="Label1">"I wonder what is the appropriate first action when you come from a country at war and set foot on peaceful soil. Mine was to rush to the tobacco-kiosk and buy as many cigars and cigarettes as I could stuff into my pockets." Most war correspondents observe wars and then tell stories about the battles, the soldiers and the civilians. George Orwell--novelist, journalist, sometime socialist--actually traded his press pass for a uniform and fought against Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War during 1936 and 1937. He put his politics and his formidable conscience to the toughest tests during those days in the trenches in the Catalan section of Spain. Then, after nearly getting killed, he went back to England and wrote a gripping account of his experiences, as well as a complex analysis of the political machinations that led to the defeat of the socialist Republicans and the victory of the Fascists.</span>

                    <span>Orwell's very satisfying account of his days as a Trotskyist dogface offers much insight into the Spanish Civil War. The heart of politics is crossed with the everday life as a volunteer soldier in someone else's war. Orwell, the committed socialist, finds much disillusionment in Stalinist Communism and explains its danger quite thoroughy. The Spanish Civil-War was a seminal act in the course of the 20th Century. A must read for any political officiando.</span>

                    <span>In addition to being a book about the experience of an infantry man in the Spanish Civil War, this is also a book about the nature of politics and political parties. Orwell doesn't hold anything back when he discusses his disgust at the Fascist party of Franco, as well as the fabricated lies of the Communist press, and the ignorance of the French and English media. His political analysis is quite intriguing in that it provides the reader with an historical context in which to examine the key players who would be involved in another conflict only a couple years later. The Spanish Civil War serves as an exciting background to the Second World War which is right around the corner.<BR>This is a vivid account of the life of a soldier. Orwell doesn't over dramatize situations; rather he tends to maintain a realistic style throughout this work. In addition, Orwell successfully intertwines humor with suspense as he recounts his brushes with death. In this book, Orwell examines the moral and physical experience of a man at war. His literary style resembles that of Remarque in his book All Quiet on the Western Front. Writing an engaging account from the first person point of view makes the account more authentic.</span>

                    <span>Unlike 1984 or Animal Farm there is a constant upbeat current in this revealing account of his participation in the Spanish Civil War. Although a very political affair, Orwell's participation is not tied to the tenets of one particular party as much as his desire to do good in the world by helping to stop Fascism. So he brings his wife to Spain, enlists in the militia, is sent to the front, wounded, chased by the police, engaged in street fighting gun battles between different political parties that are on the same side of the war. An amazing account so very well told. There is a chapter in the middle that has to do with the complexities of the political parties at the time, at the very end of the previous chapter Orwell writes that if you are not interested in the politics to skip the chapter, so I skipped the chapter, preferring to stay with the adventure story. It is an adventure story, a war story, a comedy, a sad tragedy, but heartfelt and so real. Great book if you like good writing, or war stories, or politics or Spain. Above all, a well told story made more interesting that when Orwell finishes he is still assuming Franco would be defeated, which was not the case at all.</span>

                    <span>I was put off Orwell at an early age by reading 1984 and Animal Farm, both of which I found terribly depressing. Thirty years later, I finally got around to reading 'Homage to Catalonia' and I wish I hadn't waited so long because it is absolutely fascinating. Orwell's account of fighting on the front line during the war is really reamrkable. It is astonishing to earn what an absolute shambles the war was, with soldiers armed with hopleessly antiquated weapons. The Republican and Nationalist front lines were so far apart that most of the time they can't even fire at each other, being too far apart to score a hit, so they are reduced to shouting propoganda at each other through megaphones. I had no idea Orwell could be funny, at times reading this book is like reading a scenario for a farcical comedy. You get a good sense of the privations and squalor of life in the front line, also, surprisingly, the cold (it had honestly never occured to me that Spain was ever cold). There is an incredibly vivivd description of how Orwell felt when he got shot in action. Away from the front, Orwell is shocked to discover that the Republicans seem to be more interested in fighting each other than the Nationalists. The Communists begin to act vindictively towards the Trotskyists and members of POUM, the organisation under whose banner Orwell had fought. He describes his horror as he sees men who had given up everything to go and fight for the Republic, treated as criminals by the Republican army. There is a very funny scene where he describes how his hotel room is searched by police looking for evidence of subversive activity. they search the room for about an hour, looking everywhere, but they never touch the bed, because his wife is lying in it, even though,as Orwell reflects, there could be a ton of Trotskyist literature under the pillow, and machine guns under the mattress. Hilarious in parts, heartbreaking in others, this is an unforgettable book.</span>

                    <span>Ever wonder what it is like be shot right through the neck? Ever wonder what it is like to stare over open sights at an enemy soldier with his pants down (literally) relieving himself? Would you shoot? Ever wonder what it is like to fight with allies that may be as worse than the common enemy? <P>Orwell experienced all of this and more as a member of one of the more obscure Spanish militias fighting for the Spanish Republic during the bloody internecine Spanish Civil War. He also became incredibly dissillusioned in the process. Finding his beliefs in revolutionary socialism, he was already jaded by communism and the cynical use it was put to serve Stalin's interests. He opted for a more loose organisation and therefore choose to enroll with the Anarcho-Syndicalists as a foreign volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. His particular group was called the POUMists (an acronym that I need not summarize here). <P>Ill-equipped and with no training, they showed what raw idealism can do against Franco and his fascist oppression -- they stopped fascism cold on the battle field and were never found wanting in terms of courage. What did defeat them was the United Front launched by the Cominterm against International Fascism. For those that did not tow the line, Stalin's advisors and compadours inside the Spanish Communist Party sacrificed. Denied weapons, ammunition and food, the coalition --- made up a broad spectrum of liberal-democrats, progressives, socialists, communists, anarchists (and every shade between) --- were defeated in piece-meal battles. Orwell was shaped and scarred by the experience. Although always a social progressive, he realised that idealism in its most extreme forms could be as bad as the fascism one was fighting against. This shaped his eternal mistrust of Communism (but not as some rightist's bizaarly claim, push him into being some kind of conservative demigod).<P>This book has it all: a trenchent analysis of political history, a serious war biography, a good slice of military narrative, and a chronicle of idealist growth, development and abandoning of a former way of thinking... <P>Without a doubt one of my top 5 war biographies and one of the top 25 reads of my entire life, so far....</span>
