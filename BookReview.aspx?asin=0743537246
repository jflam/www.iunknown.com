                    <span>I have had a hard time in the past listening to Debbie Ford because her voice is a little boring, but this time I just pictured her as my girlfriend on Prozac sitting across the table from me and we got along great. After just a few minutes you pick up on her genuineness and feel her emotions as she relates her personal story.  She hit upon insights to the past and how the bad things have gone on to create good things in our present self.  I nearly fell over with a revelation about me, after one of her meditations.  I have since purchased this set for three  friends and each one has said the same thing, it is lifechanging.

                    <span>Ford is at the top of the "self-help" gurus ... she humbly shares her "story" with us which allows us to embrace our own and know that we are not alone. These CD's have helped me let go of who I thought I was to embrace who I want to be. Thanks Debbie Ford! You are an inspiring powerful woman!</span>

                    <span>This audio program helped me take one of the most difficult experiences I've gone through in a long time and turn it into a pathway to healing. I was continually amazed and inspired by the material, the exercises, and Debbie's loving presence. I used the program at a time when I was experiencing some depression and found that it not only helped me shift out of that, but it helped me make peace with my past and get inspired about my future.  The best $30 you could possibly spend.  Buy it, make the time for it, and do it.</span>

                    <span>That's what I found from this incredibly deep and experiential CD series.  
<br />
<br />This program allowed me to understand and untangle the dramas that I create, but more importantly I now have many tools to transcend my limited story.  
<br />
<br />This CD series is like a transformational workshop that you can do from the privacy of your own home or car.  I just loved it!</span>

                    <span>Save your money. There are far better avenues for inspiration and hope than this insipid series of cd's. Perhaps if the message weren't delivered by the author, then it might be easier to listen to her tale of woe and redemption. As it is, Debbie Ford's voice drones on in a monotone that is close to unbearable. </span>
