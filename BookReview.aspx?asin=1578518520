                <span id="Label1">The Growth Paradox  <P>At best one company in ten is able to sustain profitable growth. Yet capital markets demand that all companies seek it relentlessly and mercilessly punish those who fail. Why is consistent, persistent growth so difficult to achieve? Surprisingly, it&#146;s not for lack of great ideas or capable managers, nor is it because customers are too fickle or innovation too unpredictable. Innovation fails, say Clayton M. Christensen and Michael E. Raynor, because organizations unwittingly strip the disruptive potential from new ideas before they ever see the light of day.   <P>In his worldwide bestseller The Innovator&#146;s Dilemma, Christensen explained how industry leaders get blindsided by disruptive innovations precisely because they focus too closely on their most profitable customers and businesses. The Innovator&#146;s Solution shows how companies get to the other side of this dilemma, creating disruptions rather than being destroyed by them.   <P>Drawing on years of in-depth research and illustrated by company examples across many industries, Christensen and Raynor argue that innovation can be a predictable process that delivers sustainable, profitable growth. They identify the forces that cause managers to make bad decisions as they package and shape new ideas&#151;and offer new frameworks to help managers create the right conditions, at the right time, for a disruption to succeed. The Innovator&#146;s Solution addresses a wide range of issues, including:  <P>&#149; How can we tell if an idea has disruptive potential? <BR>&#149; Which competitive situations favor incumbents, and which favor entrants? <BR>&#149; Which customer segments are primed to embrace a new offering? <BR>&#149; Which activities should we outsource, and which should we keep in-house? <BR>&#149; How should we structure and fund a new venture? <BR>&#149; How do we choose the right managers to lead it? <BR>&#149; How can we position ourselves where profits will be made in the future?  <P>Revealing counterintuitive insights that will change your perspective on innovation forever, this landmark book shows how to create a disruptive growth engine that fuels ongoing success.</span>

                    <span>This book crisply explains the meaning of disruptive innovation
<br />in business. While many of the examples of disruption are
<br />technological innovations, many other examples are
<br />not technological. Nor are the technological examples all
<br />high technology.
<br />
<br />The authors go on to explain why companies fail to embrace 
<br />disruptive innovation and give some advice for how 
<br />companies can change to sustain growth through disruption.
<br />Understand though that the authors admit (or claim) that no
<br />company have managed to sustain innovation through disruption
<br />across two or more CEOs.
<br />
<br />Even if you aren't in management, as an employee this
<br />book might be of use in helping you understand why your
<br />company is winning or losing, and what to look for in
<br />a future employer.</span>

<br />I was talking to a friend the other day about why major (multi-billion dollar a year) companies are not good at innovation, and he recommended this book. Wow!  Looking at the companies I know and admire, it all became clear.  Innovation *is* disruptive; the most promising marketplace is the opposite of their existing defense and intelligence clients--the people that do not get adequate intelligence support from the existing cash cow; and all of the middle and senior managers (Washington-based) are incrementalists who had succeeded at building bodies-for-hire accounts over decades. 
<br />
<br />For those who feel an intuitive faith in disruptive endeavors, this book is inspiring and also instructional.  It specifically suggests that entrants will beat incumbents when the objective is to substitute lower-cost good-enough solutions for client needs that are not satisfied by high end production.  However, it also makes clear that the *last* place you want to sell disruptive solutions in to is the existing high end client base.  Go for new customers and new contexts.
<br />
<br />In government intelligence terms: stop trying to teach the spies that they need to do a better job on open sources of information in 33+ languages.  Instead, go after the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and the elements of the Department of Defense that do not get adequate classified intelligence support.  Establish Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) as a viable endeavor there, and in ten years come back and crush the spies in head on competition.
<br />
<br />Three &#34;litmus tests&#34; that the authors put forward are very helpful to those seeking to monetize disruptive new ideas:
<br />
<br />1)  Is there a population of clients that has historically been under-funded, under-staffed, and have as a result *gone without*?
<br />2)  Is this group likely to appreciate lower cost &#34;good enough&#34; solutions?
<br />3)  Is it possible to be profitable while providing these clients lower cost good enough solutions (e.g. monitoring risk around the world, at the sub-state level, something the spies simply cannot do effectively despite their $50 billion a year budget)?
<br />
<br />Another major lesson I drew from this book is that alternative channels can be phenomenally successful.  One example the book uses: instead of selling low-cost throw away cameras through photography shops oriented to high-end perfectionists, move them into grocery stores and discount stores for the low-end market that could not afford a traditional camera.  This *makes sense.*  Hence, instead of trying to sell low-cost open source services to the people who think they have the most to lose from promoting them (the mandarins of the high-cost secrets), go instead to the least well-served end-users, the logisticians, acquisition managers, diplomats, etcetera, and get them to test localized rather than centralized solutions that then &#34;explode&#34; as other end-users see the low-cost success and emulate through decentralized adoption of new best practices.
<br />
<br />The last half of the book is loaded with stuff useful to how I am going to structure my relationship with any major corporation--it focuses on a number of key factors including scale, profitability over growth, proprietary end to end solutions in the beginning, transitioning rapidly to open distributed solutions at the right moment, and ensuring that the team members are *not* (NOT) incrementalist line managers that succeeded by going along within a status quo system.
<br />
<br />The following quote captures my perception of the imperfection of the guys at the top that don't get it:  &#34;In many ways, the managers that corporate executives have come to trust the most because they have consistently delivered the needed results in core businesses cannot be trusted to shepherd the creation of new growth.&#34;  (Page 183).
<br />
<br />The book goes on to discuss the conflict between the traditional processes of managing traditional businesses, the conflict between traditional business values versus those of disruptive innovators (who can tend to alienate and aggravate executives used to having life just so), and between the &#34;pace&#34; of big organizations that need 12 months to think about an opportunity, and small &#34;fleet of foot&#34; innovators that can evaluate, act, write a proposal, and win million-dollar jobs over a week-end.
<br />
<br />The authors are generally negative about business unit consolidation, and make the point that the bigger the business gets, the more process takes precedence over people.  They specifically caution against a strategy of acquisition as a means of growth, documenting the terrible toll this can take as a cash flow drain, in essence saying that really big growth cannot come from incrementalist approaches.  I put the book down with the feeling that the really big companies need to think seriously about launching spin-offs, as Charles Schwab did, and the really small companies, like mine, have a fighting shot at beating the hell out of the established beltway bandits who are too slow, too arrogant, and too rich to be serious about innovation for the future.
<br />
<br />This book made me smile, and it made me think.  Super piece of work.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books on business strategy to be published in a long time.  If you haven't read the earlier "Innovator's Dilemma", don't bother, just read this book instead.
<br />
<br />One of the most interesting discussions in this book is just the definition of a disruptive innovation.  It is not, as one might think, simply something new or technically innovative.  More importantly, the disruption is relative to the current state of the business.  In fact, the exact same innovation may be disruptive to some businesses, but sustaining for others.  For example, online retailing, though technically innovative, is not disruptive to existing catalog retailers -- it is merely a more effecient method of doing business.  However, it can be very disruptive to existing "bricks and mortar" businesses.
<br />
<br />I particularly like the academic bent to the book.  While by no means a textbook, the authors strongly emphasize that you can't just look for trends in business, and try to predict futures based on trends.  Rather, you need to create defensible, testable theory based from the trends, and only then can you start to develop a more scientific approach to strategy.
<br />
<br />For example, the authors cite popular books which champion opposite theories of vertical intergration.  Rather than blithely saying the vertical integration is good or bad, they try to develop a theory for the contexts where this makes sense, or where outsourcing is a better way to operate.
<br />
<br />All in all, this book is not the fundamental treatise on strategy that Michael Porter's seminal book is, but it is still a must read for the modern business.</span>

                    <span>This is easier to read than the Innovators Dilemma. There is a more varied range of Product and Industry case studies, which helps to show how broadly this theory can be applied. <p>What I did like is how he covers the footnotes at the end of each Chapter - so if they don't interest you, you can skip over them, but if they do interest you, then you don't have to struggle to the back of the book. I wish more authors & publishers would use that technique.<p>One quibble - given his Economics background, he suggests that having competing phone standards is not wasteful. Only an Economist would say that. A Consumer finds it frustrating. He has the good grace to suggest in a footnote that some readers might take issue with him, and I am one. He belittles the benefit of schoolgirls from Sweden using their phone on vacation in Spain, but I can vouch that being able to readily check on the safety of my teenage daughters when they're in foreign Countries for over 10% of the year is a definite benefit!<p>Given his Economics background - of course there are plenty of graphs, and 99% of them are straight lines - there are no time dependent variances in his world. Also some silly proof-reading slips, such as a "semi-log" graph being described as "semi- long".<p>Probably still worth reading the Innovators Dilemma before reading this one, just to get the theory.</span>
