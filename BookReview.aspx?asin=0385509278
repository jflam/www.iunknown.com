                    <span>I bought the book on a Sunday, read it that night.  Took the concept to the range and course the next day with a metronome,(I'm a drummer) and wow!  I had immediate and amazing results.  I already had good mechanics thanks to the Graves golf academy and single-axis golf, but I had never had tempo explained or even talked about this clearly.  It's like a light came on and all my golf toil came together in one fell swoop.  I mean truly amazing results here, people. And they were instantaneous.  I've never experienced this kind of improvement this fast with any other concept or training aid ever.  It's very simple as well.  A must read for any golfer serious about the game.</span>

                    <span>Bought this after reading the rave reviews.  Was a bit sceptical, but thought I'd give it a try.  Went to the range & did the workout, then started hitting balls.  I'm a 22 hdcp, generally have ok mechanics & occasionally put up an 85 but more likely to score 105 or so.  Hit all but 2 balls in a large bucket well.  Some slight mis-hits, but not too bad.  To the course, 96 with 41 putts and 95 with 39 putts.  The only thing I need to fix now is short game - driver is straight & long, irons crisp.  Losing strokes by hitting over the green too often... yikes!  I'd possibly ding this product a bit because the videos are not very useful & I think the material could be presented a bit better, but hey, it's like magic!</span>

                    <span>I, having played golf for 3 1/2 years and working dilligently on my game had gotten my handicap into single digits.  I was always inconsistent, never really being able to piece together a string of good rounds.  I would hit balls at the driving range, my backyard, and work on my swing any spare second that I had. 
<br />
<br />I have read 2 golf books in my life, Manuel de la Torre's Understanding the Golf Swing, which brought about marked improvement in my game and now John Novosel's Tour Tempo.  This was the missing ingredient that tied everything else together.  I was shocked and amazed, I could not believe I was hitting the ball that crisply.  I got this book in Mid-January, and since I am a basketball coach, I had not played golf since Christmas break, after working with Tour Tempo for about 5 weeks, I played a round of golf in February and shot 79.  This was amazing to me, becuase normally to get to that level, I would have had to play and practice everyday and "peak out" at that level in the summer. 
<br />
<br />Needless to say, Tour Tempo helped me tie all of the other swing mechanics together.  I believe this book will help everyone who struggles with consistency, because using the Tour Tempo tracks makes you practice consistently. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Kudos to John Novosel and John Garrity for providing golfers with empirical proof of the ideas first expressed by Ernest Jones in "Swinging Into Golf" (Robert M. Mc Bride & Company, 1946) and later refined by C.A. Macey in "Golf Through Rhythm" (C.A. Macey, Crowborough Golf Club, 1957), Robert Winthrop Adams in "Timing Your Golf Swing" (The Citadel Press, 1957) and me in "Golf's Timeless Fundamental" (ICS Books, 1997).  In "Tour Tempo" Novosel and Garrity have confirmed my proposition that there is but one "Golf Swing Rhythm" for every club and every swing.  Their research also confirms that unlike the "Golf Swing Rhythm", which is universal, "Golf Swing Tempo" varies from person to person based upon size and build.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, like many without a musical background, Novosel and Garrity confuse the terms "tempo" and "rhythm", using them interchangeably when in fact they have two very separate and distinct meanings.  Tempo refers to the overall speed of the swing or how long it takes to go from the swing's start to finish.  Rhythm, on the other hand, refers to how the total time of the swing is apportioned among the various parts of the swing.  Thus, Novosel and Garrity would have been more accurate if they had titled their book "Tour Rhythm" or "Tour Tempos" instead of "Tour Tempo".  After all, as their book suggests, there is only one rhythm whereas there are many tempos.
<br />
<br />I would have also liked them to explain the concepts of tempo and rhythm in the context of the full swing and not just the backswing and downswing through impact.  Again, this would make their work more complete, accurate and easier to understand.
<br />
<br />That said, I highly recommend "Tour Tempo" and commend Novosel and Garrity for making a significant contribution to the body of work in this area of golf.

                    <span>Aren't you tired of playing most shots at a mediocre level, playing a few REALLY bad shots, and playing some almost like the hands of God swung the club so perfectly, shooting the ball right at your target?  I know you guys/gals are smart people. And smart people will recognize that this is how most people play golf.  Then those spectacular shots get them hooked and they become a regular golf nut.  They will get a few lessons, read a few books, and maybe even buy a gimmick they saw on tv that promised them more yardage or more accuracy.  Guess what happens?  They might improve for about a month and then they are right back to where they were.  I know, because I am one of them, and so are you, probably.  
<br />
<br />Have you read all these reviews for Tour Tempo?  Guys talking about hitting the ball better than they ever have, scoring better than they ever have.  It's hard to believe isn't it?  Well go ahead and be skeptical, you should be, it's only natural.  But, read this carefully...if you are tired of leaving the course wondering what the heck it is going to take to get some consistency and play some decent golf, then you need to read this book and do what John says.  This guy is a student of the game and has studied and tested just about all of the stuff out there that you and I have seen.  I know this because I was so blown away by the effectiveness of this book that I called him up on the phone to tell him.  And he told me about himself and what makes him tick and why he wrote the book and what he has found through all his research.  This guy is for real.  But like anything new and revolutionary, there are the traditionalists who can't get away from grip, posture, etc., etc. being the answer to better golf.  And it is part of it, I agree.  But this book reveals the secret that ties it all together and produces DRAMATIC results.  
<br />
<br />All I have to tell you is that if you want to learn more about this secret, buy this book now, read it and do what John tells you to do.  It's easy and produces fast results. 
<br />
<br />But please, if you aren't willing to give yourself a chance to learn what this book can teach you, then don't buy it.  Just hope that you don't get in a money match with someone who has integrated what they learned from Tour Tempo.  But if you happen to get it and do it, I'm sure you'll agree that is the best thing to happen to your game.  It has been for me.  And I'm a low digit single handicapper already.  Buy it now and get better.    </span>
