                    <span>Lief Ericksenn has created an interesting introduction to the medium format field. Many of his pictures are excellent - especially those centering around the space program. The text is a little light, possibly designed for a beginner like myself. Still, there is a great deal of information about composition, darkroom and manufacturers. Perhaps an update to the text is in order. However, considering the number of books written on the subject, I would consider this a must-have for those interested in MF photography.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a good reference and primer for those wishing to explore the medium format world of photography. The logic and language of Ericksenn is easy to read and understand. It is obvious from his work shown, that he is a professional and earnest about this topic. Most serious photographers would not find this text challenging or "new" enough, but a novice may. Some helpful references are the scenics pictured, taken with different lenses and film sizes to demonstrate perspectives etc. Most of the information about the cameras discussed is basically correct, but much of it is dated as of this writing. Some brands of equipment are largely ignored. I found this book "okay", but then I have been deep into this hobby for decades.</span>

                    <span>While this book boasts excellent print qualities, along with top notch photo reproduction, it lacks any real information of substance. If you are looking for a book to help you learn the ins and outs of medium format, keep looking. It will not help you with the intricacies of lighting, composing for medium format vs. 35mm, or any other "important" information for the neophyte medium format photographer. I was looking for this type of book, and I was sorely disappointed after reading this title in one evening. Please Mr. Ericksenn, try again.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for the novice considering moving to medium format. Goes in to detail on available options in this format. Has some good tips and tricks. Emphasis on high end equipment like Rollei and Hasselblad. Next to nothing on Mamiya. Not a must for those already familiar with medium format equipment.</span>
