[Lopez's] book will sharpen the terms of the debate over what the Tibetans and their observers can or should be doing about the place and the idea of Tibet. And that alone is what will give us all back our Shambhala."--Jonathan Spence, <i>Lingua Franca Book Review</i><br><br>"Lopez's most important theme is that we should be wary of the idea . . . that Tibet has what the West lacks, that if we were only to look there we would find the answers to our problems.

                    <span>Lopez, Donald S. Prisoners of Shangri-la: Tibetan Buddhism and the West (University of Chicago, 1998) is a meticulous analysis of the misinformation, disinformation and fantasies promulgated by various people, well-intended and otherwise. They include charlatans like T. Lobsang Rampa, famous for having written a series in the 1950's about his "life" as a lama in Drepung monastery. Trungpa Rinpoche's psychologization of Tibetan Buddhism as exemplified by his version of the Bardo Thodol, and Leary and Alpert's psychedelic-isation of that Nyingma text, as well as Lama Sogyal's well-received edition of the same, are examined. Lopez offers an amusing look (and a fascinating one, to someone who has partaken of all these notions in her own journey of discovery) at a wide variety of topics including the notion of Tibet, itself; of that invention of the West known as Lamaism, of Tibetan art (the implication being whether there is such a thing or not), and the history of the dispute over misconceptions concerning the meaning of the six-syllable Chenresi mantra, among other subjects.<P>Of particular interest to me was the revelation of Jeffrey Hopkins's methods of teaching traditional philosophical debate at the University of Virginia. This book is an excellent complement to Stephen Batchelor's The Awakening of the West. It will be remembered that Batchelor's final chapters, in which he expressed the idea that the West could never accept Buddhism into the mainstream until concepts and language became more Westernized, created a bit of a stir.</span>

                    <span>A thought provoking and well documented look at how Tibet and its people have been reformulated by the media for the West's consumption for nearly 200 years. It's isolation has made it the victim of spiritual and political charletans selling a romantic and impossible image of it in the West, later to be followed by the total silence imposed by the Chinese as they carried out a ruthless policy of social genocide, further distorting the image of Tibet as a nation and a people.<P>Anyone interested in the future of central Asia, and that is to say Asia, China and the world itself, should read this book, as should all those currently bewitched by Tibetan Buddhism. The historical reality of Tibet has much more to offer the world, than the fairy tale we have wistfully imposed upon it.</span>

                    <span>As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not "real Tibetans" because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous.</span>

                    <span>Refreshing and insightful take on the coming of the Buddha circus to the West, with a knuckle ball twist attempting to 'deconstruct' the perceptions of Westerners on Tibet. The sudden surge of Buddhism in the Americas, with outstanding issues like, should we cede the Rockies to the Tibetans? is an historical surprise and also a puzzle of New Ages, old ages inside these New Ages, and what _is_ the New Age? In the meantime the recreation of Tibetan religion inside American culture is preposterous, yet apt, although one wonders if these forms can survive the passage. Nothing much constitutes a bed of roses and where the Buddhas point to the moon, the dark side of the force can't be far behind. As a mere trifle in this regard, the amusing out in front history of the Lobsang Rampa story/fraud, and the curiously timely appearance of this series of Instant Tibet Myths just as a public was needed for the travelling circus, makes good sixties nostalgia reading. Most kids on my block had their roller skates on with this one back when. Lobsand Rampa would have been a giveaway if it hadn't been a decoy--right? In the meantime the cultural history of the blend of Buddhism and Tibetan religion is a first class anthropological mystery story, and this survey of many of the issues is good reading. The problem is that someone decided they had to divide a subject into exoteric and esoteric versions of one and the same version, with the result that sitting ducks won't know what hit them when the time came. In the meantime the Chinese treatment of Tibet remains an outrage and one can only hope the author's strategy of demystifying Tibet to induce realism will prove successful. Interesting book with lots of good notes and leads.</span>

                    <span>This is a very unique analysis of how the idea of Tibet has been constructed by outsiders, especially those of far different Western cultures. Tibet has been described as everything from a backward haunt of crude barbarians to a paradise of pure thought and devotion. Lopez shows us that neither of these is accurate, and that Tibet is possibly the one location and culture on Earth that has been most heavily analyzed by outsiders who have never been there, or talked to its natives or leaders. Lopez tackles this subject from a purely academic angle, and his writing tends to get bogged down in esoteric theory (lighten up on the hermeneutics, sir), along with occasional egghead professor-speak like "Tibetan Buddhism was then constructed as the other of this other ('original Buddhism')." <P>Apart from those difficulties, we do get a mostly fascinating debunking of inaccurate Western pontifications about Tibet, like an exhaustive deconstruction of the West's misunderstanding of the familiar "om mani padme hum" mantra, or a treatise on why the European fraud Lobsang Rampa (not a real Tibetan) could be taken seriously. Of course Lopez has much to say about our modern celebrity Buddhists and the popular Free Tibet movement, all of which are riddled with inaccuracies. Lopez also gives us the true responsibilities and goals of the Dalai Lama, who is a worthy international icon but not necessarily the undisputed God of his people. Other books provide the background on Tibetan history, religion, and geography. But this book is a must-read for anyone interested in attaining accurate knowledge of the Tibetans and their struggles.
