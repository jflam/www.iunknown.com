                    <span>Far from containing any ground-breaking revelations, this book is essentially old news. Except for a few details that Block has added, virtually everything in it can be found in Harold Peterson's "The Man Who Invented Baseball," which was published in 1973.</span>

                    <span>David Block's fascinating book is essential for anyone interested in learning more abot the origins of baseball.
<br />Meticulously researched, and elegantly written with a nice line in humour, David Block's scholarly work debunks many myths on the origins of America's National Pastime, explores the history and development of bat and ball games played throughout the world, and draws compelling conclusions as to the origins of the game in the USA.
<br />
<br />A sure-fire award winner, this book will change the course of baseball history.

                    <span>Like others who have been reading and reviewing David Block's book, I regard this as a major milestone in the published  history of baseball. It is not just that he disposes of many conventional errors in previous accounts nor that he has uncovered many previously unknown details. He has done so in a manner that reads like a good mystery story--slowly revealing not the villain but the hero of his search: the true progenitor of modern baseball.  Meanwhile, his list and use of sources is unparalleled, his discoveries of the byways and footnotes to the standard history are fascinating, his treatment of those who have written before him is generous. From now on, anyone who has the slightest interest in the history of baseball will have to have read Block! </span>

                    <span>As soon as I began reading "Baseball Before We Knew It", I felt as though I were on a runaway horse--I kept exclaiming "Whoa, Whoa."  Baseball is "America's pastime", but David Block becomes an international historical sleuth to uncover its true roots.  Forget everything you have been led to believe about the origin of baseball and be prepared for the ultimate "who dunnit".  Mr. Block even sheds new and intense light on the Abner Doubleday myth, not just dispelling it (again), but revealing perhaps a more nefarious agenda by Albert Spaulding, the baseball magnate who could not accept that, just maybe, baseball did not originate in America.  Meticulously researched and documented, Mr. Block introduces us to all of baseball's possible ancestors.  His conclusion is surprising but satisfying.  This is not just "another history of baseball book", but the definitive work that will be defered to and refered to for a long time to come.  And for the detail wonks, he provides footnotes, appendices and a bibliography which in and of itself is an example of thorough research.  An absolute MUST READ.  And a great gift to baseball-loving friends also. </span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this very information and entertaining book about the origins, the very roots, of the game that is, as Walt Whitman said, "Our Game...America's Game". For those interested in baseball and it's history, this is simply the best book written on the topic in the last fifty years. Best yet, it is not ponderous but an easy read that the casual fan as well as the hard core historian will love. I could tell you all of the little nuggets you will learn, but, I suggest you simply go out and buy one! After all, Opening Day is just around the corner!!</span>
