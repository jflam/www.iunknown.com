                    <span>This book covers much the same ground as The Age of Federalism by Elkins and McKitrick, but much more rapidly. In that earlier book no effort was spared to lay out the details of diplomacy and policy as they related to Federalism and the nascent "Republicanism". Here much the same is accomplished by focusing more on the personalities involved -- Jefferson and Adams primarily, of course, but also Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and (to a lesser extent) Burr and Pinkney. Hamilton does not come off that well, as the story is told from the points of view of Adams and Jefferson, both of whom disliked him (for quite different reasons), and feared him to a certain extent. So he seems more of a petty schemer than he really was.
<br />
<br />Still, scheming was the order of the day -- Jefferson pursued his designs relentlessly and disingenuously. (Adams was not up to committing chicanery. Though ambitious, he was a socially clumsy intolerant moralist with an ungovernable temper.) The election of 1796 was the first real presidential contest, since Washington was not running. It was a warmup for 1800: the party lines were drawn, but party discipline was lax, so it had the awkward outcome of the prominent Federalist Adams becoming President, and the prominent Republican Jefferson Vice-President.
<br />
<br />By 1800 the rancor between the two parties was greater than ever, and the electors were disciplined to vote as they were told by the party organizations, with the interesting result that Jefferson and Burr tied. They were both Republicans, and the leadership, expecting a few defections in the electors' 2nd votes, had expected Jefferson to win. So the election went to the House, and many ballots.
<br />
<br />There is much here about the ways the voting went, and how each state's electors behaved. It shows rather clearly the flaws in the system, once there are parties. There is much here, too, on the political machinations of the various factions, much of it entertaining. This was a pivotal election: Jefferson won, and the Republicans had their way for a quarter century, and the Federalists just faded away. But more than that, the whole cavalcade of characters, who were consciously and unconscously setting precedents that would endure to the present day, has its own fascination. 
<br />
<br />I enjoyed the writing, and I enjoyed the narrative devices. To begin with, Ferling gives us interesting biographical sketches of the main players, taking them up to about 1789. As we know that the climax comes with the election of 1800, we can enjoy all the details and incidents of the previous years as contributing to the final event, and taking significance from that. This is a story, in other words, not just a recitation of historical fact. Moreover, it is gracefully written for a lay audience, with notes tucked at the end of the book. It is written as part of the series Pivotal Moments in American History. As that name suggests, it is not discursive, but focused. It accomplishes its object of illuminating one of those important turning points in our history fully, with interest, but with economy, too.

                    <span>...here's an example:  Throughout the book Mr. Ferling refers to Jefferson as a Republican (capital "r") candidate when he was the founder and candidate of the Democratic-Republican party which became the Democratic Party of today (visit the Democratic and Republican Party websites if you doubt this).  While heavily footnoted, there is little in the way of direct quotation to substantiate what Mr. Ferling reports.  I imagine he has most of it right, but it's fairly obvious that he's trying to draw implicit parallels between the piracy then and terrorism today and the Alien & Sedition Act of that time and today's USA PATRIOT Act.  I think he has valid points to make and I would tend to agree that the positions of Jefferson then may more closely resemble the positions espoused in the rhetoric of today's Republican Party (in terms of actions it really appears that today's Republicans are the Federalists of our time (contrary to Mr. Baiamonte's reading)).  I only wish Mr. Ferling had troubled himself to explain the reasoning behind some of his rhetorical flourishes and provided more factual details (or disclosed that such details have been lost due to the passage of time).  
<br />
<br />The book begins painfully slowly and hops back and forth in time.  However, perhaps by making the first chapter so slow the others seem like pageturners by comparison.  
<br />
<br />I would have appreciated more detail on the Electoral College voting system of that time which seemed very clever (the Federalist-controlled House had to choose between two Democratic-Republican candidates).  Also welcome would have been more detail and explanation of Mr. Ferling's position that there were threats of secession by northerners of that time.
<br />
<br />A good book for an overview, but so many pages could have been put to much better use.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book about the election of 1800 (and the prior one of 1796), concentrating more than other treatments I've read on how the failure of Adams's administration was due to the Federalist split into pro-Hamilton and pro-Adams factions. It identifies three interesting factors in Adams's loss. First, the Hamiltonian faction was more ideologically and personally united than the Adams faction, which was essentially the leftovers rather than a movement. Second, there was a horrendous miscalculation in the election of the New York legislature (which chose the Presidential electors) in the spring -- the corresponding, phenomenally successful, Republican campaign was run by Aaron Burr, which effectively guaranteed him a slot on the ticket with hilarious consequences. Third, because both of the party's candidates, Adams and Pinckney, were in the running for President (rather than one for President and one for Vice-President) intra-party politics were much more likely to get out of hand during the course of the campaign.
<br />
<br />The book's good fun, and sympathetic to everyone (particularly Adams, as is fashionable these days). Its treatment of the sideshow after the election, when Jefferson and Burr tied in electoral votes and the House went through 36 ballots before choosing Jefferson, is thorough and enjoyable, though it doesn't really resolve the two mysteries of why Burr provoked the struggle and why he then blinked. I enjoyed it but felt that it was written to sell rather than to answer questions that were burning inside the author's head -- his earlier A Leap In The Dark seemed much more driven by genuine passion.</span>

                    <span>A not so often appreciated turning point in American history is the election of 1800. It signaled the end of the Federalist party, the rise of party politics, and the beginning of a new path for the nascent union. This short book gives voluminous details of this important campaign in a very readable and exciting narrative. And the campaign was not without its excitement. It unfolds as though it had been written for a novel or a movie script. Almost all of the people involved met surprising or engaging ends. Not only is this book good history, it's also a great story.
<br />
<br />The book gives overviews of the political careers of all of the major players in the election of 1800. Not only Adams and Jefferson, but C.C. Pinckney, Aaron Burr, and Alexander Hamilton.  By way of these summaries, the administrations of George Washington and John Adams also receive good summaries. This gives the reader a pretty good idea where the nation stood as 1800 approached. The crises of Adams' presidency, such as the war scare with France in the late 1790s, the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Alexander Hamilton's control issues all loomed. John Ferling spoke about the book in Minnesota this past October. He said that while researching this book his assessment concerning Jefferson and Adams increased tremendously (he even alluded that he previously held a somewhat negative view of Jefferson), while his view of Alexander Hamilton decreased greatly. The book does depict Hamilton as a power-hungry, potentially menacing schemer that actually held the strings behind Adams' cabinet. Thus Hamilton is to blame for the provisional army and the Alien and Sedition Acts, not Adams. Ferling also says that part of the American legacy is indebted to Hamilton, but overall Hamilton fares badly in this text. John Adams fares rather well (which will surprise readers of Rosenfeld's "American Aurora" where Adams is pretty much equated with despotism, incompetence, and monarchy). Here Adams seems more like a very capable politician - apart from some obvious blunders - caught inbetween the different factions of his own Federalist party (the "Ultras" who follow Hamilton, and the more moderate). Another surprising fact is Adams' uniqueness amongst the other players of never having owned slaves. Thomas Jefferson's ups and downs also receive a fair showing: His slaves, his monetary excesses, his suffocating debt, his weakness as a public speaker, and his affair with his slave Sally Hemmings. The major players receive farily balanced portraits. None are totally romanticized or completely demonized.
<br />
<br />Those who think that dirty politics and negative advertising are endemic to modern American elections will receive a shock. The election of 1800 was rife with schemes, defamations, backstabbing, rumors, and questionable polling practices. In many ways it resembled modern elections in its tireless hurling of mud and brickbats across party lines. Ferling discusses the role of the press in this process. Each side had its newspaper that fired accusations at its opposition. This greatly resembles the current publishing wars between the likes of Bill O'Reilly, Anne Coulter, Micheal Moore, and Al Franken. Dirty politics are in no way the exclusive capital of the modern age.
<br />
<br />The election itself reached the pinnacle of nail-biting intensity. A tie in the electoral vote, a deal struck between the tied contenders gets broken, the election goes to the house who vote over thirty times, threats of civil war loom, and finally a sole member of the opposition rises to the occasion to keep the situation from spiraling completely out of control. How the exchange of power in 1801 occurred without bloodshed approaches the miraculous. The book outlines the amazing details.
<br />
<br />Readers will leave this book with a deep appreciation of the importance of the election of 1800. America would never be the same again, and many of the major players meet interesting, almost jaw-dropping, ends. Highly recommended for readers wanting to know the pivotal events that shaped the early United States.</span>

                    <span>I started this book in the heat of the Bush vs. Kerry campaign and, after a two-month hiatus (unrelated to the quality of the book), finished it this week after attending an Alexander Hamilton museum exhibit in New York City.  The book was a great and very interesting read, and I was most surprised by the similarities between the campaign process of 1800 and that of today.  
<br />
<br />The book devotes much of its space to the political background and relationship between Adams and Jefferson, but also spends a great deal of time on the other major players -- most notably Hamilton, Madison, Burr, and Washington to a lesser extent.  It makes very clear the dislike and distrust between most members of the Federalist and Republican parties, and conveys the contempt that some of the more extreme members had for one another in the early government.  While the author does a good job of providing the good as well as the bad in most of the major subjects, the same cant be said for his treatment of Hamilton.  Ferling paints Hamilton as a calculating, scheming villain, a monarchist, a puppet master at times, and much more.  I'm sure Hamilton was indeed regarded as such by many at the time, but I found it ironic that a week before completing the book I had just spent three hours at an exhibit glorifying the life and contributions of this "American hero."  Unlike with Jefferson and Adams, there are no positives in regards to Hamilton to counteract all the negatives Ferling wrote about.
<br />
<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book despite the bias.  Needless to say, fans of Hamilton most likely will not feel the same way, while Jefferson fans may agree with my sentiments.</span>
