                    <span>Alright, yes, I am a big RFK fan.  But not necessarily a Kennedy fan.  That's right--it is actually possible to like an individual Kennedy without being a fanatic about the rest of them!  That said, I believe one should be able to see that this brief documentary stands on its own, however you feel about the family.  American Experience has shown time and time again, much like the Ken Burns documentaries on a smaller scale, how to showcase a mesmerizing personality.
<br />
<br />What is particularly wonderful about this piece is how it follows the arc of Bobby Kennedy's changing belief system: what metamorphasized within him and what solidified. His most remarkable facet, to me, is that for a politician, and one with a reputation for bull-headedness at that, he was not afraid to change his mind, to learn from life and rethink former convictions.  It shows a man on a journey within himself,taking a large part of an equally changing country with him until his sudden end.
<br />
<br />Agree with his politics or not, Bobby Kennedy was an intelligent, philosophical and driven man.  American Experience has once again told an interesting story about an interesting person, and isn't that the best sort of entertainment?

                    <span>Sorry, folks, I am NOT a Kennedy hater, and I find the way in which Robert Kennedy's personal and public lives interact make him  one of the most interesting of the family. I have to agree with chefdevergue, though, whose review is more sophisticated than is painted. 
<br />The good things about this film include the footage, the commited nature of the narration, the amount of time given to one person's life. 
<br />BUT
<br />that person's complexity seems to be submerged in the Robert Kennedy cult (does everyone have to cry?) in which a nasty little man is transformed by his brother's death to bring out his human side. In doing so, he becomes hip-60's humanist-cum-revolutionary who could have healed the nation.
<br />I am sure this is partly true. The United States seems to have begun a serious drift to a mean conservatism after about 1966, yet Bobby Kennedy stood out against it. He must have been aware that he was unlikely to be elected president in 1968; primaries did not count for so much those days, his primary victories hardly indicated a popular surge for his brand of radicalism, a demoralising defeat waited for him in New York on 18th June, and Humphrey was tying up the nomination at boss-dominated state conventions. Yet he stood out against this, appointed a radical staff and put his neck out on unpopular issues.
<br />However, the bad Bobby wasn't looked at by this hagiography. He didn't stop being the cool calculating politician in 1963; he couldn't have survived if he had. His awareness and respect for the cold power-politics within the Democratic Party are not really dealt with here (compared with the other and superior PBS documentary, The Kennedys. which had the brilliant historian Alan Brinkley as its consultant); his ruthlessness in pursuing the obvious belief that the family had a right to the White House is quietly buried here - eg his attempt to force his way into William Manchester's hotel room in 1966 to stop Manchester attacking LBJ in 'Death of a President', because at the time Bobby was still hoping to be LBJ's running mate); the tv debate with McCarthy in the California primary wasn't shown, yet here RFK was not so nice or such a humanist - waving the big stick over law 'n order, making dark hints that black people would be invading white neighbourhoods if McCarthy had his way. Not nice, and not fitting in with the cult myth that this documentary promulgates, but an attempt to expand his base to white working-class non-radicals who were needed for victory, in California aand nationally. Perhaps if Bobby had won..things may not have been so radical after all?
<br />So sorry folks, and I repeat I am not a Kennedy hater; they are a flawed family, but one which rightly captures the breath of anyone interested in public life, and one which has bravely held steadfast to the banner of liberalism in a conservative age. The Bobby myth has some strong points in its favour; he really does seem to be a passionate idealist in many ways, but this movie does not give a balanced assessment of this fascinating man.</span>

                    <span>I watched this when it was on PBS last month and thought it was one of the best documentaries I've seen.  It left me wondering what happened to politicians like RFK.  Why are we consistently stuck with less than stellar candidates for the most important job in the world? </span>

                    <span>As an admirer of Robert Kennedy, I was really looking forward to seeing this new PBS documentary on him and I was not disappointed.
<br />
<br />From the emotional start (at the 1964 Democratic Convention where RFK made a heartfelt speech about his late brother) to the highly emotional ending (the funeral train & his night burial at Arlington) this documentary takes you on a journey & shows you how Bobby grew through experience.
<br />
<br />Tightly edited, the documentary includes some rare clips of RFK that I hadn't seen before, including his appearance on 'Meet the Press', where conflicted about whether to run for president against LBJ he talks about 'getting off the planet' to one of the questioning presenters (can you imagine a politician saying something as existentialist as that nowadays!)
<br />
<br />The interviewees, a mix of historians and RFK's staff and friends are good value with some insightful comments.
<br />
<br />For those new to Bobby and wishing to learn more this is an excellent introduction to his life, with a good overview about the social upheavals of America in the 1960s as well.
<br />
<br />For RFK fans the film doesn't really tell you anything you hadn't know before, but the narrative thrust of the programme is so compelling that it almost doesn't matter.
<br />
<br />Of course, two hours to cover the very full and complex life of RFK is really not enough. The documentary is very tightly edited and if there is a fault, it doesn't have nearly enough clips from Bobby's speeches. 
<br />
<br />Another hour would have added more depth to the story. Too many things are missed out - RFK's visit to South Africa in 1966 and his anti-apartheid speech;his fight for the rights of Native Americans.
<br />
<br />Overall, an excellent addition to the growing numbers of documentaries on Robert Kennedy. 
<br />
<br />I defy anyone not to shed a tear and wonder what might have been at the conclusion of this excellent and worthwhile documentary.

                    <span>I have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding Robert Kennedy, and I've got to say that this is, by far, one of the best pieces of work I've yet to see.  The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America.
<br />
<br />This movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy's life.  
<br />
<br />If you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it.  This is THE one you want to watch.  After watching this, you will see Robert Kennedy in a way you never have before.
