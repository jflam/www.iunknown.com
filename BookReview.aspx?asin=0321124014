                    <span>While a very fine book for the technically knowledgeable, this book could be considered something of a failure for someone venturing into unknown territory. That is to say, someone without a knowledge of "working spaces," "ICC profiling" or other "insider" knowledge of graphics programs. <BR>It assumes a familiarity with terms without explaining them well.<BR>For example, there is a complete lack of explanation as to why one would wish to change a profile coming from a digital camera into another profile which is more favorable for printing images from an inkjet printer. Similar situations appear throughout the book (the section on curves will leave a body cross-eyed).<BR>This is an 'instruction' manual for those functioning at the intermediate/advanced level, but it in no way 'teaches' one how to use Photoshop or why a certain step should be taken, so there is no real sense of 'aha! That's why I should use this function instead of that one.' A person can get lost in the dialogue, which is more apt to satisfy color professionals than John Q Public, who simply wants to learn how to use Photoshop for color correcting without a primer course under their belt. <BR>Not recommended for anyone with an IQ under 150 -- unless you wants wrinkles on your forehead from consternation.</span>

                    <span>I have spent many years doing electronic prepress, color correction, and design, and one question I get repeatedly asked is "how do I get better color from my computer?". Now, I can point them in the direction of this excellent book.<P>Mr. Kieran provides a solid foundation of what color correction is, and why it is necessary. His first section on "Color Fundamentals" reminds me of the old "Pocket Pal" book every designer lived by, except better written. This introduction gives you a solid and understandable overview of color correction, its terms, and its purpose. Building on this foundation (don't skip it!), the book then goes on to a thorough explanation of how to use Photoshop to improve the color, tone, and quality of your digital photos.<P>The book is framed by what the author calls the "essentials of color correction" -- highlights and shadows, netral tones, contrast, and sharpening. I was very happy to see this organization because it mimics the process I use every time I professionally work on a photo. Mr. Kieran goes into a great amount of detail for each of these "essential" steps. He begins each section with a thorough description of the "why", then step-by-step explains the "how". The book is crammed with color photographs, clearly illustrating both technical issues like how histograms relate to changes in the image, as well as demonstrating each step of the correction process.<P>Two very practical sections stand out: Mr Kieran gives a great overview of all of the ways you can convert a color photo to black and white, and all of the ways you can sharpen a photo (two things I am constantly asked!). There as so many ways to do these basic tasks, it's great to have a solid description, complete with illustrations, and explanations of when to use one method over the others.<P>In conclusion, a good solid practical book - one that anyone serious about good photos should give a read.</span>

                    <span>If you buy only 1 photopshop book, buy this one. I am not a photographer, not in the biz, I'm just a guy who loves his pictures. <BR> Kieran's experience is beautifully communicated and he makes complex theories and industry standards sound simple. It is like having a seasoned Pro standing next to you. (I wish I could find a book on computer networks that's this good.) I'm only a few chapters into it, but already I look at color in a competely different way. My mind is racing as I recall pictures that I never got the most out of, and now I can! <BR> I warn you; though some software and books make it seem like your computer can magically fix color, contrast, and produce beautiful prints on it's own; this book will challenge you to learn. Kieran explains the difficulties associated with color reproduction, what the industry has done, and what you can do with what you have. Stop wondering and start knowing.</span>

                    <span>The image you capture with your camera doesn't have to be the image you share with others. Poor lighting, incorrect exposure, and washed-out colors can ruin a good photograph, but modern editing software-namely Photoshop-can save an otherwise hopeless image.<P>Photoshop makes it easy to produce great-looking images full of detail and vibrant color, even when the original image is fuzzy and bland. Color expert Michael Kieran calls Photoshop Color Correction a distillation of 10 years' worth of hard-earned knowledge in the field of color correction and color management. In it, he shows you how to improve the detail, color balance, and sharpness of any photograph, regardless of its source, by applying color improvements you can see on both the computer screen and in print.<P>This book gives an overview of the fundamentals of printing and color theory, and the whys and hows of calibration and color management. You'll learn practical techniques, presented in simple language-how to give the most important areas of an image an extra dose of detail by careful control of Photoshop's curves feature; how unsharp masking can bring images into focus; when to vary the black generation setting and what that means for printing and color correction; how to hold shadow detail; how to manage the Photoshop's separation settings; and more.<P>High quality color doesn't just happen; sometimes it requires a great deal of work. Photoshop Color Correction demystifies the issues surrounding the tonal structure of images and helps you build an impressive repertoire of skills for analyzing and correcting color. You'll learn step-by-step processes for engineering great color in your photographs and enhancing color, clarity, and contrast.<P>A companion CD-ROM contains low-resolution versions of the sample images in the book that illustrate the possibilities of color correction using Photoshop tools.<P>This book teaches such essentials as:<BR>* establishing proper highlight and shadow tones<BR>* keeping neutral tones neutral<BR>* adjusting sharpness to an appropriate level<BR>* understanding various color model<P>Not convinced yet? Give it a try, you won't regret buying this book. I didn't!</span>

                    <span>I've read a few photoshop books, and this one is the easiest to understand. The arthur wasted no time to throw in jokes, unrelated examples or what not to confuse you. Every info is right to the point. Unlike some other books I read which only shows you how to do things in one mode, this book actually shows you photo retouching in 3 different modes (CMYK, RGB, LAB) and the reader decides what's best for them. The book contents are very well organized so you know right from the start exactly on what you're learning in a chapter.<P>However, the CD included in the book was a joke. They are only before and after pictures shown within the book. And when I opened up those pictures, they looked nothing like the ones in the book. I assume it's because of the ICC profile differences. Somehow I feel they included this CD so that they could jacked up the price to $50.<P>Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about making your digital pictures look their best. That's the primary focus of this book. The price is a little too high to include such a junk CD.<P>Note: Amazingly, I did not buy this book just because it has a 4 or 5 stars, I picked it out from a local book store. The other 4 books I bought and returned were all recommended by internet users on here and have 5 stars. I think if at all possible, it's best to read a little bit of the book you were going to buy before actually buying it. Don't buy it just because it has a 5 stars on here.</span>
