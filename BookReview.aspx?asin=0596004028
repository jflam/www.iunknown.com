                    <span>Don't buy this book; you won't use it.  The function explanations are rarely more than a sentence, and worst of all they are many times self-referential.<p>"string urlencode(string str) - URL-ecodes a string."  The function name makes that clear, but what does that mean, if you don't already know?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of referring to a book for clarification?<p>"array pathinfo(string path) - Returns information about a certain string."  Does that description clarify anything beyond the function name?<p>They should have trimmed out more functions and included more information about the most important ones.  Sadly, this is also the book used in Dreamweaver MX 2004 for online help, which is frustrating.</span>

                    <span>The book needs an index...<p>also, the function list.. (very lengthy)  is very poorly organized and layed out..<br>each line starts with the output type of the function.. (int,string,bool) etc.<p>consequently scanning the index for the function you're looking for is extreemely difficult.<p>You cant even easily find where you are in the alphabetized list without sifting through a buncha lines starting with 'string','int','bool'<p>it's a worthless pocket reference.</span>

                    <span>I have been a fan of O-Reilly Pocket References for some time.  My colleagues would say that I am highly vested in them.  Sadly, this is the worst one I've seen.<p>The first section is actually laid out very well.  The syntax highlighting and language basics are described with succinctness and efficiency.<p>As for the second section, the function reference, it is basically worthless.  Taking up a bulk of the text, this 97 page listing is nearly pointless, as so many have said before me.  The listing is completely alphabetical, which means you have to know what you are looking for before you look for it.  Assuming you know what to look for, then you most likely have some idea what the syntax is, making this, sadly, a waste of effort (although, I can't deny that a syntax reference can be useful, if organized properly).<p>I'd have two suggestions for the next edition.  The function reference would be decent if it were categorized.  Since this would prevent alphabetical ordering of entries, my second recommendation is an index, which many reviewers have requested before.<p>With this said, don't bother with this product (2nd edition), unless you *KNOW* PHP.</span>

                    <span>.<p>My 1st Edition copy of this book is so well-loved that there is a dirt stripe down the edge of the pages from my flipping through it so often.  I bought the 2nd Edition thinking it would be just as good as the first, with the new PHP-4 functions added.  <p>The 2nd Edition is just an alphabetical list of functions, while the 1st Edition was categorized by usage-type (string functions, database functions, math functions, etc.).  If I needed to find a function that did {foo} to a string, I'd look in the strings section until I found a description for an appropriate function.  I can't do this with the 2nd Edition and am seriously considering returning it!<p>If you just need a reference to remind you of parameter order and return-type, get the 2nd Edition.  <p>But if you're like me and want to find the correct function to do what you are looking to accomplish, save your money and buy a used copy of the 1st Edition PHP Pocket Reference.</span>
