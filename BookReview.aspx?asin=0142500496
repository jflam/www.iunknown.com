                <span id="Label1">Toswiah Green. Evie Thomas. One girl. Two names. Two lives. When her  police officer father witnesses two white cops killing a black boy, he makes the  heart-wrenching decision to testify against his former friends. Overnight,  thanks to the witness protection program, Toswiah becomes Evie, and she and her  family leave their idyllic Denver, Colorado, life far behind. Toswiah's  previously happy, lighthearted mother abruptly turns to religion, her big sister  makes secret plans to escape the family, and her proud father collapses inward  to a depressed, almost catatonic state. Adolescent Toswiah--now Evie--copes as  best she can, taking up track and field in school, and trying to fathom who she  is, and who she is becoming.<p>  Jacqueline Woodson, Coretta Scott King Award-winning author of <I>Miracle's Boys</I> and many other  highly acclaimed titles, delves deep into the confused hearts of a family that  has lost its identity. Toswiah, as a young teenager, was already on the verge of  shaping her identity as a young woman; with these shattering events, it takes  every ounce of strength and courage to keep her core intact.

                    <span>Hush by Jaqueline Woodson is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  The book keeps you on the edge of your seat and you never want to put it down.  This book is full of fun adventure about the girls life and some of the bad things her family has been going through.  I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone. </span>

                    <span>The book I read was Hush, By JacquelineWoodson. This book was a fictional, drama, ethinic book.The most obvious problem in the book was the family's race, being african american.
<br />	A summary of the book Hush would be based around a girl whose birthname is Toswiah, which is later changed to Evie when put into the witness protection program. Toswiah faced many problems in this novel. After being used to living in Colorado with her family, grandmother, and having her best friend live down the street, everything changed in a matter of a day. The day and event was a hard decision for her father, who was a police officer. He witnessed a rasict homicide on a teenage boy by his two white partners. After days of thinking of what he should do, he came forward to the police department, who witnessed and interrogated witnesses. In the mean time, the two cops harassed, and called the family. The witness protection program relocated their family, giving them new identities, and they could not come into contact with any of their family or friends from Colorado, until the police department arrested the two cops. Toswiah is forced to reinvent herself and not think of the past at all. 
<br />	The book was interesting becuase it shows how certain people, even cops, deal with racial problems and how it affects their families. One wrong move by anyone, can affect all parties involved. The book was also inspiring because it shows how a young girl could be so courageous and have the ability to put up with leaving family and friends, to reinvent herself and not say anything about her past.
<br />	Possibilities and questions the book raises are how did the family and friends live after they left Colorado? What ever happened to the two cops and their families? How the whole family is affected by this tradgedy? It only fully explains Toswiah and her sisters thoughts and views, but leaves out the effects this had on everyone else.
<br />	Arguments I would have against the author would be Toswiah shouldn't, have to deal with rascism and relocation. This also lead to her fathers attempted suicide and the emotional breakdown of her mother,all of which is alot for a child of her age. 
<br />	The book taught me and affected me by showing me how a person, even a cop cant be trusted. They can give you one impression and totally change it in a matter of seconds. Which can affect the lives of everyday people. It shows how rascism and still exists in society, regardless of the occupation. It also shows how a young girl can deal with adult like problems at a young age, and adapt to different things when needed to.
<br />	My overall opinion of the book was it was a very good, interesting, inspiring, and a book some people can relate to, because we are all aware that these problems exist, but not to this extent. Advice I have for potential readers of this book would be to look and see how a young person can relate to such harsh opinions and impressions we have in our own society, and how every little thing can affect a person no matter how minimal.</span>

                    <span>This novel was about a family having to change their identity;as well as their lives, just because their father witnessed a murder. His fellow friends, police officers, killed a young african-american boy. The Green family was put in a witness protection program, so they moved out of denvert, leaving family members, friends, and their belongings. They had to change their names and had to change the way they lived. The family didn't like it there. A lot happened to the family while they are there. Cameron, which is Anna now, had grown into a beautiful women. Toswiah which now is Evie, has made new friends and found what she likes most "track". The family went through a lot of changes, but they made it through. I think this was a great book, I enjoyed reading this book. I recommend this book to children of all ages. I hope they will enjoy it, like I did.</span>
