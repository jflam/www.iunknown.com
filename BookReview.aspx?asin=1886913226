                    <span>Those of us who are profesional sportswriters spend a lot of time  in press boxes with other writers who criticize what they see on the field, but either never played the game or never played it well. "The Suitors of Spring" is brilliantly written by Pat Jordan, who did play the game. It also brings to mind some of the best sports books ever. "Ball Four's" Jim Bouton played the game. "North Dallas Forty's" Peter Gent played the game.<p>Having stood on the mound, facing down a hitter with the bases loaded, the crowd yelling, the opposition hurling insults, your future on the line and the hair standing up on the back of his neck, is an experience known by few. Jordan knows it. <p>Here he writes about pitchers, his specialty. He writes about superstars like Tom Seaver, playboys like Bo Belinsky, hardthrowing drunks like Steve Dalkowski, 6-6 lefties who never lived up their potential, like Sam McDowell, and prep phenoms from his home state of Connecticut who met the same fate as the author.<p>Jordan's talent is not one that can be learned in a literary class. He is of the school of hard knoocks, rough hewn, real, human. Bravo, Pat.<p>STEVEN TRAVERS<br>AUTHOR OF "BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN"<br>STWRITES@AOL.COM</span>

                    <span>"A False Spring" is so good I cannot do it justice here. It is, along with "Ball Four", "The Suitors of Spring" (also by Pat Jordan) and "Bo: Pitching and Wooing" by Maury Allen, one of the best baseball books ever written. This book describes minor league baseball, the hopes and dreams of a young athlete, youthful sex, raunchiness, crushing disappointment, and Americana. I read this book and memorized it, then went off to play minor league ball myself and totally lived all of it. My experiences in the Cardinal and A's organization did not resemble Jordan's, they rhymed. This book tells the story of thousands of young hopefuls who live amongst us, and many more of us can relate to it than can relate to the superhuman life and accomplishments of Barry Bonds.</span>

                    <span>I first read excerpts from "A False Spring" about 30 years ago when they appeared in three consecutive issues of Sports Illustrated.  From the moment I began reading that first installment, I was entranced.  It is hard to describe exactly why, but I am sure that the baseball action in the book was not the reason.  Instead, I remember Jordan's vivid portrayls of such seemingly mundane things as a prarie thunderstorm, an afternoon fishing in the swamplands of Florida and the glow of the instruments on his dashboard.  These depictions riveted me, I'm convinced, because they put into words how I saw the world.  As an 11 year-old, this was a unique and novel experience for me.<p>Jordan's portrayal of his own feelings of dissatisfaction, disappointment, anger, rage and finally resignation also resonated with me.  Most of the reading I had done up to that point portrayed life's events in a linear fashion that was totally at odds with what I had already experienced.  I was fascinated that Jordan could take an accessible subject matter and weave all of these other elements into it.  <p>Mind you, all of this came to me from reading the three SI excerpts.  I never did read the book until, by chance, I was searching on this site and came across a name I remembered.  So, 30 years later, I got a copy and tried to find out whether this book would have meaning for me anything like what I experienced as an 11 year-old.<p>Some pompous windbag spoke at my college graduation ceremony about the test for what he called "clahsic stahtus."  According to this guy, any writing qualified for that status if one could read the work at widely spaced intervals and still feel the same spark as in the previous readings.  He assumed, I guess, that peoples' perceptions and interests change over the years and that only writing that had a certain breadth would be able to appeal to a reader who had undergone those changes.<p>"A False Spring" certainly passed the test.  All of the vivid descriptions -- the hand-me-down uniforms, the barracks-like atmosphere of minor league spring training, the experience of pitching in frozen northern outposts-- remained as vital and gripping as before, as did Jordan's portrayal of the unravelling of his baseball career.  With the benefit of 30 years' experience, I was able to understand the author's struggles in more than the visceral way I did as an 11 year-old.  Further, I got the strong sense -- confirmed in Jordan's later memoir, "A Nice Tuesday" -- that Jordan himself had not figured out exactly why things had gone so wrong for him.  <p>At times, reading this book was like watching someone reliving some horrible nightmare.  At other times, it was simply a pleasant experience to read Jordan's description of day-to-day life in small town America in the late 50s.  Throughout, the book was just as gripping as those SI excerpts that grabbed me 30 years ago.<p>I have read that Pat Jordan set about to create a persona in this book and that the portrayal of that persona was calculated and not always accurate.  Even so, this book reveals enough of the real experiences of the man that it withstands the test of time.  I'm not so interested in absolute historical accuracy when I come across a book that can hold my attention and bring me back for more 30 years after the first reading.</span>

                    <span>Like so many baseball books, this really isn't just about baseball. It's about a young mans' journey growing up. It's about what happens to a "can't miss" prospect when he does miss. Pat Jordan looks back 15 years after he threw his last pitch--trying to figure out what happened. He's still not sure-I got the feeling he wrote this book for theraputic reasons. But we learn a lot about Mr. Jordan, and some of it is not too flattering. It's obvious he's still searching for the answers, and that's what I like the most about the book-because YOU understand while reading that he just didn't have what it takes to be a big league pitcher. A wonderful peek inside Mr. Jordan's "coming of age." Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This is easily one of best books about baseball (amoung other things) ever written. It's also a first rate work of literature that easily bares comparison to a book by J.D. Salinger you may have heard of though it owes absolutely nothing to Salinger's famed tale stylistically. Phenomenally evocative, with the kind of dead-on, grabs-you-from-the-get-go-and-never-lets-go story telling only the best of the best manage (if they're lucky!). Whatever Mr. Jorden may think, the experiences he recalls here are clearly the ones that enabled him to find his true gifts and tell a story I suspect may be all too familare to plenty of other hapless rookies but which no one else has even come close to telling so perfectly.</span>
