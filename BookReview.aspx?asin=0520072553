                <span id="Label1">The Library of Alexandria, one of the wonders of the Ancient World,  has haunted Western culture for over 2,000 years. The Ptolemaic kings of  Egyptsuccessors of Alexander the Greathad a staggering ambition: to house all  of the books ever written under one roof, and the story of the universal library  and its destruction still has the power to move us. But what was the library, and where was it? Did it exist at all? Contemporary  descriptions are vague and contradictory. The fate of the precious books  themselves is a subject of endless speculation. Canfora resolves these puzzles in one of the most unusual books of classical  history ever written. He recreates the world of Egypt and the Greeks in brief  chapters that marry the craft of the novelist and the discipline of the  historian. Anecdotes, conversations, and reconstructions give The Vanished  Library the compulsion of an exotic tale, yet Canfora bases all of them on  historical and literary sources, which he discusses with great panache. As the  chilling conclusion to this elegant piece of historical detective work he  establishes who burned the books.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps because its transalation from the original Italian, Canfora's book was for me virtually unreadable. It scores low on factual detail and all too often suffers because it seems to place form over content, which (to my mind) is a perennial failing of Italian intellectualism (the worst kind - maybe even worst than the French variety). I bought this book, through Amazon, with a desire to be informed, enlightened and delighted by the fascinating story of the great library of Alexandria. I especially wanted to learn about its famous head librarian, Erastosthenes, who amongst other achievements is said to have devised a way of measuring the earth's diameter, circa 200 BC. Two lines, at most! I ended up abandoning the book without even finishing it, such is its prolix, garbled and irritating stylistic presentation. Did I somehow fail to understand, prior to buying the book, that its narrative was not going to straightforward and factual anyhow, but more of a 'literary fantasia' based upon the theme of the Alexandrian library? Perhaps. Anyhow, it's NOT recommended bedtime reading - or at any other time. By the way - if anyone knows about Erastosthenes, email me at JDL@indigo.ie</span>

                    <span>From the beginning of this book, we are treated to historical references [in order of their occurrance] to the famous Library at Alexandria, with an eye toward clearing up the fundamental mysteries surrounding it: where was the Library located? What was its place in ancient culture? And, finally, when and how many times was it really destroyed?<P>An enjoyable and profound read, part history, part mystery; a refreshing change from the dry texts of collegiate studies. A book that engages the imagination as well as the intellect. An excellent piece of detective work.<P>I loved it.</span>

                    <span>Almost certainly, no other ancient institution has caught the modern imagination so much as has The Library of Alexandria. Begun around 300BC, this remarkable establishment became _the_ center of learning and scholarship in the Mediterranean world for hundreds of years thereafter. Our debt to the great library is incalculable; to it we owe the Septuagint (the Greek translations of the Old Testament), the standardization of Homer and Hesiod to their final forms, and the survival of the great Greek thinkers (Plato, Aristotle) to modern times. The beginnings of modern thought -- science, philosophy, mathematics, medicine -- can all be traced to this unique collection and the people who were a part of its scholarly society. It was the home to writers and thinkers that we are familiar with (Polybius, Appollonius Rhodius) and to far more that we are not but should (Theophrastus, Neleus). And its demise ranks as one of the greatest tragedies in Western history.<P>In The Vanished Library, Luciano Ganfora (translated here by Martin Ryle) gives a popular account of the history of the Library, from its founding and shadowy beginnings, all the way up to its decline and destruction centuries later. But what makes this book interesting is that Ganfora resists the temptation to slip into the academic spouting of facts, figures, and theories at every opportunity. Rather, his aim is to not only show the reader the library, but to give one a feel for what it was like to _be_ there, to work among the thousands of scrolls, and to live the life of the ancient Greek scholar. His research is grounded firmly in the original sources, many of which he discusses at length in the book's appendix and several of which he quotes at length. The book sometime feels like a novel, because Ganfora frequently adopts a storyteller's tone in order to illustrate some aspect he wishes us to explore. Occasionally, Ganfora also digresses into some of the more controversial areas of the Library's history; he argues, for instance, that Caesar's sacking of Alexandria during the Roman Civil Wars did not destroy the library as many scholars insist, but rather destroyed an annex that was used to house finished scrolls meant for export across the Mediterranean (the Library being also a major source for the dissemination of literary works across the known world). But none of this detracts from the book itself. It does a very good job of introducing one to the subject of the Library and what we know about it, and makes for a rather delightful read along the way.<P>This is not to say that this is the best introductory book on the subject out there; in my opinion, that would have to go to Derek Adie Flower's The Shores of Wisdom. Ganfora does skip over whole areas of the Library's history that Flower does not, and goes more in depth than Ganfora on some of the academic arguments surrounding such subjects as the Library's demise and its impact on Western culture. But Ganfora's book is easier to read for the layperson, and shorter -- one could read it cover-to-cover in literally a single sitting. And I think Ganfora does a better job of evoking the sense of just what the Library was like than Flower. For this reason I would recommend this book _along with_ The Shores of Wisdom; both work as complementary pieces, with the short comings of the one made up in the other.</span>

                    <span>This book is astounding. I came away feeling that I knew way too much about the library at Alexandria. Canfora's passion for the subject is evident, and he seasons his account of the library and its death with personal intensity. The resultant detail is thorough and masterful.<P>I cannot help but wonder, though, whether it was worth it. The intense focus of so much attention on so specific a subject left me slightly uneasy, as if I had watched Canfora engaged in a perfectly moral activity, but one that was best done behind closed doors.</span>

                    <span>Luciano Canfora's The Vanished Library stands out as an example of how not to write a historical account. I'm not sure for whom this text was written, but it is weak.<P>The first half is a meandering novelesque account of events, many of which appear unconnected to the library. Canfora never really put together where he was going with the narrative. I suspect someone already familiar with the subject might have understood why some of these things were important, but my impression was that the book was meant more as a popular history. The back cover states that Canfora has merged the craft of novelist and historian, an unhappy marriage if I ever saw one.<P>The second half is better, covering source material, and finally providing some elusive references and staying on topic better. He goes through writings of earlier classical sources and their references to the library, comparing their works to try to find out what happened to the library.<P>If this review sounds confusing, it's because I found the book confusing. It meandered around, sometimes offering two page chapters on subjects that seemed to have no bearing on the topic. The pedagogic style was bad, and the reader is left wondering what the point of reading it was. One can get some useful information here, and it's an interesting enough topic. But I found the writing and analysis weak and haphazard.</span>
