                <span id="Label1">For more than a decade, Steve McConnell, one of the premier authors and voices in the software community, has helped change the way developers write code--and produce better software. Now his classic book, CODE COMPLETE, has been fully updated and revised with best practices in the art and science of constructing software. Whether you're a new developer seeking a sound introduction to the practice of software development or a veteran exploring strategic new approaches to problem solving, you'll find a wealth of practical suggestions and methods for strengthening your skills. Topics include design, applying good techniques to construction, eliminating errors, planning, managing construction activities, and relating personal character to superior software. This new edition features fully updated information on programming techniques, including the emergence of Web-style programming, and integrated coverage of object-oriented design. You'll also find new code examples--both good and bad--in C++, Microsoft(r) Visual Basic(r), C#, and Java, though the focus is squarely on techniques and practices.</span>

                    <span>An unusual pragmatic approach to software construction which closes the gap between the abstract/formal "state of the art" college textbooks and reality.
<br />I wish I had come across the book after my formal education, because actually participating in a real software project exposed to the massive preassure and technical deadlocks can be somewhat of a shocker if you are used to small, confined and formal projects.
<br />If you are an experienced developer, the book will ring countless bells and provide answers and reason to countless recognizable issues... if you are fresh out of college, prepare yourself for the real world with this, the only book in my experience, that unites de-facto real-world practice with the theory you're usually bombarded with.</span>

                    <span>I have 2 books on the top of my shelf: Code Complete and Windows Server 2003 Inside Out. I consider both books to be the official bibles for programmers, developers, and old IT hack pros like me.
<br />
<br />I bought the original edition of "Code Complete" back in 1994. 10 years later I bought the second edition as soon as I thumbed through it. This edition has been completely updated to reflect what's happening in programming. At nearly 1000 pages, there's many examples as well. I like the coding horror examples the best--these show examples of bad code.
<br />
<br />Code Complete helps you think more clearly about coding. Then backs this up by providing many techniques and practices.</span>

                    <span>If every programmer would read even a third of Code Complete, it would make programmer code in this country so much safer.
<br />
<br />People need to spend more on training developers and less on firewalls.
<br />
<br />This book is a great start.

<br />Every software engineer would benefit from this book!  This book shows you how to write code correctly, as you write your application/system, to save time and improve quality/maintainability.
<br />
<br />Most developers do not write good code.  Most are hacks!  If you don't think you have time to read a book like this or that it isn't worth it, you may very well be one of these hacks.
