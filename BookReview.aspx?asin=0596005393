                    <span>I highly recommend this book for anyone using or desiring to use JSF in their development. From my personal experience, working on a JSF project, this book helped me get through which otherwise was proving very frustrating and would not have been possible without this book. Most important, the language of the book helped me really understand the basics. It firmed my foundations in JSF, on which I could build strong infrastructure. <P>A perfect place to start if you are intereted in JSF. All included examples in the book are a good starting point for building your own application blocks and components. It clears the mist that builds when you go bumping around forums and helps you understand the technology in its true sense. <P>A definite recommended read. Book content and examples are in line with JSF release 1.1 specification.<P>Thank you Hans, a terrific resource.<BR>(...)</span>

                    <span>If you like Hans Bergsten's JavaServer Pages, you'll like this book. It follows the same writing style and format, with a large Appendix which contains the JSF APIs and technical information. If you prefer your documentation in book form rather than online, the appendices are a great reference tool, but it would have been nice if they had an index or some page-edge indicators to make finding what you're looking for a little easier. The APIs tend to get lost in the text and it's easy to flip back and forth several times until you find what you're looking for. Personally, I would have preferred to see more examples in the reference sections. <P>I would highly suggest downloading the examples, which made the text (at least for me) a lot easier to follow. The examples require Tomcat 5, Servlet 2.4, JSP 2.0. If you'd like to get this working with an earlier version of Tomcat, Servlet and JSP spec, you can do it, but you're on your own.<P>The target audience as defined at the beginning of the book is divided into three roles and talks about covering the tasks for each of these roles. The roles are "page author", "application developer", and "component writer" - the component writer being the link between the HTML and the Java code. So, depending on what part of JSF you would be involved with, it should cover your area of expertise.</span>

                    <span>This books help me to find answers for many questions I had. <BR>The most important thing for me in book - example with multiform UI.<BR>In future version of book probably good idea to include example with RowSet and less information about servlets.<BR>Instead of servlets maybe better to see example with SVG rendering kit. <BR>Thank you very much for your book!</span>

                    <span>In this book, Hans has provided us with a good starting point to using JSF, including the Servlet and JSP systems on which it is built. This is of particular value to those of us coming from an ASP.Net background who so often are given a book that looks at just one small piece of the J2EE picture, leaving us to feverishly google for answers to questions regarding underlying java technologies.<P>What you should bear in mind with this book is that it is all-inclusive: a lot of the book's documentation can be readily found online--as long as you know where to look (and, believe me, coming from a Microsoft background it takes a while to know where to look--eg. "sourceforge, what?"). Including all documentation for JSF gives the benefit of not having to look for it yourself.<P>Remember also that JSF is a very new technology and not all of the details have been fleshed out about it (generating custom errors for validation is sorely lacking). As such, I would imagine it to be hard to write a book full of those "watch out" tips when the framework hasn't been widely deployed on various environments and in divergent situations. Hans' book reflects this by appearing to some to be overly general.<P>I really appreciated the chapter showing how to plug in custom renderer code into JSF, it shows that Hans recognizes the shortcomings of JSF and points the way to fixing them.<P>Overall, if you are a top-notch Java web app builder familiar with Struts or Tapestry, okay, you would get just as much benefit downloading the spec and reading it. If, however, you are a relative newcomer to java-based web apps--or just someone who wants to have it all in front of you--, especially if you're coming from the Microsoft world, I would recommend this for you.<P>A final note: I'm an average guy who picked up this book. I have no affiliations with Hans and yet, when I sent emails asking him questions on hang ups I found using JSF, he responded to me with detailed information about my issue. Not only that but Hans has been very vocal in pushing to make JSF better by publishing articles (...) and trying to get the Tapestry folks to help.</span>
