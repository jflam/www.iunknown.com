                <span id="Label1">Topher Delaney's twenty-six year career as an environmental artist and builder has encompassed a wide variety of projects including residential gardens ranging from intimate scales up to 400-acre large scale sites, one-acre large corporate rooftop gardens, numerous resorts, award-winning sanctuary gardens for medical facilities, and public art installations. Ms. Delaney's work has been exhibited nationally, most recently at the DeYoung Museum in Facing Eden: 100 Years of Landscape Art in the Bay Area, and at the San Jose Art Museum, 'Room of Fog,' a site installation piece. Her works incorporate many innovative materials including rubber, colored concrete, fiberglass, diachronic glass and recycled plastics.</span>

                    <span>very interesting the way Topher Delaney passes her work off as spiritual. in what feels like a sell-out to the new-age craze, the designs feel contrived. the drawings and text suggest some sublime meaning in the works, look closer and the message is a one liner. the designs seem too similar to be real narratives. unless, all of the clients were one and the same.</span>

                    <span>This book gave me a true taste of the original vision of Topher Delaney. I found the photographs and narrative fascinating and inspirational for the budding landscape architect, and probably of interest to any student of the creative process. However, I also was truly offended by the foreword written by Maggie Peng (whoever she might be) which sounded like a parody of all the pomposity and bombast associated with art criticism. Also, though the book has been designed in a clear and easy on the eyes format, it suffers from the annoying characteristic many of its tabletop/art book ilk share: a preoccupation with showing only 'details' and skewed points of view that make each photograph an evocative masterpiece but prevent the reader from getting a complete visualization of how each garden example was actually setup. A single pedestrian long view shot or just a simple blueprint would have sufficed to give me the big picture concept unfiltered by the book photographer's sensibility. Otherwise, Topher Delaney and her multiple visions do come through on the page and I enjoyed the book.</span>

                    <span>Having seen Topher Delaney's work first hand on the West Coast and having heard her speak, I was anxious to read her book, Ten Landscapes. Delaney is an artist, architect, landscape designer, gardener and contractor rolled into one very passionate, humorous, spiritual being. She is a unique designer whose work is considered " cutting edge," This book will challenge your perceptions of what a garden can be. Ten Landscapes is a wonderful narrative with fabulous photographs. A must read for those who are into landscape architecture or who just enjoy beautiful gardens.</span>
