                <span id="Label1"><I>The Fugitive Game</I> introduces Kevin Mitnick moments before the fugitive hacker surrenders himself to FBI agents who have located him with the help of the so-called cybersleuth, Tsutomu Shimomura. The prologue to Jonathan Littman's book kicks off with the epic climax that came to tantalize movie producers and video game designers and launch magazine covers worldwide. However, this is not another version of <I>Takedown</I>. <I>The Fugitive Game</I> is a compelling, journalistic look at the events that led up to the capture of Kevin Mitnick, and no portion of the folklore surrounding the case is left untouched by the book's critical eye. The real gold of this volume comes from the nearly 200 pages of conversations with Kevin Mitnick himself, most of which were transcribed while he was fleeing from the law.<P> Over the course of Mitnick's flight from justice, Littman documents and examines the public transformation of Mitnick into Public Enemy Number One, mostly through the efforts of the <I>New York Times</I> writer John Markoff. Markoff's involvement in the eventual capture of Mitnick by Shimomura is also scrutinized at length. Littman even questions the now-legendary Christmas Day break-in of Shimomura's computer, citing reports that the "IP spoofing technique," which Markoff claimed was so ingenious, was in fact a well-known method of gaining access to systems for years. This is a brilliant look at a compelling individual and also the manufacturing of media events and the inept efforts of law enforcement to prepare for the next wave of high-tech crime.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book and I must say that it was a real eye-opener. Over the past two weeks, I've read both Cyberpunk and Takedown. On their own, they seem to be pretty straightforward accounts of the tracking and capture of Mitnick. After finishing The Fugitive Game, I now realize how biased and self-serving both books really are.<P>First of all, this is by far the most informative and interesting of the three works, and aside from the very insightful dialogue of fugitive Mitnick, Littman poses a number of intriguing questions glossed over by the mainstream "press" and which could never be addressed in the other two books:<P>What was Shimomura's real relationship with Lottor, an ex-hacker and former roommate of Poulsen? Why were the two working together to disassemble cell phone software? What practical application could this possibly have, other than for illegal ESN cloning and eavesdropping? Was Shimomura being covertly employed by the NSA, Air Force, or some other government agency? Why is Shimomura considered a top-notch "security expert" when his computers were systematically violated over the course of many months? Why do Shimomura and the FBI insist that certain valuable applications were being stolen from Shimomura's computer, when at least some of these same programs are freely available on the internet? Why was Markoff permitted to write (uncorrected, in the NY Times) that just before he was caught, Mitnick had attempted to destroy an entire ISP, when in fact the damage was restricted to erasing only a small portion of one backup tape?<P>Two people benefitted most from the hype surrounding the arrest and criminalization of Mitnick: Shimomura and Markoff. Much of Mitnicks' "crimes" were nothing more than unsubstantiated accusations. Yet the two detectives managed to parlay the bust into a $750k book advance, movie rights, fame, etc., at the expense of Markoff's journalistic integrity.<P>This book is a must read for anyone looking for an honest account of events, free from self-serving rhetoric of Shimomura and Markoff, and the biases of the mainsteam media.</span>

                    <span>Littman tries hard in this book to make Kevin Mitnick out to be a noble hero, but it doesn't quite work. I admire the effort, though, and feel like it is a much more honest take on the subject than John Markoff's Takedown - which is, in my opinion, a truly bad book. If you're a hacker, there's lots of good information in The Fugitive Game. For a fuller understanding of Kevin Mitnick's life, and the fascinating and twisted world he comes from, as well as a nicely balanced appraisal of his crimes, I'd recommend Jeff Goodell's The Cyberthief and the Samurai.</span>

                    <span>If you're interested in the technical side of Mitnick's computer vandalism, you won't find it here. You will, however, get a glimpse into his personality and lifestyle, as well as an idea into those of other famous computer criminals of the '90s.<BR>It is well written, however, as Littman is a professional writer. Contrast this with "Takedown," in which you're given a lot of techical information, but the writing is a bit less refined, as Shimomura makes his living as a scientific computing expert.<BR>Take it for what it is.</span>

                    <span>I wish this book had been focused on the media coverage of "hackers." The book does expose how tech companies, and the media, especially Markoff from the NY Times, exploited Mitnik and his story. It also shows the incompetance of the FBI and other agencies in dealing with Mitnik, trying to make him an example for others and nearly making him a martyr instead. This story has no heroes, and its painfully noticeable that even the author is milking the "hacker" phenomenon for what its worth. It is the pathetic world of a computer prankster, his malicious "friends" and a host of others determined to pad their resumes with Mitnik's misery. "The Watchman" was more informative and satisfying, however this is the most fair and balanced treatment of Mitnick's story I've read.</span>

                    <span>Everything I wanted to know about world-class hacking but was too much the "idiot" [to use hacker parlance] to pose the right and savvy questions. Bonus entertainment in cameo appearances by a John Markov - veritable Uriah Heep among reporters - who oozes slug-like across the page with every self-serving appearance. Littman is a clear-eyed researcher whose skill as a writer is matched by an uncanny ability to stay unfooled and unphased by others' shadowy agendas or hype.</span>
