                    <span>I am a proficient MSXML coder but i can't get what I want (knowledge about .Net XML programming objects) from this book because the author habitually relies on advanced concepts from related technologies to explain things. So unless you are a pretty competent .Net programmer and already proficient in ADO.Net/ADO you  will struggle to understand this book and struggle to understand the significance of what you are being told and why. I gave up and resorted to looking for articles on MSDN. Undoubtedly there is good stuff here but Mr Esposito writes as an extremely knowledgeable person for the already extremely knowledgeable person only. </span>

                    <span>Dino tells all in this superb and in depth look at XML on Microsoft's .NET platform.  The book is well organized, starting at the fundamental classes and then branching out to the high abstraction level .NET classes and other Microsoft products such as SQL Server 2000 and Internet Explorer.
<br />
<br />As an example of why this book is so wonderful, there have been several situations where I needed to do something in XSLT that just didn't seem practical (maybe not even doable).  The section on how to use standard .NET languages such as C# from XSLT is itself worth the price of admission.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that readers are expected to have a good grasp of XML; the book is a .NET book.

                    <span>Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else. <p>It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters 12 and 13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter 12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.<p>Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET</span>

                    <span>If you do much programming with MS tools, then you probably know Mr. Esposito's work.  I read his column monthly in MSDN and have the utmost of respect for him.<p>This book is why I feel like I do. XML is everything in .NET and you can't afford to ignore it.  I guess technically you can, but you'll really be limiting yourself.  Dino knows his stuff and can really explain it well.  He writes articles all the time, and his ability to communicate is rivaled only by his knowledge of the material.<p>i could go on and on about it, but there's too much to say to do it justice.  So let me sum it up in one sentence.  If you want program in .NET and you want to do it well, this book belongs in your library!</span>
