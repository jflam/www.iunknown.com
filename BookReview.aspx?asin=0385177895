                    <span>Some of the longer reviews will tell you how this I Ching integrates relevant art work with practical advice. I just wanted to second all the positive reviews here in saying that from looking at many I Ching books, this is the only one that really clicked with me. The art work is beautiful and the text is very illuminating. 5 +++ stars!</span>

                    <span>this is the best version of the I Ching out: each hexagram is accompanied by a relevant piece of traditional Chinese painting that helps the intuitive understanding of the message the hexagram intends to convey. Lively text translation that interprets the hexagrams on the four planes of existence: spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical aids in the interpretation of the hexagrams' messages as related to the areas the question might address. The tone is psycho-spiritual-social but written in everyday terms. <p> [...]</span>

                    <span>I own both this one and the I Ching Workbook and they are practically the same book, though this one doesn't have the spiral binding (which you'll need because you'll open it so much) but has the most beautiful, meditative paintings on each hexagram. The pictures give you a profound inner sense of the truth of each throw of the coins, transforming the experience into a deeply effective tool for inner growth. Not to be confused with the Art of War or the Tao Te Ching, the I Ching focuses mainly on political relationships and the development of character as one navigates one's way through professional and personal relationships. The main thing you'll get from using the I Ching is, to learn which situations you can definitely change and which ones you should just let pass. It also shows you where you are in the development of goals and what to prepare yourself for, as you go on. Start with one question, and when you read the answer, if you have deeper questions, ask them too. You'll get amazing answers.</span>

                    <span>If you have to read reviews about I-Ching books this is the first book you need to buy.  The study of the I Ching begins with practice by consulting the oracle not with immediate attempts at understanding-especially for the Western mind.  This version of the I Ching is the easisest way to make that first step.  You read a few paragraphs on instructions to throw three pennies and begin an adventure that can last from a few minutes to a lifetime.  Despite its ease of use, this book is a complete work unto itself shold you choose to go deeper.  It has ample references to history and more subtle interpretations.  A glimpse of Western understanding may be obtained by reading Carl Jung's foreword in the Baynes/Wilhelm interpretation.</span>

                    <span>A colleague gave me this book 15 years ago and I have found it immensely helpful ever since.  I generally consult this I Ching whenever I am in a transition or under stress and want some wise advice.  Six throws of 3  pennies and I am on my way to excellent guidance.  I am so glad that R.L.  Wing took the time to give such a pleasant and easy to use version of a  very complex oracle.  I have shown others how to consult this I Ching and  have bought many copies for friends.  This book has given me an education  in life, relationships and the way this world works--it is full of basic  truths to live by.  My copy is almost falling apart from hard use!</span>
