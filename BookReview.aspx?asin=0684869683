                    <span>While this book provides a nice historical perspective on Goldman, it is one sided. Traders or bankers, who's bigger? What about the rest of the firm, who work their pants off and get the crumbs? Supposedly people are the greatest asset of Goldman, but Hank Paulsen said a couple of years ago that 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work. I'd say 20% of the people earn 80% of the money (or more like 95%). While GS is a good company, it is not the only one on the street and it definitely does not have "the best and the brightest" folks out there - they aren't building spacecraft, just making money...</span>

                    <span>Although it is clear from Ms. Endlich's tone that she nearly workships everything about Goldman Sachs, this is a well researched and competently written book. It covers in detail the history of the bank, paints portraits of some of the key players in some detail and presents a compelling overall picture of the bank's history.<p>Where the book falls short is in its financial and overall business details (compare to "The House of Rothschild" by Niall Ferguson). Overall, and interesting and insightful read.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book too, just like the one on Sandy Weill's ascent.  The book shows why Goldman is great... and bad.  Sometimes it glorifies GS too much (yawn at the richest and most powerful people in America allusions) but is certainly an interesting read. <p>I give it two thumbs up!</span>

                    <span>I read this book right before joining Goldman Sachs and was tremendously excited about it.  I joined in 1999, right after the IPO (yes, I missed out).  Despite the apparent glorification of the company, I did feel like its culture of teamwork and "long term greed" was present in everything my teams did, which the book does a good job of portraying.<p>It is clear the author appreciates the company very much and that this is a somewhat endorsed biography of the firm, yet I enjoyed reading it nonetheless.  It is refreshing to see a former employee write a positive book after so many recent cases of employees leaving only to criticize their former employers.</span>

                    <span>If you are expecting a balanced book about Goldman Sachs, don't buy it.  However, it is the only book available on GS -- undoubtedly because the author had the prior consent of employees who knew it would be written favorably.  GS is showered with so many complements and few criticisms, that this books should be passed out to employees as a morale booster or to pump up new recruits!  Three other specific points:<p>1)  Ms. Endlich was a FX trader for GS in the early 1990's... which becomes painfully obvious.  Her bravado and excitement about high profile trades and big traders are elevated to romantic proportions.  She entirely lacks any perspective on corporate strategy.  Her financial accounting skills are woefully weak; for example, the high "profit" of GS is used in its venacular to cover everything such as a rumored trading profit (pre-expenses) to pre-tax ROE of Limited Partnership compared to after-tax profit of corporations.  Finally, her disdain towards the "conservative" banking side of GS leads to superficial views of the whole business.  This ain't no Jack Welch book by an author with true business knowledge.<p>2)  I am no English language teacher, but shame on the editor(s) of this book!!  Her English is horrific and a disgrace to the publisher.  For instance,  "him and John" should be "John and he"; when someone is speaking usually one uses quotations (pg208); run-on sentences are usually solved by periods; and, the endless use of commas don't replace unclear expressions.  Incredible it was published, eh?  Henry James would be impressed.<p>3)  She misses one big point... "The Culture of Success" of any firm is relative.  Although this book is not about the industry, her unbalanced description of GS's strong inward culture is reinforced by her clear bias towards internal benchmarks of what makes success.  Looking in the mirror every morning and calling oneself pretty doesn't make a good book.  Ultimately, she never addresses the bureaucracy of a large partnership (exemplified by large law firms today), why other firms innovated more products, what departed/booted partners feel, or what do customers really think about GS's famed "client focus". <p>In sum, if you just want to read some propoganda yatta yatta, go ahead and buy it... but then again, there always is reality.  I don't work in banking or for any competitor of GS, but I am sure that they may have even a stronger opinion against this book.</span>
