                    <span>I've seen this book in the store over and over again, and never purchased because enough of the drama! My friend (Crystal) tells me to read it the girl talks just like you. So ok I get the book and I was hooked. I think this was a great read, fast funny and to the point. She didn't tell me this story was so close to me.  I could have written it!  Ms.Hunt I feel you trust me I do.</span>

                    <span>Jill Hunt did not disappoint me with Drama Qeen. The story grabbed my attention from the jump and I could not put the book down. I found so much of my own life and the life of my girlfriends in Kayla's that it was unreal!!!! Terrell was the man and definitely my favorite character! We need more brother's around like him. What I liked most about this book was that it was 1. Well written and 2. Had many positive elements regarding friendship and sisterhood. Drama Queen is up there with the best of them, and she undoubtedly has a fan in me for life!!! </span>

                    <span> Kayla is a young woman trying to make it in life like every one else.She wants what ever woman wants a good man but all she keep getting into is drama.Still in love with ex. but the man lays and creat. Kayla found a new man but a new man ain't always the best thing. Some times you end up with more drama, drama no woman wants to have.I think this a good book for all woman to read because a lot of man are living screat lives and lie about. It's not right. </span>

                    <span>Bravo to La Jill on her first novel!!!!!  Kayla Hopkins is a very well thought out realistic character who's naive misjudgement instantly turned her into a Drama Mama.  Her day to day routine consist of working two jobs to make ends meet and desperately trying to get over an unfaithful ex-fiance'(Geno), who she is still very much in love with.  She has many good friends (Roni, Tia, Yvonne & Terrell) that are affectiately truthful in helping her see her reality when things are clouded.  Disregarding Roni's advice on her rebound date with Craig was the most important ingredient for avoiding a hot dish of DRAMA!  Angelica is her raunchy, maniplulative, devilish sister who surpasses the character's wicked ways on the RUGRATS!  Overall, this book was the bomb diggity!  Just when you think things have gotten worse, you best believe there's still more drama to follow!   </span>
