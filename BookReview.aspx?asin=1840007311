                    <span>Hugh Johnson's pocket wine books have been my companions for the past 6 years. The 2004 edition is no exception, with its clear, sensible advice, judicious layout and helpful hints. <P>The contents are divided into major regions (in most cases, by country, although Bordeaux gets its own section), so Cheval Blanc is not followed by Chianti or Chimney Rock. Each region is clearly marked with a handy color tab visible of the edge of each page. I've tried other pocket guides where the wines were in simple alphabetical order with all regions mixed together, and had a much harder time finding the wines and missed the "browsing" fun provided by Johnson's format.<P>The book uses a simple 4 star rating (a delightful antidote to the preposterous 100 point system), and easily understood symbols to identify bargain wines, good years and which vintages are ready to drink. There is a brief but amazingly complete section on pairing wine and food (the best I've seen, to which I refer often), summaries of the vintages of each region, along with brief information about grapes, serving and tasting wine.<P>When it comes to wine, your taste and opinion are all that matters. But whether you are just starting to navigate the world of wines, or are a seasoned connoisseur, this book will help your journey.</span>

                    <span>I have learned more about the wines of the world in this powerful, yet tidy-sized and easy to navigate encyclopedia, than from any other source. Since I run an event and catering company that holds a wine license and serves a sophisticated clientele, this book is on my desk and within an arms-reach at all times. When I write menus and I'm not sure where to go with the wine, regardless of the varietal or the vintage, I reach for this book. HJ uses a very easy-to-comprehend star system that rates the winemaker or the vinter. This in my opinion, is the single most-important tool to have in hand when making a wine decision - knowing the winemaker! The only thing better is to talk with the winemaker one on one - if you are so lucky!<P>If you love wine and want the best wine lesson without going to wine classes, this is the book for you.</span>
