                <span id="Label1">Fifteen-year-old wannabe philosopher Luther T. Farrell knows a few things about life. He knows the Sarge (his rich, shrewd, slumlord mom) is tougher than nails and that he better not cross her. He knows his chances of using Chauncey, the ancient condom in his wallet, are slim to none. And, he knows that despite his goal to attend Harvard, he may end up stuck in Flint, Michigan, cleaning toilets in his mom's loathsome empire. Luther spends much of his time helping the Sarge run "Happy Neighbor Group Homes" around the city, including shaving and bathing elderly men and driving residents around with an illegal license. In spare moments he tries to win first place in the science fair at school and hang out with his best friend Sparky, all the while fantasizing mightily about his one true love, the beautiful Shayla.<p>  Readers will be moved as Luther, a thoroughly decent if sometimes naive boy, rails against his mother's cold, ruthless notions of what it takes to get ahead in the world. Up-to-the-minute slang and pop culture references will resonate with teen readers, as will the funny, first-person narrative; crisp, often hilarious dialogue; and wonderfully vivid characters. Christopher Paul Curtis, winner of the Newbery Medal for <I>Bud Not Buddy</I> tells a warm, witty, heart wrenching story where the good guy gets his due. (Ages 12 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book.  
<br />
<br />Parents and educators, however, should know that there are sexual themes that make it more appropriate for more mature readers.  These themes make it a very different book from "Bud Not Buddy."  Sexuality *is* dealt with in a fairly responsible manner--others have mentioned Luther's condom so at least he's thinking about having *safer* sex!--but it is still pretty frank. I wouldn't just hand this to any given fourth grader.
<br />
<br />Also Luther's mother and her boyfriend are *so* threatening to him that I think this book could be upsetting to children who are sensitive to stories about children who are emotionally abused by parents.  (Although, that said, Curtis does a great job of explaining how Luther's mother came to be the way she is.  Not to excuse her but she is a fully formed character.)
<br />
<br />Again, an excellent book, but one probably best for older or more mature children within the reading level.</span>

                    <span>After being controlled by his ruthless, loan-sharking mother, "the Sarge," who owns an empire of slums and halfway houses, 15-year-old Luther discovers a way to buck the sarge and gain his independence.

                    <span>As much as this book is similar to Bud, Not Buddy, it is just as different. It has a great protaganist. Mr. Curtis creates a strong character in Luther, and he has a well-portrayed friend, Sparky, with him. The situations between Bud, Not Buddy and this book are similar (both boys are escaping from something), but this book is geared more toward the YA crowd.
<br />
<br />The story itself kept me guessing for a while. I didn't know where Mr. Curtis was going to take the story. I was hooked. Luther and Sparky's adventures were funny, yet Luther's revelations were always interesting.
<br />
<br />The characters worked well together. Everything connected perfectly: from the Sarge's relationships with Luther and Darnell to Sparky and Luther and Chester X.
<br />
<br />Luther's story was funny and well written. I liked how the book was unpredictable. That made everything great. Mr. Curtis did a fine job with this. 
<br />
<br />I loved this book, and I think many other readers will also like this.</span>

                    <span>Bucking the Sarge by newberry award winning author Christopher Paul Curtis who also wrote Bud not Buddy. Luther's mom runs a very strict home business, group homes, and loan shark loan service. Luther himself is organized and a philophoser. He runs a group home, drives them places, takes care of them, shaves them, and is only 15. His best friend Sparky and he himself do all sorts of stuff. He tells a lot about his past and memories that get branded into your mind. Though it is a very good book, it does have some inappropriate language in it and the book jacket says 12+.</span>

                    <span>Luther T. Farrell, philosopher and scientist, has a lot going for him in matters of the mind, but not so much when it comes to women. Women do nothing but complicate his life.
<br />
<br />First, there's beautiful and talented Shayla Patrick. Luther's relationship with Shayla would be perfect if it weren't for the fact that he and Shayla are rivals in the school science fair and are, well, sort of not dating.
<br />
<br />The other woman in Luther's life is his mother, better known as the Sarge. The Sarge, dispenser of advice and high-interest loans, is one of the richest women in Flint. She got where she is by milking the system ("If it's got nipples, I'm going to milk it," she says) and becoming a government hating slumlord. Luther knows the Sarge is crooked, but he does all he can to stay on her good side.
<br />
<br />When his gold-medal science fair project lands him in some serious hot water with the Sarge, Luther gets creative and joins forces with his loyal if slightly harebrained sidekick Sparky to put the Sarge in her rightful place.
<br />
<br />Readers of Christopher Paul Curtis's previous books, including THE WATSONS GO TO BIRMINGHAM: 1963 and BUD, NOT BUDDY, will recognize Curtis's trademark humor and resilient characters. BUCKING THE SARGE, however, has a much darker tone and is serious through the laughter. Luther passes his fear of his ruthless mother onto the reader, but it is that fear that makes him reach inside himself and become someone strong, a character --- and a book --- worth cheering for.
