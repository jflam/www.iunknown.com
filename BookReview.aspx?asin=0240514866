                    <span>Although this book is not for everyone, I found it to be the best explanation and reference for many aspects of photography.   Unlike other books, this goes into depth to explain the technology well.   It is the kind of book that explains Density vs. Exposure curves, color balance and white point temperature (even mireds), lens, cameras, studio lights, etc, etc.   It doesn't go into great depth of how to actually compose and capture a great picture, but it does go a long way to explaining how the tools work at a level that engineers or technology-savy people will appreciate.</span>

                    <span>This book (5th edition) provided a few good, new tips and explainations, but my overall impression is one of incredibly technical detail on the practical aspects of equipment and processes.  I feel like it's important enough to have a general understanding of "how things work" to stick with this book, but it does not give much advice on how to think about or approach photography.  My eyes often glaze as they pass over how to read manufacturers' charts and graphs, how calculate focal length and color balance, etc., but if you're into that kind of information, you might be interested.</span>
