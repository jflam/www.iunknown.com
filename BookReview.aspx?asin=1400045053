                <span id="Label1">The author of <b>How to Know God</b> provides help for healing deep trauma&#8212;whenever it arises&#8212;so we may find peace in ourselves and in our world.<br><br><br>Terror came from the sky, and afterward the world would never be the same. September, 11, 2001, defined tragedy for a generation. On that day Deepak Chopra found himself driving from city to city, meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering. In response he has written <b>The Deeper Wound</b>, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished.<br><br>The opening section, &#8220;In the Face of Tragedy,&#8221; defines suffering as the pain that threatens to make life meaningless. When our deepest needs go unfulfilled, suffering begins. We begin to heal when we go beyond personal anger and fear to a realization of our true self, the self that was never afraid and can never be wounded.<br><br>The true self contains the light that no darkness can attack. Having described a path of awareness and compassion that leads to the light, the second half of <b>The Deeper Wound</b> takes us there through &#8220;A Hundred Days of Healing,&#8221; daily affirmations, exercises, insights, lessons, and questions&#8212;each a step out of pain toward a higher reality. &#8220;We can become living memorials to tragedy by restoring the power of life,&#8221; writes Deepak Chopra. &#8220;You are that life, you are that power. Let us see if we can find the spark that will make the spiritual flame spring up.&#8221;<br><br><br>Healing yourself comes in two stages&#8212;first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul&#8217;s energy. It is a gentle and fragile path, very much like holding on to a thread as it leads you from step to step.<br><br>If you take the time to listen to the voice of silence, you will be astonished at the power you have at your command, however long that power has been overlooked.<br><br><br>A portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher from the sale of this book will be donated to the Red Cross to aid in humanitarian relief efforts around the world.<br></span>

Meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering, Deepak in response has written The Deeper Wound, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished.

                    <span>The scars of deep wounds are not yet healed when terror knock down the WTC Towers six months ago and here again, the endless natural and man made catastrophe leaves its trails of unforgetful memories of deeper wounds - trauma and hurt with recent Communal Riots in India and Earthquake in Afghanistan. Deepak Chopra in Deeper Wounds describes the emotional states that people go through after a traumatic event so as not to get a person mired with stages of fear, anger, anxiety, shock, helplessness and depression. Deepak uses the perspective to spill off hate from the heart to scratch off the emotional wounds. The author explains that healing yourself comes in two stages-first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul's energy. In the face of tragedy, the first section of the book defines suffering as painful and way of life to a 'Hundred days of Healing', daily assertion, exercises, lesson plans and insight to sparkle up the spiritual flame to heal the wounds inside. Deepak's book is in response to the affected people in the tragedy of the twin towers, a portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher would be donated to Red Cross and charities on humanitarian grounds. A deeper wound is an exceptional book that raises psychological and spiritual issues raised by the attacks at WTC. Chopra deals with spiritually acceptance of 'Where was God when you need him most?' by helping to understand and cope up with trauma situations and overcome negative emotional hurt to restore strength and faith back to gear. He believes and pens down that evil is a form of egoism and describes the power of compassion and awareness. I wish Deepak would once again inspire, encourage and heal the pain of victims of Communal riots in Gujarat and help them tackle to overcome emotional outbursts of hate, waning tolerance, ego, anxiety, fear and violence. A human relationship is on threshold of shattering faith and during these times, Religious differences blur the image of God's world of peace.</span>

                    <span>What makes the reviewer think one has to read a book to review it? Deekpak spends a lot of time on the TV book promotion trail talking about his latest masterpiece -- a cashing in on the tragedy of others sorrow. Now it seems the author has leaped from the specific tragedy of 9/11 to the generalized tragedy which inflicts the six billion souls on the globe. That he has found a new garb for his garu tongue adds little to the price of sweat in China. That world suffering never diminishes is probably the best evidence not to spend time with these heavily spaded up fields of soothing herbal salve. None of the readers can point to any specific, verifyable first aid this book has provided for their wounds. Writers who take out a lease on wearing the garu hat never offer any authenticity to their generalized claims of relieving life's agony. I think the five stars are to soothe their own pain.</span>

                    <span>I am shocked that a previous reviewer would "dis" this book while at the same time admitting she had not read it . . . However, her negative review DID prompt me to "give the book a chance." I read it -- and I am very glad I did. When it comes to Dr. Chopra, I've been a skeptic. But this time, he is offering a much-needed resource for healing in one of our country's most difficult times. It's long been said that what we refused to deal with just goes underground and bides its time. Dr. Chopra offers us the methods and processes we need post 9/11 to begin the process of deep healing as a human community. It's never to late to begin. Read this book today --I wager you'll be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>This is an all around aid to persons that are down in character or are hurting, but also for anyone seeking a bit of cheer. A spiritual and physical book that uses mental and scientific medical reasoning to set you on "your" right track. In my opinion the author did not write this new book to take advantage or profit, I believe he is sincere and made an honest attempt at putting this together to help. The write is supported, well researched and delivers the message so it is easily understood. That is the one reason why this book is in fact helpful, I do see it helping many people if they are open minded.<BR>A super book that actually did help me and I strongly recommend, presents a powerful message of meaningfulness and destiny is SB 1 or God author is Karl Mark Maddox.</span>
