                    <span>Of all the SQL tuning books available on the market, this one provides the most depth. It provides solid, easy to follow examples. The flaw in this book is that it just provides 'techniques' for improving performance. It's basically a book that is useful for trial and error SQL tuning. <p>When tuning SQL you should think in terms of sets and essentially 'What can I do to make the optimizer do the least work?' This book does not teach you to do that. I've yet to see one book that does. It also only discusses response time. Response time is an ends and is not a means in SQL tuning. By reducing the amount of work Oracle has to do, you improve response time. <p>There is one serious inaccuracy in this book. I emailed the author about this and he did not respond. The author states that you can improve response time of updates, by wrapping them inside of a PL/SQL cursor. This is not only inaccurate, it's not even close. Not only does it take twice as long in Oracle 8i(slightly less in 9i), but it also increases logical I/Os significantly. How something this inaccurate could be missed in a major publication astounds me. To be fair, the 8i version of Steven Fuersteins PL/SQL book has the same inaccuracy(I have not read the 9i version). <p>The rest of the book seems accurate. I recommend it, but beware that inaccuracy. I have not tested everything the author has stated, but I have not found any other inaccuracies.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book cover to cover and more. I have been using this book since 1998 and I still have to say it is good book.It is one of the Oracle Classics. It is a little outdated. If you look at the cover it clearly states it covers to oracle 8i. If you still have 8i databases this is a good book. if you are using 9i and cost based optimization it is still useful but it will not pick up on some of the newer fetures of the CBO. If you use Rule based optimization(RBO) than it is a good book. I had actually used this book as a teaching guide when I use to teach SQL Tuning for an application software company who uses oracle database.  I look forward to when the revised version does ship.</span>

                    <span>Oracle performance tuning has become more critical for dba's and developers to master as database are approaching 10 plus terabytes.   Some of the newest concepts have really improved performance and speed in which data can be found and retrieved.  Some of this concepts include function based indexes, bitmap index, partitioning, parallel queries, and optimization hints.  The basic starting permise is to make sure your system has enough memory and hardware processing speed.  Two branches of thought have emerged when focusing on performance improvement: improved system tuning and improved Optimizer decisions.  The Oracle DBA must become familar with how to tune operating system performance and database performance.   Some of the valuable indicators are data cache hit ratios, Disk I/O activity, library cache, buffer hit ratios, and shared pool memory.  Various views, scripts, tools, and data tables give the DBA insight into how the database is performing.   It is safe to assume the database will grow and performance will vary from time to time.   By monitoring and adjusting parameters the Oracle database can achieve relative performance to growth.  If performance drops add more hardware or change object schema designs to reflect the data loads.  Oracle has offered two amazing database architectures: dedicated server and Multiple Transaction Server.   Each architecture has its advantages.   From a developer's view performance of the schema objects are important, such as, tables, views, indexes, and PL/SQL.   The Optimizer evaluates system statistics to decide how to retrieve data, whether it be by full table scans, index range scans, or join table sorts.   Each type of index should be evaluated: single indexes, multiple field indexes, partitioned indexes, bitmap indexes, and function indexes.    In some cases, it will make sense to use bitmap indexes for data that is relatively static.  In other cases it will make sense to use function based indexes where data search on alpha data is complex.  Yet in another case it will make sense to use a partitioned index where the data tables have been spread over multiple partition sectors and datafiles.    Sometimes usage of indexes is not need and full tables scans are better.   The developer uses the optimizer execution plan to see how the data will be retrieved.  At first the execution plan may seem confusing, but understanding Oracle database architecture will make the plan readable.  I've personally found that keeping the database statistic current and using oracle hints (ordered,index,and parallel)  provided the best return on my performance improvements.  Table joins is another critical area of performance tuning to grasp.  There are a number of join types: nested loops, sort merge, cluster, hash, and index.   The optimizer decides which type of join to use based on statistics and available indexes and constraints.  The helpful advice, I can give you for purchasing this book is that there are PL/SQL optimization techniques to consider.  One I found helpful was to use Packaged procedure calls from triggers rather than putting the PL/SQL code to execute in the trigger.  I recommend adding this book to your library.</span>

                    <span>I had a nagging and peculiar performance problem with a specific query involving a quirk in the Oracle optimizer which I had been trying to solve on and off for months. With the help of this book, I resolved the problem. It has a level of detail in query optimization way beyond other "highly recommended" books. The explanations are clear, *complete* (completeness was lacking in the other books), and easy and enjoyable to read. I finally have the understanding of these Oracle internals that I have been seeking!</span>

                    <span>If the idea of slow database response scares you, this is a good place to start.  You hear "tuning a database" a lot, but most of it comes too late.  There are some queries that no disks, no CPU, and no amount of memory can speed up.  Guy Harrison (well named) is expert on tuning SQL, and knows how to write about it in a way that makes it easy for you to benefit.<p>Besides giving you lots examples of how SQL and PL/SQL can work well, Guy shows you how to use the tools (explain plan, SQL*Trace, Tkprof) that let you know when you are getting close. Actually, he points out that you need to set performance goals early on, and keep testing to see if you are on track; if you don't do that early, it may be too late when you realize you need help.  One of my favorite sections is on tuning joins and sub-queries and the accompanying graph showing 197,664 block gets if you do it wrong (wrong index), and 45 if you do it right (using pl/sql instead of correlated subqueries).  <p>The title of this review aside, Guy has good sections on tuning an instance, looking at instance settings and hardware, that can be helpful if you get the application working well and still have slow response times, but most of the chances to have an application that works are available during planning and development, and this book defintely helps there. If you like working with Oracle, and want to know more, you will benefit from this book.</span>
