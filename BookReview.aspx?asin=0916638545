                    <span>I agree w/ the previous reviewer: this is really a wonderful book<BR>but for the asking price, it's too brief. However, for those who love to "book search" it's delightful to read of the author's finds. Highly recommended, elegiac and wry.</span>

                    <span>This is a book about books. The author describes some of his more interesting finds in the book world.<P>This book was an interesting read. The author's wondefully breezy writing style was enchanting and fun to read. His anecdotes on various book finds made you feel as though you were right next to him.<P>So why the 3 stars?<P>This book took me exactly 2 hours to read! It is compact and has so few pages, that I felt a little discouraged from the start.<P>This author truly is entertaining with his stories and if his career spans over 40 years, surely he could have added a couple more (like maybe a 100 or so more) pages to the book. Just as I was starting to really get into it, the book ends.<P>I was also put off by the cost of the book. $20.00 for 2 hours of reading is expensive!<P>However, if you like books on books that are a fun read, this is the book for you.</span>
