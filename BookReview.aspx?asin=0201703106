                    <span>I recommend this the book to all experienced programmers interested in learning the Win32 API. It covers all the core system services that you need to learn first. If you need to tackle the GUI you can try 'Programming Windows' by Petzold. Of course I'd suggest that you go the .NET route or get a good toolkit (not MFC) instead. If you want to move on to more advanced Win32 programming try 'Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows' (if you can find a copy). To get into deeper system programming, you'll have to move on to the Undocumented/Native API books.</span>

                    <span>This book is roughly the same as Steven's "Advanced Programing in the Unix Environment". It gets you in touch with the moving pieces of the Windows operating system.<p>Bring with you a strong understanding of C/C++ and some experience administrating a Windows system and you can be up and running banging against the operating system's APIs. Open network sockets, play with "Thread Local Storage", create and register your very own service, interface with the security system, whack around the registry, and a dozen other ways to shoot yourself in the foot or get some actual work done.<p>This book has almost nothing about making windows, graphics, sounds, or anything else that will help you get started making yet another accounting application. If that's what you are looking for look somewhere else.<p>This book also comes threateningly close to being a good beginners guide to porting *nix applications to the Windows operating system. The author draws many parallels to various *nix utilities and how to write their equivalent using Windows' APIs.<p>For those that like plenty of rope to hang themselves, this is the book for you. I enjoyed learning about the various facilities Windows provides the developer, and feel that this book helped me gain a better understanding of where to look first for doing fairly common relatively low-level tasks.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I read. The description is clear. It used some UNIX commands to introduce some functions, but the reader needs not to have UNIX background, just skips those short description. <br>If the author gave all system routines line by line, the book would be huge, it is not necessary ( we can tell from the title), and the price will be double. As a programmer, I like this book.</span>

                    <span>This book pretty much covers everything I needed to know about Win32 system programming.  It has very good coverage of topics like threading, file handling, Memory Management, Interprocess communication, network programming, and asynchronous I/O with completion ports.  Ever wonder how to share memory or access really, really huge files?  Want to learn how to build more scalable servers?  This book covers all that and more.  I recently took a new job that uses all of this stuff and I was relieved to find a book that covered it all so well.<p>He gives a very good generalized view of the windows programming philosophy and explains some common windows types and their uses, which helps in understanding the rest of the API.  There are plenty of programming examples and he often compares Win32 programming techniques to UNIX programming techniques giving references to the Stevens book which will help put things in context for UNIX programmers.<p>For client side programming you can get by with Petzold but for server side this book is a must.  If you do system development on Win32 then this book is your weapon.</span>

                    <span>1. While this book is not a real reference book since it is not complete at all, many pages are wasted by listing system calls with parameters. I expected more overall description of the system.
<br />2. It is only intereting if you want to compare UNIX with WIN32. On the other hand, the difference between Windows and UNIX are far beyond the "dry" kernel discussed in this book. Unless you are learning OS fundamentals, which is not the case for any one familiar with UNIX, it is not a exciting reading without OLE and Windows. My point is that neither UNIX expert nor Windows enthusiast would find this book worthwhile their time.
<br />3. I'm still reading it. It is not useless. But it failed my expection built on all other reviews and the classical looking.</span>
