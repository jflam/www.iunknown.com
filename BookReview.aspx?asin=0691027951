                <span id="Label1">At the very beginning of his book on <I>i</I>, the square root of minus one, Paul Nahin warns his readers: "<I>An Imaginary Tale</I> has a very strong historical component to it, but that does not mean it is a mathematical lightweight. But don't read too much into that either. It is *not* a scholarly tome meant to be read only by some mythical, elite group.... Large chunks of this book can, in fact, be read and understood by a high school senior who has paid attention to his or her teachers in the standard fare of pre-college courses. Still, it will be most accessible to the million or so who each year complete a college course in freshman calculus.... But when I need to do an integral, let me assure you I have not fallen to my knees in dumbstruck horror. And neither should you."<p>  Nahin is a professor of electrical engineering at the University of New Hampshire; he has also written a number of science fiction short stories. His style is far more lively and humane than a mathematics textbook while covering much of the same ground. Readers will end up with a good sense for the mathematics of <I>i</I> and for its applications in physics and engineering. <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I> </span>

                    <span>The square root of negative one, commonly known as "i" has a certain otherwordly character to it; it is not a real number and is often referred to as imaginary. In its own way, however, i is quite real and an essential part of modern mathematics and the sciences; literally and figuratively, it adds another dimension to the world of math.<P>Nahin's book on the subject conveys the importance of i, but unfortunately does it in a tedious manner. He has written a book dense with proofs and equations, but rather lacking in history or personality. There is some material in here that of interest to all, but overall, I feel that this book is only for the serious mathematician. Despite his statement to the contrary, this requires more than a high school level of education to understand.<P>Interestingly, I found that this was the second book I'd read by Nahin; the first one was on time travel. What I remembered about this first book was that the author took an interesting subject and ran it into the ground; he does a similar thing here. While there is enough in An Imaginary Tale to be of interest to a mathematician, and while it does convey the importance of i, this book will remain inaccessible to readers who just want to be introduced to this interestinginly complex number.</span>

                    <span>When I first took a copy of Nahin's book off the shelf, I expected a history book operating under the usual rules that seem to dominate easy reading books on science today - no equations. What I found instead was an unexpected surprise that immediately cemented my decision to purchase the book - it is chuck full of equations. But then, how do you write a book about mathematics without using equations? I'm glad that for this one, at least, the publishers listened to reason.<P>Of course, the book isn't all equations. There is some downright interesting history in it as well. For the most part, however, this is a book that illustrates the equations (or at least their modern counter parts) that led mathematicians to develop the concept of the square root of a negative number, eventually leading to the branch of mathematics we call today complex analysis. Having said that, I should point out that this is not a mathematics book on complex analysis [for that, a better choice is "Complex Variables," by Mark J. Ablowitz and Athanassios S. Fokas, Cambridge University Press, 1997]. The author does not develop theorems or proofs, and many of the demonstrations stretch the notion of mathematical proofs - but they are not intended to be mathematical proofs at all, but just that - demonstrations. Think of this book as a mathematicians leisurely romp through the mathematical history of root negative one, with an average of at least two or three equations on every page. The mathematics isn't advanced by any means. If you are reasonably grounded in algebra, geometry, trigonometry (and lots of it), and a little calculus (including a few differential equations) you should have no trouble at all. Plan on working through the equations, though, step by step. You won't want to miss a single "aaaahhh."<P>I really have only two complaints about Nahin's book, both of which are really pretty minor. The first complaint is that none of the equations are numbered. This means the author is constantly saying things like "now go back to the first equation in the last section and notice ...." I found this sometimes hard to follow, and would have appreciated a few key equations having numbers (and a box) associated with them. Another complaint is that the book has some typographical errors in some of the equations that can sometimes interfere with following the derivations.<P>Don't misunderstand, though. This is one of the best leisure books on mathematics I've read in a long time. The author writes clearly, has an incredible breadth of knowledge, and presents some really beautiful mathematics. It was a real let down when I finally finished, and realized how tough it was going to be finding another book to which I would look with such yearning at the end of the day for a relaxing evening of intellectual entertainment.<P>The book begins with the story of cubics, and how their solutions involved the square root of negative numbers. From there the book moves toward early work, or the "first try" at understanding complex numbers. There is some interesting history about Rene Descartes and John Wallis, as well as stories about Casper Wessel, Gauss, Argand, Warren, Mourey, and, of course, De Moivre.<P>The books first three chapters have the most history. The last four chapters offer more examples of how complex analysis has played a pivotal role in science and technology. The author offers some interesting uses of complex analysis in the solving of integrals, trigonometric identities, Kepler's laws of satellite orbits, and, of course, circuit analysis in electrical engineering.<P>My favorite chapter by far is chapter six, titled "wizard mathematics." It seems there was a "aaaahhh" on at least every other page. This chapter is devoted to illuminating some of the mathematical prowess of wizards such as Euler, Bernoulli, Fagnano, Cotes, Riemann, and Schellback. Plan on using up at least one highlighter on this chapter alone.<P>Nahin ends with a chapter on complex analysis in the nineteenth century, and Cauchy's integral formulas (there is also a brief discussion and derivation of Green's theorem). Then, as with the other chapters, Nahin gives lots of examples of what you can do with these mathematical tools, and where they can take you.<P>Easily one of the best books I've ever read. If you love mathematics, your library really cannot be considered complete unless this book, tattered and worn with lots of dog-eared pages and scribbles all over the margins, is on the shelf.<P>Duwayne Anderson September 22, 1999</span>

                    <span>In high school and college mathematics courses it is generally stated that, since the square root of -1 cannot be expressed as any real number, it must be a so-called imaginary number, usually designated as i. Furthermore, any number multiplied by i, say 2i, is also said to be imaginary. So-called imaginary numbers generally cause even very bright students some discomfiture, as well they should. <P>But, in fact, i is not an imaginary number (whatever an imaginary number would mean); rather it is something quite real: a 90 degree rotational operator. Mathematical operators -- including rotational operators -- are beyond the average person's knowledge (or interest) of mathematics, but at least they are real. And they are also quite useful, not only in mathematics but in various fields on science and engineering.<P>In this fascinating book Nahin traces the history of the centuries-long struggles which the concept of negative numbers and, eventually, of their square roots caused both mathematicians and philosophers until an obscure Norwegian surveyor discovered the true meaning of i in 1797.<P>As a scientist who spent decades using i -- but never really accepted the traditional view that it is an imaginary number -- I was overjoyed when I finally discovered its real meaning.<P>Clearly this book is not for everyone; but it should be quite interesting to anyone who, like I, never full accepted the concept of an imaginary number.</span>
