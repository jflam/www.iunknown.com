                <span id="Label1">A mixture of so-so standup routines and comedy-music hybrids <I>a la</I> Adam Sandler, <I>Saturday Night Live</I>'s Jimmy Fallon provides just enough laughs on <I>The Bathroom Wall</I> to satisfy one's funny bone--for the first listen or two, anyway. Unfortunately, with the exception of his masterful impressions (a hilarious Bono among them) and the amusing Prince takeoff "Idiot Boyfriend," Fallon's shtick gets old pretty fast. On the music side, "Road Rage" has a few funny lines, but the Beastie Boys-inspired "(I Can't Play) Basketball" falls flat, as does the country-tinged "Drinking in the Woods." Meanwhile, for the standup portion, Fallon panders to his college audience with routines about "the walk of shame" and hotplates that might have worked in person, but on record sound shopworn and thin. As an impressionist, Fallon has a bright future, but he needs better material before putting out his next comedy record, even one as short (under 37 minutes) as this one.  <I>--Matthew Cooke</I></span>

                    <span>I am a huge Jimmy Fallon fan. So when I saw this one in the shops I bought it (I guess it's one of those things where you feel you have to prove to yourself you're a real fan)<BR>I was expecting a couple of his songs and then that was it.<P>But actually, his songs are great to listen to. There are about 5 songs. After that, Jimmy does improv acting and impressions to a live college croud. It is hillarious. Even if you are not a Jimmy fan, it is worth getting.<P>He closes the CD with "Hammer time" where Jimmy has found you can sing pretty much any 80's song to "Hammertime" and goes right ahead to show it. <P>So funny!!!</span>

                    <span>Being an Aussie, I'm a bit late to Fallon-fandom, but boy am I hooked now! <BR>Like Tenacious D, Jimmy's brand of musical comedy is made to last. Long after the jokes have worn out I'm still listening to Snowball and Road Rage, coz they sound great. (I have to admit, Idiot Boyfriend isn't the same without that hilarious video.) <P>Of course the other highlights of TBW are Jimmy's brilliant impressions amongst the Trolls, Hammertime and Chris Rock. His standup routine is now a thing of the past, so it's nice for fans to have some examples of his early work as his career forges ahead. <P>If you're fan of Fallon's many talents, or fan of musical comedy in general, this CD is definately for you. Funny stuff! :-)</span>

                    <span>Fallon is the new comedy superstar-to-be of today's SNL cast, and he shows off his talent here... especially his musical impressions, which (if you've seen his SNL work) are as spot-on as Weird Al at his best.<P>However, as others have noted already, this first effort doesn't rank up there with the best from Pryor, Martin and Carlin... heck, not even close. The problem is that Jimmy is almost TOO hip... his delivery and choice of material is spot-on for a single performance in front of a raucous college crowd, but there's not enough humor here to sustain listening over and over. (Think of McDonald's and their "1/4 pound before cooking" -- then imagine cooking that poor burger three or four times over.)<P>I think Jimmy is a real winner... and, come to think of it, Adam Sandler's first album wasn't his best, either. There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true... I predict we'll see much better from the big JF in the future.</span>
