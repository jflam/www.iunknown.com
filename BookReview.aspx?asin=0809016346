                <span id="Label1">Much historical writing is far more concerned with the players than the stage: narratives of kings and cabbage-merchants, although acted out in fields and forests, typically include nature only as a convenient prop to provide the occasional splash of color. In <B>Changes in the Land</B>, Cronon treats the land of New England with the same sensitivity and attention to detail as the lives of the American natives and the colonists--he depicts the effects of changing land-use patterns on the texture of the New England landscape, and gives voice to the changing communities of  trees, rock walls, and rivers. The chapter on the effects of changing notions of "property" on the ecology of New England are especially strong. <P> <B>Changes in the Land</B> is almost the equal of Cronon's masterpiece,  <i>Nature's Metropolis</i>, a monumental study of the ecological effects of Chicago on the entire central portion of the United States in the 1800s. Highly Recommended to specialists and general readers alike.</span>

                    <span>I read this book for an economic anthropology course in college and with no ecological background I thouroughly enjoyed it. For anyone interested in a general history of the early colonization of New England it is very interesting. You will learn things about New England before the colonists came that will change your views about the Indians relationship with their land forever. </span>

                    <span>What an outstanding work for what was essentially a one year graduate paper that accidentally became a book.  This is not as thorough as what he would end up writing for his dissertation: Nature's Metropolis, but still an excellent work!  Traces the natural history of New England and explores the difference between European and Native American relationships with the land and contrasts their concepts of "land ownership."  This difference led to a significant amount of the conflicts between Europeans and Native Americans.  The book discusses the process of the transforming the natural world to a series of commodities that largely shapes our current view of the natural world.
<br />
<br />This book is an essential work in the understanding of New England, but does not tell the complete story.  One should also look to Alfred Crosby's "Ecological Imperialism" for more of the story.  Also Carolyn Merchant's "Ecological Revolution" is a must read if you are interested in this topic.  Her book goes much deeper into exploring the inseparable role of human social dynamics in the natural history of New England.  Be warned! Merchant's book is not for the casual reader or amateur historian.  It is difficult reading and very complex social history.  It is geared towards a graduate school audience.  Reading Cronin's book first will likely make Merchant's book more understandable.  One might also want to check out Theodore Steinberg's "Nature Incorporated" if you're really interested in New England's environmental history.  This discusses water as a commodity, its industrialization and how this view came to pass.  This is very informative, but not very exciting read.  I once heard someone call it "the driest book on water ever written."  This is not to say however that it is not worthwhile to someone really interested in the subject.

                    <span>Even though I live in San Diego, I found this book to be well worth the read.  Dense but short, "Changes in the Land" gives a close reading to the ecological impact of British colonization in New England.  As Cronon states in his conclusion, this transformation has ramifications far outside New England, since the environmental degradation that accompanied early colonization forced settlers farther and farther afield.<p>Twenty years after it was published, the scholarship is still, what I would consider "cutting edge".  Cronon cuts across disciplines and primary sources to produce a nuanced model of the interrelationship of humans and the environment.  Cronon's work is just as interesting for his (to me, anyway) novel technique of writing a history where the personalities of humans take a back seat to the consequnces of their decisions.<p>The effect is at once radical and main stream.  Radical, in that Cronon strips away traditional justifications for human decisions that reinforce the implicit assumptions that cause those same decisions.  Main stream, in that he manages to stay away from the hyperbole and argument that plague revisions of history.<p>I've also read Cronon's "Nature's Metropolis", which is his book about the development of the city of Chicago. I would recommend that book, as well as this one, to anyone interested in the subjects that Cronon covers.  His scholarship is top notch.</span>

                    <span>This is a ecological history of New England from 1633 to 1855.  What began as heavily forested land abundant with wildlife, was slowly and inexorably domesticated and exploited.  By the 1840s, Henry David Thoreau comments that New England is now a tamed, emasculated country.  What would he think of New England today?</span>
