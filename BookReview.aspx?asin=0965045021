                    <span>But if you are reading this review there is hope for you.  I used to think I was pretty good because I could scare myself but after reading this book I found out I didn't know jack.  Modern sportbike technology and normal street riding mask the multitude of mistakes I made (and still make) along with most other uneducated and even arrogant riders.  By carefully and patiently reading and re-reading this book (I am on my 7th or 8th time through) then thinking about and applying the principles Keith Code lays out, my riding has transformed from jerky and on the edge of control (as track time made perfectly clear) to in control, confident and much safer.  Speed (on the track) and even safety comes as a natural result of control, which can only come through application of knowledge.  You will learn a lot even your first time through but be warned, only the patient and devoted will reap the full benefits.  If you want to be a factory star in a week you will be disappointed.  I have been re-reading this book for almost 2 years and each time I pick it up I do so as if I have not read it before.  This book is essential if you want to be in control and to reap the benefits thereof.  Some poor graphics and other editing oversights cost this book full 5 stars.  However, the content is what counts.</span>

                    <span>"Twist II" contains the most useful information to street riders, out of Code's three "twist"-series books. ("Twist of the Wrist" and "Soft Science" are decidedly more racetrack-oriented books and aren't really applicable for street riding, but if you race then those will be useful to you!) Code's discussion of Survival Reactions or "SR's", and his explanation of the results of applying certain inputs (brake, throttle, steering) to your motorcycle, in various situations, are the two most useful topics of this book, and are worth the price alone, whether you race on a track or ride on the street (and make sure you never confuse the two! ;-)</span>

                    <span>Keith has a lot to say, no doubt about it. He is surgically smooth with the words - just the necessary - except for the "definitions" at the end of each chapter, which are a waste of paper. <br>A lot of my techique progress it's due to this book. Great reading.</span>

                    <span>I don't know about everyone else, but when I read a book I learn from it.  There is a lot to learn in this book.  I am glad a I read it a few times already because I think what learned from it saved my skin the other day when I hit a large hole in a country road going about sixty or seventy in pretty good lean on a right hander.  I think my forks bottomed out because they made this ugly noise and the bike started bucking like a horse ( I don't have steering damper ).  I did what the book suggested in this instance:  I didn't get scared ( until later ), I relaxed, I got out of the saddle, balanced on the pegs, and gassed it.  Result:  bike stayed up and I didn't eat it.  Keith will tell you to trust your bike and let it do its thing, he says riders and their fears are the reason bikes go down and all you have to do is learn to be a good rider and let the bike do what it is designed to do.  Excellent advice.  This book might save your butt.  BUY IT AND READ IT OVER AND OVER.</span>

                    <span>This book directly addresses things the rider may have experienced but not been able to single out of the riding experience.  It's a great little guide for getting into your own head on a frightening corner, and once you've got a handle on the sources of your own behavior it's much easier to correct.<p>Very easy to read, clear and written to stress or repeat the main points - exactly what you need to get the ideas into your head to counteract implusvie actions and responses.<p>Does seem a little one note, as I haven't had track time yet.  I could summarize the book in one line: always roll on the throttle, don't let yourself chicken out.  ;)  This doesn't mean go crazy full-throttle everywhere and everyway, but the main safety point, changing your acceleration affects so many points of control on your bike - best to stay with smooth on no matter what your panic tells you to do.<p>Cornering diagrams and track advice is very interesting, all simply explained and convincing.  Would like to put some of the upper level stuff to practice, though the safety and mental examinations of rider behavior are valuable for all levels of street riders.  A keeper.</span>
