                    <span>This book is the finest written account of September 11, 2001 and the tragedy that prevails.  This book describes intimate accounts of persons in the towers trying to escape.  What moved me the most was at the end of the book when the writers interviewed the people a year or two after the tragedy.   Their feeligs were expressed in such a manner that allows me to understand what they experienced.  I know how I feel today, but I never imagined how some of the survivors live through each and every day of their lives.  This book brings the subject matter to light.
<br />
<br />I thought one of the most interesting parts of the book was the appendix which includes the Al Queda manual.  The instruction manual proves to the world that these people are in need of serious mental health help.  There were quite a few instructions which simply made me laugh.  Such as the terrorist trainee is told not to speak loudly.  Oh please, give me a break! Are these trainees that stupid?</span>

                    <span>I really wanted a detailed account and analysis of the events of that day and that first half of this book does just that in a gripping (though slightly truncated) fashion.   Unfortunately, the rest of it gets lost in the minutae of the investigation in Germany, background of terrorist groups, and personal details of the lives of survivors.  Nicely done, but not totally what I was after.</span>

                    <span>Accidentally, I picked up this book at the JFK Airport, New York. I read the whole book during my flight back to HK. Der Speigel succeeded in making me believe that the materials are reliable, yet the book is not so boring as an official report. It is a high standard report that leads one to look inside the 9-11 story and history. It is informative, elaborative, attractive and emotionally evocative.</span>

                    <span>This book keeps you occupied most during the reading of the painful 9/11 events. Although, a commendable compilation of terrorists  plan and attack , the authors in this book project the views that Muslims are dangerous. Authors, I think, are also biased towards religions. For e.g., (page 248, 4th paragraph, 5th line) "Probably a spoiled young man like Ziad, stumbled into the terrorist milieu the same way a Western teenager might fall in with religious sect on a vacation trip to Asia", by writing this, authors compare spoiled "young man" to "Western teenager" and "terrorist milieu" to "religions in Asia". Unfortunately, authors did not find any other analogy to compare the terrorism. By doing so, authors give an impressions that westerner attracted to Asian religion is a kind of terrorism (unacceptable) or Asian religions are equivalent to terrorism. It is sad that out of 18 authors none of them felt that this statement is not appropriate for this book. It only reflects author conservative views about (Asian) religions. In an increasingly polarized world, where a sense of unity, beyond religion, race and faith, needed to be nurtured, and valued, this kind of writing from a "popular" German newspaper is regrettable.
