                    <span>If you have no idea what Internet is and have never seen ebay web site then you might learn something from this book. But for an average Internet-savvy person it offers little to nothing. There is a lengthy description of well-know information (like terms of sale of ebay) and constant selling of ebay business model: nothing you can't read elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>The author "gets" eBay. Unfortunately, he was not granted interviews or access to eBay people. As a result, the book is little more than a collection of articles from the Industry Standard, Fast Company abd the like. Furthermore, the book covers eBay until December 1999 or Q1 2001 at most. Back then, it looked like Yahoo! had a business model, remember? And yes, the author contemplates the possibility of a Yahoo! takeover (which was possible) and even the ridiculous idea that eBay should perhaps create its own "portal" in order to grow... Not worth the money. Buy "The Perfect Store" by Adam Cohen instead.</span>

                    <span>This book gives an overview of ebay's creation and why it has been a success.  It gives no insider insights however.  It was fun to read but I did not learn much from it.  This book does not have substance.</span>

                    <span>This book is basically a series of quoted and sited magazine articles hastily cobbled together into a book.  The only "real" interviews done by the author are with a few eBay customers who use the site.  The author admits no one with eBay granted him an interview or let him in the building.  For a much better story of how eBay came to be, read eBoys by Robert Stross.</span>

                    <span>This book basically delivers what it promises to.  Lots of somewhat dry facts about how a small Internet business boomed into one of the hottest "sites" available.<p>I am a big Ebay fan.  I wanted to find out more about the people who created Ebay but also wanted to get a feel for the direction these people were hoping to guide the future of the site to.<p>Although I thought the story was fairly interesting, this book was very dryly written.  Not much was cited other than the absolute bare bones facts and the writing was not particularly interesting.<p>While I realize this is a business book, I think there was much room for interesting tidbits, advice or funny stories.  None here.  Too bad...</span>
