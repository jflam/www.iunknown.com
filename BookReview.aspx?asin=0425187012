                    <span>It's not hard to see why kids and adults alike are hooked on Harry Potter. He's a "highly unusual boy," and an unwitting hero who proves himself to be that hero. His is a truly inspired story--and it goes much deeper than fantasy. This book reveals the history and mythology that Rowling has worked into the books. As the afterword notes, the best and most imaginative writers are often great readers, and Rowling is indeed a great writer and a great reader. "Magical Worlds" reveals the intricate underpinnings of the captivating world of Harry Potter, and creates a deeper appreciation of the events, characters, and names. I myself have felt more of the terror of You-Know-Who's name after reading in this book what it literally means.</span>

                    <span>This book is written quite well, and uses a variety of resources to make it a wonderful insght into the magical world we have come to know and love. I like how they make references not only to the books themselves, but also to the myhtology that JK Rowling had to delve into in order to write the books. Very enjoyable!</span>

                    <span>This book stayed on the shelf at my bookstore until I finally gave in to temptation and purchased it.  I'd have to say that all in all this book was great fun to read.  The chapters were short, started with questions, and well written.  I have always loved Mythology and found the author's insight refreshing and light.  He wasn't trying to convince you he was right or wrong, he was just stating facts and giving insight to little nuances about J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World.  What a great way to bridge the gap between book 5 and book 6 of the Harry Potter Series.  I will be adding it to my reading list with my kids.  We currently are reading a chapter a night of the HP Series and I'll add that at the end.  They'll get a kick out of it.</span>

                    <span>Yesterday was our grandson's birthday and we gave him three choices for spending the day: a museum, a movie or a bookstore. To our delight, he chose the bookstore. He's read all the Harry Potter books published to date, but that didn't keep him from heading to that section anyway. He was convinced that a miracle would occur on his birthday and that there'd be a new Potter. It's great to be young and trusting! At any rate, he discovered The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter by David Colbert, began thumbing it and held it up, saying, "I knew there'd be something good!" The rest of the day was spent reading and eating birthday cake. He pronounced both excellent. That evening he quizzed us on what he had read and it was clear this book will hold him until the next Potter appears. Our thanks to the author for the reading experience and the curiosity it created in other books on history and mythology. I can't recommend it strongly enough.</span>

                    <span>Don't be fooled, all ye who are not Scholars! This book is one of the most incorrect books I have ever read! But, David Colbert cleverly disguises ignorance with eloquent words! (I'm not ignorant, by the way, in case you were thinking...). <p>1.Â Firstly, I'll touch on a less important mistake; the table of contents on the back of the paperback edition is faulty - it says there is a section on snakes; there is not! But that could merely be dismissed as an accident. It also states, "AND MORE!", when there is just one more (true, but rude). He also names each of his chapters with a question (i.e., "Why are mirrors magical?"), but often times does not answer the question!<p>2.Â Secondly, his information is faulty. He did not do he research he should have; for example, he says the grindylow and the jenny greenteeth are the same thing, when they most certainly are not! The grindylow, or grundylow, is a Yorkshire water goblin. Jenny Greenteeth, for one, is individual. She is an old hag that supposedly lives in Lancashire who LIVES IN A TREE hanging over a river. When travelors come by, she reaches out her spidery arm to catch her victim, which she devours with her green teeth.<p>3.Â He gives several bogus etymologies (historical roots of words). But the one that really gets my dander up is HIPPOCAMPUS (a horse of the sea). He states, "This sea horse gets its name from the Greek word for horse (hippos) and the latin word for ground (campus)." For those of you not educated in etymology, I would like to point out the first fatal flaw - Latin and Greek NEVER go directly together to make a word. Sometimes, a Greek word is Latinized and THEN is put together, but never without the Latinization. Second, however, is a flaw that even the most unscholarly would notice if they thought about - a sea horse's name meaning, "horse of the land"? Does that make any sense - at all? No. Third, all he would have had to do is look it up in a decent dictionary to find out that, though he was correct about "hippos", he was NOT correct about "campus" - that part is ACTUALLY from GREEK "kampos", meaning, "sea monster" - and thus we have, "equine sea monster".<p>4. The book is filled with useless information that just takes up more pages. It also shows a lack of imagination - for example, he takes up a whole page whith an excerpt from Tolkein about Shelob, the giant spider, when speaking about the "ancient history and legend" (what????) of acromantulas (J. K. Rowling's giant spiders).<p>On the whole, this book is just a waste of time. I would expect a lot more from David Colbert, who STUDIED mythology in Colledge - though, considering the book states he researches by "reading randomly in the library", it's not too surprising his book is so inaccurate. I recommend "The Sorcerer's Companion", by A. Z. Kronzek and E. Kronzek (father and daughter), which, though it does have its share of mistakes, is much more accurate, is more extensive, and is MUCH more lively and informative.</span>
