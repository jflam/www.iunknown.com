                <span id="Label1">In a nutshell, this book is about systems. This book is written for those thinkers and practitioners who have come to realize that while the whole is becoming more and more interdependent parts display choice and behave independently, and that paradoxes are the most potent challenge of emergent realities. <br><br>With a practical orientation and yet a profound theoretical depth, the book offers an operational handle on the whole by introducing an elaborate scheme called iterative design. The iterative design explicitly recognizes that choice is at the heart of human development. Development is the capacity to choose; design is a vehicle for enhancement of choice and holistic thinking. 'Designers', in this book, seek to choose rather than predict the future. They try to understand rational, emotional, and cultural dimensions of choice and to produce a design that satisfies a multitude of functions. They learn how to use what they already know and also about how to learn what they need to know. <br><br><br><br><br>  The imperative of interdependency, the necessity of reducing endless complexities, and the need to produce manageable simplicities require a different mode of thinking, a holistic frame of reference that would allow us to focus on the relevant issues and avoid the endless search for more details while drowning in proliferating information. While organizations as a whole are becoming more and more interdependent the parts display choice and behave independently. This is the dilemma this book tries to resolve. It is a unique, cutting edge work, with a practical orientation and yet a profound theoretical depth, which goes far beyond what is currently available.<br><br>Leading edge systems thinking and practice that goes far beyond what is currently available<br>It deals with the whole, both conceptually and practically, written in a reader-friendly style<br>Five real cases cited to demonstrate practical application of theories discussed</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is written by one of Ackoff's disciples.  In the middle of the dot.com boom, while many less qualified people were successfully marketing "high-concept" business books, JG must have felt the urge to join the club.  After all, as a managing director of a strategy consulting firm and a former Wharton professor, he was indeed more qualified than a journalist to do so.  Unlike Ackoff however, this author does not have the greatness of the mind nor the sharpness of the pen.  Many statements would be considered plagiaristic if they weren't tired cliches.  Therefore, this book is nothing at all of the sort of wonderful things that all these other reviewers are claiming it to be.
<br />One of the more useful and accurate reviews on these pages is written by Keith Bycholski below.  His indictment is only a shade harsher than mine.  The bibliography is good and the acknowledgements of great minds and their contributions to the field are a valuable source of further study.  Occasionally, JG has some brilliant sage advice sentences of the kind a good father figure might utter.  Those are worth underlining or being incorporated into a web site by one of his admirers or by himself. A thin essay volume focusing on human nature and society might have been a hit indeed.
<br />Half of the book is about the theory of systems thinking, not very systematically written.  The second half is a summary of JG's work with selected clients.  For  consultants selling strategy engagements to clients, this part may be of some value as long as you are talking to CEO's and top administrators of non-business organizations who are at a complete loss as to what to do with their organization.</span>

                    <span>The reason I bought this book is purely out curiousity on the subject. I got this one along with the one by Ludwig Van. One sentence in this book has had a profound impact on how I do what I do. I will state it below.
<br />
<br />"... the customer is right, always right. If you don't believe this, you will not work here. He is right even if you don't know why. Your job is to find this rationale and learn why he is doing what he is doing." - An old IBM saying... .
<br />
<br />This is explained with a great example to support it, in a manner in which one could directly apply it to their work. I am product manager and I have been successful taking this as a guideline.
<br />
<br />Jamshid, I owe you one. Thanks. P</span>

                    <span>I have just reread Mr. Gharajedaghi's book.  It is a very thoughtful and engaging review of systems thinking placed in the context of other world views in Modern Times.  It is occasionally and with good humor spiced with thoughts from Persia, as well as from the author's direct experience with Russell Ackoff.  It ties together thoughts on Business Process Management with larger views on gathering consensus, resolving conflict, engaging in beauty, and managing for profit.  It is an ambitious undertaking and succeeds with great integrity.</span>

                    <span>This is a book about changing the way we usually think.  It goes beyond simply proposing systems thinking to delve into the art of managing complexity (as the title mentions).  <p>The book is in fact divided into two portions.  The first is an in depth description of systems thinking, a somewhat dry read, given the extreme density of the subject.  The second is a number of case studies with which the author was involved.  This section, in my opinion, is the most interesting part of the book, as Gharajedaghi shows us how he applies, in practice, what he preaches.  There is one story in particular, about the Oneida indian nation, that is simply delightful; I believe it yields significant lessons for anyone seeking to work with development, but is locked into a purely economic standpoint.</span>
