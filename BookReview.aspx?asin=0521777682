                <span id="Label1">The Elements of Java Style, written by renowned author Scott Ambler, Alan Vermeulen, and a team of programmers from Rogue Wave Software, is directed at anyone who writes Java code. Many books explain the syntax and basic use of Java; however, this essential guide explains not only what you can do with the syntax, but what you ought to do. Just as Strunk and White's The Elements of Style provides rules of usage for the English language, this text furnishes a set of rules for Java practitioners. While illustrating these rules with parallel examples of correct and incorrect usage, the authors offer a collection of standards, conventions, and guidelines for writing solid Java code that will be easy to understand, maintain, and enhance. Java developers and programmers who read this book will write better Java code, and become more productive as well. Indeed, anyone who writes Java code or plans to learn how to write Java code should have this book next to his/her computer.</span>

                    <span>I'm very disappointed at the amount content in this Book.  Sun posted a Java style guide that was essentially the equivalent, but free.  Equivalent in terms of topics covered while there were some noticable difference such as variable naming. 
<br />
<br />One of the redeming qualities of the book though is that it can serve as a coding standard thus saving one from tidious chore of deciding on your own standards.  In the end does it really make that much of a difference as long as everyone on your team is following the same standard?
<br />
<br />Best part of the book is the title.  </span>

                    <span>Read Code Complete by Steve McConnell. You don't need this book. It contradicts itself on several occasions and is totally wrong on others. It's unfortunate and sad how many organizations want to adopt texts like this as their "coding standard". A pamplet-sized book of bullet-points can't make developers competent, but a comprehensive manual of the best in software engineering practices like Code Complete can.</span>

                    <span>In the Spring semester of 2003, I am teaching a class in software engineering and the students are creating a large program that is to be written in Java. Not all of the students are experienced in Java, so they are required to learn the language as they follow the rules of software development. At the time when the textbooks were selected, I was not aware of this book and that is unfortunate. It is an excellent quick reference to a set of rules that will point you in the direction of much cleaner and efficient Java code. <br> In all future classes where I am either teaching Java or having the students use Java to write large programs, this book will be a required acquisition. I have already placed it on my textbook list for software engineering in the Spring of 2004.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a strong basis for establishing the always needed coding standards on every project.  But, just as with the classic Elements of Style, it needs an updated edition.  One major note that should be addressed is the recommendation on double-checked locking - the fact that this flat out does not work in Java has been well-documented and published on multiple occasions.  I look forward to the 2nd edition!</span>
