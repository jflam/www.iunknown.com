                    <span>Irene and Michael Tobis have written an essential book for managers who run numerous small projects or complex combinations of large and small projects with multiple employees who have varying skill levels. If the process you manage hasn't been automated to the point of being an assembly line, you need this book, especially if you are responsible for team production and output. We recommend it as a fundamental part of any business management curriculum and as a training tool for new managers. Others who would benefit from it include teachers, project leaders, volunteer organization presidents and committee heads who orchestrate complex tasks. The authors provide principles, definitions and techniques that you can apply to your specific situation. Anyone who feels overwhelmed or overloaded will benefit, in particular, from chapters five and six, which focus on identifying everything you have committed to and developing a plan both to get out from under the overload and to manage future commitments more gracefully. Go get your copy.</span>

                    <span>I'm a software developer, and although I don't manage other people's time and effort across multiple projects, I have to manage mine.  I've been through many of the more popular Time Management books around for solutions, but this book hit the nail on the head.  A simple yet profound exercise described in the book is doing an analysis of your current workload to determine when, if at all, you'll hit some "crunch time", where your commitments simply outstretch your available time to work them.  While simple (and after you read it, obvious) it's never been taught in any class I've ever taken.  And once you see it, you'll wonder why it wasn't.  It's critical.  And it's the basis for the rest of the outstanding techniques in the book to manage your workload (and that of your subordinates) across multiple projects, crunch time or not.  I highly recommend this to management and worker bees alike.  Simply indispensible.</span>

                    <span>Being a successful manager , and being an avid reader, I was expecting this book to go a bit further than it did.  I have read a number of project management books, and a number of management books, and I would have to say that this book is at best a rudimentary management book.  If you are completely new to management then maybe this book would be useful.  If you are an existing manager and are looking for practical advice on how to manage, track, and report on multiple projects, this book is not for you.</span>

                    <span>THe book's precepts that reliability and consistency equal success and it's the formula that makes success is one right out of the CMM manual and a staple at Management Consultant firms.<p>Unfortunately this book falls short of how to get there, other than some warm over Stephan Covey planner tips.  Good for skimming but not much meat.</span>

                    <span>The authors posit that unreliable brilliance will always lose to reliable adequacy.  It is noble to aim for greatness, but unless you can deliver reliability consistently, you are creating problems for yourself and your organization.<p>They, one a PhD psychologist and the other a PhD systems engineer, jointly operate a consulting firm that seeks to find individualized paths to productivity that can be sustainable, convenient, natural and delightful.<p>To them, reliability has a simple definition.  The reliable worker or workgroup finishes every work item in a reasonable amount of time and with reasonable quality.  Many who are capable of brilliance are capable of reliability, but often it does not come easy.  Being competent means you can complete the job. <p>Being reliable means you can complete the job every time.  Unless your customers can depend on you, regardless of the project's complexity, you have problems.  The high value, high-complexity organization cannot afford to deliver inferior service.<p>The book combines skills from time management, task completion and organizational psychology.  It offers jargon-free definitions of important terms; tips and tactics for facilitating multiple projects; practical advice to minimize project errors and warning signs new activities are headed awry.<p>The authors provide simple, proactive strategies for consistently achieving multiple objectives</span>
