                <span id="Label1">"As far as I was concerned, the French could be cold or even openly hostile. They could burn my flag or pelt me with stones, but if there were taxidermied kittens to be had then I would go and bring them back to this, the greatest country on earth."  <P>David Sedaris's new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day, tells a most unconventional life story. It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes ("There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling than that was my voice itself with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch") and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From budding performance artist  ("The only crimp in my plan was that I seemed to have no talent whatsoever") to "clearly unqualified" writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris's career leads him to New York (the sky's-the-limit field of furniture moving) and eventually, of all places, France.  <P>Sedaris's move to Paris poses a number of challenges, chief among them his inability to speak the language. Arriving a "spooky man-child" capable of communicating only through nouns, he undertakes language instruction that leads him ever deeper into cultural confusion. Whether describing the Easter bunny to puzzled classmates, savoring movies in translation (It Is Necessary to Save the Soldier Ryan), or watching a group of men play soccer with a cow, Sedaris brings a view and a voice like none other. "Original, acid, and wild" --said the Los Angeles Times to every unforgettable encounter."</span>

                    <span>Annotation: A humorous autobiographic novel by David Sedaris outlining random events in his life. His unusual life stories tell of his childhood lisp troubles and speech therapy classes, his guitar lessons taught by a midget, his struggle to become an artist and trying to learn and survive the French culture and language.<P>Author bio: David Sedaris was born in New York and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. He's openly and happily gay. He lives in Paris with his boyfriend Hugh Hamrick. He has worked as a housecleaner and, as a part-time elf for Macy's. Many of his plays have been produced, and his essays are featured regularly in The New Yorker, Harpers, and Esquire.<P>Evaluation: This was a very very good book. My sister had read it and recommended it to me. This was the first book I had picked up in a long time and was pulled into it by Sedaris' humor. At times, especially during class, I would find myself trying to hold in my laughter as to not make a scene. I usually have a hard time getting into a book when I first start reading, but this book started out with an interesting and of course humorous tale of Sedaris' speech therapy classes. I finished this book in about a week because every time I picked it up, I didn't want to stop reading it. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs a good dose of laughter.</span>

                    <span>Nearly two hundred reviews of this book have already been written. So, is there really a need for one more? Probably not. But, if you don't know yet who David Sedaris is, you should check out not only this book, but the earlier ones, too. Poignantly funny, deliciously irreverent, and curiously in touch with what really makes people think. Not all his stories and essays are brilliant, but the ones that are (more than a few) will hit you where it hurts. Guaranteed!<P>From the older books, a real standout is "True Detective," which affected me in a way few stories about childhood ever have. This one story alone convinced me Sedaris knows what he's talking about...but there are dozens of others, too! This latest book is also a delight to read, but I mostly want to HIGHLY recommend the *recorded* version...if only to hear Sedaris actually sing his Billie Holliday jingles in "Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities." Classic comedy!<P>One of the earlier reviewers said Sedaris was "too sarcastic" for them. Well, he *is* that...no doubt. But that's only half of what he's about. The ultimate resolution in his writing is anything *but* sarcastic. He doesn't just leave you in absurd pain. He shows you, instead, that life really does lead somewhere. The only requirement...leave the dysfunctional behind. Think you can do it? Good luck....</span>

                    <span>I have never read a book so consistantly funny. I wasn't laughing at every page, but there was at least one line or paragraph in each essay that honestly made me laugh out loud. I won't give any away; enough are posted here. Any more, and I'd give away half the laughs.<P>I'll admit, I wondered what was going on in Sedaris' head at some points, but at others his thoughts so closely mirrored my own that it was just too funny. His one-liners and anecdotes are wonderfully witty (my favorite was the American tourists in Paris who arrogantly think no one else on the train speaks English). He accurately points out negative qualities of Americans in the second half, yet he doesn't talk down to his readers as he himself is a lazy loaf who spends most of his time in France in a movie theater. Just wonderful. You'll laugh your way through it.</span>

                    <span>if you are a fan of this writer, and i officially am, this is one novel that will not disappoint. He is brash, he is amusing, he is self-centered (not so much this time out), he is very unorthodox. Nothing he writes will set the world on fire, but he's clearly not trying to do that. All he is trying to do is have a good time, his way, the only way he really seems to know how.<P>Sedaris strikes me as one of those reclusive writers, the ones who really don't want to be around too many people who know their faces, but have no problem expressing themselves through the written word, speaking to us, baring his soul, without ever having to look into our eyes. He strikes me as that kind of character, really. Just look at his photo on back. A picture of someone who is totally uncomfortable posing for the camera, insisting on a natural action shot. Never speaking to us directly.<P>Sure, sure, he has his public radio work, he does his appearances, fine. But those are contributions rather than fame. Sedaris doesn't seem to adhere to the social understanding that he has "made it." and he doesn't care. he just wants someone to talk to. without actually talking to anyone.<P>great scam he has though, i admit. little essays about this and that. nothing major, nothing really minor. just having a conversation. telling a story to an audience held captive by their own devices. what a fine read this book is! my favorite stories involve his times in paris trying to understand the language, a little piece about taking responsibility for a turd in a friends toilet and a rather long dissertation concerning a family dog. one story really bothered me. it was about his riding a train in france with his partner and a married american couple are badmouthing him to each other, thinking him french and not able to understand their words. he lets it all fall off his back with no redemption. I WOULD HAVE LET THEM HAVE IT! and it bothered me that he would let himself get so beaten up by these ignorant steers!<P>but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars.</span>
