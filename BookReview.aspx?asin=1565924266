                    <span>vi (visual) is probably one of the most flexible editors (notice it is an editor not a word processor) that one can use. There are several ways to accomplish the same common tasks. There are so many ways in fact that most people learn just a subset of commands and string them together to do their editing instead of learning the more exotic commands. 
<br />
<br />The advantage of an editor besides speed and simplicity is that you will not inadvertently place visually hidden code in the program as you can easily do with a word processor.
<br />
<br />People got so used to this editor on dos based environments. You can still use the command line editor after the colon at the foot of the screen. When you find and use the abilities of vi you will wonder what you did without it.
<br />
<br />This book is a great starting place abd you may never need another.
<br />
<br />The Topics include:
<br />
<br />-	Basic editing
<br />-	Moving around in a hurry
<br />-	Beyond the basics
<br />-	Greater power with ex
<br />-	Global search and replacement
<br />-	Customizing vi and ex
<br />-	Command shortcuts
<br />-	Introduction to vi clones' extensions
<br />-	The nvi, elvis, vim, and vile editors
<br />-	Summary of vi and ex commands
<br />-	Vi and the internet
<br />
<br />The examples are quite clear and plentiful.

Get a taste of it yourself and you will be hooked.<p>vi is powerful beyond belief and  honestly I had been using it for years before I got this wonderful book from O'Reilly. The power of vi is revealing in this easy to use and well structured reference and learning aid.<p>Impress your friends with some of the little known and used features and functions. The authio Linda Lamb certainly knows her way around the editor so pay careful attention to the examples she uses to illustrate functions. Many of these can be used almost as-is in your daily work.<p>I suppose with all the latest WYSWYG word processors vi seems a little dated, but using vi I can create, edit, copy and manipulate documents in a fraction of the time others can by clicking and drilling in a windowed application.<p>I love vi. It's the raw power thats addicting. Yeah sometimes you can really screw the pooch with a typo but generally vi is fairly forgiving. I should know, my typing stinks but vi is generally kind to me when I mess up.<p>I rated this book highly in spite of I would have liked a few more examples, but the examples Lamb included are very representative of what you as a user may need and actually use.<p>This is a typical O'Reilly book - excellent and a worthy addition to any serious compter professionals library.<p>Hey I just heard that vi is available even to Windows lamers.<p>Try it folks, give your mouse finger a badly needed rest. Going to vi is like getting out of Chevy Impala into an Indy car. The Chevy may have better seats and A/C, but when you touch that gas pedal you'll be hooked.</span>

                    <span>I had made a couple of attempts to learn vi before, and I just didn't get it.  This book made it fairly easy, and introduced me to the power and speed of vi.  It lets you get started quickly, with an extremely clean, organized presentation.  After a short time using vi I'm convinced that emacs is much more difficult to use properly than vi, and that windows-like editors may be simple to use but they are crippled compared to the functionality of vi.  If you use a text editor more than once or twice a week do yourself a favor and learn vi.  If you use different unix / linux systems you are almost compelled to learn vi since it is the only editor that's always available.  This book also covers vi variants, such as the superb vim.</span>

                    <span>First, I unequivocally recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the vi editor used on UNIX and Linux systems.  The book is well laid out and well written.<p>There are, however, two things I think would make this good book even better: (1) step-by-step examples of some of the more complex vi techniques and (2) some on-line example files available from the O'Reilly Web site.  On-line example files are employed to advantage by other O'Reilly books (O'Reilly's "sed & awk" comes immediately to mind).  Providing some hands-on example files to work with would definitely help anyone using this book to learn the vi editor.<p>Having said that, this book in its current form will teach you more than enough to use vi effectively.  For those who are just starting to use vi to do real work, I'd also recommend acquiring the companion "vi Editor Pocket Reference."</span>
