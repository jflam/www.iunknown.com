                    <span>The Recruit is a better-than-average spy thriller that is able to exceed its relatively routine storyline. It succeeds due to the good writing and the acting of the two principal leads, Al Pacino and Colin Farrell.<P>Farrell plays an ace computer programmer haunted by the death of his father over a decade earlier. Pacino is a recruiter for the CIA who hints that Farrell's father may have been a member of the company. Farrell enlists and trains for field work; this recruitment and training takes up around half the movie.<P>The second half of the story has Pacino - one of the main trainers - recruiting Farrell for his first assignment, dealing with a mole within the Agency. Although some of the plot twists are foreseeable, others are less obvious, and if the ending wraps up everything a little too neatly, it is nonetheless satisfying.<P>In certain ways, this is a rather standard suspense flick, but as said before, it is the writing and acting that help it excel. Farrell holds his own with the veteran Pacino, and the rest of the relatively no-name cast also puts forth a decent effort. The Recruit is a solid four-star flick: not a classic but definitely a pleasant diversion.</span>

                    <span>Well, seems like poor Colin Farrell just cant stay out of troble these days, whether in a phone booth or here where he is recruited by a crafty CIA Recruiter (Al Pacino) for some ole fashion fun and games into a world where, "Nothing is what is seems", oh really, never heard that one before. Ok, the story line is weak, or lets hope the CIA doesnt recruit like this, but the film does have its way of keeping your attention through the plot twists and turns. Pacino is in his perfect enviroment here as the CIA man testing the agencies efficency through some newly recruited moles. Now, this is a film that is supposed to give us a real life glimpse into the ways and means of the CIA, but I dont hardly think so. Still, its good movie fare and and not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, especially now that the final epsiode of Six Feet Under has aired.</span>

                    <span>This action-thriller is a great movie, in which "nothing is what is seems"; for the characters, as well as for the viewer. Al Pacino and Collin Farrell show us great acting, together with a great story it makes this to one of the best action-thrillers I've ever seen! Special note for the outcome of the movie, the outcome is something I find very important. Most of the time good movies get wasted by a horrible end. Not this movie, no patriotic, moralistic, "help I'm gonna throw up" end. It's something you won't see coming....</span>

                    <span>When you watch this movie you will remember two things. "Everything is a test", and Nothing is as it seems." You will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. Is this a test, or is this the real thing you will ask yourself over and over again. James Clayton is still dealing with his Father's disappearance. James is recruited by Walter Burke to join the CIA, but James will find that nothing is at it seems, and he will realize he can't trust anyone but himself. The movie is intense, and a great thriller. I liked the peek into the CIA and the recruiting process. Al Pachino and Colin Farral were good together in this film.</span>

                    <span>NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS...that's true enough in the words of CIA instructor Al Pacino in Roger Donaldson's labyrinthine movie about a new CIA recruit, played with marvelous intensity by the gifted Colin Farrell. Pacino uses many of the elements of his previous roles, and why not--the man is a brilliant actor and sometimes you never know what to expect from him in spite of his familiarity. Bridget Moynihan (Sum of All Fears) co-stars as fellow recruit and would be lover for Farrell. (...) she possesses a strong sense of character in this multi-leveled role. Gabriel Macht in a smaller role as Zach is also very good, as Moynihan's other possible love interest. Even with the many clever twists and turns, the ending becomes predictable but not until the movie is almost over. Credit Donaldson for this succinct direction. The musical score is also brilliant; loved the use of usually boring synthesized music. It's effectively haunting in this movie.<BR>Colin Farrell is destined for his Oscar; his intensity and his understanding of multi-levels of characterization will lead him to an even brighter future.</span>
