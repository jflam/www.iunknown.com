                    <span>After a very long time I have come across a book that is really fabulous. Most of the programming books are too bulky and they waste all the pages in explaining only the documentation rather than the architecture. Most of this documentaion can be obtained on the web. This book explains the principles and the architecture behind all the commonly used .net concepts. I highly recommend this book. However, do not buy this book if you are planning to learn .net and have never used it before. This book caters to programmers who have had at least some programming experience in .net previously.</span>

                    <span>If you want a real reference book for .Net programming, this is it.  He goes into depth in explaining how things work.  Especially liked his chapter on Multithreading.  It is a gold-mine for a professional C# programmer.
<br />
<br />PS.  The guy who gave this book a low rating, probably hasn't done anything sophisticated with .Net yet.  Hey, its a reference book and his writing style is clear and to the point.</span>

                    <span>I have been developing software for 20+ years and am very particular about programming books.  This book is my premier C# reference.  Juval Lowy covers the topic thoroughly and offers best practices and many well written useful classes.</span>

                    <span>Programming .NET Components is a rare gem of .NET programming books. I found the content in this book to provide much-needed perspective related to general .NET programming tasks, answering questions like: best practices for interface and class heirarchy design, in-depth coverage of the .NET garbage collector and how to prevent it from hurting your application's performance, and a thorough explanation of delegates and their more evolved counterparts called events.
<br />
<br />Many .NET texts explain "how" to do things, but generally don't explain "why" things are done a certain way. This text gives you the breadth of knowledge you need to make optimal use of .NET technologies, and to understand when to use a particular approach to solve a problem when there is more than one possible option.
<br />
<br />I have not read all chapters of this book, but what I have read so far has already more than justified its purchase price. And I know it will be a valuable reference book for me in the future, as I explore threads, remoting, etc.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book and one that should be on the shelf of every experienced .NET developer. Although I use C# and C++, I primarily use VB.NET. The book is in C#, but it is easy to read, as you might expect. You might have heard the author on DotNetRocks. If so, you probably already expect a lot from this book. So far, I have been impressed. It is a book I plan to keep and refer to occasionally. By contrast, there are so many that I buy, read, and then shelve and never use again. Look at the table of contents and enjoy.</span>
