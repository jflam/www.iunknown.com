                <span id="Label1">The best-selling sequel to <I>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</I>--funny, poignant, instructive. One of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman possessed an unquenchable thirst for adventure and an unparalleled ability to tell the stories of his life. <I>"What Do You Care What Other People Think?"</I> is Feynman's last literary legacy, which he prepared as he struggled with cancer. Among its many tales--some funny, others intensely moving--we meet Feynman's first wife, Arlene, who taught him of love's irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. We are also given a fascinating narrative of the investigation of the space shuttle <I>Challenger</I>'s explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disaster's cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen. A <I>New York Times</I> bestseller.</span>

                    <span>I like this book a little better than "SYJ"--I certainly do also like "SYJ". However, the best thing I like about Feynman is that he talked so honestly about himself. Hardly any other celebrity would want do that. In "SYJ", he is real, not afraid to talk about his adventures or even sex. But you still can tell that in that book he was like a naughty boy, sometimes deliberately created "troubles" and generated adventures. In this book, he became more genuine, he used a very sincere voice to focus on how he see and value things -- love (2nd chap.), life, science (last chap.)... It almost make me have a crush on him - although he is dead. What do I care what you think about my last remark? :)</span>

                    <span>Feynman's book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" is a lot of fun. But fun was not the only thing in Feynman's life. "What Do you Care What Other People Think" is a rather different book.
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong: there are various funny stories in this book, too. And the book also describes various controversies - for example the story in which the silly feminists called Feynman "a sexist pig". Feynman never hesitated to inform morons (especially the pompous fools) that they were morons, and this book is another proof of it. Nevertheless, the main focus of the book is different.
<br />
<br />Feynman first talks about his childhood - especially his father who taught him to question the orthodox thinking, and who probably always wanted Richard to become a scientist. On the other hand, Feynman's father was not an intellectual. One of the special features of Feynman is that he was brought up in an ordinary family - not in a family of professors which is unfortunately the case of most professors today.
<br />
<br />The second part of the book is very sad and very emotional. It's about his first wife, Arlene. I think that the book will show you how much they loved each other and how big influence Arlene had on Feynman. Well, a problem was that she suffered from tuberculosis. She was dying while Feynman was working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos. This part of the book could compete with any good fiction - the difference is that this story is real and it happened to one of the most influential physicists of all time. I am sure that you will agree that Feynman's heart was at least as strong as his brain.
<br />
<br />However, it's not just a sad love story: Feynman also describes their tricks that they used to send letters to each other (circumventing the censorship in Los Alamos) and other amusing details of this period.
<br />
<br />The third portion (about 55%) of the book is dedicated to the commission that investigated the explosion of the Challenger, the space shuttle in 1986. Feynman was always eager to get to the very heart of the matter and he never cared whether he looked "nice" to others. Even Ronald Reagan knew about that, and therefore he personally asked Feynman to serve on the committee (with Neil Armstrong and others).
<br />
<br />Feynman did not disappoint and the book reveals the findings in depth - well sometimes the description is too detailed, I would say. It shows how some people in NASA - for example an executive called William Rogers - preferred the image (their personal image as well as the image of NASA) over the truth. You will also learn about many technical details that have led to the explosion. Feynman was thinking differently - unlike the chairman of the commission who thought that everyone should sit in a room and ask the experts, Feynman decided to talk to the engineers. Feynman's analysis is also a critique of the government bureaucracy.
<br />
<br />Although NASA was probably a unified force when it sent the first men to the Moon, it became fragmented afterwards, Feynman argues. The engineers estimated the probability of the failure to be about 1:300, while the top bosses were painting an optimistic picture to the Congress that the probability of an explosion was about 1:100,000, and NASA can be both cheap as well as efficient.
<br />
<br />Feynman's most visible conclusion is that the space shuttle program may have been a mistake because the public had to be fooled that the project was better than it actually was. 
<br />
<br />Feynman always believed that the public must be allowed to decide whether they want to fund you and your projects, after you honestly tell them what the project means. Unlike many unrealistic people in the academia who believe that an arbitrary amount of money paid for an arbitrary project in science is a good investment - and that it is always OK to fool the ordinary people to get some money - Feynman understood economics and the workings of the society very well. Moreover, honesty was his primary goal in debates with the laymen.
<br />
<br />At the end of the book, Feynman advocates science and its principles. However, you don't need to be trained in physics to understand the book. </span>

                    <span>The follow-up to the successful, "Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman" this book offers four pretty distinct parts.   <p>First section describes how his father taught him to think about the world and his father's ambition to make young Richard a scientist.  The end of the book is Feyman's case for the importance of science.  In between we get the sad, but sweet story of his first wife and the utterly compelling story of his time on the committee investigating the challenger explosion.  It was my favorite part of the book.  <p>The description of how government committees decide facts and make recommendations was eye opening.  It was the best description of how these things work that I've ever read.  Feynman was constantly up against a committee chairman that wanted to keep everyone in a room asking questions of experts.  Feynman didn't like that setup.  He wanted to travel out to NASA and talk to engineers, so he did.  <p>Going to Huston and Canaveral, Feynman learned something about the nature of NASA that probably goes for any big organization.  He found that NASA was a unified force when their goal was putting a man of the moon.  Information was shared freely and appreciated at every level.  Once that goal was met NASA became compartmentalized.  <p>Leaders at the top spent their time reassuring Congress that NASA would achieve their goals with low costs and high safety.  Engineers at the bottom realized that this wasn't entirely possible.  The middle managers didn't want to hear the challenges because they would be forced to report it to the top bosses who didn't want to hear it.  It was much easier for top bosses to paint a rosy picture to Congress if they were unaware of the actual challenges of making it work.  The end result was that top bosses said that the likelihood of a mission death was 1-100,000 while engineers on the ground felt that the likelihood was more like 1-300.  <p>Feynman concludes that maybe the shuttle program was a bad idea.  It could never live up to the ambitious projections of the leaders and the American public was being lied to.   NASA should be honest with the American people, Feynman thought, then Congress and voters can decide if they are getting enough for their money.  It was a surprisingly thing to hear from an advocate of science and discovery.  But Feynam reckoned that the amount of science and discovery has been little compared to the cost.  He complained years after the first shuttle launch he still hadn't read any significant experiments in scientific journals.  <p>In all, I liked this book a little better than "Surely You're Joking."  It was a little more thought provoking than those fun tales.</span>

                    <span>This book is the follow on to the book "Surely you must be joking, Mr. Feynman". In the first book there was a time line that progressed from youth to Professor at Caltech. This book is much different in that 45% of the book describes his pre- 1986 life and 55% describes his involvement in the Challenger shuttle accident investigation. This investigation was a mere 2 years of his life (and the final 2 years as well). The same brilliant character shines through in both parts of this book. There are many interesting vignettes of this iconoclast that are not in the first book. The most interesting part is the description of his relationship with his first wife Arlene who succumbed to TB while he was still a young man. He really had a great heart for those close to him. He didn't suffer fools willingly and often was abrupt to the point of rudeness. More interesting observations are available at feynmanonline^com. Detailed there is a more balanced view of the man and his foibles.</span>

                    <span>Yes, Feynman was brilliant. Yes, Feynman revolutionized the teaching of physics. Yes, he seems to have been a delightful, charming, handsome, womanizing, fun guy to hang out with. But the Feynman cottage industry ran dry a long time ago. I expect his grocery lists to be published any day now to feed the insatiable hunger for anything that he touched. The essays and articles in this book are bland and nearly worthless. One is introduced as "uproarious." Uproarious is defined as "provoking hilarity." If you think anecdotes about Feynman running up a stairway to bring his heart rate up are hilarious, you are easily amused. This book was a complete waste of time and money.</span>
