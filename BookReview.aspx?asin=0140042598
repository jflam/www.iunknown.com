                <span id="Label1"><i>On The Road</i>, the most famous of Jack Kerouac's works, is not only the soul of the Beat movement and literature, but one of the most important novels of the century. Like nearly all of Kerouac's writing, <i>On The Road</i> is thinly fictionalized autobiography, filled with a cast made of Kerouac's real life friends, lovers, and fellow travelers. Narrated by Sal Paradise, one of Kerouac's alter-egos, <i>On the Road</i> is a cross-country bohemian odyssey that not only influenced writing in the years since its 1957 publication but penetrated into the deepest levels of American thought and culture.</span>

                    <span>On the Road is of course characterized as the bible of the beat generation, and certainly it is a perfect depiction of that particular time and place in American cultural history. But one must not be trapped by this characterization. On the Road is so much more. It is a beautiful journey with full and deeply imagined characters and feelings. Kerouac probably has more to say about American life in On the Road than any other novelist of the period. The book is a real joy and essential reading for anyone interested in breaking out of the mold of the plastic, suburban middle-America that came to dominate our landscape during the fiftees and beyond.</span>

                    <span>I am highschool studnet who read On the Road as part of an independant study class I am taking for an American Literature English credit. I selected On the Road mostly because I had lost a list of books allowed for the project, and it was the only book I could remember from that list. I am a fairly fast reader, finishing most books within two or three days of starting them. I found that with Jack Kerouac's writing though, I could only take so much at a time. There was too much emotion on every page, too much of "the real world", and too much I could relate to to just plow through it  like I normally would. I found that I might read a few chapters, and then dwell on them for days afterward riding home on the train, while talknig to friends on the internet, and even in the middle of conversations with my family and teachers.
<br />
<br />Although I absolutely love this book more than any other I've ever encountered, I worried about how much influence it might have. I can remember when my mother and my brother first read it, and how they raged about how amazing it was. I didn't make much notice of it then, but now I definitely do remember some changes in them both as compared to how they were before discovering the book. Many of these changes are probably for the better, but should a book be able to change someone that much? After I finished reading On the Road, I had this overwhelming urge to drop everything going on in my life in favor of just going, and living, and wasting time for weeks on end, and then going again. Now that it's been some weeks since I've finished it, this urge has calmed substantially, but I have the feeling it will flare the very moment the next exciting thing happens to me.
<br />
<br />I've talked to others my age who've read the book, and I think I've found most agree. Jack Kerouac's writing has become somewhat of a guide to living his life, greyhound buses, ciggarettes, road trips, and all. This has even influenced others to write books such as "How to be a Beat" and "The Beat Generation".
<br />
<br />On the Road is most definitely a masterpiece in literature, butthe question is whether or not you're willing to risk letting it absorb you as much as it has others like myself.</span>

<br />In the errant, glowing review for the New York Times when it was first published, On The Road garnered comparisons with The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway, and with good reason -- it chronicled a "lost generation" eager to grasp at life (WWI for Hemingway's book, WWII for Kerouac's book) and expressed it in a whole new fresh way. Both books are quite lively, full of explosive description and off-the-cuff dialogue that renders the experience in a quasi-documentary-style way: that is, both books PUT YOU THERE, in the moment. 
<br />
<br />While Hemingway went on to spectacular success, embraced by Academia (but not always by the critics), Kerouac's trajectory was a lot darker. Critics (even the New York Times published a "retraction" of that initial glowing review one week later and now referred to him as a "Neanderthal with a typewriter") and Academics went out of their way to bash his spontaneously bop prosody style. No matter. Although it was shame that Kerouac (as most artists) needed to be crucified in the media, his books, his accomplishments remain. And this book, On The Road, certainly stands as one of his greatest achievements, being an expression of a cry for freedom and nonconformity -- as well as a reinvention of literary style. Possibly this would've be published as "memoir" if it appeared today. Regardless, Kerouac is a jazz poet of the highest order, his spontaneity and agility of style famously influenced by the freewheeling freedom of jazz. The descriptive passages in this book of jazz music, alone, are worth the price of this book. ( See that passage of Sal and Dean discussing the ephemeral "it," and you'll have some idea.) Even the structure of the novel is original. What can I say, this is a unique and marvelous reading experience, an explosion and heart and vigor and youth -- one experience that should not be missed! Along with On The Road, I'd also like to recommend The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, a strange little beat-influenced romance and, weirdly, the second best book I read so far this year.

                    <span>all the poetic reviews were a setup.  How could you people find this romantic?  There are no great stories here.  Only boredom.  Watch paint dry.  Thats as exciting as it gets hear.  I hope you dont have to read a dry as dust book like this to tell you that being a drifter is fun.  Cause if youre looking for insight, it aint here.</span>
