                    <span>I have a very severe case of ADHD and have done a condsiderable amount of reaserch on the subject, even sharing new information with my doctors at times. I bought this intending to use it as I do most of these type of books, more as a reference than a straight read through.  I have found myself however, devouring it more eagerly than I have many novels. I learned many NEW things from this book.  I really feel it is changing my life for the better, page by page.  The combined perspectives of the two authors is what makes this book so groundbreaking. If you have ADD it is written in YOUR language-in an interesting ADD minded format and not condescending like many sources on the subject, yet unexpectedly sympathetic.  But the most important thing is how much you will learn from this book, about yourself and how to develop a realistic approach to succeeding in all areas of day to day life. THE BEST MONEY I HAVE SPENT TOWARDS TAKING CONTROL OF MY ADD, but please don't feel that you need to have ADD to benefit from this book.  I hate self help books but this book really made me feel better about myself.</span>

                    <span>This book offers a wealth of engaging,concrete,simplified step by step strategies to handle the hurdles.I originally bought it in hopes of helping my 11 yr old son.I was amazed to learn that I used several of the strategies years ago when I taught school! I didn't realize that other people don't have to play music while they declutter, or sprint through something before they become distracted.Nor did I realize how so ADD I am , until I began seeing myself on every page. The authors definately set you up to succeed. They offer clear succinct techniques,fun ways to focus,and a totally different approach of working with the strenths of your ADD.  </span>

                    <span>I have done TONS of research on ADD/ADHD since I found out 4 1/2 months ago at age 22 that I have ADHD.  I can NOT believe how awesome this book is!  
<br />
<br />1st: It is laid out so that people with ADD/ADHD can read it more easily.  I didn't know that I do read things easier if they are bullited and such.  And this book is set up like that.  Very easy to follow - both with/without ADD/ADHD.
<br />
<br />2nd:  The BEST format as far as information goes.  It has a story of someone who does something (that is AD/HD related), then has ways that person can help themselves.  Then step two has ways that person can get help from friends and family, and finally, it lists ways a professional can help.  It also has lots of different ideas to help get organized that are easy, cheap and not too difficult!
<br />
<br />3rd: This book can be set down and picked up at any given point with out the reader getting lost - and we all know that that is important when we talk about this catigory!!!  I keep a mechanical pencil in the book at all times and am constantly circling/highlighting/staring next to paragraphs and sentences!  I always jot down little notes in the margins of the book and I love to go back and read through them again for reference to myself!!! 
<br />
<br />A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE WITH THIS FUN, yet CHALLENGING lifestyle (I hate calling it a disorder!!).... Please spend your money on this book.  You WON'T be disappointed!

                    <span>I have a hard time staying online with what I need to do for the day.  My daughter, who is a writer, needs to be organized but with a five-year-old and a husband in the military, it is very hard for her to do.  I think the small steps you can take are the best.  She can also use this for her son who is ADHD.</span>

                    <span>I'm new to ADD, just learning what this means to my life, and my son's life.  This book was an absolute godsend, not only in helping me identify and confirm many habits as being ADD-related, and in providing excellent strategies to work through them, but most importantly, in finally opening that window so my lover really finally 'gets it'.  Read it with your family and support folk, cause all of you need to hear it.  </span>
