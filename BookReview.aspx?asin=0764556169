                    <span>Well at least everything I ever needed to know about building an Arcade machine. This book is a MUST have for the novice to expert builder. It covers everything from how to decide what to build, to how to put it all together. I find myself re-reading chapters even on sections that I have already completed on my cabinet, just to see if there was something I missed or something I could have done better. What a great resource for anyone who grew up playing arcade games and wanted one of their very own. I highly recommend this to everyone.</span>

                    <span>A couple of the guys I work with have been messing around with this hobby for a while, and I've always wanted to give it a shot but didn't know where to start.<P>Now that I have this wonderful book, I've started to dig in and finally build my own arcade machine.<P>Most useful so far have been the author's guidelines on materials building, and the clear way he explains woodworking chores. I'm far from an expert woodworker, and many project books I've picked up go way over my head. John St. Clair's approach is very clear without being condescending.<P>Overall this is an awesome book. If you have visions of a stand-up arcade machine in the corner of your den, basement, or playroom, pick up this book and get to work!</span>

                    <span>I've built four arcade machines in the past, and honestly wasn't expecting to find anything I didn't already know in this book. I was pleasantly surprised to find all kinds of info I wasn't aware of; it's a great source of inspiration- full of ideas I never would have thought of.<BR>If you're even toying with the idea of getting into this extremely rewarding hobby - you need to buy this book! If you've already built an arcade machine and have become addicted - you need to buy this book!<BR>It's that simple.</span>

                    <span>Well, this book is an incredible read. It has so much useful information, I couldn't put it down. Definitely one of the single best "how-to" books on the market, in ANY genre. I thought a book like this would have been very "text-booky". This was not the case. The way the book was written, the sentence structure, words, general flow of things, it just keeps you wanting more. A great book for anyone in this hobby, or just interested in this subject. I recommend it to anyone. Great job!</span>

Appendix B has a very good insight on an issue that is in this hobby.<P>This hobby is changing so fast that it is hard to keep up the new products and ideas. The book and its accompaning websites help point you in the right direction of the latest products and ideas to help make your project better and unique.</span>
