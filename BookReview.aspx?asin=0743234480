                    <span>This book is a must have for every campaign manager. Never mind that two veterans of the Clinton War Room -- James Carville and Paul Begala, wrote it. The chapters on communications are, perhaps, the best. Want to learn how to "frame the debate" and deliver the perfect sound bite? Then this is the book for you.

                    <span>Politics is a grass roots, slug-it-out fight with a winner and a loser and no prizes for second place. Every step is a battle because so much is at stake. Authors and veteran political consultants James Carville and Paul Begala, who were notably pivotal on the Clinton campaigns, cleverly explain what makes a winning campaign work and what gets a politician elected. They also present the flip side and honestly explain why campaigns, including some of theirs, fail. The account is made richer by their knowledge of memorable historic elections, their references to using campaign concepts in business management and a few good recipes. Conversational, loose, opinionated and frank, this book is entertaining and instructive, with clear explanations of carefully distilled ideas and plenty of insider war stories. The authors may harbor some warmth for the Democrats, but that doesn't tame them as they skewer and critique both parties. We recommend this book to executives and professionals as a fun, extended metaphor on winning that includes some practical rules and sharp storytelling.</span>

                    <span>This book is not just about politics.  It is chock full of winning strategies, personal stories, political stories, and "five simple rules of great communicating."  If you are in sales, management, college, or just want to know secrets in communicating, you need to read this book.  It provides great insight from two political strategists who know what it takes to win.  Be prepared to take notes, it is well worth your time!</span>

                    <span>I thought that this book was excellent and funny. The authors did a great job explaining all the rules and they relate it to every aspects of their real life job and experience. I was suprised to read about Lincoln who had failed several times before ended up being the President. If Lincoln can do it, you can do it too.  Don't give up, just play your cards right!!</span>
