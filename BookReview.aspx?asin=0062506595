                    <span>The distance between the atoms in my brain is the same overall ratio as the distance between the stars in our galaxy. My head is basically empty space. Just thought you should know.
<br />
<br />Stanislav Grof is considered to be the Father of Transpersonal Psychology. His opinion that the psyche can be exterior to the brain is well formulated and respected though not necessarily agreed with by mainstream science. The notion that the universe is a machine made up of parts has a strong hold on much of Western Science. The Newtonian view that the universe is composed of solid matter is a hard nut to crack. The metaphysical assumptions seem so obvious. Consciousness is the product of our brains, of matter. Maybe, maybe not. 
<br />
<br />The main objective of this book is to explore non-Newtonian views concerning the relationship of mind with matter. Views congruent with modern physics. Within the context that consciousness does not passively reflect the objective material world; it plays an active role in creating reality itself. Rather than seeing the universe as discrete objects and empty spaces the universe is seen as one continuous field of varying density. Matter and energy are interchangeable. Consciousness is integral to the universe and not limited by any of its parts. 
<br />
<br />This is a book about how we are at a turning point in human history. A point where we have the opportunity to transcend our differences and create a seeming utopia on earth. Where we realize our interconnectedness with not only each other, but with all life on earth, even the universe itself. This is a most optimistic book where the future of man is concerned. We are an essential part of reality. It has taken us 14 Billion years to get here and the universe is on our side. It is our time to shine. Life, like baseball, is a field of dreams.
<br />
<br />Thou essence art that essence.

                    <span>The book describes transpersonal and paranormal experiences, with anecdotal evidence of their validity. It's not really about the scientific theory about them. For example, it only briefly refers to the holography analogy and the relevant studies in quantum physics, and doesn't really explain them in detail as the title might suggest; that was a bit disappointing. From a psychological side, same thing - it doesn't talk about the why and when and how of the phenomena, just that they occur.
<br />
<br />Still, a decent introduction to what's possible in non-ordinary consciousness, from a reputable scientist; it will make you open your mind a bit more to new age topics. If that's what you're looking for, then it's not a bad book.</span>

                    <span>Although a bit light, I found "The Holotropic Mind" to be a great and accesible intro to Stanislav Grof's work within Transpersonal Psychology.  Although none of the holotropic breathwork techniques are revealed within this book, I found some of the models and metaphors to be really enlightening (his note on the nature of the void experience was particularly compelling).
<br />
<br />This book is NOT on the level of Beyond the Brain or LSD Psychotherapy but it is worth picking up, even if you are a more advanced student of Grof's work.</span>

                    <span>Though I do share similar beliefs in a lot of what Dr. Grof concludes, he leaves a lot more room for debate than need be. There are many metaphysical topics he touches upon that may seem a bit "out there" for many (i.e. past lives, living archetypes, out-of-body experiences, etc.) and yet he offers little to back-up what he says. 
<br />
<br />The problem is that this particular book is more like an overview than a careful and thorough analysis of the mind. Dr. Grof only provides anecdotal evidence and cursory summations of research and studies to justify his conclusions. A lot of the material comes from his own experiences and that of his patients. This is not enough to sway me intellectually and not what I expected from a book that presents itself within a scientific context. If this were entitled "Chicken Soup for the Holotropic Mind," I probably wouldn't feel as disappointed. Ah, well...</span>

                    <span>(excuse me for my poor english! I read better than I write.)<br>Despite what the author says, this book is about the interpretation of the minds behaviour under the drugs influence.<br>In other words, if you want to read about how the author interpretates what people think and see when theirs brain are actually under LSD, read it. Perhaps you save money if you ask after the book at the local libray.<br>----<br>Contario a lo que el autor dice, es un libro sobre la interpretación de ell actuar de la mente bajo la infuencia de drogas. En otras palabras, si quieres leer acerca de como el autor interpreta lo que la gente piensa y ve cuando tiene el cerebro influenciado por LSD, lee el libro. Quizás salvarás el dinero si buscas el libro en tu biblioteca local.</span>
