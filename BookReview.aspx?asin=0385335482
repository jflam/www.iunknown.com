                <span id="Label1">If you've ever paid off one credit card with another, thrown out a bill before opening it, or convinced yourself that buying at a two-for-one sale is like <I>making</I> money, then this silly, appealing novel is for you. In the opening pages of <I>Confessions of a Shopaholic</I>, recent college graduate Rebecca Bloomwood is offered a hefty line of credit by a London bank. Within a few months, Sophie Kinsella's heroine has exceeded the limits of this generous offer, and begins furtively to scan her credit-card bills at work, certain that she couldn't have spent the reported sums.<p>  In theory anyway, the world of finance shouldn't be a mystery to Rebecca, since she writes for a magazine called <I>Successful Saving</I>. Struggling with her spendthrift impulses, she tries to heed the advice of an expert and appreciate life's cheaper pleasures: parks, museums, and so forth. Yet her first Saturday at the Victoria and Albert Museum strikes her as a waste. Why? There's not a price tag in sight. <blockquote> It kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? You wander round, just looking at things, and it all gets a bit boring after a while. Whereas if they put price tags on, you'd be far more interested. In fact, I think all museums should put prices on their exhibits. You'd look at a silver chalice or a marble statue or the <I>Mona Lisa</I> or whatever, and admire it for its beauty and historical importance and everything--and then you'd reach for the price tag and gasp, "Hey, look how much this one is!"  It would really liven things up. </blockquote>  Eventually, Rebecca's uncontrollable shopping and her "imaginative" solutions to her debt attract the attention not only of her bank manager but of handsome Luke Brandon--a multimillionaire PR representative for a finance group frequently covered in <I>Successful Saving</I>. Unlike her opposite number in <I>Bridget Jones's Diary</I>, however, Rebecca actually seems too scattered and spacey to reel in such a successful man. Maybe it's her Denny and George scarf. In any case, Kinsella's debut makes excellent fantasy reading for the long stretches between white sales and appliance specials. <I>--Regina Marler</I></span>

                    <span>Sophie Kinsella's novel "Confessions of a Shopaholic" is refreshing and fun to read. I read it in a few hours the other night and just loved it! Fortunately I had already purchased the two sequels (Shopaholic Takes Manhatten and Shopaholic Ties the Knot) so I jumped right in and read some more!<P>Becky Bloomwood is a hip English 20-something who has a serious addiction to shopping! She can't help but stop in the shops after work (she writes for a financial magazine called Successful Saving), and then when she sees that gorgeous scarf.. how can she possibly resist? So out comes the Visa! But when that Visa bill comes at the end of the month, Becky can hardly believe she managed to spend THAT much money in such a short period of time. She then has to come up with some creative solutions to her financial woes, or else her credit cards might be turned off!<P>The antics between Becky and her credit card company and bank manager are hilarious! Sophie Kinsella writes a lot of it in letter form, which is just plain funny. <P>Becky's relationship with Luke Brandon is the one part of the story I felt could have been better. I like most of the interactions between them - but I did want more. We barely saw Luke during most of the story, I would have preferred a few more interactions between them. I thought the shopping expedition between the two of them was great - especially Becky's reaction when she finds out they're picking out luggage!<P>Overall, it's a fun, light read. I read the entire book in a matter of a few hours and read the sequel later that night. All the characters are fun and interesting, with unique (yet realistic) personalities. I highly recommend this book, it's a riot!</span>

                    <span>What a fantastic story. I listened to the unabridged audio version and fell in love with Becky the main character. Becky was very well written and I can see a bit of her in all of us.<P>Becky works for a financial magazine doing column work on subjects that she thinks she knows nothing about. Well weather or not she knows anything about them she is defiantly no using any of the advice that she writes about. She is continually in debt and is very overdrawn but does that stop her from buying a new scarf (even when she has to borrow money to do so?) not hardly as you know it is a necessity.<P>I spent most of this book laughing hysterically, especially when the letters to and from her bank and credit card company are read. But, what will happen when things start to fall apart? Listen/read to find out.<P>If you liked Bridget Jones Diary you will love this book. It is great fun fiction!!! Becky has become one of my favorite characters of all time. So much in fact I went out and bought the other 2 in the series. I had to know what happened to her!!</span>

                    <span>I've nothing against a light summer read...and that is what I'd hoped for when I picked up this book. Unfortunately the 'heroine' is repugnant to the point where I was actually unhappy that things worked out for her in the end. She showed no true remorse for her lies, schemes and immaturity; so I wasn't routing for her to overcome them. Also, the 'turnaround' in her career was at best happenstance...and so preposterous and unbelievable. So, I think I can sum up my review in a single word which reflects the amount of thought and creativity that went into writing this fiction: BOO.</span>
