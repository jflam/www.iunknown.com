                    <span>The story is an entertaining look at Williams' career as a ballplayer, fisherman and ex ball player. It talks about his strange career with the Red Sox fans that would boo him in spite of his brilliant hitting. His study of the game, especially batting and dedication to being a near perfect hitter is a pretty good insight into why the booing bothered him so much and led to some bad displays of resentment by him to the fans. The spitting incidents and the time he accidentally threw a bat into the stands and hit a lady spectator on the head are well covered. His resentment toward most sportswriters is a continuation of his reaction to the reception he received in Boston. It's a large contrast to the welcome given to Joe DiMaggio in New York and the rivalry between Williams and DiMaggio is covered too. In later years, Williams mellowed and so did the fans so that their relationship was a good one. One wonders what kind of statistics Williams would have had if he had not missed five years in the military service, being a pilot in World War II and in Korea. One of his statistics that I don't often see mentioned is the fact that he is one of only two players to win the Triple Crown twice.<p>Besides being a "Hall of Fame" ball player, Ted Williams was also a hall of fame fisherman and there is a lot of fishing talked about in the book. <p>Ted Williams was definitely one of Baseball's greatest hitters and an individualist, plus being quite a character. This book gives a good insight into these things in his "own words". It should be a must for any baseball fan.</span>

                    <span>First, a quick qualifier: the four stars is for "My Turn at Bat" as a baseball book. Unlike "The Boys of Summer," for example, it is not also a literary gem, nor, I suspect, was it intended to be.<p>That said, Williams and his collaborator, the fine writer John Underwood, achieve a peppery tone in the book that one certainly heard in Williams's voice when he spoke out after his baseball life. Williams's language is rich and funny and-especially when he speaks about baseball writers-sometimes bitter. <p>The book paints a vivid picture of Williams's childhood in San Diego which, he says, included countless hours playing ball in backyards and city parks. Ted is at pains later in the book to point out that his enormous success as a hitter came from this constant practice, not as a result of his keen eyesight, which was the subject of much legend.<p>The book also brings to life the storied Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, which of course produced a lopsided advantage in favor of the New Yorkers during Williams's career. You feel his frustration when he discusses the final-game loss to the Yankees in 1949 that ended the Red Sox season and the team's subsequent decline over the remainder of his career. That loss came after his poor showing in the 1946 World Series-the only one of his career-and a season-ending playoff loss to the Indians in 1948.<p>These frustrations and his vicious battles with the press bring out the human side of Ted, important because as a hitter he seemed to most in a world of his own. To his credit, he doesn't dwell unduly on his achievements, but to ignore the magnitude of them is impossible: only one season below .300, 521 career home runs, an incredible on-base percentage, and so on. The humanity is also revealed in his description of his final at-bat (which resulted in a home run). Despite his emotion, he was unable, he says, to acknowledge the crowd (famously commented on in an essay by John Updike) despite its clamoring and the urging of his teammates to take an extra turn in the spotlight. Not my way, the Splendid Splinter says.<p>A final section of the book is also very interesting for Williams's comments on the secrets of hitting and his recommendations for improving the game. Some of the latter are timely for the game today: he urges hitters and pitchers to work more quickly, and he advocated before its adoption the use of a designated hitter. Personally I don't find that to have been one of baseball's shining ideas, but he certainly was foresighted.<p>If you're looking for much on Ted's personal life, look elsewhere, but as a fine read for the student of baseball, "My Turn at a Bat" should get a turn with the reader.</span>

                    <span>Rest in peace, Ted Williams, the last great angryman. This is a wonderful read for all baseball fans & for anyone who loves colorful characters. People have alternately called him the world's greatest hitter, world's great fisherman & the world's greatest pilot. Was there anything Ted couldn't do? Unfortunately, he was also great at holding grudges. He recounts in minute detail insults that go back decades. I wish he had let go of the anger...but I guess that's part of what made Ted Ted.</span>

                    <span>I have been reading baseball books for over 40 years and this is the best baseball autobiography I have ever read. I loved Theodore Ballgame because I loved baseball and I loved to hit, so I was very glad this book is such a good representation of the great man. Captures the angry, humane, vital qualities of a man bursting with humanity.</span>

                    <span>I have always been a huge fan of the game of baseball, the greatest game in sports.  To tell you the truth, I didn't know much about Ted Williams.  All I knew was that he was some great hitter in his time, nothing more or less. Of course, Ted Williams played in his prime decades before I even entered the world so I felt there was no reason to know who he was.  I was more interested and knowledgable about stars like Griffey and Bonds, Maddux and Schilling.  However, after the tragic and recent death of The Kid, I became interested, too late of coarse.  I read articles written by Sports Illustrated and the like and then I picked up My Turn At Bat.  Let me tell you this, Ted Williams is not just a great hitter, he is an American hero.  So, to make a long story short, Ted Willaims writes about all his troubles with the press in Boston, his quarrels with fans, his military service, his fishing and hunting passion, and of cousrse everything else that a legend writes about in his autobiography, all from his side of the story.  The funny thing about My Turn At Bat is that it doesn't feel like you are reading a book.  Instead, it is more like you are in small conversation with The Splendid Splinter on a cool summer night.  Ted Williams was the man that Hollywood has tried for years to duplicate.  But he is no John Wayne or James Bond.  He was America's true hero on and off the field, something that no baseball player today can become.  There are a lot of great ballplayers out there today, A-Rod, Chipper, Ichiro, etc., but there are none that can come close to Teddy Ballgame.  If you are a fan of the game of baseball, the way it should be played, I strongly recommend this book.  In Mr. Williams words, "Put it in capital letters and run it on page one."</span>
