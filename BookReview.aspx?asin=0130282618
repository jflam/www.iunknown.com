                    <span>Java programs have the reputation of being slow. Performance is thought to be<BR>Java's trade off for cross platform portability and higher developer<BR>productivity. Real-time systems demand on time responses and in many cases,<BR>should not fail. At the first glimpse, Java seems quite unsuitable for<BR>real-time systems. Well, if you think so, you might want to read Peter C.<BR>Dibble's book "Real-Time Java Platform Programming".<P>In fact, real-time specification is the first Java Specification Request<BR>(JSR001) in the Java Community Process and the reference implementation just<BR>came out in early 2002. So, this is a very timely book for this very important<BR>new application area of the Java platform.<P>The focus of this book is not well known Java syntax and API functions. This<BR>book spends a lot of pages discussing what are real-time systems, what are the<BR>requirements and why Java 2 Standard Edition is NOT up to the task. As a<BR>result, we can learn important things about real-time system design and the<BR>philosophy behind the real-time Java specifications. Java is only a tool. A<BR>real-time system engineer should first know the system design so that he can<BR>apply Java to the new situation. I find the approach of this book very<BR>effective.<P>Back to the question we raised in the first paragraph: It turns out that<BR>performance is not THAT important for a real-time system. We can have a slow<BR>real-time system but it has to give consistent and predictable results<BR>everytime it runs. That consistency allows us to design systems that we know<BR>will meet the deadline. One of Java's core problems in real-time applications<BR>is the unpredictable behavior of the garbage collector. The book have lengthy<BR>discussions on new algorithms on memory management and the real-time Java<BR>approach to this problem.<P>Of course, garbage collector design and memory management is an example of many<BR>real-time system design aspects covered by this book. Other important issues<BR>include threads and synchronization. I find this book very readable for both<BR>Java programmers interested in real-time system engineering and real-time<BR>engineers interested in Java tools. <P>This book could be even better if the author can organize scattered sample code<BR>segments into a consistent sample application and use it to demonstrate<BR>different usages of the real-time Java platform. Also, the author did not cover<BR>the installation and basics of the reference implementation. Nor did he cover<P>real application scenarios on real devices or simulators. That makes it a bit<BR>difficult to understand the context of the examples.</span>
