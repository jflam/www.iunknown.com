                    <span>In 1897 a contingent of twenty black soldiers, a white West Point officer, a military surgeon and a young newspaper reporter rode bicycles from Fort Missoula, Montana to St. Louis, Missouri, following the Burlington Northern railroad.  The groups' leader, Lt. Moss, was trying to prove to the army that bicycles could be a valuable asset.  I first became acquainted with this little known gem of history through the children's magazine Highlights in the early 90s.  I have been fascinated with it ever since.  George Niels Sorenson's Iron Riders presents this story and the broader context of those "Buffalo Soldiers-on-wheels". He tells us of the practice trip the bicycle corp made to Yellowstone Park before their epic St. Louis run and the lives of the riders after their trip.  This 8 x 10 book has many primary source pictures, documents and maps which illuminate the text.  It's the only informational book I know of devoted to a story which deserves a wider audience.  If you are a middle school history teacher, like me, do yourself a favor and pick up this book.  It would make a fantastic unit.  But I agree with the other reviewer:  anybody who likes black history, social history, military history, bicycle touring, the west and/or unsung heroes will find a lot to enjoy in this book.  And, if you like this book you'll want to check out the PBS video The Bicycle Corps: America's Black Army on Wheels and the children's book Black Wheels.</span>

                    <span>The subtitle, "Story of the 1890s Fort Missoula Buffalo Soldiers Bicycle Corps" is a good general description of the book's contents.  I had never heard of Ft. Missoula, much less known that they had a bicycle corps, before stumbling across this book in the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial's bookstore.  It's not a long book, but it covers its topic well.  Of course I was interested in the horrendous ride from Missoula, Montana to St. Louis, but the account of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry saving the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill was enlightening.  Also (all too) informative was the account of the "discharge without honor" by order of President Theodore Roosevelt of 167 soldiers, many of them formerly of the bicycle corps.  The book also includes numerous photos, a number of which are wonderful shots (and very well-printed) of the soldiers in Yellowstone National Park.  I highly recommend this book as an entertaining account of a dedicated group of American soldiers who happened to have been of African descent.  (Incidently, having read this book I was able to feel incredibly smug with recognition when the Bicycle Corps turned up as an integral part of Peter Heck's "Tom's Lawyer", the most recent installment of his Mark Twain mystery series.)</span>

                    <span>What a great book!  It really has something for everybody; military bike history, Black history, the American frontier at the turn of the century and more. Great pictures and illustrations also. Military cycling books are rare and this one fills a much needed niche. You will not be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>Whoever heard about this unusual bicycle corps that pedalled around the Rocky Mountains 100 years ago?  The fact that African-American army soldiers participated in this fascinating exercise adds to the enjoyment of this story.  The author clearly did his research and presents the material in an understandable and fun manner.  Check it out!</span>
