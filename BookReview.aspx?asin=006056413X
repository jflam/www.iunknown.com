                    <span>If there was only one book I could read this year, it would be this one.
<br />
<br />In some ways I felt a little guilty reading this book. Ms. Mahar exposed many of the secrets that kept the US economy running. 
<br />
<br />Bismark said that people should not know how their laws and sausges are made. Well, Ms. Mahar exposed how the "sausage"  on Wall Street is made.  Shopping on Wall Street will never be the same.
<br />
<br />In the future, I wish Ms. Mahar would turn her excellent investigative ability to the current "Bull!" now running amok - China. I'm sure we will see again the same rogues' gallery involved in hyping this bubble.
<br />
<br />Excellent book.

                    <span>_Bull!_ is a riveting and instructive saga about the hazards of rose-colored glasses to anyone's financial health.  Unlike the shenanigans detailed in _Liar's Poker_, _Predator's Ball_, and _When Genius Failed_, we all went for the ride Mahar describes.  This is a wryly written and well-researched post-mortem.  It's almost worth buying for the chapter on CNBC alone.  Lots of nice quotes from shrewd market-watchers ("information is not knowledge" and the corollary "always, the promoters who spread the tips sell to those who consume them";  "anxiety motivates people to take risk"-counterintuitively; "the argument that expensing stock options might hurt the share prices was akin to complaining that investors would pay less for shares if they knew that profits were inflated. Of course they would!"; "The unique advantage of gold is that it is no one else's liability").  Some cogent analyses of what was driving the speculation (401(k)s, declining cd and money market yields, etc.) and of the beneficiaries.  Among the latter, Mahar is particularly good on the mutual fund industry and the quandaries of conscientious fund managers at the end of the decade.   There are plenty of deft portraits of a host of dubious characters-corrupt analysts, criminal CEOs-and of the bubbly companies that fabricated their earnings, or didn't even bother.  Naturally the heroes are the lonely bearish analysts and newsletter writers.
<br />
<br />But Mahar wants to be more than a historian; the book's subtitle is "What 21st Century Investors Need to Know About Financial Cycles."  Apparently, they don't need to know much about their relation to business cycles or to geopolitical events.  There is no reference in the discussion of the bear market of the 1970s to the huge boost in the capital gains tax in 1969 or to surging oil prices.  The market seems to cycle in a vacuum.  You almost have the impression that personal computers are the tulips of the late 20th century.  That people were willing to pay $400 for a share of Amazon and throw billions at dotcons that had no prayer of making a profit doesn't detract from the fact that there was a technological revolution in the 80s and 90s that has totally changed the way we live our lives and run our businesses.  There's a reason why Intel and Msft have the market caps they do; the bull market of the 80s and 90s was more than just a frenzy of irrational exuberance.   
<br />
<br />As a bear, Mahar naturally goes after the philosophy of  buy and hold, but her numbers belie her biases.  She cites a study looking at 10 year periods between 1926 and 1998 and notes, triumphantly, that there was a 4% chance that you'd make nothing by holding for 10 years.  But every investment is a bet and 19:1 are pretty good odds.  And b and h means more than 10 years.  After 40 years, your chance of earning greater than 10% annualized return is "just" four in five, says Mahar dismissively.  An investor could be excused for thinking that was not bad. There were positive annual real returns in all the bear markets she graphs at the beginning of her chapter on cycles, save for 2000-2004.  
<br />
<br />Her bearishness colors her story.  Magellan's Jeff Vinik is supposed to be a seer for dumping tech stocks in fall of 1995; Gail Dudek is a heroine for repeatedly calling a market top starting in 1997.  But it's not particularly prescient-or profitable-to be four years early.  From 1/1/96 to 12/31/04 the Nasdaq had an 11.86% annualized return, w/o compounding.  If there are paper gains, there are also paper loses.   Had you bought shares of the Prudent Bear fund run by David Tice, another hero, you'd have been down about 3.4% p/a over the same period.
<br />
<br />Still, Mahar's distinction between secular and cyclical markets is valid, and there may be another leg down to the bear market that began early in 2000.  Maybe the S&P500's P/E never got low enough and the despair never got high enough.  The twin trade and budget deficits are worrisome as is the extent to which the recovery in 2003-4 was driven by consumer debt.  A lot of readers will find the author's bear case pretty compelling.  But whatever your take on the next quarter or next decade, there's a lot to savor and learn from in _Bull!_.

                    <span>The author explains that the 90s bull market was driven by momentum, not value. The main source of liquidity was a stampeding herd of misinformed individual investors whose do-it-yourself investing, much of it via 401(k)s, flooded the mutual fund industry with money, driving up stock valuations to unsustainable levels. The majority of individual investors got most of their financial advice through the media, which had been taken over by investment industry marketers. The market's upward momentum made most fund managers look good even though they were only following the indexes. As a result, mutual funds became asset gatherers, basing their fees on the amount of money under management, not on investment expertise. Lawmakers enacted the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 which helped build the bubble by enabling corporations to mislead investors about their earnings; the effect was a massive transfer of wealth from shareholders to corporate management. Financial chicanery became prevalent throughout corporate America, and creative accounting was so pervasive that, in 2001, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that there had been no earnings since 1995! During the longer term from 1969-2003, stocks outperformed long-term Treasuries only by a trifling 1% per year, but Wall Street and the media kept investors' attention focused on equities because equity-based commissions, fees, kickbacks and other rake-offs are far more lucrative. After the bull market's momentum had reversed, the media kept telling investors to stay invested and buy on dips, but investors were pouring money into a large sieve. Many investors had become uncritical as they monitored their accounts; the balances looked okay but, in reality, investors' deposits were camouflaging the investment losses. Mahar shows that timing, which depends on expertise and luck, is key to whether an investor wins or loses, and that buy-and-hold would not have worked well during the long term. Unlike momentum and long-term buy-and-hold investors, successful value investors, like Warren Buffett, use market timing to buy low and sell high. The only true golden periods for stocks over bonds were the 1950s and 1960s. Mahar demolishes the myths perpetrated upon investors by the financial services industry and its lackeys in the media. Every investor should read this book!

                    <span>On the surface, this is a history of the stock market over the past 20 years.  Like most economic history, one would expect to be bored to tears.  The book adds a couple doses of financial theory (also "Ho Hum") and somehow manages to be a delightfully insightful and interesting read.  The 400+ pages just flew by.
<br />
<br />There's lots of interesting historical annecdotes included:
<br />1)  The bears who get killed for mistiming their predictions.  (The bull isn't done until the last bear is gored)
<br />2)  How the Blodgets of the world were created by a system that encouraged cooking the books and an abdication of responsibility.  (Mahar covers the laws that created this environment, and those politicians that pushed for them)
<br />3)  The ups and down of particular investors as they deal with the bull and inevitable bear.
<br />
<br />In addition, several insights come out:
<br />1)  Buy and Hold Equities isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  
<br />2)  Not everyone belongs in the market.  Indeed, many investing professionals make their money on Wall Street, but invest it on Main Street.  (Harder to lose money on a house)
<br />3)  Decreasing spending or increasing earning potential can go a long way.  
<br />4)  It is easier to pick trends than timing them.
<br />
<br />There are a couple attacks on her thinking:
<br />1)  She cites the virtues of market timing, but market timing really isn't that easy.  If it were, we'd all be doing it.
<br />2)  She cites many folks who called the end of the bull right.  In a sea of information overload, it isn't that easy to find these people and understand their arguments.  (There's always convincing bears)
<br />3)  There are many instances of "If you only followed Xs advice from Day Y..." which is tough to check.  Is that a valid trend, or are the dates (especially the end dates) picked just to amplify a point?  (It's always possible to find a 5, 10 or 20 year period to prove a point)
<br />
<br />That said, the book is an important one, both from a historical point of view, and to improve one's investing.</span>

                    <span>A fascinating work from which much can be gleaned -- entertaining as well. 
<br />
<br />The only thing I take issue with is Mahar's references to succesful "market timing" by investors who pulled money out of the market before 1999. For investors like Warren Buffett, it would be more accurately described as "market pricing" -- that is, when an investment's price has risen significantly beyond its intrinsic value, it is an appropriate time to sell. As it is said: "price is what you pay, value is what you get." </span>
