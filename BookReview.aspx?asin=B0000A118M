                    <span>This album kept Jazz alive. Coltrane soars with nothing but happiness, gratitude and Joy and you can't help but be stunned by this musical masterpiece.</span>

                    <span>After hearing so many people and musicians that I respected rave about this record, I bought A LOVE SUPREME many years ago as my first jazz purchase.  At once, I could not have made a more daunting, or rewarding first step.  Coltrane's masterpiece is not an easy one to digest, especially for a novice, but I hung in there and ultimatly picked up on the tidal wave of emotion that pours out of Coltrane;s horn, as well as Elvin Jone's drumkit, Jimmy Garrison's bass and McCoy Tyner's piano.  His exploration of  personal faith may seem to be a very private exercise, but obviously has struck a universal chord.  This certainly set the bar high for future explorations, but also prepared me to enjoy many other of Coltrane's works as well as recordings by Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and other past and present masters.</span>

                    <span>Probably the best-known selection in Coltrane's entire outstanding body of work, it certainly is among non-jazz listeners who have long made it one of the greatest crossover successes in the history of mainstream jazz.  The reason for this is all in the feeling.  From the opening stroke of the gong to Coltrane's chanting of the title to the evocative and moving saxophone "prayer" at the conclusion this is one of the most profoundly moving and powerful performances ever recorded, in a way that touches us as human beings, not as jazz fans or rock fans or as anything other than lovers of great music and great art.
<br />
<br />Anyone from the devout to the unreligious cannot fail to be moved by Coltrane's heartfelt expression of the spirituality that he found after sinking to the depths of addiction.  Coltrane's triumph over heroin and his thanks to God are what informs every note that is played.  Yet, the truly wonderful thing about A Love Supreme is that as instrumental music (aside from the chant) it is universal to people of all languages, all cultures and all religions (or even no religions.)  Everyone can draw strenghth and inspiration in their own way from this amazing and vital recording.
<br />
<br />Coltrane and his brilliant quartet (McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones) present a masterpiece of classical/jazz/spiritual that goes far beyond the reaches of mere jazz.  What it is, is a work of art, one of the greatest ever, and one that should be enjoyed by all for as long as hope and love remain in this world.
<br />
<br />Way more than 5 stars.  Timeless, profound and absolutely essential.</span>

                    <span>I first listened to this record when I was a young teenager. It arrived in the middle of the Beatlemania revolution that was sweeping all before it. Rather, the audience of young teenagers was sweeping all consumption trends before it and the Beatles among others, were at the lucky right place at the right time.
<br />
<br />Too bad for musical brilliants such as Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Coltrane.
<br />
<br />The word 'Jazz' the only limitation to this artwork, but a significant limitation it is nevertheless. The term has become so identified with pointless, tasteful, minor key instrumental noodling that any other impression simply does not register in the mind. Coltrane and Co's approach to this work gives the initial outlook that this too will be more of the same ol' same ol'.
<br />
<br />Of course, those 'in the know' by the time of this recording in 1964 had already earmarked 'Trane' as a transcendant soloist and improvisor, particularly in blues idioms. Coltrane himself could not have imagined the explosion of interest in electric guitar-based blues improvisation that would culminate a few years later in the outpourings of Jimi Hendrix, Cream/Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, Johnny Winter and others. All owe much and more to Coltrane's improvisatory brilliance.
<br />
<br />Here, the story is about the music itself, rather than just Coltrane's blowing. Starting almost cautiously -and setting up a musical tollgate- Coltrane and Co. chant "A love supreme" over and over tunelessly at the end of the first movement. A filtering device that diverts the impatient to some other  activity, this phrase actually gives more than fair warning of the musical seriousness to come.
<br />
<br />Momentum builds in earnest during McCoy Tyner's extraordinary piano examination of the opening theme in part II. Tyner musically throws down the gauntlet; Elvin Jones who has been punctuating events up to the moment with odd meters and dancing cymbal work throughout takes up the musical challenge with an intense if restrained solo to open part III. What happens next is hard to describe with the English language.
<br />
<br />The music becomes an atomic/atonic vortex with Coltrane, Jones and Tyner circling each other and bassist Jimmy Garrison, the melody lines interweaving with a dynamic fury, suggesting that the source that powers star systems is not fusion but rather the limitations of acoustic musical instruments and the drive to exceed those limitations. 'A Love Supreme' becomes a musical welter supreme, with the torrents of musicality feeding on themselves and becoming more concentrated in the process, generating even greater torrents.
<br />
<br />The sax and piano quiet themselves -and Elvin Jones literally goes berserk...  the thermonuclear energy generated by the other three feeding into.... Jones, who is carried forward by the fierce intensity building in the preceeding maelstrom! The movement is an explosion unlike anything found anywhere else in music. It is jawdroppingly stupifying in its expression of raw musical power expressed through the throes of the perfomers. 
<br />
<br />The fourth movement is a recapitulation and winding down from the musical firestorm experienced in the preceding movement.
<br />
<br />This recording is a monument to what great music can do to us, it touches this unknown thing we call a soul and does so with mysterious means. Coltrane does more than touch here, he grabs hold of the listener's mind through those tiny, little ear holes and squeezes hard. The listener is that much better for the experience.
<br />
<br />The CD is a print from the original master recording. I don't recall the LP so I cannot make a comparison, but several recording issues are supposed to have been cleared up in this recording. It is intense and brilliant and should be required listening.

                    <span>Where do I begin?  Trane surpasses our understanding with this work of art on record.  FULL of heartfelt expression of love, pain, desire, and a man who fully understands the what grace really is.  The album must be considered as a whole and not in parts.  It is one extended thought.  It is his relationship with God from beginning to end.  The hard times as well as the easy.  The omnipresence of God is in his notes.  There are studyings in Univeristy music classes on this one album.  There are books written on this one album.  Do not underestimate this album.  Do not merely listen to it; study it, analyze it, think about it.  Then pass it down to the next generation so that they will know and understand the greatest musical and artistic gift we've known.    </span>
