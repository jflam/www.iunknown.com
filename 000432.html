<h3 class="title">D70 First Impressions</h3>

<p>After almost two years with the Nikon 5700, I decided it was time to upgrade the camera. The 5700 is a wonderful camera for outdoor landscape shots under optimal lighting. However, it was hampered by a few significant shortcomings: </p>


<ul>
<li>Fairly high digital noise at anything above <span class="caps">ISO 100</span></li>
<li>Slow to autofocus</li>
<li>Slow to boot</li>
<li>Autofocus really wouldn't work in low light, and no autofocus assist lamp</li>
</ul>

<p>Things got really difficult when I wanted to shoot some photos of my son Matthew, since most of those shots were going to happen indoors. All of these factors convinced me that it was time to upgrade to a <span class="caps">DSLR. </span></p>

<p>The camera that caught my eye was the Nikon <span class="caps">D70. </span>For $999, it looked to me to be the best deal going. The one feature that I couldn't live without was my spot meter, and Canon doesn't have one in their 300D/10D line of <span class="caps">DSL</span>Rs. When I went to the store, they were out of <span class="caps">D70 </span>+ kit lens (an 18-70 F/3.5-4.5 lens) packages. So I picked up a 50mm F/1.8D and a Tamron 19-35mm F/3.5-4.5 wide-angle zoom.</p>

<p>So far I've pretty well exclusively used the 50mm prime lens. It forces me to think a lot more about composition since I can't just stand somewhere and zoom in and out. I have to move around until I get a shot that fills the frame. It's also an incredibly sharp lens - I get detail out of this lens / camera combination that I could never get with the 5700, even though it purportedly has better glass (ED vs. D glass).</p>

<p>The reflexes of this camera are unbelievably fast. It turns on instantly. Even with the cheap lenses that I have, it focuses incredibly fast - much faster than any digicam that I've ever held. It nails the focus in low light conditions. It writes <span class="caps">NEF</span> files (uncompressed 12-bit per channel images straight from the sensor) without any delay. There's a 4-shot <span class="caps">NEF</span> buffer which you should not be able to fill under normal conditions except if you were shooting in burst mode. On my 5700, shooting a <span class="caps">NEF</span> would lock up the camera for about 10s.</p>

<p>One thing that I had to get used to was the depth-of-field that I get out of this camera. The depth of field is <strong>much</strong> smaller at a given aperture than it was on my 5700. Especially with a lens like the 50mm f/1.8. But I can get some very interesting shots using shallow depth of field that I could never get with the 5700 since its depth of field was so large (this is due to the fact that its image sensor is much smaller than the one in the <span class="caps">D70</span>).</p>

<p>So far I'm very happy. See <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000433.html">my next post</a> for some photos of Chase the Swan.</p>
