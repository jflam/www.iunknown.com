                <span id="Label1">In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <I>new</I>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <I>The Great Gatsby</I>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <I>Gatsby</I> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings.  "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"  Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p>  It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <I>The Great Gatsby</I> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.  </span>

                    <span> I have to say, this is one of those books where you feel like there is something important that you are missing when you read it. It seems to be about nothing on the surface, but for some reason, it feels like there is an undercurrent of meaning that just didn't come through for me.
<br /> The book is narrated by a man named Nick, who moves out to West Egg on Long Island to learn about insurance (I'm pretty sure it was insurance)in the 1920s. His cousin Daisy lives on East Egg with her husband Tom, though they don't have a good relationship.
<br /> Next door to Nick lives a self-made millionare named Gatsby, who throws weekly wild parties at his house, but seems to have a sad secretive side. Gradually, Nick gets to know these people, but not a whole lot else seems to happen for quite a while. Tom has a mistress named Myrtle, who is married to a car mechanic.
<br /> Eventually, Gatsby begins to confide in Nick, and tells him that he once knew Daisy and wanted to marry her, but left to fight in the war. By the time he came back she was already married. His wild parties were designed to attract her attention so he could see her again. Nick eventually gets them back together, and finally one hot day, Gatsby confronts Tom. 
<br /> They had gone into NYC for the day, and argue hotly over who Daisy really loves and who she's going to live with, but eventually, Tom pretty much wins. He sends Gatsby back to East Egg with Daisy while he stays with Nick and another girl, Jordan.
<br /> Meanwhile, the car mechanic has finally discovered that his wife is cheating on him. He tries to lock her up, but she runs out the door and is hit by Gatsby's car. Driving by a little later, Nick and Tom see this and are convinced that Gatsby was driving, though it was really Daisy. Gatsby decides not to tell anyone the truth to protect her. 
<br /> By the next day, Tom and Daisy have left the state and Gatsby seems tranquil, but there is a sense of foreboding. Nick has to leave for work and when he returns, Gatsby is dead in his pool, killed by the mechanic because he thought Gatsby had killed his wife. This part was a little confusing.
<br /> In the end, Daisy doesn't seem to really care about Gatsby, and no one comes to his funeral except for his father and Nick.
<br /> By the end of the book, I definitely felt that it meant something, but it seemed very hazy and I couldn't figure out exactly what. I think it has something to do with caring more about appearances and money, than anything else. I would recommend reading this book as it was fairly enjoyable after the first chapter, but if you're a teenager you probably won't understand it completely. I'm going to do a re-read when I'm older and hopefully it will become clearer. </span>

                    <span>"The Great Gatsby" was an interesting book, about confused love, scandalous affairs, and gallant parties. I thoroughly enjoyed all the secrets and decieving. It gives a vibrant discription of the lifestyles in the early 1900's. Really giving you an understanding of people. My favorite character was Nick Carraway, who lived the simple life, but living a glorious one because of his connections and nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby was one of the richest men, living a mansion one could lose themselves in. If you are into scandals and drama this book is sure to keep you interested. </span>

                    <span>"The Great Gatsby" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word "love" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.
<br />
<br />The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for any other character. He had always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact the he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation.[...] </span>

<br />Finally I can say that I've read this great book! 
<br />
<br />Essentially, THE GREAT GATSBY is a tragic love story. In this novel, we are shown the extremes to which a person will go when they are in love. Gatsby is desperately in love with Daisy -- a gal way "out his league" and social standing -- so that he transforms his entire existence (reinvents himself) to win her love, even sacrificing his life. Of course, in the end there may be those who ask: Was Daisy worth it? 
<br />
<br />There is nothing to replace the experience of reading this great, beautifully written novel. All the drab film adaptions fall short, maybe because the beauty is not in the somewhat slender story, but in the telling, the language Fitzgerald uses, exquisitely rendered lines that you'll find yourself re-reading for their intense beauty. The final closing pages, in particular, are amazing -- prose that is closer to poetry. This is a MUST reading experience -- by the end you'll agree: a shining jewel of literature. Pick up a copy of this classic book! 
<br />
<br />Another novel I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Fitzgerald, but very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, compelling romance of sorts I can't stop thinking about. THE LOSERS CLUB and THE GREAT GATSBY are by far my favorite two Amazon purchases this year.

                    <span>The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book, I dont see the need for highschool students to be reading this. Personally, I dont believe that they have the mind for it. He or she is not mature enough to understand the value of this book. They dont see the agony Gatsby goes through. The lust he has for Daisy and wanting her more than every material object on this earth. He puts this girl in his mind and he cant get her out. EVen though he is well aware she is with another guy, that she may or may not truely love. Either way he wants her but cant get her and he feels his life is not complete without her. So many adults do that today, teens dont understand, their idea of "love" is spelt with l-u-v. They just dont get it. If you are in highschool, your gonna hate it, read it when you have grown up. And if you are a teacher dont force these kids to read this, it will be worthless and they will probably never pick it up again dont ruin this for them! </span>
