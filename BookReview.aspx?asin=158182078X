                <span id="Label1">A beautiful hardcover book and collector's item, "I Remember Ben Hogan" is an oral history of an amazing golf legend. Many people were touched by Ben Hogan although few were truly able to connect with him. To a select few, he was a shy, sly mentor, able and willing to reveal golf-swing secrets with a grip and a rare grin. Author Mike Towle uncovers more than 100 original stories regarding golf's most famous legend.</span>

                    <span>The beauty of this book is that it is a series of mini-books wrapped up under one cover. It's not a biography by any means - it is a compilation of stories about Hogan told by many golf greats and unknowns alike. Hogan stayed out of the limelight as much as possible and is remembered as a workman-like surgeon on the course and the practice range. Nobody could see into the man's mind, but this book really paints an interesting picture. I loved it.</span>

                    <span>It's fascinating to me that a guy as reclusive as Hogan could command so much public adoration and curiosity. This is a book that offers a lot of neat stories about Hogan that I had never read. A bunch of people who knew Hogan, both well-known and not so well known, tell their stories about Hogan in their own words---in oral history form. I've read a couple of other books on the Hawk and those were nice reads in their own way as well. I read the other reviews on this page and don't understand why "clucas" called this a "duck hook." It isn't--it's not John Feinstein-caliber, but it's still worth the price. Sounds like some bitterness being expressed by clucas, probably someone who doesn't know anything what it takes to win at golf or can recognize good book writing.</span>

                    <span>there seems no in between. I have 800+ golf books and have read everything just about everything on Hogan. (What club did he REALLY hit at Merion in the famous photo?). Due to the negative reviews I didn't get to this one for a while. When I did, I truly enjoyed it. Is some info repeated? Sure. But this is mostly new, original and genuine investigation, not reguritation. If you are a golf and golf history BUFF I think you will enjoy. If not, pass and read the more current books.

                    <span>While I understand that any author that wants to write about The Hawk will have his work cut out for him, it seems that Towle took the path of least resistance. A couple of phone calls here, 5 minutes of editing there, and you're left with a book that tells you two things:<P>1.) Hogan was a gruff but soft-on-the-inside guy.<P>2.) Hogan got the yips later in life.<P>Those who want to learn more than those two points would be better off avoiding this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The last two reviewers before me couldn't have read the same book I did. The whole point is that while Hogan is such a legendary figure inspiring tremendous curiosity, information about him has come out in bits and pieces over the years. There were dozens of tidbits in this book that were revelatory to me, and I'm someone who lived in Fort Worth many years while the reclusive Mr. Hogan was still alive. I found this book really good and informative, and full of new material. Based on its oral-history format, and the author's own admission in the introduction, this wasn't supposed to be an earthshaking biography full of dirt. Instead, it offers a lot of nifty snapshots about Hogan from people, a number of whom were his close freinds that, while not celebrities, had insights into Hogan's real life that "celebrities" who thought they knew him didn't. This book is definitely worth at least one read.</span>
