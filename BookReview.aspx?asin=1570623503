                <span id="Label1">In any meditation class, one of the first things one learns is the importance of breathing. For Larry Rosenberg, a seasoned instructor of insight meditation, the breath is everything. And he's not in bad company since the Buddha himself delivered a sutra on the subject. Rosenberg's <I>Breath by Breath</I> is an elaboration on this short classic but couched in familiar language, liberally spiced with anecdotes from Rosenberg's decades of practice and teaching. It's Rosenberg's earthy humor and patient instruction that make him such a popular teacher and that make <I>Breath by Breath</I> a rewarding read. He takes the beginning student from the wandering "doggy mind" to becoming a chicken, along the way getting a teacher's bite and sitting like a frog. For the hurried and harried, he includes a nutshell, two-step version of the sutra's 16-step practice (appended in the full text of the sutra). More of a coach than a disciplinarian, Rosenberg takes a see-what-happens attitude. "You don't make liberation happen," he says. "To contemplate breathing is to contemplate life itself." <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>Larry Rosenberg has given us a book which combines his humor with profound seriousness.  He uses an older Buddhist teaching on specific contemplations which are joined with mindfulness of the breath.  However, don't expect a book which operates on the "meditation is cool and relaxing" premise.  This is definitely written for a committed meditator, or one who is ready to take the next step in his practice, and go beyond "meditation to feel good".  Yet, the by-product of following the practice and become more awake is certainly deeper serenity.  This is a great book to help you with the up's and down's that occur as your meditation and life practice deepens.  He takes each of the 16 contemplations, such "aware of the body, breathing in, aware of the body breathing out" and gently lays the foundation for incorporating each of them into your practice.  If you enjoy the Vipasanna approach, I would really give Larry Rosenberg a read.  His approach is friendly, down to earth, relevant to your meditation and no holds barred.  </span>

                    <span>My two cents worth:  Read this book and see for yourself.
<br />
<br />There's a lot here and much of its content will require re-reading and further contemplation.  For example, for me, the concept of "no self" is puzzling, but at the same time kinda makes sense.
<br />
<br />One writing technique the author uses that I found interesting and enjoyable was to introduce each of his teachers as his first one.  Initially I had to do a double take and re-read earlier chapter sections to make sure what I was reading was correct.  This technique parallels meditation practice; in a sense every breath is our first breath because we are taking it at this unique moment which has never existed before.
<br />
<br />There is much depth to this book.  Be good to yourself and read this book.</span>

                    <span>This book really inspired my meditation- it simplified all the baggage I had acquired from a lot of other reading about Buddhism. No mysticism, no dogmatism, no exoticism, just a practical breakdown of what happpens as you practice. It made me realize that meditation is not about some later enlightenment experience, but about the experiences you are having now- that understanding made meditation much less of a labour.</span>

                    <span>Very good book on vipassana practice and how to do it. Rosenberg writing style is very good and his simple and clear explanations of complex or confusing ideas is most helpful. One of the best books I've read on buddhism or meditation. Highly recommended.</span>
