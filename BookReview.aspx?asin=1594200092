                <span id="Label1">Building on biographies by <I>Richard Brookhiser</I> and <I>Willard Sterne Randall</I>, Ron Chernow&#146;s <I>Alexander Hamilton</I> provides what may be the most comprehensive modern examination of the often overlooked Founding Father. From the start, Chernow argues that Hamilton&#146;s premature death at age 49 left his record to be reinterpreted and even re-written by his more long-lived enemies, among them: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Monroe. Hamilton&#146;s achievements as first Secretary of the Treasury, co-author of <I>The Federalist Papers</I>, and member of the Constitutional Convention were clouded after his death by strident claims that he was an arrogant, self-serving monarchist. Chernow delves into the almost 22,000 pages of letters, manuscripts, and articles that make up Hamilton&#146;s legacy to reveal a man with a sophisticated intellect, a romantic spirit, and a late-blooming religiosity.<p>    One fault of the book, is that Chernow is so convinced of Hamilton&#146;s excellence that his narrative sometimes becomes hagiographic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chernow&#146;s account of the infamous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. He describes Hamilton&#146;s final hours as pious, while Burr, Jefferson, and Adams achieve an almost cartoonish villainy at the news of Hamilton&#146;s passing. <p>   A defender of the union against New England secession and an opponent of slavery, Hamilton has a special appeal to modern sensibilities. Chernow argues that in contrast to Jefferson and Washington&#146;s now outmoded agrarian idealism, Hamilton was "the prophet of the capitalist revolution" and the true forebear of modern America. In his Prologue, he writes: "In all probability, Alexander Hamilton is the foremost figure in American history who never attained the presidency, yet he probably had a much deeper and more lasting impact than many who did." With <I>Alexander Hamilton</I>, this impact can now be more widely appreciated. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>This is an extraordinary account of perhaps the least known of the founding fathers.  It pulls together all the contradictory facets of Hamilton's life that make him an enigmatic subject.  Hamilton was a brilliant thinker and writer, guilty of extraordinarily poor judgement, reflective, impulsive, a doting husband and father, an adulterer, confident bordering on arrogance, insecure, a believer in constitutional government, and a dueler, literally to the end.  Chernow weaves all of these themes into a sympathetic account of this monumental man.</span>

                    <span>Ron Chernow has long been a favorite author of mine.  A former journalist with considerable knowledge of the workings of finance, he combines these two strengths to write superb books that illuminate the history of the American economy.  His biography of Alexander Hamilton demonstrates his abilities to the fullest, as it offers one of the clearest descriptions of the foundations of American fiscal policy available.  Yet this is secondary to the main theme of Chernow's biography, which is Hamilton's restless ambition, which fueled both his impressive accomplishments and his self-destructive conduct in public life.
<br />
<br />Lucid as it is, though, Chernow's book also possesses some glaring flaws.  While his command of financial detail is sure, his knowledge of the early republic is less so, which leads to occasional mistakes about the historical context.  Moreover, while better balanced than previous studies of Hamilton, Chernow often dismisses or spins material that reflect poorly on his subject; even his affair with Maria Reynolds is explained in part as a consequence of his sense of chivalry.  Negative interpretations are saved for Hamilton's opponents, who are viewed in the worst possible light - Jefferson is hypocritical, John Adams is vain and insecure, Aaron Burr is a duplicitous foe whose dual with Hamilton is constantly foreshadowed in the text.  Such depictions sow doubt about the validity of the author's conclusions and mar what is other respects an excellent account of one of America's most important "founding fathers."</span>

                    <span>Hamilton is clearly the founding father least studied and held in the lowest regard. Perhaps that was because he never became president. He couldn't be president since he wasn't born in the United States. He claimed to have been born on Nevis, an island in the Caribbean.  We wax elequently about Jefferson, Washington and the others, and if we remember Hamilton at all we remember just two things. 
<br />
<br />First Hamilton fought with Jefferson over the power of the central government -- Jefferson was a southern plantation owning slave holder; Hamilton was a New Yorker opposed to slavery. 
<br />
<br />We remember that Aaron Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, but we don't know why. 
<br />
<br />This splendid book presents Hamilton in an entirely different light, one who forsaw the development of the United States as a world super power and was creating the governmental institutions to allow it to become so. I wonder what he would think of the Federal Government of today, where Congress is just voting to get involved in a simple right to die case in Florida.</span>

                    <span>I found this book much more engaging than McCullough's bio of John Adams.  Of the founding fathers' bios that I have read, Hamilton may be the one I would most like to have spent a long dinner listening to his ideas and political concerns.  Part of his quality is his underdog status.  A poor immigrant who was probably the only founding father to personify the American hope of rags-to-riches.  
<br />
<br />As with almost all the other founding fathers, whose biographies I have read, Thomas Jefferson played a significant role.  As with some of these founding fathers, Jefferson played a villainous role.  I am still trying to find enough reason to glorify Jefferson, but the guy needed a good kick in the rear.  
<br />
<br />Chernow provides excellent refutation of the Jeffersonian inspired negative images of Hamilton as an enemy of democracy and an aristocrat.  In a manner that would have made Hamilton proud, the author seems to take pleasure in noting the hypocrisy of the aristocratic Jefferson, and Madison attacking Hamilton who actually put his life on the line to win independence from Britain, and who may have been the first to have called for the Constitutional Convention to make this land into an actual country.  If the British ever saw Jefferson, it was only to glimpse the back of his horse as he fled to the hills at the first sight of a redcoat.  
<br />
<br />Less happy for Hamilton is the author's honest assessment of Hamilton's weaknesses, of which there were many.  This is why any current day opponents of Hamilton (e.g., state rights exponents) would have to agree that this is a well-balanced treatment of its subject.  After finishing this book, I concluded that Hamilton would have been the brightest, and hardest working president in history, but his temperament would have surely doomed his administration.  
<br />
<br />Hopefully, text book writers will incorporate the information in this book and give proper status for our students of this incredible, but flawed man.

                    <span>It has accurately been said that Hamilton, more than any other founding father, accurately saw the potential superpower that America would become. While Jefferson favoured an agrarian economy (supported in the southern states by the abomination of slavery) and weak central government, Hamilton believed in a strong federal government, a competent military and saw that the United States would eventually overtake Britain as the world's greatest power. Hamilton's essential work in constructing the financial systems of America's new government turned the ailing country from an international bankrupt that no one would lend money to, into a viable nation with a strong economy. As Daniel Webster famously said of Hamilton, "He touched the dead corpse of the public credit and it leapt upon its feet."
<br />
<br />Ron Chernow's book brings Hamilton to life with all his brilliance, and all his numerous faults, particularly his argumentative nature which contributed to the duel with Aaron Burr. The skill of Chernow is that he has written an impeccably researched book but is honest about areas which are uncertain, and he refrains from the leaps to judgement which so many modern biographers engage in. The narrative leaps off the page like a swashbuckling novel, and if it wasn't history, you think that the events and adventures that he writes about were ridiculously improbable. To his credit, Hamilton was the only member of the founding generation who did not own slaves and was instrumental in founding the Maunmission society, which had as its task the abolition of slavery.
<br />
<br />Ultimately one has an incredible portrait of the man whom Teddy Roosevelt described as "the man of most brilliant mind - Hamilton - whom we have ever developed in this country."</span>
