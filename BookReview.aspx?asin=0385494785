                <span id="Label1">A bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that "suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down." He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer's--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for Into Thin Air, Krakauer's epic account of the May 1996 disaster  <P>By writing Into Thin Air, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer's highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber's death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous!  assessment of others' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself.   This updated trade paperback edition of Into Thin Air includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy.  "I have no doubt that Boukreev's intentions were good on summit day," writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. "What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev's refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn't the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients." As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since Into Thin Air's denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer's tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored, The Climb, Boukreev's version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer re! counts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I.  In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters-a prestigious prize intended "to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment."  According to the Academy's citation, "Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer.  His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind."</span>

                    <span>I was at my home in Old Forge, N.Y., and faced with a dreary rainy winter day rather then a day of snowmobiling. Consequently, I went to the book store and purchased "INTO THIN AIR" and soon found myself in the grips of a fantastic book. I surprised my wife as well as myself when I read it's entire contents in one sitting. I've always been intrigued by the adventures of mountain climbers and their ability to risk their lives for a few moments on a mountain summit. The particular events of this climb reinforces the fact mountain climbing is tedious and dangerous. Jon Krakauer does a magnificent justice to the realization of just how truly difficult climbing is. I have always been an avid reader but few books peaked my interest enough to read in one day. It certainly is sad that such tradegy struck so quickly. Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of pointing out that when dealing with the elements of nature the devastating effects it can have on peoples lives. He admittingly stated that Mt. Everest had become less of a challenge to experienced climbers as a result of the commercialization of expedition companies. What quickly becomes a realization is that when one encounters the elements that inflated egos aren't enough for survival. I think that Jon should forgive himself for the deaths that occurred that May of 1996. Everyone who climbs that high needs to remember that they are at risk of never returning and perhaps this account will be a reminder to future mountain climbers. I would recommend this book to anyone who simply enjoys reading factual accounts of adventure. I often in my life have waged battle with mother nature and never have I considered summitting a peak such as Mt. Everest. This book in its exacting detail makes me realize that life is fragile and often on the brink of disaster, no matter how prepared or experinced one might be.</span>

                    <span>It's hard to believe that this book is so interesting. John Krakauer tells a story about a disaster waiting to happen and then it does. The story involves a strange mix of characters... brillant, experienced guides, and inexperienced climbers focused on attaining the ultimate trophy, the summit of Mt. Everest. <P>If not for the tradegy, it would be comical... the mountain is overcrowded with climbers, highly paid guides, and local sherpas. Climbers ignore basic rules; they ignore the instructions of high paid guides, and too many pay the ultimate price for their mistakes... they died on the mountain. Their hubris, and negligence contributed to the deaths of their heroic guides.<P>This is a story with everyday villans, climbers who march by other dying climbers to pursue their own quest for Everest. And, it is the story of unexpected heroes, like the film crew for IMAX who gave away their oxogen to help weak stranded climbers. At the time, the IMAX crew thought that they had given away their chance to summit Mt. Everest.<P>I cried as the lead guide from New Zealand was dying just a few hundred feet from base camp. Although he was able to talk to his pregnant wife in NZ, he couldn't be rescued. I can't remember when I last cried real tears when reading a book.<P>This may not be a classic, but it is a great read!</span>

                    <span>This tale is Jon Krakauer's personal account of his attempt to summit Mt. Everest. Rob Hall is the leader, a guide with impeccable credentials who is also a man of caution...yet a daring individual, as anyone would have to be to climb Everest (especially time and time again). Rob leads the team up the mountain, and everything is going fairly well until that fateful day where everything seemingly went wrong. It's almost hard to read this book knowing there's a tragedy coming, but I couldn't put it down to find some heroism also involved in this story...the will to survive is amazing, and it is demonstrated clearly in this book. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>An incredible account of the Everest Disaster. Krakauer is an expert at including as many details as possible without being too wordy. This book reads like a novel, and in fact the story is so incredible that at times you have to remind yourself that it is non-fiction. I appreciated the vivid pictures he painted of the important people in this book, a talent for which he is as skilled as the best contemporary fiction writers. Reading the book, you can grow so fond of some of the more likeable characters that you feel a deep sense of sadness when you read about their passing. In a sense, Krakauer has accomplished the difficult task of explaining in laymen's terms the technical aspects of high-altitude mountaineering (which is necessary in a book like this), and somehow also gave the reader a sense of the profound grief of the situation. This is something that is lost among the litany of newspaper articles, less-talented writers, and the controversy of conflicting accounts fails to do.<P>Oh yes, the controversy. I suppose that it is inevitable that when you're dealing with this magnitude a disaster, with equally-high magnitude of some mountaineers' egos, you're going to get arguments. Unfortunately, Krakauer has been sucked into this and actually has devoted a portion of the book to responding to someone's complaint about his account. Frankly, it reads like an internet message board flamewar, and it detracts from an amazing book. Hopefully, a year from now when I think back about this book, I'll remember not the controversy but rather people like Rob Hall, one of the people who died on the mountain.</span>
