                    <span>This is a very useful book for anyone trying to refine their lighting skills. Each section features a large number of finished shots, and on the opposite page is an easy-to-understand lighting diagram, and a few paragraphs about how the shot was done.<P>I wish I'd known before buying this book, however, that it includes the complete contents of three Pro Lighting series titles (i.e., Nudes, Erotica and Provocative Shots). The Pro Lighting Series books are great, but you don't need to buy those three if you buy _Lighting the Nude_.</span>

                    <span>I like this book very much for several reasons:<P>1. Great photos - interesting techniques on topics ranging from classical nude to outdoor nude, accessories/props to hair/makeup. <P>2. Good taste - this is NOT a book filled with sleazy / low-class photos of naked women. I find all of them tending towards modern, fine art types. <P>3. Superb format - Minimal text with essential descriptions, simple diagrams showing the studio setup, camera settings <P>4. Good value - Hardcover with 400 over pages (each with clear examples), printed in in full color on glossy paper. <P>I use this book as a source of ideas and to experiment with different lighting setups. <P>Comparisions: <BR>There are numerious books on this topic, and I've read many others. This book is similar to "Lighting for Nude Photography" (also by Rotovision) - "Lighting The Nude" is twice as thick and provides more ideas/techniques. If you like Prolighting series books - which has great illustrations and simple instructions, you will love this. But if you like long-winded, text-intensive book, telling you stories about each picture, then this is not for you. Another book I like is "Successful Glamour Photography" by John Kelly but this book is a little old now.</span>
