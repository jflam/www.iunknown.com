                    <span>The dynamic duo of Pete Pfitzinger, renowned exercise physiologist and two- time Olympian, and Scott Douglas, former editor of the Running Times, have teamed up to write the latest and greatest text about marathoning. Quite simply, this book is a must read; the authors have produced a theoretically sound, easy-to-read, and entertaining manual for anyone seeking to run (i.e. as opposed to "finish" or "run-walk") a sub-four hour marathon. Advanced Marathoning has a number of outstanding features: <P>Numerous easy-to-read, day-by-day, training plans. From peak mileage at 55 miles per week over 12 weeks to 93 miles per week over 24 weeks, nine different marathon schedules are laid out and explained with daily detail.<P>A Multiple Marathons training plan. For runners who wish to tackle more than the standard yearly spring and fall marathon plan, the book details methods for racing marathons as close as four weeks apart.<P>A sidebar in each chapter which profiles a world class marathoner. These tales from the trenches illustrate how some of the principles of marathon training are applied in real life. <P>Practical advice about how to balance high commitment marathon training with the rest of a "normal" life. Since not all of us can make a living winning prize money in road races, the authors present practical tips for incorporating high mileage training into the rest of your busy life.<P>An entertaining writing style. The best line of the book comes on page 205 where the authors warn about trying to run back-to-back marathons in less than 4 weeks: <P>Your main concern should be about recovery, recovery, and more recovery not only from your first marathon but also from the lobotomy that led you to come up with this plan. Despite its many strengths, the book has two minor drawbacks: Hill training is glossed over. Hills are an essential part of almost any marathon training program. The authors acknowledge this, but they aren't specific about where, when, and how hills can be incorporated into a training plan.<P>The core strength training and flexibility training sections are brief. Specific diagrams illustrating some of the exercises written about would have been very helpful. These drawbacks, however, pale in comparison to all of the "good stuff." To repeat, this book is a must read.</span>

                    <span>I had one goal when I purchased this book...to qualify for the Boston marathon. Before purchasing this book I had no running schedule, no plan, and no benchmarks to measure my progress. I relied mostly on input from well-meaning fellow runners. Every training run felt like a race and I always felt tired and without confidence. Subsequently my first two marathons were both failures. <P>I bought this book in September of 2003 with the plan of running Dallas White Rock in December for another attempt to qualify. I can not compare the book to others since it is my only book, but I thought it was a well organized, informative and even motivating. I read it from cover to cover and then referred back frequently during my training. I did not follow the included running schedules to a tee, but instead used them as a basis and followed the spirit of them. For the first time I actually had confidence in my training and felt like I was making progress. The most important thing I learned was the importance of the long SLOW run. This concept as well as the importance of recovery were critical to the success of my training. <P>I just finished running White Rock and I am extremely happy to say that I qualified for Boston. It wasn't easy, but without the balanced training I learned from this book it would never have happened.</span>

                    <span>Before reading this book, I was able to get my marathon time to the 3:10 range. A friend of mine gave me this book and I took the time to really read through it. It was easy to understand and it gave an excellent breakdown of the training cycles, nutrition, and physiology. If nothing else, the training programs are easy to follow, and they work. You can easily finda program that will meet your time and work demands. I've followed a couple of different programs religiously, and I have taken my time down to 2:48, not bad for a 40 year old. Bottom line is this really works!</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book for anyone who is serious about improving his/her marathon times. I liked the detailed physiological information and the varied training programs. I have used two of his training schedules (the 50-70 miles/wk 24-week, and the over70miles/week 24-week program) and PRed in the marathon after each. They are not easy or for beginners, so if you haven't run at least one marathon yet this isn't for you. If your only goal is to finish, these training schedules aren't for you either. My only criticism would be an overabundance of long runs in the 70+ schedule, but you have to tailor the schedules to what your body can handle. Great resource.</span>

                    <span>My job makes running at a club impossible, so I had been looking for other ways to train. Earlier this year, I found this book and after reading it, I was very confident in its methods. I finished my first marathon in 3.12, then went to 2.57, 249 and 2.43. I just finished my 6th marathon yesterday (Berlin), which was the first I ran with this book as my personal trainer, and I shaved another 5 and a half minutes off my personal best: 2.38. I have reached this progress in the last 3 months (my fastest half marathon was 1.21 in may!), and broke my personal best on the 10K a few weeks ago, and almost my personal best for the half marathon on my way to the marathon yesterday! During it all, I felt great, confident, and in control: I perfectly knew my possibilities thanks to the schedules in this book. They not only make you train hard, they also give you a lot of feedback of how capable you are, and which goals are realistic. Thus, even though I was running very fast during the first half, I always rested assured that I would be able to maintain that pace. I am going to give the book as a gift to a friend who wants to improve her results, and I can recommend it to anyone wanting serious improvements, and also wanting to know WHY he/she is doing WHAT while training.</span>
