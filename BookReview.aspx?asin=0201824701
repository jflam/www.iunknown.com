                <span id="Label1">This new edition of <I>C++ Primer</I>, a favorite choice for a first C++ book, has been greatly improved with the latest and greatest on C++, stressing the built-in language features of the C++ Standard Library. For this new version--weighing in at a massive 1,237 pages--Stanley Lippman, a well-known C++ expert, teams up with Jos&eacute;e Lajoie, who has helped define the C++ international language standard. The new material is excellent for programmers who want to get the most out of new and advanced features in the language.<p>The authors still introduce the basics of C++, including data types and pointers, but quickly move on to stress how to get the most out of the built-in features of ISO-standard C++. Throughout this book built-in support for the C++ Standard Library, such as container classes like vectors and maps, and other standard features, such as the string class, are integrated into a tried-and- proven basic-language tutorial.<p>The major new features of C++ (templates, name spaces, and run-time type identification) all get their due. The result is an authoritative guide to basic and advanced C++ in a clear and readable style, with plenty of short, practical examples throughout the text. The book includes exercises--some quite challenging--for every section: a perfect choice both for self-study and the classroom. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></span>

                    <span><P>Lippman's primer is the first book on C++ programming that I read. It happends to remain one of my favorites. The first part of the book is devoted to the "basic" syntax of the language. The differences with C are pointed out and for those unfamiliar with C programming this material is essential. The second half of the book coveres C++ specific topics like templates and object-oriented constructs. I find Lippman's examples superb. <P>I would rate the book a 9 out of 10 for technical
content, but unfortunately C++ has changed appreciably in the 6 years since it's publication. Overall I'd have to give it a 7 since it does not cover the recent changes to the language, for example the Standard Library (STL). Of course, only one introductory text does cover STL anyway, so I have high standards.

<P>Conversly, since the book was written about the time of the Annotated Reference Manual (ARM) it is a great introduction for experienced programmers who don't already know C++ and who might not want to know right away about the latest and esoteric features of the language.
Persons entirely new to programming might not want to start with this book.

<P>I teach C++ programming courses to part-time graduate students at the Johns Hopkins University and of the 20 or 30 C++ texts on my shelf I consider C++ Primer one of the top 2-3.

                    <span>I think most of reviewers who wrote reviews for this book are experienced programmers or at least they know how to buy computer books. Well I am a C++ beginner and I bought this book and I've used it for a while. See how a real beginner think. I bought this book 2 months ago when I started programming in C++. Nobody recommended it to me. The reason I decided to buy it because it looked to me that the book was very well organized. Well it really is. When I started reading and practining with it, I found that this book is definitely not for beginners. The autor wrote in preface "Knowledge of the C language is not assumed... this book is intended as a first book on C++; it is not intended as a first book in programming!" I think if he changed to " this book is intended to be used with other C++ books", would be much better because it's really hard to understand C++ by using this book alone. If you use this book as your first book for C++ and you understand well what are presented in the book, you may be one of the following.<P>1. You hold the head of the department of computer science<P>2. You just received bronze medal for computer olympic or the like <P> 3. You should found your own software company soon <P> 4. You are cheating <P>The book starts with a program contained several funtions, followed by processor directives and pointer. I didn't understand most of first 100 pages but when I go to other books and came back to this book, I could understand much better. <P>However I give this book 5 stars. What I can say is the book is great but not for beginners. Now I have about 12 books on C++ and I regrete that I bought some of these but I never regrete that I bought this book. I think that this book is the best of all I have. Why? Other viewers already mention it all. If you know a litle bit of C or C++ and you are thinking to buy a book, think of this one. You never regret.</span>

                    <span>For experienced programmers, C++ primer is a one-stop resource. However, the contents fall somewhere between a beginner level c++ books and the ultimate "THE c++ programming language" by the creator itself. Here is my breakdown of the book: (5=best)<P>#1: Contents (5): This book is the most comprehensive tutorial style books available. The contents are presented in no-fluff, succit style. Instead of just explaining the concepts, the author focuses on the possible pitfalls and critical details. I also like the comments on compatibility issues.<P>#2: Writing Style (3): I will give 3-stars for writing style because the book lacks the conversational tone. It presents a lot of details at once. ALso, the book is very "textbook" type and the style make it somewhat hard to follow inspite of its excellent contents.<P>#3 Organization (1). I agree with most other reviewers who think that the book suffer from poor organization. The authors are trying to make their book a tutorial and a reference at the same time and it clearly fails to fit in either camp. The author jumps around alot with a huge number of cross references and presents many concept without explaining them. This make this book very unsuitable for beginners with a little programming experience.<P>#4: Examples (4): C++ primer is one of the few books with decent practice problem. The examples are usually short and to the point and successfully avoid the unnecessary clutter. However, most are code snippets instead of complete working programs and usually donot touch realworld problems. <P>#5: Audience (2): The book claims to be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. In my opinion, for beginners this book can be very frustrating.<P>Overall (5): Inspite of its shortcomming, i give this book <BR> 5-star because its worth your money. This is one book that will become your all time favourite reference once you get comfortable with the language.</span>

                    <span>I use this book all the time as a reference, but if you are learning C++, this is probably one of the worst books you can get. It is highly disorganized and would discourage any student of C++. The authors routinely refer to subjects that have not been discussed or are covered a few chapters ahead.<P>But as a reference to c++, if you are already a C++ programmer, it is probably one of the best ANSI C++ books out there and subjects are covered clearly, that is if you already know C++.<P>For a beginner I recommend Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition) by Robert Lafore.</span>

                    <span>I'm almost halfway through the book, and its by far the best book I have come across so far. I've read Ivor Horton's Beginning C++, Teach yourself C++ in 21 days, and C++ Primer Plus which I bought by mistake. This book does a better job of explaining the concepts that the other books only touch on. It is not a reference book, but as a beginner I have to say that C++ Primer is good for beginners. The other books I read I use now as references when I get confused about something I read in Lippman's book. I used to struggle trying to answer the excersises in Ivor Horton's book, after reading through a few of the chapters in C++ Primer, I can go back and finish the excersises in Ivor Horton and Primer Plus with ease. I don't know what it is, but when this book frustrates me, I just go back and re-read the section, and then it becomes clear. If you don't understand something the first time you read it, read it again. I read on a website that when it comes to C++ books, you have to read them, until you understand, if it takes 20 times, then so be it.<P>The other books don't offer the same level of explanation. This book does a pretty good job of showing, not explaining how pointers are integral to C++. As opposed to a brute force explanation, which is confusing, and it's why Ivor Horton and Teach Yourself failed miserably at conveying the importance of pointers. <P>This shouldn't be the only book you have if you are begining C++, but it should be a book you have. This book is not about the syntax of the language, ie int, char, double, etc, but how you use them. I'm glad that I have this book.</span>
