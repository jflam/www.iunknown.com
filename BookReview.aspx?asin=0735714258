                <span id="Label1">Web designers loved <I>Eric Meyer on CSS</I>, which proved that a book could be both technically competent (it explained Cascading Style Sheets clearly) and aesthetically astute (printed in color, the book showed off Meyer's work brilliantly). <I>More Eric Meyer on CSS</I> picks up where the original book ended, going into detail on a score of important Web-design tasks. As he did with his first book, Meyer has had this one laid out in a broad-page format, with many illustrations, and printed in full color. The net effect is that readers see the design effects of the CSS tweaks under discussion, and there's no way to imagine (or load code) to see how colors and shadings look when rendered in a browser.<p>  Appealingly, this book is oriented around typical design projects (such as annual financial reports, weblogs, and personal homepages) and widely used design features (including menus and index tabs). This structure ensures the utility of Meyer's book--you can just turn to the chapter that deals with whatever you're trying to build, and see what the author did in a similar situation. Each section involves far more prose than code; Meyer is very careful to spend more time explaining what he's doing than he spends actually doing it, and the reader is never overwhelmed by giant CSS listings. Numerous screen shots intersperse the code and commentary, allowing you to see the intermediate results of style sheets in progress and adapt Meyer's beginnings in order to achieve different ends. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design professional-looking documents for online publication. Aspects of CSS that affect position, color, typeface, and other design elements are covered, as are the special considerations that relate to navigation tabs and images. A number of case studies (including a look at the author's contribution to the Zen Garden design project) make ideas clear.</span>

                    <span>This book is a definite plus for all people who have dabbled in table-free design but weren't quite ready to dive head first. If you are not familiar with basic CSS mark up, this book is not for you. If you wish to learn CSS from the ground up- see Christopher Schmitt's book "Designing CSS Web Pages" published by New Riders as well. Anyone who uses heavy javascript in their design will also find many streamlined CSS alternatives to that clunky code. "More Eric Meyer on CSS" starts off with a lesson on how to convert an existing table layout to cascading style sheets. I like the way Eric leads through the examples, every step in the code reveals possible browser conflicts. Lucky for us, he is able to supply the right workaround to make the pages compliant. Readers will also walk though styling a photo gallery, styling a financial report, 'transparency layout', and many more. My favorite lessons were CSS-Driven Drop-Down Menus, Opening the Doors to Attractive Tabs, and Designing in the Garden. I have been a fan of the csszengarden site, and I had fun reaching the Zen Garden!<BR>	Overall, this was a useful and comprehensive book. Eric Meyer has a simple way of presenting the lessons. None of the ten lessons he covers should take longer than one hour. He is obviously extremely knowledgeable in this field. His praise is well deserved. I personally plan on implementing these lessons on my personal site and those of future clients. The only flaw I found with this book was chapter 10's missing lesson file from the books website, this was alright, as a similar html file was supplied. It was definitely not enough to lower my perfect rating though.</span>

                    <span>Eric Meyer has done it again. His self-titled sequel More Eric Meyer on CSS is a collection of ten conversion projects that teaches CSS by example. A practical alternative to his other new book, Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide, 2d ed., More is more inspired how-to than dry reference. Meyer says that the ultimate goal is to "lure you into using more CSS" with tempting visual effects, improved accessibility, design flexibility, and reduced page weight. I asked Eric Meyer why he wrote this book:<P>"There was such positive response to 'Eric Meyer on CSS' that New Riders and I decided it would be fun to create a sequel. Both books share the same project-oriented, practical philosophy, which is what people really seemed to like - that and the full color printing! The hope is that the book will help more designers get to know and love CSS, and inspire them to take the concepts presented and do something really awesome."<P>Eric Meyer and Jeffrey Zeldman actually make standards sexy. Yes, by converting to CSS-based techniques you make your designs more flexible, accessible, and gracefully degrade, but you also lose wait, and gain pizzazz. Chapter 6 "CSS-Driven Drop-Down Menus," where Meyer shows how to create JavaScript-free nested pull-down menus, is worth the price of the book alone.<P>As you progress from project 1 through 10 Meyer takes you through more difficult CSS conversions. The first two chapters show you how to use CSS layout to convert conventional table-based designs into CSS-based layouts. Tables still have their uses however, and Meyer is not above styling table-based financial reports with CSS in project 3. Chapter 4 shows how to create translucency with positioned backgrounds. While the technique does a nice job of simulating the problematic semi-opaque PNG, Meyer points out the additional graphic overhead required for this technique.<P>Chapters 5 through 7 are the heart of the book, styling lists to create rollover, drop-down, and tab-based menus. Some of these techniques you may have seen before, documented by foreword writer Douglas Bowman and the aforementioned Zeldman. Meyer is the first to gather them all into one place and update them for CSS 2.1 and modern browsers (most version 5+ browsers). He takes you step by step through transforming simple unordered lists into line-straddling rollover menus, lightweight CSS-only drop-down menus, and variants of Bowman's "sliding doors" technique to create rounded tabs.<P>Chapters 8 through 10 take it up a notch, styling a weblog, a home page with weblog, and the CSS Zen Garden site. The Zen Garden project actually uses a PNG file that works with a full alpha channel in IE6/Win as well as IE5/Mac, Mozilla, Safari, and Opera. Chapter 10 in particular will be of interest to graphic artists who convert graphics comps into XHTML and CSS.<P>Starting with purely structural XHTML, Meyer shows you how to gradually build up your style sheets, adding effects with each iteration. Full color screenshots, notes, warnings, and websites annotate each tutorial with alternative methods, browser workarounds, and further reading. The net effect is like having a CSS master look over your shoulder as you convert existing web sites. You can take many of these techniques directly from the book and companion site (more.ericmeyeroncss.com) and put them directly into your sites, with some minor caveats.<P>Eric Meyer has arguably done more than anyone to help promote the use of CSS, and for that we applaud him. CSS is not just for styling text anymore.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent follow-up to "Eric Meyer on CSS." Meyer starts us in the same place as the original - turning an old-style table-based layout with font tags galore and showing how to trim the page size down using CSS for layout and formatting. The next 2 projects (Styling a Photo Collection and Styling a Financial Report) again hearken back to the original in that you are trying to complete a specific task. Along the way you are introduced to progressively more difficult concepts.<P>The gravy starts with Project 4 and continues through the rest of the book. Meyer leads us through some of the cutting-edge uses of CSS today and makes them work across today's popular browsers. When there is a problem rendering an effect in a particular browser, Meyer explains the pros and cons of using the technique.<P>This book is rated Intermediate-Advanced (same as the first book). Take that to heart. The projects in this book are harder than the corresponding project in the original. Neither teaches the basics. They make a great 1-2 punch and reading them in succession is a great idea. Make sure you follow along at the computer and do the projects - just reading them is helpful, but practice, practice, practice is absolutely necessary to really "get it".<P>Meyer again mentions that if you have read his previous books and don't like his writing tone, pass on this book. I find his writing style engaging. If you don't, consider getting the book anyhow - what you will learn from it should exceed any cringing you do at the style.</span>
