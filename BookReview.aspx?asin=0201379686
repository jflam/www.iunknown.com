                <span id="Label1"><I>Effective COM</I> opens with a chapter devoted to the migration from C++ to COM programming, presenting five "attitude shifts" that C++ coders need to undergo to program successfully with COM. It starts with a discussion of defining interfaces in the Interface Definition Language (IDL), and then moves on to a discussion of the unique distribution challenges of COM-based systems. The authors also discuss other differences, such as exception calls.<p> The next chapter presents tips pertaining to the all-important interfaces in COM. Both the big picture and some precise details are covered to help you implement your interfaces safely, as well as the implementations and the particular challenges that COM presents. The authors emphasize "defensive coding"--pointing out dangerous assumptions and offering suggestions for producing reliable components.<p> Apartments, security, and transaction management are addressed in succeeding chapters. As with the previous topics, they are handled via a series of specific tips and suggestions. If you're new to COM programming, you should read some more introductory texts first, but if you've already experienced your baptism by fire into the subject, this title can help ease future pain. <I>--Stephen Plain</I></span>

                    <span>Essential COM explains how COM really works but when it comes to specific problem you can't figure out what is the best solution to it. Effective COM goes further and presents good COM programming practices. It also clarifies some material from the former book that has not been explained in sufficient depth or lacks specific examples. However the chapter about security is not sufficient. If you are interested in COM security you must read another excellent book "Programming Windows Security" by Keith Brown.</span>

                    <span>This book was meant to help readers do DCOM more efficiently. But after learning about the gory details and ever-shifting underlying plumbings which may well defeat all one's efforts, the only conclusion is DCOM should never be hyped. Java and .Net are the far better solutions. Don't even mention the DCOM security stuff that make it a hell across domains.<p>Hey man, you should told us that DCOM deserve to be dead at the beginning. :-(<p>COM is for desktop, period.</span>

                    <span>I am one cheap programmer.   I've survived, most of my 11 years buying less then 20 books (employers bought the rest).  However, com objects made me loosen the purse strings.   To use com objects from ASP scripts I found the following references NECESSARY: <br>OREILEY book on ASP,<br>OREILEY book Learning dcom,<br> Oreiley book on VBScript,<br> Oreiley book on Developing ASP Components. <p> I've also noticed, that the books really do not overly overlap that I would consider any of the books a waste of money. <br>I found with the knowlege in those books I could (and did) create COM objects for use from C++ and ASP scripts.   It was after READING the first 154 pages of this book (Effective Com...) that my com objects went from functional to being a work of art.   (Ok, I'm overstating it).    <p>Things that should be obvisous can get lost in the complexity of com.   Effective com looks at what's bad and good about com, and that knowlege is power after your basic com skills have been established.   I'm not sure I would want to pay full price, but amazon has a good price on this book. Enjoy and have fun!<p>nbg.</span>

                    <span>After reading Essential COM, this book is disappointing. Essential COM may be the best book ever writen on explaining how COM works. Effective COM is very misleading. Many will make the mistake of assuming the author did his  homework in writing this book. As an example in point 9 of the book, he  suggest that connection points require five round trips and that  bidirectional communication can be established in one round trip. Both  figures are incorrect. Empirical evidence proves otherwise. In fact, the  point he is trying to make is completely false. His suggestion is that  callback interfaces can be established faster than connection points. This  is completely untrue. If you write an application that follows his model of  using callback interfaces, it will be slightly (15%) slower than  connnection points.</span>
