                    <span>While I do not often submit many written proposals, since most of my negotiation is done over the phone or in person, the few written proposals I have been required to sumbit were accepted every time!  The key was following the advice provided in this book.

                    <span>Thank goodness my company paid for this book.  In no way is it worth more than $100.  Consideringing that every other page is a notes page, you effectively get a 60-page book.  Exclude the related information (ex: sales questions, presentation tips) and maybe 15 pages of this book actually relate to writing a proposal.  I have read most of the books out there on developing proposals and any of them are better than this one at helping you develop a proposal.  And they cost a tenth as much.</span>

                    <span>I have been a huge fan of Alan's for years. And I didn't buy this book because of its high price for years. Well, then I broke down and bought it. Used in conjunctions with Alan's other strategies, this book landed me a $100,000 deal. When I asked what made the difference, they said, "The proposal." Enough said. Buy it. Use it. Profit from it.</span>

                    <span>I was skeptical.  How could one book be worth over $100?  And how could Alan Weiss tell me how to write proposals to my unique clients?  It has been almost one year since I asked those questions...If I knew then what I know now, I would have paid a $1000 for this book!  Here are the facts,when I first started using Alan's proposal templates my closing ratio went down from approximately 90% to 75%.  BUT my consulting engagment fees went UP OVER 100%. Now, I have learned to avoid clients who don't value my work and my closing ratio has gone back to about 90% at almost double the value to me! But that is not the biggest benefit, through this book I learned how to get paid in advance...before I ever begin the project.  Prior to using Alan's models I was never paid in advance, now 40% of my clients are paying me a much higher fee and paying it in advance.<p>I no longer have this book.  I took the pages apart and filed the proposal templates according to my client base and instructed my client services manager to never deviate from these templates.<p>There are many books that have helped me think more critically, solve problems quicker and speak more effectively...BUT nothing has helped me increase my consulting revenue like this one by Alan Weiss.</span>
