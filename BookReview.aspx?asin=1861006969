                    <span>I first got this right when it came out--when there wasn't much information on Visual Studio.  At the time, I found it helpful.  However, I feel that the title should be "Introduction to VS.NET".  If you are looking for an introduction to VS.NET this is a good book to get.  If you are looking for something akin to the WROX "Professional" series I would look else where.</span>

                    <span>The idea of the book is great, but it fails to deliver on some key areas.  I was expecting more of a "cool tips and tricks" for Visual Studio and less of an overall coverage of the .NET Framework.<p>Yes they do a good job at tying both of these topics together but then the book should have been titled something like "Introduction to the .NET Framework using Visual Studio .NET"		<p>Enough coverage of Debugging techniques and Deployment using Visual Studio .NET is what I would say are the two most valuable topics covered successfully in this book.<p>Overall it could have been better had the content been revised to a more specific topic.  I am not entirely happy I bought the book but neither am I totally bummed out that I did... so unlike me, think about what you expect out of it before you purchase.</span>

                    <span>This intro to the new features of the IDE is a good fit as a guide to the features of VS.NET for the experienced Visual Studio developer.  I give it a 5 with the preceding caveats.<br>  The book is just what I needed--a tour of the IDE highlighting the new features.  It doesn't let any language considerations get in the way of showing how to use the IDEs features, and in fact tells the reader to go away if they are looking for a book on VB.NET or C#.   Note here that all their sample code is written in C# though.<br>  Their treatment of each topic is in-depth enough to step you into the use of the particular feature at hand, yet concise enough to keep you on track and get you finished working through their example quickly.  I found them illustrative and easy to implement.<br>  I give it overall a 5 because I feel that all the great features of this book tip the scale, and because I value ease of reading and quality of organization over quality of index and error free examples. -- Reviewed by Robi P.</span>

                    <span>This is my second review on this book but this time I am looking at it form the prospective a brand new programmer wanting to get their feet wet with the overall VS.NET languages and tools. <p>This book is great for the beginner programmer. It is very clearly written and covers enough detail to get you started. From here, you could branch out into the respective languages and have some idea of the overall context. <p>If someone has had some programming background with Microsoft languages, you still might just want to start with a book on the language of choice...but for the beginner...this is a good choice.<p>Just don't expect an in-depth VS IDE book!<p>Earl<p></span>

                    <span>Not what I was looking for. This book should be called "Dabbling with the programs that come with Visual Studio. Net".  I was looking for a book that really explained what is going on with Visual Studio from how to use it to what is really happening behind the scenes.  This books DOES NOT do this. It is more of a primer for VB.NET, ASP.NET, XML and Crystal Reports...stuff that is already available in most books on each respective topic. <p>WHAT I LIKED<br>Debugging using VS.NET<br>Deployment using VS.NET<p>NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK<br>-The VS.NET environment<br>-What is happening when you create a solution?<br>-How solutions and projects relate to each other<br>-Files associated with projects vs. files associated with solutions<br>-How to configure the environment<br>-How to get help and create favorites of it, including information on the namespace references<br>-How to move, rename and delete projects, including web projects<br>-Tips on project layout, directory locations, and web project file management<br>-How to use common custom libraries for all your projects<br>-Use of multiple languages working together<br>-What are the files that are created when creating a project and what are they for<br>-The VS.NET Compiler, how it works, creating separate executables for each module.<br>-What happens at the code level when adding a reference, etc.<p>Basically, I wanted a book to explain the VS.NET environment and how it works, not a bunch of other information I can find in any other book and the subject. HELLO!<p>All in all I consider this a useless book. Just buy a book on the specific VS.NET area of interest (C#, ASP.NET, VB.NET) and it will cover all that is in this book on that topic.<p>Earl<p>Earlt777@hotmail.com</span>
