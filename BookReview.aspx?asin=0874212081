                    <span>Editor Kristen Johnson has done an excellent job of pulling together many difficult-to-obtain source documents that are pertinent to the Donner Party.  She enhances the reader's understanding by presenting detailed  biographical information about each document's author, combined with  copious footnotes, all of which are extremely helpful and unbiased.  The  tremendous amount of research required to synthesize the material is quite  apparent.  Johnson's volume of material helps to counterbalance some of the  older, more biased works of Donner literature.  This is a  "must-read" for anyone interested in American history, the great  western overland migration, or simply in tales of survival.   Congratulations to Ms. Johnson upon compiling an interesting, eclectic mix  of old and rare--some almost forgotten-documents which really improve our  understanding of conflicting viewpoints of one of America's greatest  mysteries.  (This text refers to the hardbound edition of the book, c.  1996.)</span>

                    <span>Johnson's book is a great reference for anyone interested in the Donner Party.  It is a compilation of written source materials, most contemporary to the Donner event. The book contains many personal accounts of the  tragedy, given from widely diverse sources, from survivors and rescuers to  "yellow journalists" of the time. Johnson's compilation is a  testament to how the Donner Party story affected people of the time, and  how their varying perspectives affected their opinions.  Johnson avoids  reader confusion with a complete set of footnotes, detailing where various  writers were inaccurate or incomplete in their retelling of this amazing  story of the West.</span>

                    <span>This book takes many early, hard to find, publications and compiles them into one comprehensive resource.  The book has excellent annotations and summaries which place events into perspective and help give a fair, balanced view of the Donner Party tragedy.  Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in our western history and the early settlers who helped to form it.  This is a great follow-up book to McGlashan and Stewart</span>
