                    <span>If you are really serious about getting ASP .NET knowledge and you are in real development environment where you need in depth knowledge of ASP .NET paradigm and controls, then this is the book for you. What I can't find at other places, this books describes it beautifully and clearly. I am very happy to get this book and I really enjoy reading it. I highly recommend this book for all types of developers, beginner, intermediate or advanced.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those great all-in-one tome books. Some of which are great, like this one. While others are little more than doorstops. The text is well written, though, like most Wrox books it relies heavily on code to do most of the exposition. Almost every topic you can think of is covered. Basic topics like controls, page design and security. Then onto more advanced topics like XML and mobile development. That's how you get to the tome size. But the coverage is consistently well written. So if you like your books in the all-in-one flavor, this is a good book for ASP.NET 1.1.</span>

                    <span>Man,<p>I have not bought a book from Wrox since ASP 3.0 because the quality of book went downhill.  Now they just write the books to 'sell'  not to help people.  I tried this book in the hopes that they may have changed, boy I was way wrong.  Book all it does is talk talk talk but not show much... All this stuff is stuff I find on the MSDN and online resources.  I mean, what they use to write for material!!!! The MSDN????</span>
