                <span id="Label1">A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul.  The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news.  And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel.  The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.</span>

                    <span>Mr.poppers penguins is a very good book. It is very funny. If you were to read this book you would be laughing as hard as you ever have. When I first read the bok I thought it was going to be worse, but it was very funny. I would recomend this book to people 10 and under.</span>

                    <span>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a dull book that is kept alive only by its strong moral lesson that contradicts the rights of slavery.  Jim, an African-American runaway slave, is on the search for his own freedom by escaping to the south.  Shortly into his journey, he phenomenally runs into and befriends Huck, a rambunctious wild child who is also coincidentally running away from home!  Although the lesson is important, I found that it clouded Twain in his ability to entertain me as a reader.  Insignificant chapters and random characters slowly drag along as Huck defeats all odds in his unrealistic encounters that take place on the Mississippi River.  Repeated character personalities and storyline ideas created confusion for me as I was also perplexed by Jim's heavy dialect.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is actually looking for an actual action plot as it is a huge disappointment as a sequel to the thrilling Tom Sawyer novel.

                    <span> I gave this book four out of five stars for a couple of different reasons.  First of all the book clearly shows the reader what is taking place in the U.S. at this time and it helps set the plot of the story.  The second reason I gave it this rank is because throughout the whole book there is always something exciting taking place and plenty of action.  This helps keep the reader focused and into the book.  Another reason for my ranking is because even though the book is mostly serious, Mark Twain adds some comedy into the book to help reveal some of the more serious times in the book.  The length of the book is just about perfect, because the author doesn't try and drag on a certain part of the story.  This makes the book more interesting.  Finally, the reason I didn't give this book a perfect five out of five is because of the ending.  I feel that the ending doesn't fit the book.  This is cause throughout the whole book there is always action taking place, and then at the ending of the book it kind of stops at a dull point.  I think the ending could have been changed or something a little more exciting could have took place.</span>

                    <span>Huckleberry Fin was a good an exciting book. It was easy to visualize what was going on when you were reading it.  It was about a poor 13 year old boy named Huckleberry FIn. His father was a drunk, and would beat him so he decided to run away.  Huck ran away with A former slave named Jim.  They shared many adventures as they went from town to town.  Huckleberry fin was a good book, and if you take the time to read it you will enjoy it.</span>

                    <span>Huck Finn Starts out great the first fifteen chapters or so are great, but then it starts to get more and more boring as the novel progresses. If your a reader that can just plow through chapters of maninless boring junk punctuated by periods of awesome literature this is the book for you</span>
