                <span id="Label1">According to marketing maven and <I>Purple Cow</I> author Seth Godin, the "Television Industrial Complex"--and its nasty habit of interrupting people with advertisements for things they don't want--is dead. Innovation is cheaper than advertising, advises Godin who defines the "free prize" with diverse examples including swatch watches, frequent flyer miles, dog bakeries, Tupperware parties and portable shredding trucks. He explains "Design matters, style matters, extras matter." <p>  The largest portion of the book is devoted to how to sell an idea to your organization. His specific tactics range from irreverent, (let them pee on your ideas) to practical (how to build a prototype). One standout chapter explains how brainstorming can become boring. His alternative, "edgecraft," involves divergent thinking to add something remarkable to your product. His long grocery list of edges (safety, equality, invisibility, and hours of operation) suggest a genuine marketing manifesto. The ideas are bold and insightful, but can suffer from being presented in less than logical order. The book is also diminished by Godin's self-marketing, from using terminology in his previous books to naming key ideas after himself. These advertisements are unnecessary. This nervy little volume is bound to mother many inventions. <I>--Barbara Mackoff</I></span>

                    <span>Forget ads. Forget TV spots. Marketing your company, your product/service, yourSELF means getting noticed and making something happen. <P>Seth Godin's latest, "Free Prize Inside" offers new insight and direction in the marketing of what you got, the "free prize" that sets you apart of the pack. Being a champion of ideas is critical to your efforts and your company's life. Introduce new challenges and breathe life into ideas that are sitting dormant in your mind.<P>This book (as have Godin's previous gems) is unique in its delivery and packaging. "How-to" will never be the same again!<BR>Pick up a copy (or two) and find out how to be the "go-to" person in your office or on your team. Don't look for the easy answers here; like "Purple Cow" says, it's about becoming remarkable through your marketing.<P>Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I first got hooked on Seth Godin books when he wrote Permission Marketing which is one of the best primers on effective e-mail marketing. Free Prize Inside is as equally good as Permission Marketing and is an easy read that is perfect for reading on planes, trains and automobiles. It introduces the concept of edgecrafting to help you get a competitive edge by adding a "Free Prize" to yor product or service. I love the special cereal box packaging too, it is a real conversation piece. Now if I could just get my hands on a Purple Cow Milk Carton to go with it ; - )</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of Seth Godin. His books Permission Marketing, Unleashing the Idea Virus, Purple Cow, and The Big Red Fez continue impact me on an almost daily basis. One thing I love about Seth is that he persuasively argues that in today's economy thinking on-the-edge is far safer than maintaining the status quo.<P>In Purple Cow, Seth argued that businesses and nonprofits need to be remarkable in order to survive. Being remarkable means that people will tell their friends about your product or service. Purple Cow was a thought provoking book but was lacking in helping readers implement the ideas. Free Prize Inside takes it the next step and shows us how to market and create remarkable changes in our organizations. <P>Free Prize Inside is divided into three sections:<BR> Why You Need a Free Prize<BR> Selling the Idea<BR> Creating the Free Prize<P>A "free prize" is a soft innovation. Seth builds the case for the urgent need of people in all organizations, including nonprofits, to be championing soft innovations. Soft innovations are the "clever, insightful, useful small ideas that just about anyone in an organization can think up." A free prize may seem like a gimmick at first but it actually becomes an essential part of your product or service. We all know what our favorite cereal tastes like, but it becomes irresistible when we see we can get a free prize inside the box. To illustrate his point, Seth is selling the first printing of this book in a special-made cereal box! You can pre-order a copy at Amazon.com.<P>He's convinced that anyone can come up with a free prize inside. The problem comes when we share it with others. Seth says our co-workers or boss, ask three basic questions:<BR>1. Is this idea doable?<BR>2. Is it worth doing?<BR>3. Are you the one able to do it successfully?<BR>If they aren't able to answer "yes" to all three questions, they won't join you, and the idea will die. The second section of the book is dedicated to specifically showing us how to keep our innovations alive by championing them and winning the support of others. After all, creating a free prize isn't important if we can't sell it to our organization. <P>The last section is dedicated to creating the free prizes. What would make your organization remarkable? Here Seth introduces his new concept of "edgecraft." He explains, "You're...caught in the center of a web of boring. The goal of edgecraft is to pick an edge (there are hundreds to choose from) and go all the way with it-even a little further than that if you can. Moving a little is expensive and useless. Moving a lot is actually cheaper in the long run and loaded with wonderful possibilities." <P>Donuts are boring but Krispy Kreme found an edge and made them sensational. Netflix did the same with movie rentals. They created a free prize by transforming the rental experience and created a very loyal customer following. The United Way found free prize when they discovered the concept of payroll deduction. Pushing that edge has helped them raised a lot of money!<P>Free Prize Inside is an inspiring and practical way for us to find our organization's edges and push for a free prize. It comes with extensive endnotes that cite Seth's sources, expand on points, and point you to great information on the web. I particularly appreciate Seth's constant attention to the nonprofit sector throughout the book. I highly recommend getting a copy. And, if you order it before it's published in May, you can still get it in a cereal box!</span>

                    <span>The packaging is an eye-catcher. Even the faux newspaper inside is clever. The last chapter is useable for those looking to find ways to sharpen your product's or service's point of differentiation. It's a variation on the SCAMPER technique we teach in our creative marketing conferences.<P>I read about one book a week, and I teach sales and creative marketing to others. From my perspective, the author is a talented person, with an exceptional work history. That's why I'd like to see Seth reach deeper from a content and application perspective. His work offers little that I haven't seen presented or written about before. Also, too many attempts to create his own vocabulary leaves me confused, and often, irritated. <P>The book should have been one chapter long. With the main point being that soft innovations (as compared to actual product or service modifications)allow companies to move quicker and respond more inuitively with the marketplace. It's a good point, and I look forward to better works in the future.<P>If you're an author, get the book (with the cereal box exterior) as a lesson in promotion and packaging. If you're a marketer, first take a look at Meaningful Marketing by Doug Hall and Jeffrey Stamp. Then, get this book so you can say you've read it. While $20 shouldn't set you back financially, you may consider waiting a few months from now to see if this book shows up on Amazon's used book list at a significant discount.</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the nay-sayers. This book is boring, doesn't really have a point and gives only the most facile examples. At every turn I found myself saying, I know that, or, So what? Sometimes, Oh, c'mon. At other times, I think all that could be heard was the sound of snoring. The only interesting and surprising marketing effort related to this book was Godin's ability to sell it to the editor at Portfolio.</span>
