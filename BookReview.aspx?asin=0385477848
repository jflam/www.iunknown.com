                    <span>In GOD HAS A DREAM, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a hero from the anti-Apartheid struggle, the spiritual and moral representative of South Africa and one of the few legends of our time made a case for humanity. In this book full of hope, deep and moving messages, profound spirituality, beautiful lessons, wise words and insightful truths, we are also treated to a series of humorous lines. This book is idealist in its message but pragmatic in its approach to solving the problems humanity is facing. It has a solution for people of every race, religion, nationality and gender. I recommend this book to anyone who seeking for the truth to solutions of humanity's problems.

                    <span>Many people teach the Christian creed from the perspective of those of us who have lived safe, happy and healthy lives with relatively few problems.  As such, the message is often that the purpose of evils and problems in the world is to reflect original sin.  That message can be an unsatisfying one.  
<br />
<br />Former Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, sees evils and problems as simply God's methods for developing us into our full potential as Christians.  He presents the idea in such a loving and accepting way that every reader will feel God's strength and kindness while reading these remarkable pages.  Think of Saul, the enemy of Christians, becoming Paul, the great Christian missionary, and the central message becomes clear.  
<br />
<br />The book builds a few simple ideas into their profound consequences:
<br />
<br />1. God believes in us.
<br />
<br />2. God's dream is that we will be His partners to transform the world into everything it can be.
<br />
<br />3. God loves us as we are, even the worst sinners.
<br />
<br />4. God loves our enemies as much as us.  We need to become forgiving as He is.
<br />
<br />5. God has chosen us to be the instruments of His goodness.  We need to act so that His will be done.
<br />
<br />6. To play our role, we need to turn suffering into an ennobling experience rather than an embittering one.
<br />
<br />7. To understand what we need to do, we need to spend time quietly with God listening to His messages for us.
<br />
<br />8. Ultimately, we should be confident that right will out and patiently believe that good will triumph in its proper time.
<br />
<br />What makes the book so special are the many wonderful stories about how these lessons served the South African leaders so well as they struggled to overcome the repressive Apartheid regime that burdened that country.  It's an uplifting, loving message from a kind, warm and generous spiritual leader.
<br />
<br />As I read what are often familiar Christian words and lessons, I began to realize more fully how God wants us to live with perseverance and adherence to our faith.  I also began to realize that we should uphold God's will in all that we do . . . by starting from a perspective of seeing ourselves as God's partners.  It's a very inspiring and spiritually uplifting message.
<br />
<br />If you would like to deepen and better apply your faith, I suggest you add this book to your daily Bible reading.
<br />
<br />May God bless you!       </span>

                    <span>Archbishop Tutu articulates in human language what God speaks through the heart. This is not so much a book of theology as a practical application of faith and love. Tutu sees us through God's eyes and gives us a way to do the same. His vision of inclusion and hope without naive cliche is truly an inspiring and important work. Whether you are religious or not, whether your faith is strong or weathered, this is a book everyone should read and take to heart. Tutu offers hope ... all we must do is take it.</span>

                    <span>I believe what Jimmy Carter wrote on the inside cover, "that this book could change history."   Remember the first picture of the earth from space?  This book is a visionary view of the earth from the heart of a truly heroic insightful soul.  Do not let the number of the pages fool you into thinking it is a quick read...it is rather to be savored and pondered.  You will want to read it out loud to be sure others hear these words.  <br>  This writing brings perspective in a world that currently seems off center.  Balance is what we need most as humankind faces all the days ahead.  It will make you smile, laugh, sigh and perhaps cry, but you will be the richer for it all.</span>
