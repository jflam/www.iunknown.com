                    <span>Among the patterns described is a template based factory pattern, where each Object register itself in the Factory template class; this Factory class knows nothing beforehand about all the various objects it will later create and deliver.
<br />
<br />I have implemented this pattern in conjunction with xml files, which has simplified my code greatly, in addition to making it more robust. 
<br />
<br />This pattern alone was worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>First of all, i don't understand why so many ppl complaining that the book talks too much about template. The title says generic programming; even you are so genius that you find other way to accomplish generic programming, I'm sure all the concept still apply.
<br />
<br />I'm really happy i read a review from Gamma's pattern (very good, but very dry, takes years to digest) book and pointed me to this book. It teaches you how to implement pattern using generic way. As an engineer(not computer science), I found the book answered a lot of question and probelm that I wasn't be able to deal with practically. 
<br />
<br />Here are the list that you can learn from this book,
<br />1. ever wonder how to write library like boost.org, read this book
<br />2. ever wonder how can you create a object with the same type of another object(or some type) without knowing the type, read this book
<br />3. don't want to implement pattern yourself or don't want to hard code the pattern, ex. object factory, then just download the code. VC,BC&GCC are supported
<br />
<br />Masterpiece.</span>

                    <span>Interesting book but dont' call it modern C++ design. GoF can call their book Modern Design, Mr. Stepanov can call his library Modern Design, Mr Meyers can call his books Modern Design, but this book has nothing to do with Modern Design. Either it is an old technique, wrapped in template implementation or some cumbursome  code which is not applicable in real life.

                    <span>This book describes many intersting C++ things, but is more like a University project than useful for engineer. There are not many things useful or educational for engineer.
<br />
<br />The author makes column on C++ Users Journal, which is more useful than this book. Author's new book on Coding Standards is also worht buying better than this. </span>
