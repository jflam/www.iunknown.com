                    <span>The high tech market illusion markets new technology immediately too the mass marketed.   Enthusiasts of the market illusion argue, "if Bill Gates can market windows to the masses, why can I market my technology to the mass market?"  At the origin, all high tech markets have a gap between the mainstream-market, the chasm.   The chasm problem can't be solved by voluntary assistance, all the resources required to cross the chasm must be requested.  In a closed market, a central authority controls all standards and rules.  This works fine for a closed market, however, the mass market is composed of numerous interest groups and each group is distinguished by its own psychology and demographics.  This each each group will have its own market response.  The key too crossing the Chasm means understanding each group niche and its relationship to its neighbor niches.  Make a total commitment to a niche and don't take on more than one or two niches at a time.  Reverse the trend in the niche decision from high risk and low data too high data and low risk.   Focus resources to become dominate in the niche, big fish in small pond.  Characterize the target: create something that feels like real people, record down your customer scenerios, store thumbnail information about each customer, and determine how the product will be brought to use by the customer.  
<br />
<br />Accepting this reality means building a whole application that solves a 100 percent of the business problems of the group, this becomes the high tech lore: 1. target the right customer 2. derive the compelling buying reason 3. build the whole product 4. form partners and allies 5. create a distribution channel 6. find the right pricing 7. distinquish from competition or create competition 8. position into the niche and work to create a mass market merge 9. determine the next target customer.
<br />
<br />The high tech innovator must become enlighten.  As you cross the chasm you will not be a market leader, but by the time you reach the other side, there will be a strong following.  The high tech innovator must realize the markets do not unfold in a smooth continuous manner, there are perils in the chasm, and gain niche loyalty is the key to gain mass-market loyalty.   The innovator must gain the trust of the pragmatist.  The pragmatist is critical to gain customers because of his large support base.  Once the pragmatist is won over, he remains very loyal to the application.  It is impossible to win mass-market acceptance with gain the pragmatist loyalty.
<br />
<br />Visionaries give high tech companies their first breaks.  The winning strategy is for the entrepreneur to define product deliverables. The Visionaries can give the high tech company a burst of revenue and exceptional visibility and without the boost the high-tech products can't make it to market.  The visionary is in a hurry to build the future and perceives limited windows of opportunity.  Because the opportunity windows are small, large sums of money are generated to complete the project on time.  The entrepreneur must create phases of the visionaries project.   The high tech company must seed the entrepreneur community with their idea and product overview and hope that a visionary will share its vision.   The process is a creative imaginative dream and high tech company is offering a credible way for visionary to realize their dream.  The core of the dream is a business goal and it involves a quantum leap forward in the way business gets done and it also involves a high degree of recognition and reward.  The dream is looking for a fundamental breakthrough.
<br />
<br />The market is flush with enthusiasm and vision.  The high tech company must attempt to distinguish themselves from their competitors and once the mainstream merges with the market niche, wealth and growth occur.
<br />
<br />The early majority wants evolutionary and not revolutionary product features.  The early majority is concerned about disrupting their organization.   A very pragmatic attitude compels the early major to seek resource references reassuring them on the technology investment.
<br />
<br />The early adopters hope to gain a jump on their competition, lower production costs, provide more complete customer service, and create a radical discontinuity between the old way of doing business and the new way. 
<br />
<br />It is tough to break into a new industry when selling to a pragmatist.  Pragmatists deeply value the experience of their colleagues and funds are in the hands of prudent souls.  Pragmatists seek a percentage improvement: incremental, measurable, and predictable and too them risk represents a chance to waste money.  The natural prudence and budget restrictions keep them cautious.  Pragmatist focus on standardization, increased sales, and lower costs and once won they are very loyal.
<br />
<br />The customer can't reference each other when they are in different markets.  Customer reference is a chain reaction affected usually by word of mouth.  The market purpose must be to develop and shape something that is real and has a set of potential customers and a given set of products and services and allows the customers to reference each other when making buying decisions.

                    <span>Long established as a classic, the drawing depicting the different classes of customers and their adoption rates are commonly used in the industry. I personally thought I already understood it, just from osmosis. However, reading the book taught me more about the characteristics of those customers, how you gain penetration into their markets, and most importantly how you manage a team and produce a product into those markets.<p>There are also lessons in there about establishing a beachhead and how to choose your target customer that dovetail nicely into some more modern work around persona identification in software development and the need to identify just one target persona for your application at a time. This is a great marketing book -- even if some of the specific company examples are somewhat dated -- whose concepts readily translate into not only management but directly into product development and vision.</span>

                    <span>There are some rare books that create revelations, and in my professional career, this is one of them.  Now it is obvious why I often failed to connect with "Pragmatists" and other customers, who didn't seem to get it like the other "Visionaries" and "Technofiles" I had little trouble selling to.<p>I was the one who didn't get it!<p>In addition, marketing and sales books can be such dull tomes, but Moore's professional experience and accesible manner makes for an interesting read.  His "lingo" has been picked up but many professionals, to the point where you need to read Moore just to be up to date.  But the good news is, you will be much more effective in technical sales and marketing after reading this book.</span>

                    <span>There are plenty of long reviews on this, so here's just a short synthesis.  This is considered the Bible of marketing thought for early stage, technically-oriented products.  It describes the phases of customer thinking, and how you have to appeal to them, including some non-intuitive but dead-on approaches for making the leap to the Early Majority. <p>For some reason, this second edition seems to have been edited poorly though, with grammar erros and such.  Unfortunate for a great work.</span>
