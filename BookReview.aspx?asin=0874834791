                    <span>"Talk does not cook the rice." Chinese proverb (p.137) <P>The simple introduction states that this collection contains folktale, parables, and proverbs from around the world. It also mentions that stories are powerful teaching tools. <P>Stories are divided by local as in the case of Zen stories from Japan and by religious group as in Jewish or Christian tales. There are no illustrations except small decorative "borders" that divide the title from the story. <P>Most of the stories are short and simply told. They appear quite tellable as written or they could be embellished. The tales are suitable for a variety of ages and some for all ages. The stories are very good, but I suppose with so many stories to choose from, it must have been a hard selection process. <P>The source notes are a real treasure. Each section has some interesting background common to all the stories. Forest then describes the history of the tales and various sources. She says what she based her stories on but not how much she changed them. The several stories that I was familiar with do not appear to be greatly altered. <P>There is a list of proverbs from various countries.<P>I would recommend this book as a very good storytelling resource.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those rare books which can appeal to audiences of a wide range of ages, faiths,and backgrounds - whether you are a child, teacher, preacher, parent, or connaisseur of world cultures.<P>The fifty folktales and parables in this collection have universal appeal because each tends to speak to some aspect of human experience which is common across cultures. They range from a short three paragraph Chinese tale of a philospher waking up from a dream, wondering whether he is a man dreaming he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he is a man, to the well known Indian tale of three blind men and the elephant.<P>Without being either overtly religious or secular, this collection reflects Zen, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Taoist, and Sufi faiths in its short stories, as well as traditions from Ancient Greece and Africa. <P>If you wish to open the early mind of a future young reader to the treasure troves of world literature, this is a good place to start.</span>

                    <span>Fine collection and one we see people refer to very often on discussion lists and web sites. From the simple to the complicated, from the overt to the sublime, you will find some story of value in this book that speaks to you and wants you to speak it. Well worth the price and a book that you will read and tell often.-Storyteller.net Review</span>

                    <span>Having had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Forest perfom live in Louisville, Kentucky, it was my pleasure to become reaquainted with her work. This book is as alive as her live performances. I could hardly put the book down once I started it. I would recommend this book to storytellers, story lovers, parents, and preachers. A great source of some of the world's finest tales. A job well done Ms. Forest!</span>
