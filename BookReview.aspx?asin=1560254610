                    <span>this book was not well thought out. it was just an attempt to sound intelligent, but failed. the purpose of a book the should be to enlighten your readers not with big sounding words but with good ones that best describe the situation you are trying to get across. to me the book had nothing to do with tupac, it dealt with the author's lack of ability to put words together to form a sentence that could capture his audience. he just used the icon's name to sell his book, and true we fell for it, the true fans of tupac. we try so hard to grasp hold on anything and anyone that can give us more facts than we already have, so it pains me when people do things like this book which was so so so poorly written. i would hate to have a face to face conversation with him. PAC will always be in our hearts, thoughts and thanks to the real Gs he will be on our radios, TVs, VCRs & DVDs. as PAC would say, "NEVER IGNORANT GETTING GOALS ACCOMPLISHED."</span>

                    <span>A great x-ray of Tupac and a much better book than Michael Eric Dyson's foolish cashing-in on a dead rapper's tattooed body. A lot of stupid stuff has been written by the VIBE and Village/Stone people who just want to make money off 'Pac. REBEL makes you understand Tupac's confusion and the analysis of the rap lyrics are the best I've ever read about a rap star.  (The chapter on "Dear Mama" should be included in every school literature class.) I recommend this book to anybody who loves 'Pac and loves hiphop. When Dyson's stupid book goes the way of the dodo, REBEL will still be read. It's the most serious and amazing Tupac book anyone could want.</span>

                    <span>Ever since the first time I heard 2pac rapping with Digital Underground. I feel in love with the lyrics he put out from Brendas got a baby, to Got keep your head up! And so many more. No matter what people though of him as being the THUG N***** he was somebody real. When others never understood where 2pac was coming from he made music that everybody could groove to and understand. He's the one who put potery to its most. The day he passed a way felt like I had lost some one I knew and loved.  I'am a true Tupac lover and only wish he was still here blessing everyone and even ME with his True words of wisdom. It's been almost six years since his death and no matter if he's dead or alive he'll continue to put out the music he so muched loved to do and the music everybody loved. This is a man that should've e still been here and listening to his new ablum makes me think if he is still alive and if you are may GOD be with you and you with him in your deepest glory. Bury me as a "G" RIP  I LOVE YOU TUPAC.  L-Boogie and S Loc OKC</span>
