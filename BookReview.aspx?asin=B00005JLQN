                    <span>Despite the fact that Phone Booth's release date was postponed time and time again, it is still a more than solid pot boiler that showcases the skills of stars Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Farrell plays Stu: a smarmy publicist who, in an attempt to cheat on his wife, uses a phone booth in New York City to contact his young client (Katie Holmes who is wasted in this thankless role). One day Stu picks up the phone when it rings only to be held hostage by a seemingly crazed sniper (Sutherland, whose malicious voice is simply chilling) demanding that Stu confess his sins or he dies. Director Joel Schumacher (the man who ruined the Batman film series) keeps the pace speedy and suspenseful without having the film wear out in it's 80 minute running time. Farrell (in a role originally planned for Jim Carrey) gives a great performance and seems to become more and more of a great actor with each film he does, while Sutherland (whose role was originally slated for Ron Eldard) is fantastic, even if it's only his voice that is performing. Radha Mitchell is wasted as well as Stu's hapless wife, while Forest Whitaker seems a bit out of place as police Captain Ramsey. All that aside however, Phone Booth is a more than solid thriller that is definitely worth checking out.</span>

                    <span>With a fascinating premise, Phone Booth begins with some well-conceived New York City imagery, then taking viewers to the busy life of crude publicist Stu Shepard, played by Colin Farrell. After making a call to Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), who he is having an affair with, though she, quite innocently, does not know that Stu is actually married to his wife Kelly, Stu hears the phone booth ring, and he answers the phone. On the other line is a sniper who will shoot him if he hangs up or tells anyone. Soon, after the Caller proves his motive by gunning down a man ready to force Stu out of the booth, the authorities arrive.<BR>A triumph in some fantastic photography and editing, Phone Booth is a modern example of the quick-cut editing seen in most trailers, but does it well. Split-screen technique is usefully inputted here, again displaying the quick pace of this man's life. A jolting, synthesized musical score accompanies the cinematography, and is at just the right level.<BR>The movie is directed by Joel Schumacher, who handles the premise well, and written by Larry Cohen, whose dialogue is realistic. Stars Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker, Captain Ramey of the NYPD, have a good screen presence that lasts the single-set suspense-thriller. It is Kiefer Sutherland, as the voice of the Caller, who menaces the characters and the viewers with his taunting, threatening tones, who really steals the show. His demands and hateful voice add to the movie.<BR>However, the "urban reality" that the film provides is only stereotypical and clich√©d. Teeming with break-dancers, prostitutes, and baseball-wielding pimps, the inner-city portrayal isn't quite believable, and the shouting prostitutes get really annoying. And while it lacks in a truly exciting finish, the film makes up for it with the tension throughout.</span>

                    <span>This is a movie that I put off watching for a long time, because it sounded really boring. Trap a man in a phone booth, and talk him to death? Yawn.<P>I finally watched it with the rationale that it is Colin Farrell in the booth, and therefore would not be another "My Dinner with Andre" kind of movie.<P>While I've seen better movies, this one kept my attention, and I would never consider it to be 81 minutes of my life irretrievably lost. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Stu Shepard, but the rest of the cast fails to register on the "Wow" scale. Katie Holmes is cute, but horribly miscast, and Forest Whitaker won't be putting this one down as one of his better performances. Nobody else even registers, except of course the caller, who has a suitably creepy voice.<P>The concept is intriguing, as a mystery caller with a wealth of technology and information seeks to right the wrongs of the world, one slime-ball at a time. Worse offenders must have crossed his path, but for some strange reason, he decides to target Shepard for the "crimes" of fantasizing and nearly cheating on his wife, for faking his success, and for not being nice to people in general. After Shepard manages to tip off the police, and they finally realize that something's not right with the scenario, the movie wraps up in an untidy hurry. <P>The major let down for me was the prominent billing for Keifer Sutherland, even with his face in the cover shot, so you definitely knew something was wrong by the time you got to the end, said end being quite unsatisfying.<P>Plot holes abound, but if you can get past them, you will enjoy Farrell's performance. <P>Amanda Richards 7/12/04</span>

                    <span>This movie is supposed to be another action packed thing. But its more like a 2 year olds scary movie. This guy goes in to a phone boothe at a time given and if he puts down the phone hes gonna get shot. Theres this big red dot that stays on him all the time so if he puts down the phone hes gonna get shot.</span>

Now Stu must outwit a Psychotic Sniper before He's out from the Phone Booth to Freedom.<P>Directed by Joel Schumacher (8MM, Falling Down, Tigerland) made a Clever, Suspenseful, Taut Dark Comedy Thriller. Farrell gives a Dynamic Performance and a Chilling Voice Work by Sutherland. This film was only shot in 12 Days in December, 2000 and it was release in April, 2003. Which it was probably, the best way to shot the film to keep the mood realistic.

DVD has an fine commentary track by the director and the original theatrical trailer. Do not miss this unique psychological thriller.
