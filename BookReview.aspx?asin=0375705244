                    <span>I first thought Founding Brothers was an odd choice of titles for Joseph Ellis's recent look at the leaders of the Revolutionary era. One could hardly put James Madison in the same generation as Ben Franklin. But I think it may be a deep brotherhood than that. Ellis's focus is on the relationships among the founders. We know, of course, that they were a group that all generally knew each other personally and had shared in the Spirit of 76 at the time.  What, exactly, does this then mean?
<br />
<br />What it means is that how they related to each other is as important as what specifically they thought and did. Ellis presents the reader with six episodes in early national history, in each emphasizing some topic and one or more pairs or groups of personalities. Beginning with the Hamilton Burr duel as the exception that proves the rule, Ellis explains how the enormous dislike and distrust that certain founders had for one another could become vicious and personal beyond what we know in politics today. Compared to revolutions like the contemporary French, to say nothing of the later Russian or Chinese, which tore themselves apart from inside, the American revolutionaries managed to remain, if not always even civil, then at least within the bounds of the law. The Hamilton Burr duel, besides being the single noteworthy exception, seems so placid in comparison to the Reigns of Terror that took over elsewhere that even in deadly conflict, our Revolution remained civilized. Moreover, the resulting single death essentially moved dueling from an illegal but overlooked activity to something truly distasteful.
<br />
<br />Other chapters take less extreme cases, showing how sectional and even personal differences could result in great acrimony, but also great compromise, even if sometimes the compromise was to agree not to mention something (slavery, for example). Besides the conflicts, Ellis shows how partnerships grew and blossomed (Jefferson and Madison), or grew, shrank, vanished, and re-emerged (Jefferson and Adams). The emphasis remains generally on the relationships rather than any single individuals or particular issues, though Ellis does of course tell us what the issues are.
<br />
<br />Ultimately, the reader will judge this work on whether or not these connections seem meaningful or important. One should not underestimate Ellis's skill as a writer, and I note that he managed to win a Pulitzer for Founding Brothers. It is well deserved. To recite the frequently overused phrase, Ellis has made history come alive for us between these two covers.

                    <span>I was assigned to read this along with several other books for a class on the American Revolution.  Since I had little if any knowledge on the subject, I was going in fairly blind.   Three of the books (Founding Brothers, His Excellency and American Sphinx) were an entertaining read as well as informative.  Ellis' goal with Founding Brothers is to take a closer look at certain significant events in the American Revolutionary period which are more noteworthy than others.  The Hamilton-Burr Duel, The Dinner at Jefferson's house, Washington's farewell, The slavery issue and the tension filled relationship between Jefferson and Adams both during their time in office and after political life.  Many questions have been raised concerning the Duel, the Dinner and the silence over the slavery issue and Ellis concentrates on the myths and truths of each situation.  Due to lack of written record, some if not much on these subjects have been lost relegating historical theories to just that, a theory.   
<br />
<br />Washington's farewell was incomplete, but a single volume would be needed to due this event justice.  Ellis' intention was to show Washington as an example of what our most powerful elected official should be, i.e. Cincinatus who serves his country then relinquishes his authority to return to his previous life as a citizen.  More of our elected officials, not just the President, would benefit immensely from this example instead of ceasing power and never letting it go.  
<br />
<br />As for the two chapters concerning John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, some critics have properly described this section as too long and to an extent boring.  While the falling away and reunion are significant, a single chapter would have sufficed.  
<br />
<br />One last comment I wish to make about previous critics regarding the language Ellis uses.  I am a Graduate student working towards a M.A. in history.  Throughout my college career I have be assigned numerous books which are written for the scholarly elite, of which I am not one.  Many of these books contain `$50' words where simple words would work, but Ellis is not in this category.  I was able to read each of his books with little or no assistance from a dictionary, somewhat uncommon for me.  As for Ellis' perjury about Vietnam, I would be concerned when reading his books but since all books I read coincided with these, I conclude that Ellis is a talented writer despite a lack of personal self-esteem in his personal life.  
<br />
<br />Other books I read for this class were Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography and Other Writings, The Age of Federalism (Elkins, Stanley and McKitrick, Eric), War for America (Black, Jeremy), Alexander Hamilton: A Life (Randall, Willard Sterne) and The First Salute (Tuchman, Barbara).</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Instead of attempting to cover a broad range of events and folks involved in Revolutionary America, Ellis decides to concentrate on specific events in a series of six essays that cover the Hamilton-Burr Duel; the dinner w/ Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison at which an exchange was orchestrated for acceptance of Hamilton's fiscal plan and the location of the capital on the Potomac; the Silence of congress (and the whole government) on the slavery issue; Washington's farewell address; and two essays on the relationship of Jefferson and Adams.
<br />
<br />While this neither claims to be through biography or history, Ellis is able to accomplish much here that significantly larger books fail at. He does an excellent job of communicating to the reader the true radicallness of the revolution and the dire consequences for those involved if the experiment fails. Eschewing both hagiography and the trend of examining the everyman, he depicts the actors as fully human and essential to understanding the time. But more than anything else--and this is especially true in the duel chapter, he draws the reader's attention to the fact that much of history is guesswork and will never be known with certainty.
<br />
<br />Though I would suggest numerous other volumes for a thorough appreciation of the revolutionary era of our history, I would not hesitate to recommend this volume to some one who is looking for an entertaining read--whether they are interested in Revolutionary America or not.

                    <span>This book was a joy to read, though it took me some time to get through. Not because it was a slow read, but because interesting and good solid historical works are not fast reads. Ellis's is a master story teller, with a deep sense of language and keen turn of phrasing. He offers amazing insights into early revolutionary history through six vignettes between the founding brothers of the revolutionary generation. 
<br />
<br />1) The Hamilton Burr duel as a window on the political disagreements of the period.
<br />
<br />2) Dinner between Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton as a means of compromise on Hamilton's federal fiscal programs and the location of the Nation's capital in Virginia 
<br />
<br />3) The Silence from the House and the Senate on the slavery question when raised in 1790 by Quaker Abolitionists and the portent of that void. 
<br />
<br />4) The Farewell of George Washington's retirement from the presidency and his advice to future generations. 
<br />
<br />5) The Collaboration between opposing parties : Jefferson and Madison as Republican's while Jefferson was vice president to John Adams as president, whose confidant was his wife Abigail Adams 
<br />
<br />6) The Friendship between Jefferson and Adams during the last 14 years of their life as they reflected on their revolutionary historical legacy. 
<br />
<br />Some of my favorite insights. That streamlined histories are always retrospective applications of order on what was at the time an evolving unclear series of events. The failure of the revolutionary father's to deal with the slavery question, enabled the union to form, but that despite this dodging a price was to be paid, the Civil War. Ellis's description of Washington surrendering his military commission to congress : "in doing so he became the supreme example of the leader who could be trusted with power because he was so ready to give it up". And Washington's military strategy was the recognition that victory did not mean winning battles. Captured ground, what Washington termed a "war of posts", was virtually meaningless. The strategic key was the Continental Army. If it remained intact as an effective fighting force, the American Revolution remained alive, and the British could not win the war, which in turn meant that they would eventually loose it.

                    <span>Simply put, this book is great.....then it did win the Pulitzer, so I guess that goes without saying.
<br />
<br />One thing most people really don't understand about America is that during the couple of decades surrounding the Revolution, the future and survival of the nation was anything but inevitable.  There were extreme differences of opinion on the actual meaning of the Revolution and the Constitution (so much for "original intent") to the point that friendships were broken forever.  Even George Washington, the one person that just about everyone agrees the new nation could not have done without, was attacked mercilessly as having betrayed the principles of the Revolution.  All this while the new nation was walking a fine line in dealing with our European brothers.  Our sailors were being captured and impressed into service for other nations, we were in severe debt for the war, a substantial segment of our population lived in slavery, and we desperately needed to build an economy that could stand on it's own legs in the world.  We are fortunate that the men discussed in this book happened to be alive during that time.  Never before or since has the world seen a group more capable of handling these challenges.
<br />
<br />As others here have mentioned, this book focuses on several events that occured during the first years of the republic, events that help to shine a light on the thinking of the founders and the political landscape of the times.  It is truly a fascinating read......I guarantee you'll love it.</span>
