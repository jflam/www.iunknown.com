                    <span>This book was a real disappointment.  Although the information on the cover doesn't say so, it's aimed almost exclusively at people in business situations; almost all of Fine's examples deal with corporate conferences and other networking events.  For example, her top suggested line for exiting conversations is "I need to go see the exhibits."  She continually emphasizes how improving your small talk skills will win you new clients, a promotion, etc.  What about just making friends?  The idea that you might want to improve your conversational skills in everyday social or family situations is hardly mentioned at all.
<br />
<br />Fine also has some peculiar ideas about what constitutes "small talk."  She offers a long list of "icebreakers" for initiating conversations with people you don't know.  Unfortunately nearly all of these are too personal, too serious, or just bizarre.  Imagine trying to strike up a conversation with a stranger by saying, "If you could replay any moment in your life, what would it be?"  The person would just think you're either nosy or a kook.  She even suggests using political statements as conversation starters, which is just asking for trouble.
<br />
<br />There are a few good suggestions in the book; she has useful advice for dealing with egocentric people who talk endlessly about themselves.  However, all of Fine's good ideas could easily fit on two or three pages.</span>

                    <span>The issue is that most us find it difficult to have a small talk specially with strangers. <p>The conclusion is that if you take the risk (of rejection) and burden of making the small talk, you will reap the benefits.<p>The examples are good. I like it for the clarity and crispness. I am going to try the advise since it is not too difficult.</span>

                    <span>This book is written by a woman, for women. Being male and reading this book, i quickly saw how useless this book is for me. I am not being sexist so quit mounting your offense, i am simply stating fact. Her lack of knowledge on the male spectrum of this lack of communication skill is obvious. She knows what it's like for women, but cannot speak for men.</span>

                    <span>I don't see how this book would help anyone. The 50 icebreakers were just awful! If a stranger approached me with pretty much any of the 50 suggested icebreakers, I'd refer to my "how to get out of a conversation" handbook.....not worth your money.</span>
