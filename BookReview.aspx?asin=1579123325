                    <span>This book on baseball parks was incredibly good.  I personally am very interested in baseball parks and so I have high expectations for a book like this.  The information was given in an easy-to-read way that made reading it enjoyable and not a chore.  There were lots of facts and the pictures were perfect.  The only problem was the shape... I don't get it is it a baseball or what?  Other than that this is one of the best baseball books there is and I should know because I love baseball.

<br />P.S.  Go Rangers</span>

                    <span>"Take Me Out To The Ballpark" is a delightful, stadium shaped book-tour through ballparks of the past and present.  While focusing on major league ball parks, distinguished homes of minor and Negro league teams are also highlighted.
<br />
<br />Almost all major league parks of the Twentieth Century are featured.  Most segments combine narratives and pictures along with lists of stadium firsts and highlights.
<br />
<br />"Take Me Out To The Ballpark" is a real treat for every baseball fan.</span>

                    <span>I think that this is a wonderful book.  I love baseball so was thrilled to be given this book as a present.  You can spend hours pouring over each and every page, learning interesting facts about the ballparks where some of the most exciting games took place.  
<br />
<br />My only complaint would be the size and shape of this book.  It is shaped like a ballpark and thus doesn't fit easily onto a bookshelf -which means that you have to leave it out on a desk or table.  Perhaps that was the editor's idea...  having it out in the open just makes it too tempting to pick up and enjoy over and over again.</span>

                    <span>Take Me Out To The Ballpark is probably...no IS the most detailed baseball book. It has from photos to history that goes way back to 1910!  <p>One of the best facts in it is that there is 2 White Sox stadiums. It shows them too!  If you're a baseball fan then this is gold for you! I give it a 10/10!So quit mess'n around and read this    <br>RAD book.</span>
