                    <span>Well lemme me say I have been swimming since I was 7. I am a teenager of 14 and what he says about injuries is not very much so true. Yes it is very true you use your muscles and joints but you can have an extremely high injury. I have gotten alot of injuries. I have extreme shoulder problems and my neck is horrible. He states that you have a minimal chance of getting injured and if you are you can hop right back in. I would like to inform you all that I was out of the pool for a year. A whole year and I swim for a USA team. You cannot just jump in and do what he says it takes strenght and agility. I love swimming always have yet I know that if I do not do things right I can get hurt. This goes for everyone I swim with. I do very much though think everyone should try it just do not work so hard that you get to be like me. I am young things heal but as I sit here and type I am in pain. But I would not stop swimming for the world.
<br />
<br />Thanks a friendly swimmer. </span>

                    <span>This book is more than a guide to swimming. It's a guide to understanding how teach your body swimming as if it were a language. I used it myself and found a pleasure in swimming that I previously had not found, the result has been a quick transition from beginner to intermediate freestyle swimmer. The book is not perfect, it repeats itself (in fact this may be the mantra that makes the book so appealing), also I found the drills difficult to interpret from print. Even so, I found the book everything I needed to make me realise that swimming is an endless search for a beautiful perfection.

                    <span>This book has had a tremendous influence on my swimming.  The drill, particularly the balance drills in chapter 8, have transformed the way I swim.  I cut my strokes from 28 to 20 in a very short period of time.  This version is the updated book with the updated drills and they are fantastic.  They will make you understand the necessity of balance in the water.  As some others have noted there is a lot of discussion on why things should be done this way and the author spends a great deal of the book "on the soapbox." But this is because of the need for convincing others.  Really use the exercises in this book and you will fly through the water.  An outstanding effort that is the swimming equivalent of the Brawn books. </span>

                    <span>A lot of people have mentioned that the techniques are obsolete, and that you should get Laughlin's other book, Swimming Made Easy. Not so!
<br />
<br />In this revised and updated version, the author has completely revised the drills used -- if I remember right, he said that only two of the original 12 drills are used in the now-14 drills.
<br />
<br />Why did I give this book only 4 stars? Let me give you the breakdown:
<br />
<br />First, the CONTENT, or the substance of the book: the techniques and drills presented are superb! I don't know if olympic swimmers can actually improve their times using this book, but I know that as a casual swimmer, I have improved a LOT. The techniques are, for me, revolutionary (but maybe not for professional/olympic swimmers, who may already know these techniques). And for that, this book would have gotten 5 stars -- because of the new techniques that one can learn from this book.
<br />
<br />Second, however, is the PRESENTATION. For something that shows a lot of techniques, pictures are worth a thousand words. But instead of photos, we only have illustrations (drawings only! and by the author's brother at that!). And the number of illustrations are sparse! I have weightlifting books, stretching books... and they all have PICTURES. I think, especially for a book like this, I would have preferred that there be a SERIES OF PICTURES (a frame by frame thing showing the technique in practice).
<br />
<br />Sure, the author tries to explain, but so much verbiage can only go so far -- besides, he would have to use a thousand words to be worth it, as the saying goes. Several pictures would have helped tremendously. Or at the very least, more illustrations.
<br />
<br />Again, I highly recommend the book, but as some other reviewer has said, if you can get the DVD Freestyle Made Easy, then that would be fantastic. Personally, even if it does jack up the price a bit, the book and video go HAND in HAND. The author would probably say the book and video complement each other, but I would go further and say that the book and video are INDISPENSABLE from each other, and that they SHOULD be bundled in the first place.
<br />
<br />The book fills in all the words that they can't fit in a voiceover of a video, and the video shows the actual techniques in action. If one needs to make a choice, I'd probably get the video first, then fill in all the details (and read all the explanations) in the book. If you can only afford one, I'd say get the video (but really, try to get the book, too).
<br />
<br />In this revised and updated version, the drills in the book are the drills used in the Freestyle Made Easy DVD.
<br />
<br />So, this book is NOT obsolete, and in fact I think it explains the theories of the Total Immersion way better than Laughlin's Swimming Made Easy. If, however, you want to read on all four strokes, then by all means, get Swimming Made Easy. If it's just freestyle, get this book and the Freestyle Made Easy video.
<br />
<br />If the video and book were bundled together, this would have gotten 5 stars. As it is, with the lack of pictures of the book alone: 4 stars. I really wanted to give it 5 stars because it has improved my swimming and the content is great, but a book that teaches technique should have more pictures.</span>
