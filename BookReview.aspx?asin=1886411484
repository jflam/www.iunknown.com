                    <span>I use this book all the time at work where we are<BR>using Linux more and more. This was first just for<BR>Systems but now I am using Linux for my own productivity,<BR>writing reports and printing. I love the power of the<BR>commands and it's all in this book! I do take exception<BR>to the reader below who wanted to change case of file<BR>names "manually" - this person should reread the book's<BR>intro as all Open Source software is out on the Internet<BR>made by different people, this is what makes it so powerful.<BR>But that is the joy of this book. It's format and coverage<BR>makes it fill a gap that has been sorely needed in the<BR>Open Source / Free Software community.</span>

                    <span>This book offers an extremist view of Linux. <BR>It shows you how to do your everyday computer <BR>work using ONLY open source software - many<BR>Linux books take a much less "pure" view of <BR>the system. But that's not all. It can also <BR>claim what others can't. The dirty little <BR>secret of Linux books is most authors use M$ <BR>to write and publish them! But Stutz is a <BR>GNU/Linux fanatic, and he wrote and produced <BR>the whole thing with ONLY Open Source software! <BR>This in effect means that the book itself is <BR>an example of the kind of things you can do <BR>with Linux. And if that wasn't enough this book <BR>is also Open Source! If he is right that the <BR>Open Source movement is about to transform book<BR>publishing like it transformed software, then <BR>this book is a glimpse at the future.<P>And by the way, Linux Cookbook is packed with <BR>lots great tips! It is a thorough guide for <BR>learning how to use any Linux system, regardless <BR>of your distro or hardware. It is refreshing to <BR>see such an extreme view brought to the everyday <BR>user. Dare I suggest that it may one day be<BR>regarded as a "classic for the masses".</span>

                    <span>I had been using Linux for around two years when I came across this book. I was surprised there was so much more to know about Linux. After casually glancing through its pages I realised this was a treasure chest.<P>If you are the shell user type, you will definitely enjoy this book. If you are GUI user, you will start appreciating the shell.There are easier ways to do what you have been doing and this book will show you how to do those things.</span>

                    <span>Target Audience<BR>Command line Linux users who want practical examples of how to do things.<P>Contents<BR>This is a detailed book on how to accomplish a number of tasks using the command line interface of a Debian Linux distribution.<P>The book is divided into seven parts and the following chapters: <P>Part 1 - Working With Linux - Introduction; What Every Linux User Knows; The Shell; The X Window System<BR>Part 2 - Files - Files and Directories; Sharing Files; Finding Files; Managing Files<BR>Part 3 - Text - Viewing Text; Text Editing; Grammar and Reference; Analyzing Text; Formatting Text; Searching Text; Typesetting and Word Processing; Fonts<BR>Part 4 - Images - Viewing Images; Editing Images; Importing Images; PostScript<BR>Part 5 - Sound - Sound Files; Audio Compact Discs; Editing Sound Files<BR>Part 6 - Productivity - Disk Storage; Printing; Cross-Platform Conversions; Reminders; Mathematics<BR>Part 7 - Networking - Communications; Email; The World Wide Web; Other Internet Services; <P>Appendices - Administrative Issues; Linux Resources on the Web; License<P>Review<BR>The true Unix geek and guru seems to be addicted to the command line interface of their system. Why use a mouse and a graphical interface if you can do it all via the keyboard and arcane system commands? If that appeals to you and describes your world, then this book will appeal to you. <P>Now, before I say anything else, there's one thing that the reader should know. This book was written in 2001, and I'll assume that the richness of the desktop graphical interfaces was not available back then. The book seems to be written from the assumption that the command line is the only game in town. The author makes a statement in the opening where he says this book will show "everyday users - artists, designers, businessmen, scholars, or scientists" how to use the tools and applications. I'm here to tell you... the average "user" he targets isn't in this group. You show me a typical accounting supervisor who will use a command line interface, and I'll admit I'm in error. But it isn't going to happen...<P>The book is written in "recipe" format. Each example is numbered, and any other special handling instructions are included up front (like additional packages to download). The command syntax is listed along with a "to get this type of result, do this:" list of command parameters. If you are interested in trying to accomplish a task as part of a shell script or to avoid using an interface with unnecessary features, this format will help you zero in on the specific information you're after.<P>Another thing to keep in mind is that the author is targeting the Debian Linux distribution. You may find a few variations you'll need to accommodate if you are running something different, but overall you should find value regardless of what Linux distribution you are running. It's all solid information if this is the type of Linux work you are doing.<P>Conclusion<BR>A good title for Linux geeks or wanna-be geeks who want to learn how to use the command line interface to accomplish tasks. Definitely not a title for typical desktop users of Linux.</span>

                    <span>* * * * *<P>This book may have had Debian as its base, but, this book can easily be used with any distribution. I have been using Linux for six years now, and I was able to learn commands that I didn't know even existed. Don't pay any attention to those who will give this book only three stars simply because they didn't read the books discription and bought the wrong book. This one is a real winner. I antipipate that this book will be in my library for some time to come because most of the books contents go over stuff that will most likely not change very much over time.<P>* * * * *</span>
