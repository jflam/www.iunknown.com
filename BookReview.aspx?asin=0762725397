                    <span>In preparation for a family vacation in Yellowstone I sampled 4 different hiking books, and this was by far the best. It had the best descriptions, maps, photos, and readability. I liked the way the author categorizes hikes by special interest: fishing, wildlife viewing, etc. It also provides good information on backcountry campsites if you're looking to backpack. There is no index, which is annoying, but otherwise it's a key buy.</span>

                    <span>My spouse and I were planning to go backpacking in Yellowstone during our crosscountry trip two summers ago. We bought this book because it had very nice descriptions of all the trails and amenities. When we started reading it though, it indicated that the summer was the worst time to go. It said that the traffic and tourists were almost as thick as the mosquitoes. Therefore, we decided not to go, and we have never used the book for the purpose it was meant for. It was well worth the money, though, because it saved us from making a big mistake.</span>

                    <span>We used this book for a two week stay in Yellowstone. The ratings for hills and difficulty of the hikes are accurate and helpful when selecting hikes. The trail descriptions also help when picking a hike depending on effort, scenery, wildlife, amount of other hikers, etc. We saw parts of Yellowstone only a tiny percentage of visitors get to see, thanks in part to this book. Be sure and check at the ranger stations for bear and other wildlife activity prior to beginning a hike.</span>

                    <span>When I first came to Yellowstone to work in the summer of 1998, I was a little overwhelmed by the number of trails in the park. I had never been hiking before, either. Thanks to this book, I had a wonderful summer of hiking, and I now have a new hobby. The book has hikes for nearly every mile of trail in the park. The hikes are listed by trip, not by trail, so you have several options on each stretch of trail. For each hike, there is a handy elevation profile, list of key points and mileages, suggested itinerary, hike options, and a detailed description of the hike itself. There are also many nice photographs. I highly recommend this book for beginners or old backpacking pros. It has hikes for everyone.</span>
