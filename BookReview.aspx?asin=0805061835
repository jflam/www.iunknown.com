                <span id="Label1">Featuring a new preface by the author on how parents can make a difference.<br><br>With author appearances on Good Morning America, The Today Show, 20 /20 and NPR's Fresh Air, and featuring articles in Newsweek, Time, and The New York Times, Real Boys is one of the most talked-about and influential books published this year.<br><br>Based on William Pollack's groundbreaking research at Harvard Medical School over two decades, Real Boys explores why many boys are sad, lonely, and confused although they may appear tough, cheerful, and confident. Pollack challenges conventional expectations about manhood and masculinity that encourage parents to treat boys as little men, raising them through a toughening process that drives their true emotions underground. Only when we understand what boys are really like, says Pollack, can we help them develop more self-confidence and the emotional savvy they need to deal with issues such as depression, love and sexuality, drugs and alcohol, divorce, and violence.<br></span>

                    <span>While there are kernels of truth in this book -- boys relative to girls are doing worse in school, the path to manhood is more perilous than the path to womanhood -- the underlying premise is pure bunk,and merely reflects today's cultural hatred of all things male. Who says men have historically been without feeling or vulnerablility and ability to express their feelings? This is nonsense. You would have to live in an utter vacuum without any awareness of history or literature or art or religion or anything to believe that the ideal of manhood implies lack of emotion or lack of caring or sensitivity. Yes some men have been hardened and some men and women have used shame to raise children - but this reflects the fallibility of human nature not some historical failure of the culture to understand what men are or should be. The book's premises are questionable in several salient respects. It suggests that boys need to express their feelings more and then indicates that boys typically express their feelings through action not talk. It equates enforcing behavior codes with shaming and rejection. It suggests the answer to the problem is to give even greater authority to public institutions to raise our children by assigning one-on-one mentors to each child in the public schools. As if the public schools weren't already trying to do more than they are capable of or even should be attempting. The author derides traditional notions of masculinity and then emphasizes the importance of sports to healthy development of masculine identity. Come on folks. Boys are in trouble today because our institutions and the cultural elite despise maleness and are hostile to all things male. Boys are being asked to conform to unrealistic expectations, and they are in frightening numbers being asked to do it without fathers.</span>

                    <span>Real Boys by William Pollack, Ph.D. is a definite resource for any educator or parent. Although the content of the book does not seem to present "new" evidence or findings, the material forces the reader to become more aware of the moral and emotional development of boys in constant struggle with the Boy Code and our adult reactions to this struggle. The case histories offered in this book are concrete examples of a variety of developmental issues, such as sensitivity, separation, relationships, adolescent sexuality and expressions of love and anger. Even if these individual cases had been fictitious, the description of the difficulties experienced by the characters and the solutions suggested were food for thought. Only one example of these readings would be the connection referred to in the section on the generative father. The reference to the Biblical characters of Abraham and Isaac is used in this book as an example of the care for the next generation. This section on the father-son relationship took on a whole new perspective after I read that reference. Real Boys refers to the protection of the father for his son. If one continues with this thought, the occasion of the exchange was during the binding of Isaac as a sacrifice. Abraham says, "I am here, my son." Any book, in this case Real Boys, that inspires the reader to continue contemplating and searching beyond the written word, is worthwhile to read. This connection of our modern problems to an ancient relationship is only a hint of the interesting connections in Real Boys. Through the use of specific case histories and the general information such as the delineation of myths and truths, views on man's work, sports, peer pressure and what parents, families and educators can do, Real Boys contained theory and practice in one easy to read book. The section on depression describes particular instances and assists the reader in recognizing the telltale signs of depression. One can refer back to any of the sections in this book, as the situations arise. From the preliminary stages of repressed expression to the extreme of violence and suicide, the reader can take whatever tidbit might be helpful from this useful information. These sections are written with the straightforward language of any lay person, while noting the appropriate time to seek a referral for a professional.<P>Many resource books regarding development are either theory or practice using excessive technical jargon or superficial examples. Real Boys presents some obvious observations regarding the emotional and moral development of boys and other insights which may not be as overtly expressed. The Boy Code referred to several times in this book is not a unique concept and one that most individuals, if asked, would agree exists. The utility of such a realization, that such a "standard" exists, is similar to the awareness of the usage of "wait time" in the classroom. Most educators, without realizing, wait seconds for a student's response to a question. By identifying "wait time" and including this area in the evaluation of a teacher, the teacher becomes more conscious of this tendency and more conscientious in waiting a few more "seconds" for a response. "Wait time" still exists, as does the Boy Code, but the adult's reaction may become more patient, sensitive and effective. Real Boys conveys the message that our responses to such a code can make the difference in the appropriate cessation of certain expectations from boys which may not be realistic, reasonable or healthy and the perpetuation of the expectations which encourage healthy emotional and sensitive moral growth for any child. Discussion and practical attention to these issues may result in the increased awareness of how we treat each other and a decrease in the behavior that negatively reinforces their perpetuation, particularly in our schools.</span>

                    <span>Real Boys is a pivotal book that explains in great detail how to shatter the myths with which most boys are raised in our society, which prevent them to be allowed to be who they are. Their roles have been stereotyped, and have resulted in deep pain. Many fathers do not understand the bond that their sons need with their mothers, as well as any boy's need to share feelings, even if that means to cry. <BR>Dr. Pollack's book brings tremendously valuable insight for parents who have sons, and how to spare them from guilt, shame, and to embrace their authentic selves in order to thrive, as opposed to devalue themselves. <BR>If you are raising a son, I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. It also addresses teen suicide, and the signs of depression to look out for in order to prevent this from happening to your son. <BR>Highly recommended for the tremendous insight it brings in order for boys to be REAL, and thrive. <BR>From my heart, Barbara Rose, author of 'If God Was Like Man' and 'Individual Power: Reclaiming Your Core, Your Truth, and Your Life.'</span>

                    <span>This was a book I was assigned to read for a graduate level diversity class. In a group consistng of myself and three women, our opinions on specific topics in the book varied. However, we all felt that the author was telling us that we need to coddle our boys.<BR>In "Teachers as Cultural Workers"(1998), Paulo Freire discusses the differences between authoritative, authoritarian, and passive teaching, with the passive approach caused by parents and teachers "coddling" the child. Boys do need to be expressive, but not to the extent that Pollack would have.<BR>The other issue I have with the book is his noted studies. Not only is the reader left not knowing which study belongs to which statement, but also some of the studies are extremely outdated. For example, Pollack notes results of a study linking gay boys to being hereditary through a report from 1953! ...</span>

You don't know when you are going to offend someone-you always have to be watching yourself." pg. 151<BR> "Sixteen-year-old ROSS relates it this way: "Being a guy today, wow.
