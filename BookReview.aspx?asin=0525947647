                <span id="Label1">Having previously dissected the factual inaccuracies of a single bellicose talk show host in  <I>Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot</I>, Al Franken takes his fight to a larger foe: President George W. Bush, the Bush Administration, Ann Coulter, Bill O&#146;Reilly, and scores of other conservatives whom, he says, are playing loose with the facts. It's a lot of ground to cover, as evidenced by the 43 chapters in <I>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</I>, but the results are often entertaining and insightful. Franken occupies a unique place in the modern political dialogue as perhaps the media's only comedy writer and performer who is also a Harvard fellow as well as a liberal political commentator. This unique and vaguely lonely position lends a charming quixotic quality to adventures such as a tense encounter with the Fox News staff at the National Press Club, a challenge to fisticuffs with National Review Editor Rich Lowry, and an oddly sweet admissions visit to ultra-conservative Bob Jones University (with a young research assistant posing as his son when Franken's real-life son refuses to participate in the charade). Less useful are comic book dramatizations of "Supply Side Jesus" and a fictitious Vietnam War story featuring the numerous righties who, Franken intimates, improperly avoided service. And Franken's criticisms of conservative talk show hosts Sean Hannity, O&#146;Reilly, and columnist Coulter, while admirable in their attention to detail, fail to shed much new light on people who have built careers on broad arguments and relentless self-aggrandizement. But Franken is at his best, and most compellingly readable, when he backs off the wackiness and the personal grudges and writes about more personal matters such as the political circus surrounding the memorial service of the late Senator Paul Wellstone. But even on these more serious topics, Franken's wit is still present and, in fact, grows sharper. In a time when much political discourse is composed of rage and shouting, it's refreshing that Al Franken is able to shout in a witty manner. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I LOVED this book. It's a fast read with awesome facts no matter what neo-cons may say. I really couldn't put this book down, turning down an indie concert to stay home and read it. It's the best political book that I've read in quite some time because Franken is a genius, hilarious and well informed & researched. It should be required reading for everyone that votes and speaks their minds politically. </span>

                    <span>Al Franken shows the lies that neo conservative tries to feed the public as true. His portrayal of the Sean Hannity is right on the mark. He is a rude ken doll that often lies and Colmes is his "liberal" side kick that says one liners and adds nothing to the show other then being the token liberal. I am a libertarian and I agree that neo conservatives like Hannity give conservatives a bad name. I love the chapter on the neo conservative Jesus. That is a hoot.  Like the messed up sermon on the mound, where the neo con Jesus claims that It is easier for the ricj man to come to heaven, then the poor man. This is a sham since Jesus stood up for the poor and the hated. I am old school conservative which means that I believe in small government, personal freedom and social responsibility. It does not mean greed, self importance and pride which seems to be the hallmark of the conservative ideas and ideals presented by people like Limbaugh and Hannity. I think that Franken is a very smart and astute thinker and even though he is a liberal, yes he too loves America.</span>

                    <span>I was amazed that anyone could fit so much garbage in a book this size.
<br />Franken who is a has been (who never really was) gets all his facts wrong. While this in itself is not surprising since its almost expected these days from franken, there is nothing even funny about the book or the Author.
<br />Its just misinformed, and poorly researched Faction.
<br />I did find a use for the book though in my bathroom, though the paper on a roll is cheaper.

                    <span>Al Franken's book left me very confused, mainly because there is so much lying on both the left and the right that I don't know if his book is just another long rant claiming to be the truth and supported by supposedly meticulous research or if it's actually the truth. To start with, this book is very funny, provided you're a liberal. I am a very left-wing liberal who read this book largely to avoid having a nervous breakdown over the disastrous direction I feel this country is taking. I left it feeling slightly unsatisfied, because while I loved the hilarious lampooning of reckless conservatism and its public figures, I also knew that Franken had only given one side of the story and had done only a mediocre job disguising what he was doing. I can't force myself to read the garbage that Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity put out because I think I would be so enraged and offended by their views that I couldn't get past page 2, but I wish someone would write an actually balanced book, which is extremely difficult in this day and age because our government is doing such a great job of polarizing the nation with its "for us or against us" mentality. Franken's book just adds to the problem. Although he spends about half the book bragging how good his research and fact-checking are, which gets beyond boring, he's so obviously far-left as to raise inevitable suspicions. I thought his ruse about pretending to be interested in Bob Jones University was inappropriate. I also think that if he was intending to convert conservatives to his way of thinking with his book, he will fail. The book is too inflammatory to reach out to anyone, largely because of the overuse of expletives attached to conservative figures. I despise Karl Rove just as he does, but his book really preaches to the choir. However, it was extremely entertaining to read and I enjoyed the experience, although the whole thing is slightly overdone. </span>
