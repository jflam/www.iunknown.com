                    <span>I have read Maxwell and a host of other leadership books, but there is a world of difference between a consultant or a middle-manager telling you about leadership...and the winningest coach in college football telling you about leadership!<P>The thing I liked the most is that rather than vague affirmations or ambiguous principles, Bowden gives us SPECIFIC, hard-won advice regarding handling staff, planning for success, etc. <P>The fact that he has done so remarkably well--with his job "on the line" based on each season's performance, not to mention every time he plays a strong rival--Bowden gives us a CEO/Chairman of the Board-level view of how to handle matters.<P>I bought it because I am an FSU fan. I kept it because it was the best book on leadership I had ever read.</span>

You don't have to be a Florida State or even a football fan, this book goes so far beyond any sport. This book basically tells you how too live a better life, and Bobby Bowden obviously has a awesome one.</span>

                    <span>In The Bowden Way, Steve and Bobby Bowden combine to bring the reader practical, common sense approaches to issues every one of us face on a daily basis. Moreover, the content keeps you interested, is easy to follow, and is very linear in moving along from one topic to the next. Of course, with Bobby Bowden, there's always a bit of that geniune humor we've all come to expect. I would strongly recommend this book for any and all ages, football fan or not. It's a refreshing read.</span>

                    <span>Wow- where to start. As a high-school football coach and student of motivation I have read every book written by a successful coach of any sport. All have been helpful, but this book is by far the best advice I have ever read on coaching and leading an organization. Bowden writes simple statements that at first glance seem somewhat to simplistic. However, the simplicity is the genuis of the man. The advice is short, specfic, and it works. I did not read one story or find an example as being a "coaching embellishment" all of the examples the man provides are real-life situations and the honest apprasial of the situation is a treat. As a coach I have a found a simple but powerful way to build a football program, as a leader and a person I have found a way to live a life with simple workable ideas and practices. Bowden's chapters on staff morale and staff meetings are pure gold to football coaches. Every coach should own this book and every person should read it. I was not a huge Bobby Bowden fan before, but I am now. He has written an honest book, that will make a huge difference for whomever reads it.</span>
