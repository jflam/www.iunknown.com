                    <span>I'm not going to waste a lot of time describing _Fahrenheit 451_.  There's over 1,000 reviews on Amazon alone.  I'm sure most people know that it tells of a dystopian future in which books have been banned, and how firemen are employed to start fires instead of fighting them.  Even some of those who have not read the book have at least that superficial idea.  
<br />
<br />What makes _Fahrenheit 451_ so nightmarish is how this society came to be.  This was not the result of a totalitarian dictator or government, it was the will of the people.  Somewhere along the way, people tired of being challenged, both intellectually and morally, by books.  Bland, inoffensive, and mind-numbing  forms of recreation dominated the cultural landscape.  Commentators on the ailments of the human condition became enemies of the state, while the true disease itself went unchecked.  There are quite a few out there who think something like this can't happen in these "enlightened" times.
<br />
<br />It's already happening.  The cirriculum throughout the American school system is being dumbed down far below the capabilities of the average student.  Public libraries are being underfunded, and in many cases, closed down completely.  Authors and intellectuals are given far less reverence than celebrities who hold on to their fame through idiotic publicity stunts rather than through talent and hard work. 
<br />
<br />So, I might not have told you anything you don't know already.   I won't be offended if you choose to brush off everything I mentioned previous  to the point I'm about to make.  Read _Fahrenheit 451_.  Take a good look at the cultural and intellectual climate of society today.  Ask yourself if this is what you want our future to be.  
<br />
<br />Me neither.

                    <span>People say this book is no good just because it's too "confusing."  Well, just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean that the book is bad.  Dumbing down ideas doesn't make a book better.  I understood this book quite well.  I also love this Mr. Bradbury's imagination.  If you liked this book, you should also read Dandolion Wine, another book by this great author.  If you don't like this book because it's too confusing, just don't read it.  It is a great book and seeing all those "1 star" reviews for being confusing is a real pitty.</span>

                    <span>...Very few people see the obvious in this masterful work by Mr. Bradbury...It's not only a political commentary against anti-intellectualism ( President Bush...are you paying attention?!)...But this work is also a clever love story...There are enough admirers of Bradbury's work reading here that may have noted the old triangle Bradbury throws out about middle aged Guy Montague's married wanderlust with a much younger, teenaged girl...The old master doesn't carry this down the regular Valentine road though...He couches Montague's fondness and interest in the fetching young Clarisse around the subject and "love" of books...It is easy to see the sexual connection Bradbury draws via vivid descriptions on the smell and feel of books...Indeed, Bradbury makes the choice the characters in this most novel of novels must make between the constrained fidelity of 457's society of anti-intellectual constraints versus the uninhibited option of free love in not only one's thinking but in the individual's life and love as a decision a person must make with every bit of fervor and "love" that they have...Mr. Bradbury makes his choice for the latter in a most convincing, romantic, and egalitarian manner...His spectacular if somewhat cliche ending lets the reader know in no uncertain terms that Bradbury wishes the reader to make and promote the books point of being for knowledge or against it as the crucible of what to take away from this splendid tale...Enough so, that one may indeed wonder what beautiful depths and dimensions Bradbury might have added to this work by giving the character Clarisse more of a voice and part in the book...Certainly, the further fleshing out of the romantic attraction between Montague and Clarisse this reviewer doesn't believe would have detracted from the work, far from it, perhaps it would have added a dimension to the story that seems waiting to be told...Reading any of Bradbury's gorgeous work..."The Illustrated Man", "The Martian Chronicles", "Dandelion Wine", or any of his many short story compilations are absolute rapture for the true bibliophile...Sitting down with Bradbury is like being able to dream while you read...Both are things we don't have enough of in today's "Bush-whacked" culture...Pick up this one today and send a message to the Nascar set!...</span>

                    <span>For my book project in school, I chose to Fahrenheit 451; I was quite impressed by his writing in The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chrnicles. 
<br />
<br />I simply loved the novel. Its theme of censorship and knowledge vs. ignorance reminded to be aware of the future. 
<br />
<br />Since almost everyone has explained the plot of this book, I won't bother to do this. </span>
