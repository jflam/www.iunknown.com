                    <span>I found the book to be concise, with excellent examples and exercises that stretched my thinking. After being in business for 15 years, there were still excellent ideas on employee motivation, and niche marketing. <P>A worthwhile book, and one I refer to often.</span>

                    <span>After owning a jewelry store for 20 years with 16 employees I had a consulting company come into my store. 30% of what they did is exactly what this book shows you what to do. <P>I have since sold my store and am a consultant in the jewelry industry helping people run a better buisness. I MAKE the stores I visit get two books:<P>How to make a business run without you by Susan Carter and<BR>The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber.<P>Both books are about why small businesses fail and what to do about it. The E-Myth is the phsychology of how to run a business so it runs without you but Susan Carters book is a step by stpe on how to actually do it.<P>In a snapshot, it's this: If you can't leave your business because you're "the only one who can do it", think again. Take bank depsoits. Write down exactly how to make the depsoit, where to get the forms, which bank to take it to, where to enter the data.<P>If you did this on your job, coulsn't soemone else take over?<P>After doing this, for the last few years of owning my store, I didn't have a job. The employees ran the store.<P>The best part of this book is the center section, Susan lays out exactly what each chapter of your store operations manual should look like.<P>Did you know that MOSt McDonals franchises do 100% of their potential after only being open 30 days? Why? because of the operations manual for that franchise.<P>$[money] for a lifetime of knowledge? Worth it? Buy it and let it sit on a shelf and it's worthless.<P>Buy it and use it and you get ONLY 5 hours more with your family per week (that's 250 hours per year), is that worth $[money]?<P>i think so. For me I sold my store and am doing what I love, helping others have their store run without them...</span>

                    <span>The first half of this book is totally worthless and the "doggy shop" analogies are condescending and "stupid." The second half as some useful outlines to writing a business operation manual...this book is DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. It is only about 130, paperback. I was expecting a textbook FULL of "how to" suggestions. Save your money for something else.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for any business owner. Why pay big consultant fees when you can walk through the process as described in this book. This is truly the best How To book I have ever seen. And the author writes in such a way, it is as though you are conversing as she teaches you how to run your business instead of letting it run you. I'm in my third year of business and I owe a great deal of credit to Carter. It's like having my own personal consultant. Kudos! Five stars!</span>
