                    <span>I won't include a bunch of examples, as other reviewers already have....  But I will say that I LOVE this book!  It's so fun to read.  I suggest you read it with another smarty sitting nearby so you can share your glee with someone else -- some of the phrases simply MUST be shared!  Also, I recommend this book as a cure for writer's block.  These lovely nuggets give you a lot of food for thought and inspiration to be just as clever.
<br />
<br />You'll be glad to have this precious collection in your library!</span>

                    <span>Dr. Grothe's "Oxymoronica" left me chuckling and amused on more than one occasion.  Although this book is -- as another reviewer indicated -- a mere collection of quotes, the presentation and commentary provided by Dr. Grothe makes it so much more than a simple book of not-so-simple quotes.  If you buy this book, be prepared to mark it up because you'll find yourself repeatedly reminding yourself, "I've got to remember that quote".  A stellar read that should be enjoyed, savored, and referred to frequently!! </span>

<br />I am sure if someone had told me before I read this book that it was an easy-to-read, entertaining, and informative combination of a simple quote book, many cultural and historical references, and a scholarly and literary analysis of paradoxes and oxymorons, I would not have bought it.  Well, I sure am glad nobody told me exactly what the book was about because I not only bought it and read it, I thought it was an outstanding book.  
<br />
<br />"Oxymoronica," a new term introduced by Dr. Mardy Grothe and the title of this book, was defined inside the front cover as "any variety of tantalizing, self-contradictory statements or observations that on the surface appear false or illogical, but at a deeper level are true, often profoundly true."  
<br />
<br />In keeping with that definition, the book contained over 1,400 oxymoronic and paradoxical quotations from ancient times to today, organized into fourteen categories, most of which you would expect to find in any standard book of quotations (i.e. advice; insults; politics; sex, love, and romance; marriage, home, and family life).  Complementing the wit and wisdom of the quotations was Grothe's historical and cultural research and his ability to present and put into a logical, often humorous, context the quotations so that I could reflect on and appreciate their profound meanings.  You can open the book at random or read it sequentially and get the same pleasant experience both ways.
<br />
<br />I had many profoundly personal moments of reflection on people and events in my life throughout the pages of this book:
<br />
<br />"Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's own ignorance."  Confucius
<br />
<br />"You can't make anything idiot-proof because idiots are so ingenious."             Ron Burns
<br />
<br />"The child is father of the man."  William Wordsworth
<br />
<br />"When you add to the truth, you subtract from it."  From the Talmud
<br />
<br />"He had nothing to say and he said it."  Ambrose Bierce, on a contemporary
<br />
<br />"I learned an awful lot from him by doing the opposite."                               Howard Hawkes, on Cecil B. DeMille
<br />
<br />"Most people when they come to you for advice come to have their own opinions strengthened, not corrected."  Josh Billings
<br />
<br />"Vision is the art of seeing things invisible."  Jonathon Swift
<br />
<br />"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."       George Orwell, in "Animal Farm"

                    <span>"Oxymoron" is Greek for "Sharp-Dull," (e.g. "long brief" and "jumbo shrimp"), and this little book delivers a treasure trove of paradoxical sayings in which unintentional wit takes the form of intentional witlessness (Yogi Berra -- "I didn't say everything I said") and intentional witlessness masquerades as unintentional wit ("Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist needs his head examined").  This book is a painfully delightful exploration of skewed syntax and perverse proverbs.</span>

                    <span>The book contains a wide selection of paradoxical expressions arranged in 14 different sections from sex, love and romance, to politics, insults, insights from world literature, etc.
<br />
<br />Here are few examples:
<br />
<br />The lage F.W.H. Myers used to tell how he asked a man at a dinner table what he thought would happen to him when he died.
<br />The man tried to ignore the question, but, on being pressured, replied:
<br />
<br />"Oh well, I suppose I shall inherit eternal bliss,
<br />but I wish you wouldn't talk abut such unpleasant subjects."
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />Last month I blew $5,000 on a reincarnation seminar.
<br />I figured, hey, you only live once.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />We sleep in separate rooms, we have dinner apart, 
<br />we take separate vacatins.
<br />We're doing everything we can to keep our marriage together.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />Beware!  To touch these wires is instant death.
<br />Anyone found doing so will be prosecuted.
