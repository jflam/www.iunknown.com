                    <span>My fiance got this cookbook for Christmas, and has already made four recipes from it - all of which turned out perfectly! He's generally one to "test" new recipes on me before making them for friends, but these were all spectacular on the first try. Especially wonderful so far has been the risotto with butternut squash and the ravioli stuffing with butternut squash and mascarpone cheese. Absolutely amazing. When you can make cooking fun, it's definitely a triumph - and Rogers & Gray have completely succeeded in that respect. BENE!!</span>

                    <span>My boyfriend and I are good cooks and food mavens who nonetheless don't cook a lot. We know from great food and the recipes in this book are superb. In no other book have I ever found recipes which consistently yielded such high--i.e., restaurant-quality--results. Another great thing is the fact that many of these recipes don't require a lot of expensive/hard-to-find ingredients. We cooked out of this cookbook and its sequel, these two books alone, for a year and a half. Then we visited the restaurant in London, which is sublime--but that is another story.</span>

                    <span>Have a problem preparing a "whole fish", but otherwise have not found a better guide to exquisite preparation of whatever fish (absolutely fresh) may be available. Contrary to popular thought - the English (Rose and Ruth) can cook!</span>
