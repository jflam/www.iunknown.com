                    <span>For years, from April through October, I always have my old dog-eared copy handy. Baseball is all about the little details, and there are so many of them that, no matter how big a fan of the game you are, you can always get stumped. This Dickson Dictionary goes much further than just defining terms...it gives examples, cites history, and provides some truly wonderful photos. The last time I referred to it, I was trying to learn the finer points of the infield fly rule. Usually, though, I use it to identify which is the slider, which is the breaking ball, which is the sinker, etc. This book is exhaustive. Living in L.A., I've got Dickson as my baseball reference and Vin Scully as my baseball poet. I'd say all the bases are covered. Now if we can only get those Dodgers to make the playoffs...</span>

                    <span>This baseball dictionary is clear, concise and helpful, particularly for people like me. I love baseball, but when I was growing up, girls weren't raised on sports, so I became a fan with sketchy knowledge of the rules and nuances of the game. Since I bought this book, I've learned a lot about pitching maneuvers, stats, history of the sport, slang terms and dozens of other things that make baseball more and more interesting to watch. I'm very glad I own it.</span>
