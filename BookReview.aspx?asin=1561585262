                    <span>This book's title is absolutely accurate. It is chock full of ideas, both in the text and the pictures, for innovative storage all over the house. Another important thing to me is that the writers of this book realize that it is often the details, such as the height of a bench or the placement of a drawer, that can make or break a storage solution. They encourage the homeowner throughout the book to choose the solutions and dimensions that fit their house and their lifestyle. Function is the No. 1 priority, but form is not shortchanged at all, as the photos prove.<p>While some of it does not apply to my situation, I found that there were at least a few areas -- most notably the mud room and why it's such a great idea -- that were beneficial to me. I had already thought a lot about storage in the house I will be building, so it probably was not as helpful to me overall as it would be for someone who is either starting to think about this subject, or who has an existing house with storage problems. That being said, the photos and the writing are both high quality, and no basic room in the house is left uncovered, so this book is definitely a 5-star.<p>If you own Taunton's other books, you may recognize a few of the photos from them. However, most of them are not duplicates of the other two Tauntons that I have, and even the ones that are the same are covered completely differently.<p>I have only one complaint with this book: There is no index in the back. There is a page of resources, which provides some books and some Web sites, and a long list of photographer credits, but I would like to have seen some sort of an index of keywords or specific storage ideas. In spite of this shortcoming, the book is so logically put together that it still deserves all five stars.</span>

                    <span>Joanne Bouknight's Home Storage Idea book is a wonderful book.  I have discovered so many great ways to solve all the storage problems we had in our home.  My carpenter loves all the ideas we are having him add to our home.  Some of my favorite ideas are the Bedside Storage on page 157,the Graduated depth bookshelf on page 139,stair-landing entertainment center on page 121,stair tread and bench room on page 27 and finally the space between the studs bookshelf nook for small objects on page 114. <br>My friends can't wait to add a few storage ideas to their homes as well.  The best part of the book are the great pictures and way Bouknight writes.  Her style is so readable, just as if she's talking to me in person.  Great Job Taunton Press!</span>

                    <span>This book is very helpful, as it covers all parts of a house. There are some gorgeous and fancy houses here, but also many that are down to earth. You would laugh at all the post-it notes stuck on the book!! There's quite a bit here on kitchen storage, actually, and I like the parts on built in cabinets. Now I'm ready to make it happen in my own house!</span>

                    <span>I agree that the book shows a wide variety of storage options available, which is what saves this book from 1 star.  However, it only shows one style of interior decoration, and an outdated one at that.  Most of the pictures are just so-so.  <p>Recommendation:  Choose a different book.<p>Better Source:<br>I think Simple Solutions Storage Space by Cahill is a good book.  It shows a wider variety of design styles, and they are ones that are more likely to stand the test of time.  Plus, it also shows a wide variety of storage options in a wide variety of rooms.</span>
