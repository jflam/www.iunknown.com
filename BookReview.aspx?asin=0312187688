We had always valued the history, the world of ideas contained between the covers of a book or, as in the case of <i>The Night Visitor, </i>some special personal significance. Now, for the first time, we began to appreciate that there was a history and a world of ideas embodied by the books themselves.<br></span>

                    <span>Yes, the "booklover from Chicago, IL" (see my April "98 review of this book) is back, and I have read this book an incredible 6 times - man I need a life:) But seriously, I've given it out as a gift several times in an attempt to get more people into book collecting because I strongly feel that this book is capable of generating a true love for books! It's sequel, SLIGHTLY CHIPPED, is charming too, but the sequel is never quite as good as the original - is it? A trilogy, however, is another matter, and I'm eagerly awaiting, the rumored third book in this series, BOXED SET, but I have no idea when it is due out. If the Goldstones, see this review, I hope that they may decide to enlighten their devoted readers with a crumb of information, and maybe even give us a web page of their own! Well, until the 3rd book is released, or I read this one 3 more times, this is me signing off! p.s. - buy this book !</span>

                    <span>This is a fun and charming narrative for those new to collecting books on the ways of the antiquarian trade -- from how books are found to how a book jacket or a quirk of printing can make an ordinary book quite rare and valuable. <P>If you love the printed word, though, find a copy of Noel Perrin's "A Reader's Delight." It won't tell you how to collect books, but Perrin's enthusiasm for his cherished favorites might very well make a collector out of you. THEN read this book to find out where to start. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed; the Goldstones' story is not about books but about collecting as a pursuit that lends cachet to the collectors. Here, used and rare editions are merely the items being collected; the Goldstones in fact could have chosen any upscale item (I can just hear them going on and on about botanical illustrations, for instance, talking about Redoute, adding a few wry anecdotes about being fooled by reproductions, and throwing in a timeline of the cultivation of the rose). <P>In this case, their self-deprecating wit masks not their newness to the used book trade but their actual ignorance of reading itself -- that compulsive consuming and cherishing of books. Consider the choice of books they want(the hoary usual suspects mingled with a few eccentricities to add flavor, and their many gaffes ("something called the Kelmscott Press" --a bit of self-deprecation more deprecating than they actually appreciated). <P>Nonetheless, the book is delightfully written and a quite informative story of one couple's introduction to this fascinating world.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book quite by accident and am delighted. If all accidents could be so delightful. A well-written, easy read that speaks volumes about books and the people who love them. If you have ever thought about purchasing that "special book", this is a must read. Thanks to this pleasant tome, I'm prepared to start my own personal collection. I only hope my adventures are as rewarding as those described by Nancy and Lawrence Goldstone.</span>

                    <span>This is a fun read by the Nick and Nora Charles of book collecting. This was their initial book on the subject, a labor of love, and their enthusiasm is contagious. Their books that follow are good, but not as good, because they are becoming pillars of the establishment rather than treasure hunters. There is less spark to their work now, less sense of discovery, more serious, less fun. <P>Fortunately, for fun I can always come back and read this one again, and John Baxter's marvelously bookish A POUND OF PAPER, and of course, Dashiell Hammett's original Nick and Nora Charles.</span>

                    <span>What a rich little book. It is such a fun read. It has revived my love of book shopping. My wife and I went out this past weekend to hunt for new finds. It is also a good reference. I will keep it handy in my book hunting. It is well worth the small price.</span>
