                    <span>This is a well organized, enjoyable look into this dynamic profession. Bender's work is professorial; young broadcasters would do well to pay attention to his sagacity. Although Bender provides ample warning of his bias toward exacting preparation, he might lose a little of the essence of sports broadcasting. In treating broadcasting as tantamount to a science, he leaves you without the reason why he does it (and why I do it and why we all do it) -- sports broadcasting is FUN. It is revitalizing. Bender at times treats it as something that requires such precision that it saps his energy. I will say, however, that stripping some of the luster away from this coveted and misunderstood profession is necessary. As mentioned in the Booklist review, he provides plenty of "look-what-you're-getting-into" advice. He's done a good job at that, along with providing clear and understandable advice for someone willing to follow in his shoes. Besides, nobody needs to be told how much fun it is. What we DO need to be told, Bender provides.</span>

                    <span>I am not a big reader of books. Often I will buy a book, set it downand not pick it up for weeks, or even months or years. However, this book I sat and read almost cover-to-cover. As a sportscaster myself, I found it entertaining, informative, and provides excellent direction and insight for younger men and women who are hoping to break into  this field. If you are planning or hoping to one day go into the  broadcasting industry, whether its in sports, news, or whatever, I  would say this is required reading!</span>
