                    <span>What a difference a year makes in digital photography! Or 5 years come to that. Having bought the book, 50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques, it was immediately clear that the techniques and tips were aimed at beginning photoshop workers. Nothing wrong with that. However, by today's standards, there are many more attractive books on the market that do the same thing so much better and with much better quality illustrations and colour photgraphs. I found the tips a bit 'old hat' and the illustrations very old hat, the sort of tips and techniques you could easily pick up in an hour's search on the net, AND with better colour examples.
<br />Still, to keep things in perspective, the book IS 5 years old and it shows.
<br />Buy it if you want a cheap second-hand book for your shelf. Otherwise, you can do much, much better with the scores of  other visually attractive beginner/intermediate books on today's market.</span>

                    <span>This new book has 50 entirely new techniques AND the CD includes all fifty of the techniques from the first edition for a total of 100 useful and fun techniques. 
<br />
<br />All other reviews (mostly 5-star reviews) that are posted here are for the first edition and most of those less than excellent reviews are by people who bought the first edition when it was three years old.

                    <span>Looking at the book's cover and at the now defunct editor's description, there was no indication this book was primarily aimed at - and indeed was written for - Photoshop Elements users. The copy said it was also for Photoshop users but it only covers through version 6 and the introduction says using applications other than Elements for the actions described may not work.
<br />
<br />I've not used Elements so I have no idea whether the book will be helpful there. It's certainly not helpful for me.
<br />
<br />I'm a professional using Photoshop CS and thought some of the tips might be worthwhile. I also use PaintShopPro 8. I thought some of this book might be worthwhile for me but I'm nothing but dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>This book concentrates on nothing at all that I could find. Information on lighting, color and composition, angle, equipment are just rushed through, and leaves you holding the bag, so to speak. All the information that you NEED to know is left out, where information that anyone who has used a camera for more than a month already should know, is covered throughout the entire book, chapter after chapter. Useless book, unless you are an ABSOLUTE BEGINNER and have never seen a digital camera operated before, buy something else. Oh, and the included software is only good when you uninstall it. 
<br /> 
<br /> I don't like getting ripped off, and after purchasing this book, I'll never buy anything who was associated with this obviously slapped together POS. And I don't think you can call "take the photos again if you don't like them" a technique. Which is mentioned in the book about 50 times... YIKES. </span>
