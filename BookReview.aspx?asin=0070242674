                    <span>Barbara Glantz has written a life altering book--at least a life at the workplace altering book. It is easy to read and filled with hundreds of big and little things that can change the way you spend 40 hours a week. Very positive, super ideas.</span>

                    <span>This book is just okay.  There are a lot of examples of how to improve morale at work, but the writing isn't that great, and the book isn't very well organized.  There are much better books on the topic...try Managing to Have Fun by Matt Weinstein or 1001 Ways to Energize Employees by Bob Nelson.</span>

                    <span>"Care Packages for the Workplace" is a fun, easy read that will change your attitude toward work and life. I can't recommend this book enough. It is filled with ways to make the workplace more humane on every  level. Read it today...you'll go to work tomorrow a different person.</span>

                    <span>This book was not at all what I expected.  As a member of middle management I was looking for suggestions on motivating employees on more of an individual basis.  Most of the ideas in this book I felt need to be  implemented by upper management throughout the entire organization.  As  supervisor of a small department, I do not have the resources or authority  to implement these types of changes. Also, most of the ideas would only  work in businesses with high customer contact.  For those of us that work  only within the organization, most of these ideas are not applicable.</span>
