                <span id="Label1">When he was but 10 years old, Tim Tyson heard one of his boyhood friends in Oxford, N.C. excitedly blurt the words that were to forever change his life: "Daddy and Roger and 'em shot 'em a <I>nigger</I>!" The cold-blooded street murder of young Henry Marrow by an ambitious, hot-tempered local businessman and his kin in the Spring of 1970 would quickly fan the long-flickering flames of racial discord in the proud, insular tobacco town into explosions of rage and street violence. It would also turn the white Tyson down a long, troubled reconciliation with his Southern roots that eventually led to a professorship in African-American studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison--and this profoundly moving, if deeply troubling personal meditation on the true costs of America's historical racial divide. Taking its title from a traditional African-American spiritual, Tyson skillfully interweaves insightful autobiography (his father was the town's anti-segregationist Methodist minister, and a man whose conscience and human decency greatly informs the son) with a painstakingly nuanced historical analysis that underscores how little really changed in the years and decades after the Civil Rights Act of 1965 supposedly ended racial segregation. The details are often chilling: Oxford simply closed its public recreation facilities rather than integrate them; Marrow's accused murderers were publicly condemned, yet acquitted; the very town's newspaper records of the events--and indeed the author's later account for his graduate thesis--mysteriously removed from local public records. But Tyson's own impassioned personal history lessons here won't be denied; they're painful, yet necessary reminders of a poisonous American racial legacy that's so often been casually rewritten--and too easily carried forward into yet another century by politicians eagerly employing the cynical, so-called "Southern Strategy." <I>--Jerry McCulley</I></span>

                    <span>If only all history could be told by the voices of those who lived it, maybe those voices could tell truth to power.  Except on sources like "Democracy Now", those authentic voices seem to be missing in the media's telling of the stories of today.  I think therefore this book is important for what it tells us about the history of race relations in this country but also for what it can tell us about our decisions and view of present reality. 
<br />
<br />I live in Madison, Wisconsin and this quote from "Blood done Sign My Name" is sometimes pretty applicable today in my town.  "Black Southerners forcibly altered that narrative in the 1950's and 1960's by stepping outside their assigned roles - and compelling a reluctant federal government to intercede on their behalf.  As often as not, they had to be prepared to defend themselves physically from terrorism by white reactionaries.  White liberals, with their hesitancy and quibbling, were sometimes very little help.  In North Carolina, white liberal paternalists did not stand in the schoolhouse door as George Wallace had in Alabama.  Instead, journalist Osha Gray Davidson observes,they 'would quietly appoint a committee to deliberate for eternity over exactly which door, and of what dimensions, would best facilitate the ingress and egress of all students.  The style of a Wallace was different, but the result was the same.'  And so sometimes it was necessary to escape from an endless and pointless conversation with white paternalism by striking hard and sometimes violently against the architecture of their oppression-Oxford's tobacco warehouses being only the local example."
<br />
<br />Timothy Tyson delves into his personal history with an open mind and eye to find the truth about his family and his town during a difficult time and era.  But he is also making the point that times are still difficult and the way to work on problems is to face them head on with a knowledge of what came before.
<br />
<br />"There it should stay, many people seem to think - why dredge this stuff up?  Why linger on the past, which we cannot change?  We must move toward a brighter future and leave all that horror behind.  It's true that we must make a new world.  But we can't make it out of whole cloth.  We have to weave the future from the fabric of the past, from the patterns of aspiration and belonging - broken dreams and anguished rejections - that have made us.  What the advocates of our dangerous and deepening social amnesia don't understand is how deeply the past holds the future in its grip - even, and perhaps especially, when it remains unacknowledged.  We are runaway slaves from our own past, and only by turning to face the hounds can we find our freedom beyond them."

                    <span>Author Timothy B. Tyson has carved out a rather unique role for himself.  Believe it or not, he is a white man from North Carolina teaching Black History in Wisconsin.  "Blood Done Sign My Name" is the compelling, personal and brutally honest story of how this all came to be.  
<br />Tyson was 10 years old back in 1970 and living with his family in the small rural town of Oxford, N.C.  His dad was the Methodist minister and his mom a schoolteacher in town.  One day in May, his 10 year old playmate Gerald Teel casually remarked that "Daddy and Roger and 'em shot 'em a nigger."  Indeed, his daddy and two of this brothers had brutally shot and killed a 23 year old black man, Henry Marrow, for very dubious reasons.  This single event would have profound implications for the little town of Oxford and would play a major role in shaping the life of one Tim Tyson.
<br />"Blood Done Sign My Name" is a remarkable book on many levels.  If you are interested in learning more about the arrest and subsequent trial of Robert Teel then you will certainly find it here. It is not a pretty story.  
<br />Likewise, if you would like to learn more about the painful history of race relations in this country then this is your book as well. Tyson believes with all his heart that most of us have an extremely distorted and somewhat sugar-coated view of what really went on in this country during the 1960's and 1970's. For example, as a fairly well read white man in his 50's I had never even heard about two incidents that Tyson contends are key to understanding what really happened in those years.  When you read about the case of the Wilmington Ten you begin to understand the rage black people felt back in the early 1970's. And when you read the grisly and heartbreaking story of what happened to some slaves who dared to rebel at the Destrehen Plantation in Louisiana way back in 1811, you again begin to appreciate the reasons why blacks in this country feel and react the way they do. The history books that most of us read in school never mention incidents like these.  So how are we to know?  And if we don't know, how can we possibly understand?
<br />And finally, "Blood Done Sign My Name" is an intimate account of one man's personal struggle with the issue of race. Tim Tyson has presented us with an exceptionally well written book that offers the reader an awful lot to chew on.  Highly recommended.  </span>

                    <span>I just finished reading Blood Done Sign My Name.  I found it to be a very powerful indictment of America.  I have basically shunned my German heritage based upon their complicity in Hitler's genocide of the Jews and other "misfits."  This book made me re-think my own prejudices. Especially where the author's African-American friend, whose parents were a mixed-race couple, found it safer to live in Germany than in the U.S. It hit me like a 2x4 to realize that America has treated not just one or two groups this way but many. To name a few: African-Americans, American Indians, Japanese Americans, Chinese-Americans and most recently Arab-Americans.  Just when I was despairing of our country and it's people who are leaning ever to the right, just as I was contemplating moving to Canada, I turned the page and Tyson began writing about hope and redemption.  He wrote about facing the past and teaching it to our children.  Teaching the truth, not the sanitized, re-written version.
<br /> 
<br />I have felt that as individuals, we have to face our individual pasts or we will repeat the past and visit it upon our children.  It is clear from reading Tyson's book that we must do so as a people/country as well.  We have a long way to go considering that people don't even want to face violence and abuse that happens in our own homes.  Until women and children are safe in their homes and we face these issues, I don't have a lot of hope that our treatment of groups of people will change.
<br /> 
<br />I will pass this book around and recommend it to my friends and acquaintances not just because of the wonderful writing style but because this is a very important work that hopefully will hasten this country facing it's past and moving toward a better future.  I am also very impressed that Tyson took a tragedy that impacted his life and turned it into a positive, not only for himself but others as well.
<br /> 
<br />Thank you Timothy Tyson for writing such a powerful important book.

                    <span>Part civil rights history and part autobiography, this book deals with a little known 1970 lynching in Oxford, NC, its root causes and aftermath.  I will allow the other reviewers and amazon.com to detail the story, but suffice it to say that it reads like a novel and is both heartbreaking and uplifting. A very personal and spiritual look at race relations and the impact it had on the author's life.  A truly great book.</span>
