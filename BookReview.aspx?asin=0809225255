                <span id="Label1">Late on the night of his youngest son's final Little League game, Ned McIntosh found he couldn't sleep. He realized that he'd never again coach one of his children, and he began wondering whether his coaching system, developed over 15 years of coaching (and three sons), would be of use to other parent/coaches. Three years later, <I>Managing Little League Baseball</I> was born. From start to finish, McIntosh stresses the need to make baseball fun for the players, all the while developing the skills players need to win. From choosing players (use your returning players as scouts) to making sure they all play (a Little League rule) to designing effective practices, McIntosh outlines the techniques that have made his teams successful--for 15 straight winning seasons. Chapters outline drills for hitting, base running, defense, and pitching, while a special section focuses on handling overbearing parents. This otherwise fine book is flawed by too few illustrations (a problem remedied by McIntosh's later book, <I>Little League Drills and Strategies</I>), but <I>Managing Little League Baseball</I> is a great resource for coaches old and new. <I>--Sunny Delaney</I></span>

                    <span>This book is outstanding and obviously written by someone who knows what he is talking about.  My only comment is that it is not only for Little League baseball but any baseball program for youth such as  Pony/Colt,  Dixie league and others.  Other than the rules that are unique to the  Little League organization, the rest of the book is applicable to nearly  any program.  His recent update is even better. As a former Umpire in these  programs I was particularly impressed in his comments about that part of  the program.  Strongly recommend this book to both coaches, parents and  players.</span>

                    <span>I found this book reinforced some of the more successful things I'd been doing as a coach and gave me many other tips I intend to put into use this season. The author is methodical in his approach and it is easy to see why  he never had a losing season in 15 years of coaching Little League. I'd  recommend this book to anyone who wants to do a good job coaching youth  baseball.</span>

                    <span>I have read about twenty books devoted to coaching youth sports, particularly baseball and softball.  Managing Little League Baseball is the best.  I have read it from cover to cover three times and frequently refer to specific sections.  Ned McIntosh gives practical, useful tips on choosing your players (e.g., talk to p.e. teachers), giving tests, drilling the basics (hitting, baserunning, defense), scheduling pitchers, handling parents, motivating players, coaching your defense, and charting to win.  Most recently, I was trying to figure out how to play our six infielders all six innings and make sure our other seven players played the mandatory two innings in the field and batted at least once.  The section on charting to win provided the answer.  This book should be required reading for all Little League coaches, whether in tee ball, minor league, little league, or senior league.</span>
