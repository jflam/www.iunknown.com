                <span id="Label1">With the recent popularity of such notable books as Frances Mayes' <I>Under the Tuscan Sun</I> and Elizabeth Romer's <I>The Tuscan Year: Life and Food in an Italian Valley</I>, a legion of new Italia fans are finding out what many already know: the charm of Tuscany cannot be denied. In <I>The Most Beautiful Villages of Tuscany</I>, author James Bentley and photographer Hugh Palmer offer a decidedly unique view of this remarkable region. Focusing on thirty-six villages and towns from all over Tuscany--chosen for "both their intrinsic beauty and for the part they have played in Tuscan history and culture"--the gorgeous full-color photographs, accompanied by superb accounts of each village, truly "bring the region to life, evoking the richness of architecture and landscape, and bringing out the charm of the Tuscan people." The final chapter is devoted to useful travel information, including passages on hotels and restaurants, market days and festivals, as well as a select bibliography and detailed map of the region. As beautiful as it is informative and entertaining, <I>The Most Beautiful Villages of Tuscany</I> is "the perfect visual tribute to the timeless beauty of these small towns and villages."  </span>

                    <span>I ordered this book last week and received it this weekend. I opened the cover and never put it down. I am not Italian nor have I been to Italy but it is my dream. I am constantly telling my husband this would be the trip of a lifetime, but until that time comes, this is the book I will cherish....the one I will flip through and dream with. The architecture is what inspires me to go, to take my own pictures. The photographs in this book are.....well, breathtaking.....absolutely breathtaking. If you share this dream, you must buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is gorgeous! All the photos are clear, none of them are grainy or crappy which is my biggest pet peave. The towns are accurately portrayed and the histories are fascinating. I have to say though that my favorite town in this book is San Gimignano! I've been all over Italy (my family lives there) and that is my absolute favorite town. Another town which is in Umbria called Orvieto is definately worth the visit!</span>

                    <span>Don't leave this book on your coffee table. Take it anywhere you can dream. The pictures are so clear you can smell the air and run your hands over the bricks. The copy is crisp and well written. The perfect book to sit with in front of the fire, when the wind is howling and dream of warmer climates and clear skies.</span>

                    <span>This large format hard cover masterpiece squeezes all the natural beauty out of the Tuscan landscape. Hugh Palmer floods the pages with gigantic panoramic photos of almost forty villages in Tuscany, many of which are never visited by the average tourist. If nothing else, this book has convinced me to wander off the well-beaten tourist track to get a real taste of the rich landscape and architecture that hides there. This book is not only a magnificent inspiration for a magical tour of Tuscany, but after, the best possible way to remember the experience of being there.</span>

                    <span>This book is more than a well-researched travel guide. It's also the most gorgeous tribute to Italy I've ever seen. I'm an Italian, living in Como, and have visited every one of the villages in the book and I can tell you, they are as gorgeous as the authors' interpretations. The photographs are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen, and, like a previous reviewer, I, too, get misty-eyed just looking at them. If you want to travel to Italy or just love Tuscany, you won't go wrong with this book!</span>
