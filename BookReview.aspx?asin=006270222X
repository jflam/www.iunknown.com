                <span id="Label1">At the heart of Tiger Woods' accomplishments is the special bond he shares with his father, mentor and first goal coach, Earl Woods. In <I>Playing Through,</I>?Tiger's dad shares the never-before-told story of the Woods family. Part autobiography and part ultimate insider's biography of Tiger, <I>Playing Through</I> is Earl Woods' opportunity to have his say and pass on lessons he has learned along the way.<P>For the first time, Earl faces the critics and cynics, addressing head-on the controversies and rumors that have grabbed headlines. In this brutally honest account of life with Tiger, Earl reveals how Tiger struggled to adapt to life as a pro, the racial attacks and hate mail, the painful sacrifices the family made throughout the years and the real reasons Tiger left Stanford after just two years. He also tells the untold story of what happened the night before Tiger's Masters' victory and the unique philosophy behind all of Tiger's actions, professional and personal.<P>Earl also shares his own stunning story. Raised by his sister after losing both of his parents by the time he was 13, he chose the military over a promising baseball career. He reveals the racial barriers that tortured him throughout his Army days, how he found his calling in the Green Berets and shocking details about his two tours of duty in Vietnam, where he met and befriended the original "Tiger," for whom his famous son is named. Woven throughout his recollections is the legacy of his mother and the lessons she imparted to him about family, faith and hard work -- all of which helped Earl to nurture and guide his son's talent.<P>A tribute to Tiger, to the powerful role of family and the bonds between fathers and sons and to the sport that has made so much possible for the Woods family, Earl's words will inspire all of us to work hard, dream big and "play through" life's challenges.</span>

                    <span>Who was the man who was behind Tiger Woods to mold and shape him into the champion that he is today? The answer is Earl Woods, Tiger's father, friend and confidant. Playing Through is Earl Woods' own biography of what it is like to be the father of one of golf's greatest stars. One would expect a cohesive and comprehensive story about Earl's life and that of his son. Instead you are presented with a man who is uncapable of seperating himself from the persona of his son. Earl Woods spends the majority of the time speaking about his son rather than himself. How strange, since the book is supposed to be about Earl Woods. Unfortunately it ends up as a promotional text about Tiger.<P> Earl Woods is a man who dealt with many obstacles in his life. As a teenager he lost his parents, struggled with a career choice, dealt with the racism in the Army and a failed marriage. Then after his divorce and remarriage a child was born and Earl devotes his life to him even at the expense of his own marriage. At this juncture we hear no more about Earl. Tiger becomes the focus which is a shame since Earl's life is far more interesting.<P> Throughout the work Earl tends to put people on a pedestle to the point where they become unreal ( his mother, his brother-in-law, and the orignial Tiger, his friend). He is defensive about any criticism about his son and doesn't tell us much about his relationship with his other children. Earl is so emeshed in his youngest son's identity that he becomes a bore. Surely he could have told us more about himself rather than going on and on and on about Tiger.<P> Despite his faults Earl Woods raises some interesting questions regarding the role of the NCAA on student athletes. He intimates that the NCAA controls the athletes who make money for their schools but receive nothing in return. Earl also shows the impact that Tiger's status has made on the game. Tiger's presence has made the game more accessible to people, raised the purses, tightened security and inspired more minority children as well as their parents to take up the game. Tiger's impact is immeasurable as he continues his career.<P> If you can tolerate Earl's egotistical meanderings and defensive posture, the book is a good lesson in how not to make the mistakes Earl made and become a better parent. It is filled with Tiger's triumphs and challenges. Earl comes across as your controlling parent of an exceptional and talented player. It is worth the read for those who are Tiger fans and collectors of books written about thim.</span>

                    <span>From this book, I get the feeling that Earl Woods is one of the most egotistical people I have ever come across. He does nothing but talk about how good he is at this, how good he is at that, what he did to bring up Tiger, etc. He even says his separation from his wife Tida is due to affluence, not that they are simply separated. Also, he takes no responsibility for anything that has ever happened to him. Every negative experience in his life was due to him being a minority. Give me a break. <P>He also feels the NCAA was out to get he and his precious Tiger. NCAA rules are rules, just like in golf. Get over it. Tiger was not treated any differently than any other college athlete. Tiger was offered a country club membership at the Olympic Club while he was at Stanford, and Earl can't figure out why the NCAA wouldn't let him take it. Because, believe it, or not...Tiger has to live under the same rules as everyone else on this planet. <P>I do have to say the book is an easy read, and keeps you interested, but only because Earl's "thumb on my back" mentality keeps you laughing.</span>
