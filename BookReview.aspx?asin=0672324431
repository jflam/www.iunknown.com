                    <span>Though this book aimed primarilly at .NET rather than Delphi it self, but I think its approach is correct, for the readers that already familiar Delphi 5/6/7. I would call this book '.NET for Delphi programmers'.
<br />
<br />This book contains advanced topics I didn't feel useful first time. But lately I migrate some old Delphi 5 compoment packages
<br />to VCL.NET, I found there're many useful topics in this book.
<br />
<br />In a word, I like this book and it worth the money.</span>

                    <span>I was initially disappointed by this book, though now I am only slightly negative.  In the book, the author provides a good overview of how you can use Delphi for .NET and ASP.NET.  I did learn a lot about .NET and am better prepared for the migration.
<br />
<br />However, this looks and reads like an editted C# book.  Except for a few pages (literally one chapter), there is very little about Delphi.  The examples are in Delphi, which helps with the understanding, but the author uses the Microsoft .NET libraries and DOES NOT USE EVEN ONE of the Borland specific libraries like VCL.NET, etc. in his examples.
<br />
<br />Overall, an educational book, but not what I was looking for.</span>

                    <span>The book covers an excellent range of topics. As both Delphi and .Net are large subjects I think Xavier has managed the content very well. 
<br />
<br />The book is easy to read and the examples are very easy to follow.
<br />
<br />The Delphi 6 Developers Guide on CD is also a nice bonus if you are still developing for Win32 in Delphi 6/7.
<br />
<br />What I expect out of this type of book is to reduce my learning curve and allow me to start writing programs, Delphi for .NET Developer's Guide has certainly done that for me.
<br />
<br />If you are going to write .NET programs in Delphi than you want this book on your shelf.

                    <span>I just wasn't impressed with the book.  I'm an experienced Delphi developer and I puchased this book thinking it would show me how to leverage my Delphi skills and learn how to do things in .NET. What a disappointment.  After a chapter on using the graphics routines comes a section on Mono then off to a discussion of databases.  Not much on creating normal forms apps and many of the code examples are in C# or VB.  Even some of the sample Delphi code was for version 7, not even .NET examples.  I really wanted this book to get me ready for .NET and instead I merely learned some about the graphics routines and file IO.  I wanted more from the standpoint of you're a Delphi developer here's how to work with .NET. <p>Found a bunch of typos also, so I had to really study the book to see what was meant.  In one case it says you'd expect to see an 'A' as the result but what you really get is an 'A' - not very useful from a learning standpoint.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book.  The examples are clear and straight forward. The guest author list reads like a Delphi Community Celebrity party.  The inclusion of the prev Dev Guide on CD is a really nice touch.<p>I had a lot of .Net migration misconceptions that Mr. Pacheco has addressed very well, leaving me excited about using Delphi within the .Net framework.<p>Joe Hendricks</span>
