                <span id="Label1">Author Garri Garripoli examines movement through life, which he terms "the Ride," with a capital R. The Tao of the Ride is Garripoli's deft interpretation of the two worlds of motorcycling and Eastern spirituality, and the relationship between them. In his view, readers can best understand the Ride as it refers to the motorcycle: the need for balance, the confronting of one's own mortality, accelerating, braking, refueling, tuning-up, accepting passengers, being in accidents, and on and on. To that end, the motorcycle becomes the metaphor for freedom - whatever it is that returns us to  our natural selves. This metaphor then serves to illustrate principles of Eastern spirituality, including such timeless Chinese philosophies and concepts as Tao and Qi, to name but a few. Tao entails living in a natural way, accepting nature and following its rhythms - in short, Tao is balance and acceptance. Qi is the life force, the cosmic energy that flows through every human being. The metaphor of motorcycling, which requires balance, acceptance and evenly flowing energy, illustrates these principles effectively and concisely. </P>  <P><I>The Tao of the Ride</I>, with its unique and down-to-earth metaphor, illuminates with crystal clarity and offbeat humor heretofore elusive Eastern philosophical precepts. Its division into concise, easy-to-read chapters, presented with humor, joy and wisdom, render it accessible and especially inviting.</P>  <P>Whether they hail from the beat generation or generation X, whether they drive Fatboys or minivans, all readers who enjoy Eastern philosophy and crave a better, more down-to-earth understanding of it will love this book. <I>The Tao of the Ride</I>, a handbook for the Ride of life, will take readers beyond motorcycles and into the mechanics of the soul. It is destined to become a must-read, New Age classic.   </P></span>

                    <span>After reading the other reviews, this book was a disappointing read.  It would make an interesting magazine article, but I think that it drags on- even for a short (141 page) book.  I found myself zoning out while reading, it didn't capture my attention past the first few pages.<p>I highly suggest that you read the sample pages, and imagine it being repeated about 50 times.<p>The message is good, I loved the stories from his friends, but expected a lot more.</span>

                    <span>The way he connects motorcycling riding to eastern philosophy helps to illuminate both.  The philosophical ideas he talks about with motorcycle riding I have experienced in other areas (tennis and developing software), but this book helps to put what I've experienced in a very useful context. The way he paints the motorcycle as a vehicle to explore larger ideas and better connect one with nature makes me want to try riding a motorcycle.  If you like relating your life's experiences to a bigger picture or want to understand the deeper meaning of riding a motorcycle, you will enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>This book really grabbed me - it's honest, fun, lyrical yet speaks from the heart.  I don't ride, but the author really gave me a true sense of what it could be like even as a passenger, so I finally picked up the courage to go for a ride with my boyfriend who just got a Yamaha V-Star Classic, and now I understand his obsession.   I also enjoyed reading the other contributors thoughts and feelings about their experiences, especially the women!  I'm thinking I may just take some lessons and get my own bike after this...  Great read and many thanks for sharing this poetry in motion.</span>

                    <span>Bro...remember the patch that says "If I have to explain...you won't understand". You managed to explain the Ride in ways both Riders and non-Riders will understand. Everyone needs a place to be able to focus, and for me, my place is my bike. For my daughter, it's her guitar, for my mom it's a horse. (Okay..getting into a good piece of blues does it too!)  There is a great deal of wisdom in the saying "Sometimes it takes an entire tank of gas before you can think straight."  Thanks Bro.<p>Shineyside Up!</span>
