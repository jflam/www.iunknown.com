                    <span>I absolutely enjoyed reading the book.  This is a book that covers some very advanced topics in a way that it seems so easy to comprehend.  I liked the way author uses examples and explains not only the technology but the use of the development tools as well.  This is just one the best technical books that I have ever read.</span>

                    <span>This is a comprehensive book on component-based development (with C#). It's ~1000 pages thick and packed with code and developer information that is well referenced. A bit short on component "packaging" frameworks. This book also complements well Groove development(GDK with .NET)...</span>

                    <span>After trying numerous .Net books I found that this one was extremely helpful in getting to know the most important parts of the .Net framework. The book covers a lot of ground, since anything can be a 'component'. The discussion is split into front end, middle tier and back end components. So the scope is big. This book assumes you know .Net, and have played with VS.Net, so don't expect an introductory level text. I think the author does a great job of picking out the most important parts of the .Net framework and demonstrating their practical use in short but useful examples.<p>I have been disappointed at numerous books that spend ages covering the same ground like introduction to .Net and using windows or web controls, leaving meatier issues untouched. In contrast, Faison treads quickly, and clearly, through major topics in .Net such as (not in order): using windows & web controls, user windows & web controls, Crystal reports, database access & data grids, session management in ASP, security, web services, and so on. Many other areas of the framework are covered in passing; for example a handy section on using the web browser control in .Net.<p>The discussion of UML in the beginning is a bit fast, particularly the terse presentation of numerous design patterns, but the author's use of UML sequence diagrams through the book is excellent.<p> My main criticism is that the author tries a bit hard at humor with the quotes before each chapter. Otherwise, it's a great book.</span>

                    <span>Highly recommended for serious software developers.<br>One of the best books I have read.<br>Part one is almost biblical to software development process.<br>This is not just for .NET, the same principles are applicable to Java or Windows developments.<br>I have good understanding on VC++6.0, but facing VS.NET I feel daunted.<br>My experiences with the Windows system, MFC class lib and VisualStudio are not much useful.<br>This book helps a lot.  .NET is very rich and deep, so you should not expect<br>realizing .NET with a signle book.  Yet this book is a must on your reading list.</span>
