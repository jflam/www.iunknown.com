                <span id="Label1">As more and more people seek meaning in new forms of spiritual practice or renew their commitments to traditional religions, they are creating homes that reflect and enhance the spiritual component of their daily lives. This book provides an inspiring testament to the influence of spiritual practice on contemporary design. Here are Buddhist meditation rooms, personal shrines to Catholic saints, and altars to Santeria deities and the Virgin of Guadeloupe. Here are exquisitely decorated Sabbath tables as well as tables whose settings reflect the procession of the seasons. Here are private temples to creativity, memorials to beloved friends and family members, and offerings to Hindu gods. And here are shrines and sanctuaries enriched with the symbolism of many religions past and present. Imbued with personal content, all of these rooms offer comfort, accommodate ritual activity, and embrace the elements of nature. From collections of masks and icons to meditation gardens, from Chanukah Menorahs to Haitian drapos, the spiritual impulse in design draws from the world's religions and the history of art. Chapters on the "Evolution of Sacred Design" and "The Meaning of Sanctuary" provide a foundation for understanding the content of the home sanctuary. Chapters on "Rooms and Shrines," "Altars," and "Art and Artifacts" illustrate specific interpretations and applications. Whether abundantly decorated or austerely refined, the rooms pictured here lift up and enrich the soul. They are filled with meditative light, exalted imagery, soothing color, and symbolic meaning. 120 color photographs and illustrations.</span>

                    <span>As you browse throught this book you will feel inspired in many ways; you will be inspired spiritually of course but also at looking at the world in a different way. In this book the differences between religions are erased, the belief in ancient dieties mesh with contemporary reflections of Jesus, Buddah, Hindu Shiva and Shakti figures, African fetish figures or sculptures are intermingled with Burmese textiles and Mexican altars , complete with crosses adorned with milagros are juxtaposed on other pages with devil wood carvings and images of death in the form of calaveras (skeletons). There is even a section on Santeria altars where the text explains the origins of the religion as coming with the slaves from Yoruba to Cuba and spreading throughout the Caribbean. The book is organized with a text and accompanying pictures of the history of sacred design and the meaning of santuary. If you look at the table of contents you will see that the author explores gardens, rooms and shrines, altars , art and artifacts. The text is less than spellbinding but the pictures are magnificent. The author takes you into several artists homes and naturally they are some of the most spectacular. If you are into wood work from New Mexico than you are in for a real treat. There is nearly a two page spread of renowned santero Ramon Jose Lopez bedroom that shows his "chapel" where he sleeps. The bed has six panels, featuring various saints, a room divider with more hand carved panels of saints, many styles of crosses, including an altar made of wood in form of a pyramid where each level is lit by candle light and colorful retablos. It is a sight to behold and helps explain the inspired beautiful work by Lopez. In general this is a book that opens up the possibilities for creativiy to flow and create your own santuary. Having a mini altar myself that continues to grow and having seen some impressive homes where sacred places exist , this book helps to borrow ideas from or develop some new ideas. The gardens featured range from simple, rustic places to elaborate arts of work complete with sculptural panels and life sized sculptures looking as though they are dancing in the garden in their inanimate state. The colorful pictures seem to reveal something new each time you look at the book, it as though the spirits reveal themselves when the time is right. A fine book for browsing after taking a break from the task at hand, this book will inspire you and elevate your senses as you look to the heavens and give thanks for all the beauty around you.</span>

                    <span>I found this book inspiring. Many different icons and symbolizations are represented from various sects of religion so I believe it has broad appeal. I witnessed glorious worlds beyond my own which to me is the very essence of opening a book in the first place. The photographs are lovely and each time through I have noticed something different in detail from the time before. Serenity flows from the pages. <P>We were inspired by another book, Holy Personal by Laura Chester, and built a 10' x 12' meditation room in our back garden. In A Spiritual Style has only affirmed our desire to transform our interior living spaces into sacred, meaningful places of comfort and self-expression for our family as well.</span>

                    <span>Beautiful to browse through, but steeped in a sort of spiritual narcissism which I found distasteful. The writing is disjointed and overall, the book poorly organized. A disappointment.</span>
