                <span id="Label1">In the years following his and Francis Crick&#8217;s towering discovery of DNA, James Watson was obsessed with finding two things: RNA and a wife. <b>Genes, Girls, and Gamow</b> is the marvelous chronicle of those pursuits. Watson effortlessly glides between his heartbreaking and sometimes hilarious debacles in the field of love and his heady inquiries in the field of science. He also reflects with touching candor on some of science&#8217;s other titans, from fellow Nobelists Linus Pauling and the incorrigible Richard Feynman to Russian physicist George Gamow, who loved whiskey, limericks, and card tricks as much as he did molecules and genes. What emerges is a refreshingly human portrait of a group of geniuses and a candid, often surprising account of how science is done.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Having read the truly exciting and insightful account of the discovery of the double helical structure in Watson's `The Double Helix', I was looking forward to more insights on science, the process of discovery if not insights into how great minds collaborated.  I found none of this in the book. 
<br />
<br />The book is an honest account of Watson's experiences, thoughts and feelings during 1950-1970.  Much of the book relates to his being enamoured and his insecurities in relation to Christa, who turns out to be a love lost.  
<br />
<br />More interesting are the descriptions with Gamov - a giant both figuratively and literally - who impacted Watson deeply.  Gamov made lasting contributions to both biology as well as physics.  
<br />
<br />Other interesting aspects of the book include the formation of the `RNA Tie Club' of 20 members aiming to solve the structure of RNA, various travels, accounts of lively parties (with copious consumption of alcohol) and practical jokes everyone seemed to enjoy / revel in.  At times one can't help but feel that this was a concerted attempt to shake lose the nerdy image. 
<br />
<br />In parts, the book reads like a journal, in other instances the discussions of specifics requires a deeper understanding of Chemistry.  I was hoping for a insightful and cogent description of efforts, how science works, how the best minds pool ideas to extend knowledge and how significant was the contribution by key players outlined in the book.  In these areas, the book left more than a little to be desired. 
<br />
<br />From someone who co-discovered `the secret of life' readers should be forgiven to expect more than is delivered by Watson in Girls, Genes and Gamov.

                    <span>I bought this book hoping to understand more about the circle of people who relates to the DNA problem; I found an author who thinks and talks like a l3 year old and has nothing to say..well yes a name is dropped here and there 2 sentences later he is off talking about something else, usually girls. What a waste of money this is unless you want to have nothing but contempt for scientists, but this is a very unrepresentive book and person to appreciate science..a silly 300 pages of drival. Those who wonder what his relationship with Franklin was might find interesting that initially in California he dreaded seeing her again, found her pleasant, pretended to do this and that to help her, but in reality skips off looking for girls! What a jerk! What a vacuous book, worse than one could ever imagine.</span>

                    <span>Anyone expecting a stoic recollection of the works of a great scientist will find many such books available.This is not one of them. It is, however, a very real self-portait of a man in his latter years who, while being a great scientist, admits to not being a great 'everything'. It makes the legend human, just as  the anecdotes about his peers makes them less stone gods of science, and more multi-dimensional people. 'Genes, Girls, and Gamow' is the kind of book you might hear orally from the author in his den in a comfortable leather chair.It is definitly not lab coat and sterile conditions reading. If you want a genetics text, BUY a genetics text. If you want a good example of how great insight in an art or science does not make one immune from the human condition, then give this book a read.</span>

                    <span>Watson's second book centres on the quest for the structure of RNA, whereas his first one 'The double Helix' told us the story of the discovery of the DNA helix.<p>Readers of this work should have a solid knowledge of chemistry.<br>It is however not as interesting as his first book and seems to have been written more as a memory for the insiders than for the common reader.<br>It contains some indiscretions about Watson's more casual sexual encounters, together with his arduous search for a 'good' wife. But mainly, it's gossip about the scientific communities in England and the US in the 1950-1970's.<p>All in all, it doesn't have the scientific and sexual fireworks of e.g., Erwin Schrödinger's biography by Walter Moore.<p>Only for the friends and the aficionados.</span>

                    <span>If ever one wanted a refereshing reminder of the difference between a creator's ideas and a creator's personality, this is it.  This is frankly a trainwreck of a book where a 72-year old man reminisces over all the girls he might have gone out with, wished he had gone out with, thought should have gone out with him even if he wasn't interested, when he was 25.  It recounts malicious gossip and slander about his coworkers in the 50s and 60s for no discernable reason.  Why anybody would want to rake this muck for public view is a very interesting question.  The  Gamow of the title is dismissed without fuss or regret on page 239 ("he died prematurely of alcohol-induced liver failure"), though he is purportedly one of the central figures in the narrative.  Goodness knows what might have transpired without alliteration.<p>Many have wondered if the discovery of DNA structure was a stroke of genius, or a lucky  fluke of being in the right place at the right time.  This first-hand report points unforgivingly at the latter conclusion.</span>
