                    <span>I've always been a huge fan of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls (especially since I live in Illinois). I went to an IMAX theater to watch this documentary. Once I got there, the IMAX screen was huge and looked nice (something that I would later realize was more of a hassle than a benefit). For starters, the screen was so big that you're constantly looking around you just to see the movie. But enough about my personal experiences and how I dislike the IMAX screen, lets get on with the actual movie/documentary(This is a standard documentary to me, but it seems like some people insist on calling it a movie). I have to be completely honest here: "Michael Jordan to the Max" is somewhat boring. Don't get me wrong, it well documents some of the highlights of M.J.'s career, but even a person that said he was one of Michael's biggest fans was sleeping during it. I suppose this documentary is something nice to have to complete your M.J. highlight DVDs, but some might find this thing to be a little boring.</span>

                    <span>I saw this movie in the IMAX theater in Boston at the Science Museum and was thrilled. Granted the home viewing experience is not the same but I also rented the DVD and was thrilled.. For those who did not enjoy the DVD, you have the wrong equipment. I have a widescreen TV and full 5.1 channel surround sound. The sound mix is incredible and the picture format and video transfer is stunning. In some game scenes it feels like you are on the court. I am going to buy this DVD for my home viewing pleasure and the legend of Michael Jordan will live on....</span>

                    <span>I bought this DVD with great anticipation only to be let down. Sure the visuals are great but I'm more interested in the plays that made the Jordan experience special. The Ultimate Jordan is a much better DVD.</span>

                    <span>I did not see this on the IMAX screen (but I have seen other films, so I can extrapolate somewhat). There is good background on Michael Jordan and some good shots. A lot of it focuses on the Chicago Bulls versus Utah Jazz rounding out MJ's career, but it is done well. Some things are his baseball career and the positive influences of his father are worthy additions. Overall, good for any basketball fan, especially fans of MJ.</span>

                    <span>Along with the "Ultimate Jordan" DVD, this is a must buy for all Jordan fans. While the Ultimate Jordan set has all of his earlier hits; Come Fly With Me, Above and Beyond, etc., this DVD packs in the accolades of his final year as a Chicago Bull. There are more interviews and more candid insights with Jordan compared with his earlier videos. The sound and video quality are top notch as well.</span>
