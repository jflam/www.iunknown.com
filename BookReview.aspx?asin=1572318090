                <span id="Label1">In 24 easy-to-follow lessons, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional 6.0: Step by Step</I> covers all of the fundamentals of programming with VB6. The book breaks lessons down into clearly defined steps and concise discussions that assist in creating demonstrative sample programs.<p> A companion CD-ROM contains 84 projects, organized into 24 folders to match the chapters in the book, plus an extras folder. The sheer number of projects and abundance of source code provide a valuable resource that will help beginning programmers get started quickly.<p> Though it contains a complete introduction, the book avoids or simply briefs on some advanced topics like multiple document interface (which, of course, advanced programmers would need to be familiar with, though it receives only a one-page sidebar). <p> The discussion of object linking and embedding, while a tad Microsoft Office-centric, adequately introduces and explains a potentially difficult subject. The book also contains lessons on current topics, including DHTML and file transfer, a pleasant surprise as Richter gives these topics their due.<p> For those looking for a complete, hands-on introduction to Visual Basic programming, this book will provide a valuable resource. <I>--John Keogh</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Using the Visual Basic development environment; forms and projects; properties; exiting Visual Basic; creating a new project; running a program; creating an executable; using controls; menus and dialog boxes; variables; mathematical operators; conditional and looping code; debugging; printers and error handlers; graphics; drag and drop; file operations; modules, functions, and procedures; collections; static and dynamic arrays; string functions; text files; simple encryption; using Access databases; launching OLE-aware Windows programs; OLE Automation; the Windows clipboard; ActiveX controls; integrating sound and video; monitoring your systems memory; downloading files using FTP and HTTP; using Internet Explorer to display HTML files; working with DHTML; creating an HTML page that supports DHTML; using ActiveX controls in DHTML pages; brief discussion of preparing a DHTML project for deployment as an HTML file and DLL; ActiveX Data Objects; FlexGrid; using the CD-ROM.</span>

                    <span>On the positive side: The book is oriented towards beginners, and does not assume prior programming knowledge (but does assume that you know your way around Windows). The lessons are fairly clear, and the author provides plenty of coding examples on the CD.<P>On the negative side: Although Halvorson uses standard naming conventions for objects (with three-character prefixes), he does not use the current standard naming conventions for variables. Instead, he uses the old-fashioned BASIC conventions, so a string variable is named Message$ instead of strMessage. (Microsoft recommends against this practice). And as the reviewer from Nashua pointed out, Halvorson doesn't assign types to his string and integer variables, instead leaving them as the default variant type (a bit sloppy, won't really affect small programs or databases but could be a time/space-waster in large-scale projects).<P>If it weren't for the less-than-ideal programming practices Halvorson uses in his lessons, I'd recommend this book with more enthusiasm. For absolute beginners, it might be better to start with Smiley's intro to VB, and then go through Halvorson's (while correcting the naming conventions and variable types in the exercises!) for more detail. Bear in mind that both are learning books rather than reference books; you'll need to pick up something like "VB and VBA in a Nutshell" (from everyone's favorite geek publisher O'Reilly & Associates) to have at hand while doing more advanced stuff.</span>

                    <span>Coming from a Delphi applications developer background, I found this book easy to follow for my introduction to VB 6. I didn't realize how easy VB is to learn. This book is packed with information covering many topics including ADO and Active X controls, string handling, internet controls. Of course, the topics covered were just a taste and not indepth at all. It was just enough information to get your feet wet. <P>Most of the chapters had applications to practice coding. However, there were several chapters that had sample applications but didn't have any practice code to type. He just went through the pre-written code and explained the key statements. It was more of a reference than actual typing and learning. This books isn't for beginning programmers. But it is a good transition book from other languages to Visual Basic. For my first Visual Basic book, I learned a lot.</span>

                    <span>I bought this and 3 other vb book for work and I think this is easily the worst one. It doesn't explain a lot of the code, which is why I bought the book. Also the way it's organized isn't very easy to follow. I bought this book because I firugre that Microsoft would know their product the best but apparently not. My advice is to look for another book on the subject.</span>

                    <span>As an experienced programmer looking to learn languages I do not regularly use, or asked to recommend a book to someone else for learning a new language, I look at many books. This book is bad. The author takes you by the hand and does everything for you. There aren't any exercises or review questions at the end of chapters. People don't learn that way. To learn something and keep it learned people must do something, perform an exercise, think through and solve a problem. This book isn't much better than a classroom lecture, or a TV show. This book does not make you think!</span>
