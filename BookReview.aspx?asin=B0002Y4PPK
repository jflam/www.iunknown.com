                    <span>For the most part, I really liked this movie. Bobby is a terrific character: innocent, charming, open, needy and sexual. I also like the way all the relationships in this film are portrayed, because they're not at all black and white. All of the relationsihps between the main characters (Bobby and Jonathan, Bobby and Clare, Jonathan and Claire, even Bobby and Jonathan's mother) are an ambiguous combination of friendship, romance, sexual attraction and family. It was nice to see these kinds of "gray" relationships, which I've experienced often in my own life, on film.
<br />
<br />My favorite part of the film was the first "act", which showed Bobby as a child, absorbing much of his identity from his older brother, and Bobby as a teenager, befriending Jonathan and slowly being adopted by his whole family. Somehow, I preferred the younger, teenage versions of the characters to the adult versions. It's not that the older actors didn't do a good job (in fact, seeing this film gave me a newfound respect for Collin Ferrell as an actor), it's just that I found the older version of Jonathan much less appealing. I was a little disappointed that Jonathan's character ended up being a sad cliche in so many ways ... a promiscuous gay man who winds up sick from AIDS. Since so many of the relationships and ideas in this film seemed so fresh, it was sad to see one of the main characters follow such a tired path.
<br />
<br />Although I haven't read the book, I could sense from the film that there were important aspects of the plot and the characters' lives that had been cut out. Adding scenes may have made the film longer, but it probably would have improved it. Overall, however, this was an entertaining, endearing and almost great film. </span>

                    <span>It surprises me that Michael Cunningham could have chopped up his own work and write a 90 minute adaptation of his 352 page novel! I loved the book so much and I honestly wanted to like the film as well but I just couldn't. They left soooo much out that could have been some great scenes on film. I believe Michael Mayer was a wrong pick to direct. Something as intimate and mature as this should have been done by Peter Bogdonavich (The Last Picture Show), Steven Daldry ("The Hours", another Cunningham adaptaion) or Todd Field ("In The Bedroom"). 
<br />The film often has the feeling of a sunday night TV movie on ABC or something. It is truely sad that this film had so much potential coming from an excellent source. In a better adaptaion we would have seen more from Johnathan and Bobby's childhood, more of Alice and Ned's life involving a miscarrage. Johnathan's ex-boyfriend'd death could have been great! Just plain more would have been enough. The character Bobby goes through some pretty hard things in the book but the film merely mentions them or suggests them. It's frustrating! The casting on the bright side was decent. Colin Farrell and Dallas Roberts give good solid preformances. Farrell's is truely understated. Sissy Spacek's role is excrutiatingly minimized but she's still good. Robin Wright Penn is--well I didn't like Robin Wright Penn. She looks good as Claire but doesn't give the qualities the real Claire has; miscast.
<br />This is the only film that I think still has a chance of surviving. I hope that sometime in the near future someone comes along and does a remake of this! It will be deep, emotional, funny, engrossing, it will be three hours, and I will love it.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed in this movie and have rated it "1 star" in order to help balance the folks who gave it "5 stars".  
<br />
<br />It's about a boy whose family dies one-by-one while he was young. He meets another boy and they experiment with each other (nothing graphic).  Then they go their separate ways and grow-up.  They reunite, but one is straight and the other is a closeted gay guy who has a female housemate.  The straight guy and gay guy are best friends.  The straight guy has a baby with the female housemate and they all move to the countryside.  After a few years, the female moves back to the city with the baby, leaving the two guys living together in the countryside in a house she bought.
<br />
<br />Aside from the brief experimentation scenes when the boys were young, there is no sexual contact between the two men during the movie.  They're just best friends. And there's nothing wrong with that, but this should not be advertised as a gay movie, because it isn't.</span>

                    <span>The ad for the movie was one that made you think that this was going to be a fantastic movie.  And, don't get me wrong there were so many moments in the film that led you toward that promise, but than yanked you cruelly back in this muck of what should have been a delight of a film.  I won't blow the ending for those who want to see it, but let's just say it doesn't finish anything.  I had hoped for so much and in doing so was let down.  There never really was a love triangle at all. Johnathan was gay, Bobby was straight/bi curious and Claire just loved sex.  Overall, not as great as a movie I'd hoped for.  Sorry to all the Five Star reviewers</span>

                    <span>Toss in a bit of the 60's, 70's and 80's, add some sexuality (homosexuality, bisexuality, heterosexuality and questioning), add some city, some country, and a baby, redefine the definition of family and you have "A Home at the End of the World".  I think many from less then fortunate homes hope for such a home as portrayed in this film.  Touching, deep, with enough humor to keep us from getting too emotional, the story is about people, and family and caring for one another.  The film starts out briefly in the late 60's, and we spend a fair amount of time in the 70's getting to know the boys, Bobby and Jonathan, who in essense become brothers through circumstance, not through blood lines.  I would say about half the story line is set in the 1980's as we explore the dynamics of the adult relationships as they relate to the childhood one shared by the boys.  At times, especially early, the film loses momentum, though very briefly.  Don't leave for a drink or snack, as the film and the plots move quickly.  This is a film that could have used an extra 15 minutes.  I found the sound levels to be a tad low at times. The soundtrack is excellent, poignant and draws in the viewer to the drama unfolding - fantastic selection of music.  Overall, an excellent film, extremely well acted, Sissy Spacek is terrific in her role, a great casting call indeed.  The film was released by Warner Independent films, and it did seem "independent" for the most part.  The "kissing brothers" line is most memorable.</span>
