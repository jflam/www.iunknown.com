                    <span>I have read a few hundred "non-fictional" books over the years for my MBA, for quality, etc, but I have to tell you that this book about the use of balanced scorecards is the best business related book that I have ever read, and I feel that every CEO should completely absorb it to utilize its "pertinent" applications that are applicable to their business processes, thus institutionalizing the process metrics' continual improvement concepts of ISO/TS 16949:2002 and ISO 9001 in all types of firms, including those that are not automotive suppliers!- Bill Cooper, Global Quality Systems Senior Manager, Lear Corporation</span>

                    <span>Finally, a pragmatic approach to developing a Business Scorecard that captures the profitability proposition through periodic measurement of critical performance.  The critical thinking used to construct and evaluate each element of the hierachical measurement structure provides a keen insight into the contribution value of each functional area of the business.  The concise step-by-step approach in building the overal Business Performance Index provides the guidance necessary for immediate implementation by small or large enterprizes.</span>

                    <span>Praveen, I just have to buy you a cup of coffee or a drink one day.  I am just finishing your book, "Six Sigma Business Scorecard " and have to say that I haven't been this riveted to a business book since "The Goal".  Books like this for me have been far and few between.</span>

                    <span>This book connected the dots between my undergrad, mba, six sigma training and 25 years of business sense.  Your first reaction might be; why haven't I been tracking and measuring the critical links to growth/profitability more closely?  Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down; it was like therapy for the business mind.  It breaks through all the mystery and jargon of TQM, ISO 9000 and six sigma, in simple business terms.</span>
