                    <span>I think it's high time the classics were brought back. Too often these feminists classics have gone out of print, and not available to younger generations. It's as viable today as it was in 1984.</span>

                    <span>A fantastic, indispensable book that should be read by everyone who has eyes and half a cerebellum. A great starting point for people who, like me, were interested in feminism but always felt the whole Betty Friedan liberate-the-homemaker aspect they taught us in highschool was a bit shallow, moot, and furthermore nonapplicable to males. Hooks' voice is distinctively wise, startling, discerning, and pragmatic; conceptually, it really makes you view the way society works with new eyes, even if none of the indictments really come as a surprise. Although many readers not predisposed to radical politics may have trouble swallowing all of her ideas in this era of ultra-conservatism, this book really does have something for everybody. It's obvious the reader below calling this book baseless propaganda didn't really understand it, for harmful power hegemonies are still as central to American social and political conduct as when it was first published twenty years ago.</span>

                    <span>More men should read feminist texts.  The world would be a much better place....hopefully.  I'm a man, and I love books by Bell Hooks, Adrienne Rich and Alice Walker.</span>

                    <span>A compendium of feminist misandry.  Anti-men myth piled on bigoted propaganda.  There is so little truth or fact and so much misandry in this book that there is no place to start describing it.  If you're into self congratulating feminazi hate this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>Like bell hooks, I am a feminist. I am also a Chicana. It was a relief to see someone writing about the problem of racism in  mainstream feminism. Hooks points out the sad fact that many women can be aware of sexism as a form of oppression, but be oblivious to other prejudices (i.e. racism & classism). She uses testimonial accounts, analysis, and her own personal experiences to paint a too true picture of the ugly side of mainstream feminism. She has shed light on why so many women of color feel uncomfortable, and perhaps unwanted when it comes to feminist activity. Look in your history books. How many photos of Blacks and Mexicans do you see marching for women's rights? Yet we were there, too. Hooks points out that we have been feminists for just as long as white women, but we have been ignored, "marginalized". Her book is honest, courageous, and a great achievement.  bell hooks is an amazing writer, and I think those who read this book will also enjoy another of hook's books, "Ending Racism".</span>
