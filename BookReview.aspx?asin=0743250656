                <span id="Label1">Back in 1993, the editor-turned-designer Kate Spade made a splash in the fashion world by turning out a small collection of boxy, utilitarian handbags, each elegantly accented with her name stitched in discreet, lowercase letters. As a result, the simplicity and unabashed refinement of the Spade moniker on those Lilliputian labels has come to define the very foundation on which the designer has since built a fashion empire, one that now, in addition to handbags, includes shoes, clothing, and smart home things, all of which embody the Spade formula of timeless style--a seamless merging of cheerful colors, clean shapes, and well-chosen embellishments. <p>  Not bad for a Kansas City-born girl who used to comb vintage stores for fun. Having perfected and expertly marketed her own brand of personal style (one that has famously been counterfeited throughout the world), the designer has emerged with an equally elegant trio of books whose topics Spade has become a virtual authority:  <I>Style</I>, <I>Occasions</I>, and <I>Manners</I>.<p>  Applying a personal touch to everything you do is Spade's mantra, and leads us off to parties big and small in <I>Occasions</I>. Just like its sister volumes <I>Style</I> and <I>Manners</I>, <I>Occasions</I> has the spirit of a light-hearted scrapbook, but it still packs a bounty of inspired entertaining ideas into its slim proportions. From classic cocktail recipes and setting a sparkling table to seasonal menus, party themes, and the art of the perfect toast, Spade offers all the ingredients for making a party memorable (and maintaining grace under pressure). While she often spotlights the wisdom and flair of famous party stars she loves (Truman Capote and his Black & White ball among them), Spade in her own words resonates as the real tastemaker, getting the balance between girl-next-door and bon vivant just right. <I>--Christene Barberich</I></span>

                    <span>I bought this book as a gag gift for a friend, assuming that it would be full of cutsie little ideas for parties... maybe a few recipes and quotes and bits of ettiquette.<P>I read it on the way home, and was bored to tears. There's nothing I love more than entertaining and pretending to be sophisticated, but this book was niether. It told me almost nothing that even barely related to reality, and that which was complete common sense that any 5 year old could tell you about having friends over. <P>I ended up returning the book. It wasn't even worth it as a gag gift.</span>

                    <span>Or she would have spared me (and other buyers) from paying for her advice, information, opinions, and knowledge on her version of "entertaining". Most of the information is irrelevant - unless you have your own caterer, florist, maid, bellman, limo driver, party organizer and an unlimited amount of cash. Dispensing advice on how to entertain using caterers and servers is hardly applicable to most of us who do not entertain in a posh Manhattan apartment. The section on "Weekend activities in the Country..." is perfect insight in to how contrived and artificial the life of Kate and Andy must be. <P>Although one might try and find the book humorous - in order to justify its ridiculous overpricing. The real joke is on me the purchaser of the book as I was the one duped and the Spades are laughing all the way to the bank.</span>

                    <span>I anxiously awaited the release of this book, as well as the other two in the series. What a disappointment! There is nothing in this book that is new or exciting. Kate offers the same old, tired suggestions that you can find in any book on entertaining. The watercolor illustrations are cute but that's about it. This book has no substance and reads more like a children's book then anything else. For $20 these books are overpriced, as is anything with the Kate Spade name on it. Don't waste your hard-earned money so she and her yuppy husband can laugh all the way to the bank, or their "summer home" in the Hamptons! :-(</span>

                    <span>This book is wonderful. After watching Oprah and reading about these books in Style Magazine, I decided to see what the hype was about! This particular book helped me organize a great Happy 40th birthday for my mother and her friends. After the success of my party, I went ahead and bought the other two books as well. These books have great suggestions and look great on the coffee table! I would recommend buying all three books, they are excellent!</span>
