                    <span>I own the book in Spanish language. Some content in the book is not easy stuff, if you study by others books, but Kolmogorov has the gift to make easy things that aren't quite so easy. Perhaps some theory is "old", because all the new books use some diferent approach to the subject, like the chapter dedicated to the Lebesgue integral, the book give the definition of a simple function in a different manner that we use today. The book is a must to have in your library, when you need to work with Functional Analysis.</span>

                    <span>This book is not quite up-to-date, but still very good as a starting point in (functional) analysis. The virtue of Kolmogorov and Fomin is their user-friendly writing style. I am delighted to find their book being available for less than ten dollars.</span>

                    <span>I am electrical eng who study math all of my life. I had the Arabic version of it which cover more than the English  one.I start reading it after Krewsiq book of advance functional analysis. I really like Krewsiq because it is so easy so I cover it  within 1 year but I need 2.5 year to finish off this one which is  fantastic, I really can't compare it with other books, it is a school of functional analysis and master book that you can't  really understand functional analysis without it.</span>

                    <span>This highly regarded book came out from the notes of Andrei Kolmogorov's lectures given at Moscow's Lomonosov University in the 1940's, and it still stands as one of the best introductions to real analysis available.<p>The  authors introduce step by step all the key concepts needed to get a  thorough understanding of the subject and proceed all the way long from set  theory to Fredholm integral equations.<p>This book is appreciated not only  because the topics it includes but mostly because of the insight with which  it was written. It is a pleasure to find through every page of the book the  great genious of Kolmogorov who not only mastered most areas of mathematics  but who also had an almost unparalleled understanding of what the trends of  future mathematics would be.<p>The contents are: Elements of Set Theory;  Metric and Topological Spaces; Normed and Topological Linear Spaces; Linear  Functionals and Linear Operators; Elements of Differential Calculus in  Linear Spaces; Measure, Measurable Functions, Integral; Indefinite Lebesgue  Integral, Differentiation Theory; Spaces of Summable Functions;  Trigonometric Series, Fourier Transformation; Linear Integral  Equations.<p>Full motivation and detailed explanation for each topic. Short  bibliography, but that is justified by the fact that the authors themselves  were involved in the development of the topics covered.<p>Conclusion: a  must-have text for every mathematician or math student.</span>

                    <span>This book is actually two books bound as one.  The first part concerns metric spaces and normed linear spaces.  The second covers Lebesgue integration.  The typesetting and prose are sometimes very tight, but some  of the constructions used in the proofs are really amazing.  Numerous  examples are sprinkled through the text. I would not recommend this book as  a first book in functional analysis or in Lebesgue integration.  To get the  most out of this book, you need to have seen many of the results presented  elsewhere to really appreciate the Master's technique used in developing  those same results in this book.</span>
