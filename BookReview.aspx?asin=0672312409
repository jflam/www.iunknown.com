                <span id="Label1">For the majority of C++ programmers, the pace and style of David Chapman's <i>Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days</i> will make a good deal of sense. The author covers all the essentials of basic Windows and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) development, and then addresses several new features in Visual C++ 6, all while moving quickly enough for the busy, working programmer.<p> Chapman's first section introduces the basic Visual C++ 6 tools, like the AppWizard and ClassWizard, and discusses the essentials of building dialog-based applications using basic Windows controls such as static text, edit, button, and list box controls. Further chapters cover mouse and keyboard basics, timers, menus, and fonts. In short, the first week provides a traditional introduction to Windows and MFC programming without the frills.<p> The second set of tutorials delves into Graphical Device Interface (GDI) graphics programming, always a challenging topic for new MFC programmers. Then the author moves to using ActiveX controls inside your applications (a real strength of Visual C++, enhanced in the new release). The basics of toolbars, saving and restoring files to MFC applications, and an introduction to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) programming round out this set of chapters.<p> The last set of exercises will give the MFC developer some new expertise. First, the author looks at the potential of ActiveX Data Objects (ADOs) for database development and how to build reusable libraries in both static and dynamic targets. Advanced material introduces the basics of networking and the TCP/IP protocol and discusses MFC support for working with the Web.<p> For readers with a little more time, handy appendices discuss additional topics such as printing, the MFC container and helper classes, and the basics of exception handling and debugging. Clearly, the constraints of the 21-day format have not prevented this author from successfully covering many essential topics in today's MFC programming with a good level of detail. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></span>

                    <span>This is a good book. Why? Because it does exactly what it is supposed to do. You have to accept that VC++ and MFC are way too big to condense into one readable book. <P>What I like about this book is that it get you up and programming quickly. When you are done, you can actually write useful programs. That is, you can create a user interface that hits a database and extracts information. Sadly, that is what most commercial programming is all about.<P>I have read two other great books on VC++ and MFC: 1. Programming Windows With MFC by Jeff Prosise 2. Programming Visual C++ by David J. Kruglinski, et al <P>They are great for learning the every nuck and cranny of how to program windows, but they dont really help you create useful apps quickly. They are great references. But this is the book that will gives you reasonable, doable, "homework."<P>As to the bugs in the source code, I did notice some. But remember, we are programmers!!! Once we get the gist of things, the best way to learn is to no enter in the code verbatum, but to write a little bit of our own. That's how you learn.<P>One last note, to learn VC++/MFC, you really need the MSDN Library. As you are writing code, make sure to look up the objects. Get a good handle on the member functions and variables.<P>Good luck</span>

                    <span>If you want to learn to program C++ or even VC++ i think even using some online tutorial would be better. This book is completely useless. I dont own a copy (If i did i would have burnt it up), i dont do window$ stuff (FreeBSD all the way). A friend of my taking some programming course where they used this book as the course text and happened to have some assignments i was helping him with. Why did i give it such a poor rating?? 'Cos it is the most annoying book i ever saw. The author's style of programming is really really poor and inconsistent; like inconsistent use of both camel and hungarian notation. He must have learnt programming from VB(which is notorious for its poor coding practices). The most annoying thing about this book is the uneccessary comments, like:<P>areaOfYard = FindArea(lengthOfYard,widthOfYard); // call to function passing a length and width value<P>return l * w; // in one statement... return l * w ... wow <BR>(like this is sooo amazing)<P>oh and <P>i++ // increment i<P>Really, how dumb does he think readers are?? This should probably have been called VC++ for dumb dummies. Comments should be used to clarify code not just repeat what code sais.<BR>Except you're a complete newbie to C++ or any other programming language you'll find this book completely frustrating and annoying and even if you're a newbie it'll teach you very bad programming practices.</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book as a Beginner since it teaches a lot about the visual studio environment and also takes you step-by-step through applications. Not the greatest in-depth or and by no means advanced. But its super for a beginner.If you know little of VC++ and even less of MFC then START here. Notice I emphasized Start....since you will need to read lots of other books to gain deeper understanding. Take this from someone who struggled with the advanced books and then got a better start with this one.</span>

                    <span>This was the first book on Visual C++ 6 I ever purchased...well, it's actually still the only one I own. I've been casually reading it and programming from it for - a lot longer than 21 days.<P>In my opinion, this book is not for beginners. It's taken me a long while to begin to pick up some of the concepts that Chapman is constantly throwing into the picture. While I have grasped a great deal about C++ through this book, I am going to buy another one soon, one that more thoroughly covers the details instead of trying to cram the whole picture down at once.</span>
