                    <span>In his biography of George Halas (Papa Bear), Jeff Davis explains that Halas both played for and coached the Decatur (IL) Staleys which he organized in 1920.  It was one of the 11 original teams in the American Professional Football Association, of which Halas was a co-founder and its driving force. The APFA became the National Football League in 1922. With all due respect to his achievements as a coach, Halas deserves much (if not most) of the credit for keeping professional football alive. At least until the emergence of television, baseball really was the national pastime and college football was much more popular (and credible) than was the NFL and the All-American Football Conference which challenged it after World War Two. 
<br />
<br />It is debatable when all this changed. Many cite the the Baltimore Colts victory in overtime against the New York Giants in the NFL championship game (December 28, 1958), others Pete Rozelle's leadership as commissioner (1960-1989 and especially during his first years in that office), and still others a program which CBS televised in 1960 as part of its Twentieth Century series, "The Violent World of Sam Huff." Having personally observed the NFL's exceptional growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s, my own opinion is that there were many factors which certainly include these three.
<br />
<br />In 1960, 36% of those interviewed during a Harris poll selected baseball as their favorite sport, a substantial lead over pro football's 21%. Only ten years later, MacCambridge notes "a shocking change: 38 percent for pro football, 23 percent for baseball." He observes: "This was more than just a generational shift, signaling younger adults raised on football replacing a generation that had grown up listening to baseball on the crystal set. It showed that the NFL was reaching a vast, upwardly mobile middle class, and changing their loyalties. Conversely, the Grand Old Game of baseball -- plagued in 1968 by a historic offensive drought and slumping attendance -- for the first time seemed to have become pass√©, quaint, an anachronism representative of little more than nostalgia for an earlier, simpler time. This was a gross oversimplification, of course, but the truth remained that while football soared, baseball floundered, prisoner to its own complacence."
<br />
<br />Although MacCambridge devotes a great deal of his attention to individuals and especially important games, his primary objective is to explain how and why "In the span of two generations in postwar America, pro football became a truer and more vivid reflection of the American preoccupations with power and passion, technology and teamwork, than any other sporting institution in the country." Credit MacCambridge with providing, in my opinion, the best analysis thus far of the National Football League's evolution to supremacy. It remains to be seen, of course, how long it will sustain it as NASCAR's popularity rapidly and extensively increases. 
<br />
<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Davis' Papa Bear, Michael Mandelbaum's The Meaning of Sports: Why Americans Watch Baseball, Football, and Basketball and What They See When They Do, Richard Whittingham's Sundays Heroes: NFL Legends Talk About the Times of Their Lives, and Phil Barber and John Fawaz' NFL'S Greatest.</span>

                    <span>If there is a better book on the history of professional football, I would like to know of it. Michael MacCambridge has written the definitive book on the subject. He has managed to capture both the color and growing pains of the game in an informative and extremely readable fashion. Just a quick perusal of the source notes gives one the real sense of the extent to which the author has gone to deliver a comprehensively researched, but entertaining opus to the reader.

                    <span>Considering the popularity of pro football in this country, the historical literature on the game has really been lacking, especially when compared to the thousands of works on baseball.  Finally, McCambridge has crafted what should prove as the definitive history of the game, one that any fan of football should enjoy.
<br />
<br />Although it's a 500-page book, the author's style makes this a pretty brisk read.  While full of details, the book isn't overwhelmed by them, always giving the reader an excellent view of the big picture, and of the role that each person and event plays.  It's clear that the author admires many of the people he talks about, but he still manages to present both praise and criticism, never letting his work become hagiographic.  His treatment of the AFL-NFL relationship during the years before their merger is the best I've seen.
<br />
<br />This is truly a book that's just been waiting to be written.  Thankfully, McCambridge has done great justice to a subject ripe for examination.  I think this should be necessary reading for anyone who considers themselves a serious fan.</span>

The big games, the big personalities, the big challenges, and the ongoing march to do what's best for the league first, the teams second, and all boats will rise with the tide. Really enjoyed it.</span>

                    <span>This book has received (and deservedly so) many accolades for its sweeping and exhaustive history not only of the sport so many americans love, but the people behind the sport.  MacCambridge does a great job of bringing little (at least to younger fans) known giants to life, on both the player and management side.  His chapters involving the AFL/NFL "war" for players, the fledgling AAFL of the late 40s and 50s, the dynastic Browns teams and many others of that era enrich the reader's knowledge of football.  In addition, the book does a great job of illustrating the vision of people like Lamar Hunt who understood very early on not only the power of TV to show the game but the need for collective revenue sharing, that the sum must be greater than the parts (unlike baseball which still looks at the parts instead of the whole).  
<br />
<br />Other enjoyable portraits of Pete Rozelle, Tex Schramm and others leap off the page and make this book an easy and enjoyable read.  My only criticism, and it's a mild one, is that the book almost begs to end about 100 pages sooner than it does.  While MacCambridge essentially brings us to today, this part of NFL history is probably the LEAST in need of analysis or recitation right now.  Better to have perhaps ended it with the passing of Roselle or the resolution of the USFL/NFL battle showing the league at the doorstep of complete TV domination.
