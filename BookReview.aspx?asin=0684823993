                <span id="Label1">Author Nicholas Lore uses the techniques of his career-guidance network, the Rockport Institute, to make <i>The Pathfinder</i> a substitute for a great job counselor. Through goal setting, list making, and other techniques, the book leads readers though the process of deciding exactly what they want to do for a living and finding a way to make it happen. Lore realizes that people have different temperaments and decision-making methods, so he provides individualized advice to suit each one. He also understands that creating a new career requires courage as well as desire, so <i>The Pathfinder</i> devotes plenty of space to motivation and overcoming fears. While anyone looking for a new career will find direction with this guide, people who didn't <i>know</i> they were looking may decide to start once they go through Lore's probing self-examination process. </span>

                    <span>The Pathfinder does a great job of taking on the false idea that we need to stick to one career ladder in order to have successful, satisfying lives.  As a coach for Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one)I was especially pleased Nicholas Lore was the author and creator of the exercises. Given his solid background with the Rockport Institute Career Choice Program, this book is great for parents/partners who doubt our inevitable need to change from one thing to another!</span>

                    <span>I completed the work in this book in 1997.  In the back of the book there are phone numbers for further research.  I completed a whole Pathfinders survey, did a phone interview and received a tape of it, and although I felt it was VERY expensive, ultimately, it did help me find a career that was a giant leap but an excellent fit with my needs and skills.  I listened to my own answers and suggestions on the tape, and can say they also helped me greatly to realize I knew what I wanted all along.  I am very happily ensconced in my career, and 8 years after I read this book, I can still say it helped to change my life.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for help in finding what will make you successful and happy in the workplace, this is it.  <p>Whether you just want to find what you are best at (and what you'll get paid most for!) or whether you're seeking ways to add greater meaning to the largest part of your life, this is what you need.  <p>I've spent the last 10 years (and that's a lot of books on the shelves, guys!!) trying to figure my career out.  Reading Nick Lore's book - and using the Rockport Institute's analysis tools -told me what I needed to know to make real, meaningful changes.  I can't believe I am writing this, but now I really am doing what I love - and making money doing it!<p>I have never met Nick Lore, but I know he's put more work into this book and more sincerity into this work - than any author who has taken money from me in the name of self-help.  <p>If only I had read this 10 years ago!!<p>Thanks Nick!</span>

                    <span>I have never sent in a review before. I bought this book in 1999. I slowly worked my way through it and systematically took back control of my life. Part of that control meant I moved back to my home country England a few years ago. Recently my overseas belongings were finally shipped over including my "personal workbook" and The Pathfinder. To my amazment, I read through my notes and thoughts and realized I was now LIVING everything I wrote down! I am now running my own business doing something I love and it's growing and growing and I am HAPPY! I do wake up excited about my day and not only that, whereas once upon a time the biggest I could dream was where I am now, now obviously I am dreaming bigger! So, I am someone who can write to say that this book has had a PROFOUND effect on my life and changed it fantastically! There is no higher recommendation. If you are serious about having it all - this book will help you get there with love.</span>
