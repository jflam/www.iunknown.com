                    <span>JEWS, LISTEN TO ME... IT'S ALL I ASK OF YOU<p>***** FIVE STARS *****<p>I was in my elementary school, back in the Philippines, when we were asked the question: how many Filipino Nobel Prize winner can you name? I went home, consulted my parent, then the encyclopedia for an answer. I can't name one. Then I remembered someone telling me that Corazon Aquino was named woman of the year by "a" magazine back in 1986. She was, of course, the Joan of Arc of the country, and I thought to myself, maybe she was also named a Nobel Peace Prize winner... back in 1986. She wasn't. It was Elie Wiesel. So before learning the names Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King or the Dalai Lama (the celebrities of the Nobel Peace Prize), I am proud to say that, oddly, the first person that I can name who won the prize... was Weisel. But then, I thought, before, Aquino was more deserving of the prize. I, honestly, "hated" the name Elie Wiesel.<p>After reading his book NIGHT, however, my impression of him changed. NIGHT is Elie Wiesel's record of "his" childhood in the death camps of Aushwitch and Buchenwald. Like THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, the first English book (written by a non-Filipino) I've read, Wiesel's is as powerful and thought-provoking. This is an inspirational, spiritual book. A meditation of what is and what should or could be. <p>Now, more than ever, do we need a book like NIGHT. A guide and a reminder that wo/mankind is powerful, yet terrifying. To remind as that there once was Auschwitz and Buchenwald... and two world wars. And that we are all servants of a higher purpose, for we are humans.</span>

                    <span>For Eliezer and his family, night was a nightmare. His family was Jewish and they had currently been taken to the Auschwitz concentration camp, for many, they were taken to their death. In the book Night , Elie wiesel tells his childhood story, through Eliezer about being taken to the concentration camp, and suffering in the worst ways possible. The book shows great detail and It used imagery througout the whole thing! I felt like I was taken in to the book and became a victim, I could picture them starving in the trains. For eliezer his problem was wanting to live. He was to young to die. The theme in this book is to never give up and always have faith I give this book five stars and I would recommend it to anybody</span>

                    <span>I am a teacher who always* uses Cliff's Notes if they are available.  NOT because I don't want to read the book but because they help me understand the book.  Cliff's Notes provide an analysis of the book, such as metaphors and illusions.  Don't assume that people who buy Cliff's Notes are too lazy to read the book.</span>
