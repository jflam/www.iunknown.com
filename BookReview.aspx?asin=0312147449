                    <span>This is one of my favorite translations of the Tao Te Ching.  However, note that, like the author says, this is by no means a strict translation (athough in the case of the Tao Te Ching, there are so many varied translations / interpretations available that it is diificult to say if there is a strict translation).  I would recommend this version of the Tao Te Ching it as a supplement to another translation.</span>

                    <span>i had read many translations of the tao te ching and i'm happy to say that mr. walker's version is readable, smooth and filled clarity. it is a good translation because he explained the tao te ching without sounding so cryptic. instead, he explained with great clarity that even a five year old kid will appreciate. again, i recommend this translation and thanks, mr. walker.</span>

                    <span>What sticks out the most about Lao Tzu's handiwork is how the Tao shines through even when the very core of Tao may be misunderstood by the interpreter.<p>Why was this translation produced anyway?<p>We are all aware by now that the unformed, unnamable, the all-encompassing, omnipresent Tao is beyond good and non-good.  On that level of weareallone, good and non-good simply do not exist separately.<p>Yet in imposing a title on Lao Tzu's pages the author suggests "The Book of the Good and Natural Way?"<p>If this book only defined Good, would it not create non-good also?<p>Just the thought of either good or non-good implies its opposite.<p>Beyond the translators vision lays the unity, the infinite completeness, of the eternal Tao.<p>This GOOD that Mr. Walker speaks of must by necessity, exist for him alone.<p>"He who knows the Tao knows it to be the source of all things soever." (ALEISTER CROWLEY)</span>

                    <span>Walker's version of the Tao Te Ching is by far the most beautiful and has (at least, for me) the clearest and deepest meaning.  This is the the book that has taught me the most about the tao; this is the translation from  which I read to my son.  I hope you read it.</span>
