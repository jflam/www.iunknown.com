                    <span>i have many, many home decor books and this one by far and away is my most favorite and has the best philosophy.  and the cover is fuzzy and pleasant to handle AND nice to look at.</span>

                    <span>And the text makes you think about things that you are probably never going to think about in today's madcap and rushed society, simple things like natural lighting, linen textures, plants for detoxifying your environment, etc.  There is just one thing that frustrated me about this book.  On pages 54 and 55  there is the most amazing sofa I have ever seen, but there is no mention of where it came from or how to get one like it.  Some of the references are clearly European and cannot be found in the States.  But the overall philosophy is simple-  we are animals and we need to slow down and rediscover our sensual being.  And once you have found this simple mindset, you will see ways to make it happen all around you.</span>

                    <span>I love this book. I found it on a small interior design store in Italy,and It was love at first sight.I judged it by it's cover(and thought the idea of the velvet cover was great) but when I read it I was transported by its contents.Its absolutly great! Everyone should have it!</span>

                    <span>This book teaches us how to feel calm and organized, how to embelish and refine our senses with the best home arrangements.  I loved it!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When I first picked up The Sensual Home I was pleased.  The cover material feels like velvet and the cover photo of a cat at a window evokes a sense of peace and harmony.  However, the content is somewhat disappointing.   Although the photos are beautiful, the author presents rather basic,  commonplace knowledge regarding sensual elements used in home decorating.   In addition, the text type is not a standard font but an unusual print  style that is sometimes annoying and at odds with the beautiful  photography. The Database chapter  does give practical tips but in small  print that is again difficult to read.  This could be a better book if it  contained just more photos of the same quality as presented. It goes on the  coffee table.</span>
