                <span id="Label1">In the tradition of the Bungalow series, here is a marvelous celebration of the twentieth century's most delightful and whimsical  architectural style<br><br> <i>Storybook Style</i>, the rambunctious evocation of medieval Europe in  American housing, was born in the early 1920s and almost forgotten by the late  1930s. It took its inspiration from the Hollywood sets that enthralled Americans  of the period and that still appeal to our jaded modern eye. Half timbered and  turreted, pinnacled and portcullised, these houses owed their fanciful bravura  to architects and builders with theatrical flair, fine craftsmanship, and humor.  In <i>Storybook Style</i>, architectural information enhances the stunning color  pictures by Bungalow and Painted Ladies photographer Doug Keister to impart a  wealth of information and enjoyment.<br><br> Photography by Douglas Keister.</span>

                    <span>You know how it is---you wander into a bookstore, vaguely hoping for something at least interesting, but at heart, you want to find the magical, special book that will change your life. This was it for me: the most blissful collection of my favorite style , Storybook. (It's also known as Hansel & Gretel, fairytale or even Disney.) It flourished in the 1920's as a subset of Romantic Revival which also spawned Tudors and Mediterraneans with a few Norman towers thrown in.<P>But this----!!! Apartment courts, small houses, large mansions, all styled with whimsy and craftsmanship, all quirky and utterly adorable. Some are handmade, some are architect's designs but all have that sense of magic. Sarah Susanka's "Not So Big House" became a best-seller for advocating some of the principles which got lost in the shuffle of Depression era/Art Deco/Moderne style, such as human-scale coziness. (Note: HGTV's "Extreme Homes" sometimes shows Storybook houses, too, such as castles and cottages.)<P>Every page is a delight and a revelation, each picture is like a piece of fine chocolate. "Storybook Style" reminds me why it's important not to settle for less than perfection in our homes. <P>I'd give this book 10 stars if I could.</span>

                    <span>This is exactly the book I was looking for. I love this style home, but I never knew exactly how to describe it (or that it was even a 'true' architectural style). This book has not only given me some ideas about what I'd love to have in a home, but also made me aware that there are such homes in my area :) The pictures are really wonderful. A lovely book for anyone with a sense of whimsy.</span>

                    <span>My first impression of this book was that it was a trifle; once I started to read it though, I discovered it was surprisingly substantial. What a joy to look at these quaint medieval-inspired houses. Lots of them, and all those turrets! You won't find mention of this phenomenon in any of the popular books on house styles, and the author deserves credit for documenting it. <P>The book displays a professional knowledge of architecture, unlike many in this category which seem to be written by art historians, and you can rest assured the author will not confuse a mullion with a muntin, or claim, as another one once did, that Tudor is an early Rennaissance style. (Although he happens to be incorrect in saying "terra cotta" means "hollow tile"; it means "baked earth".) <P>No vacant catalog-esque prose here; the author knows his subject and enjoys telling others about it.</span>

                    <span>5 stars plus! A book to delight the heart! It's so well-written you don't want to stop reading, yet you want to see what delight awaits on the next page. My suggestion - page through and look at all the pictures - then go back and read it all. Great job - please do another one!<BR> These guys did a similar book called Red Tile Style, on spanish revival architecture - if you like this one, check it out- it's also very well done.</span>

                    <span>Idea books for cottages and cottage detailing don't get much better than this. This book tells the story of the emergence of the Storybook style in the early part of the 20th century-- a style that came right out of the fantasy world of Hollywood. In fact, many of the homes featured in this book were commissioned by the movie folk of this era. This is a larger format book-- and you'll be glad it is when you see the pictures!</span>
