                    <span>I read this book after devouring Gitta Sereny's wonderful biography on Nazi Armaments Minister, Albert Speer. This offering is superior to anything else on the Holocaust, bar none. Sereny spent many hours interviewing the Commandant of Treblinka, Franz Stangl. He reveals in dispassionate tones the horrors of this death camp: the subterfuge to confuse those arriving to the camp, the fake train station, the beautiful gardens... it's almost surreal to read this man's words. More disquieting is that Stangl appears to be rather normal, though obviously a psychopath since the concept of guilt is alien to him. He loved his wife, was a devoted father and was an attractive personality, yet he was involved in monstrous crimes.<P>Sereny also interviews Jews who survived Treblinka by working in the "clothes factory," and she also interviews some of the S.S. guards who presided over this horrific complex. But the heart and soul of the book is Stangl, whom she interviewed while he was in a German prison in 1972. When she asked him, "When you saw children about to be gassed, did you think of your own children?" Stangl vacantly looked away and said mutely, "I don't know." <P>This book should be required reading for those who deny the Holocaust or seek to make excuses for Nazi genocide. Sereny is a masterful writer and every word of this book is gripping. This is not a product to skim haphazardly, it's as engrossing as anything ever written about genocide in the 20th century. I can't recommend this book highly enough.</span>

                    <span>Often, the most frightening--and courageous--action we can take is to confront the truth about ourselves. Through Franz Stangl, commandant of the Nazis' Treblinka death camp, author Gitta Sereny reveals how the choices we make in our lives inevitably, and sometimes mercilessly, change us. And she shows us that the only way we can be at peace is to accept responsibility for them. <P> Sereny's is no mere biography of Stangl; instead, his life becomes the point of departure for a complex look at Nazi Germany, ordinary Germans (and Austrians, like Stangl), the workings of Treblinka, the escape and pursuit of Stangl after the war's end, and the Catholic Church's complicity in aiding Nazi war criminals. On this last subject, readers will especially appreciate Sereny's thoughtful and scholarly approach, as well as her persuasive conclusions regarding Pope Pius XII's curiously ambivalent behavior at the peak of the death camps' operations. Compare Sereny's analysis with the recent Vatican apology (of sorts), and judge for yourself which is the more credible account. <P> Throughout the book, Sereny manages to keep the focus on individuals and still retain the vast scope necessary to treat the Holocaust as a historical event. Stangl himself is presented as an ordinary man who made his Faustian pact and tried, like so many former prisoners of the camps, to move on and repress his feelings without processing them. His interviews with Sereny were ultimately as cathartic as they were therapeutic, and he died soon after their last meeting. <P> The impression we are left with at the end of "Into That Darkness" is one of tragedy as well as horror, for unlike a Goebbels or a Himmler or an Eichmann, Stangl could have been one of us. Sereny makes no apologies for Stangl; quite the contrary. But that's what makes this particular truth so hard to face.</span>

                    <span>Gitta Sereny was a British journo who had attended Franz Stangl's trial in 1970, and she had interviewed him in prison in Duesseldorf in 1971. She had also interviewed others, including survivors and keepers of Treblinka, as well as his wife and one of his daughters in Brazil. He was caught in 1967.<P>But just to be sure that the author's intense interest in this horrible subject left no doubt about her own conscience, she had made it clear to Stangl (and to her readers)...that she... "abhorred everything the Nazis had stood for and done."<P>It's a well written account of this SS Colonel's life and job, beginning with his involvement of the Nazi's euthanatia program, his first posting to Sobibor, his subsequent assignment as commandant of Treblinka, and his post war escape to Brazil via Italy and Syria. But the author digresses when she devotes 20 pages about the Vatican's probable Nazi sympathies. <P>We learn that Stangl was clever and practical in getting train-loads of people to shed their clothes and possessions and to walk into large "bath houses," complete with simulated sprinkler heads; and low volume ceilings to minimize the time of suffocation from the exhaust of the camp's 250hp diesel generator engine. <P>Curiously, we also learn that it took only a handful of real (home country) Germans to make Treblinka tick. The clever Germans in fact had delegated this killing business to this Austrian Stangl. And he in turn had recruited hundreds of Chekoslovaks and Ukrainians. Employed as guards, they would do all the dirty work. But they in turn would select healthy and strong arriving prisoners, called worker jews, and put them to work carrying the asphyxiated dead from the "baths" unto the open pit ovens, and then to shovel their ashes into holes dug into the earth. <P>The author is obsessed in finding out how and why an otherwise ordinary family man like this Stangl (and maybe all the other living Stangls in the rest of the World, and those yet to be born) could legitimize his conscience in being responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people and continue to live a relatively normal life. But it's an age old question and it doesn't get answered. Not here and probably not ever. Largely, because it's impossible to get into people's minds. <P>And for that matter, the author could as well have asked the Colonel of the Enola Gay why and how on August 6th, 1945 he was able to overcome his conscience and nuke Hiroshima, knowingly killing 50,000 mostly innocent men, women and children in 2 seconds.<P>Even today, we live in a World that has gone mad, but life goes on.</span>

                    <span>Potential readers should know that this book unjustly implicates the Vatican in the Jewish holocaust. Since this charge has no basis in historical fact, the assumption must be that the author harbors anti-Catholic sentiments. Anti-catholicism is outrageously prominent in Holocaust studies, and one is forced to wonder if this prejudice is motivated by non-academic considerations.<P>Aside from the virulent anti-catholicism, this is a solid work on the psychology of atrocity and the long hard road to penance.</span>

                    <span>This book would have earned five stars from me, but I think it came up short in places. First, I finished the book without feeling like I had really learned much about the workings of Treblinka, that mass factory of death that it was. The few chapters devoted to it barely scratched the surface, I think, giving us only a superficial glance. However, I do understand that since there were so few survivors, only so much could be told. Stangl did not help matters much, claiming ignorance of much of what went on there.<BR> Also, the way the author digressed only to focus on the implication of the Vatican was annoying. If I had wanted to read a book about that theme, I would have bought one of the several books on the market about that very subject. It was obvious the author had an axe to grind with the Church. <BR> Finally, there should have been more information about Stangl himself. (For several chapters in the middle of the book Stangl was never mentioned!) Again, in the author's defense, I guess, Stangl was not very open and forthcoming, making it hard for the author and reader to assess him. <BR> There is the invevitable comparison between this and "Death Dealer," the memoirs of the commandant of Auschwitz, Rodolf Hoess. I don't want to sound like I am giving a separate review for this book as well, but I will add that both Hoess and Stangl believed they were decent men who just happened to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hoess was more open and cooperative; Stangl was stubborn and evasive, yet an obviously more sophisticated figure. Both had the dignity to admit their guilt. <BR> Despite these few minor flaws, it is one of the better books on the Holocaust, and the author is excellent in her insightful, penetrating look into the mind of Stangl, his family, and other instrumental figures from that dreadful place and time.</span>
