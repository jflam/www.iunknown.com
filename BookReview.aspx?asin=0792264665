                <span id="Label1"><p>A British prime minister in Queen Victoria&#146;s England once dismissed Kilimanjaro as &#147;that mountain behind Zanzibar with the unrememberable name.&#148; Today, there can be few who don&#146;t recognize its most beautiful and evocative name. From the literature of Ernest Hemingway, from movies, and from a multitude of images, the world is familiar with the Elysian view of elephants and giraffes grazing against the shimmering backdrop of Kilimanjaro. Floating over the plains of East Africa, more mirage than mountain, Kilimanjaro exudes mystery and romance. At the same time, it is an accessible mountain, drawing more than 20,000 visitors each year to its slopes and snowy dome. The climb up Kilimanjaro has been likened to a journey from the equator to the poles, passing as it does through zone after zone of climatic change, from tropical forest to frozen desert. And Kilimanjaro&#146;s human history is no less rich than its natural history. Close to the cradle of mankind, the mountain has watched history unfold at its foot, from the earliest hunter-gatherers and the scramble of colonization to World War I battles and the wave of independence that swept Africa in the mid-20th century.</p> <p>In <i>Kilimanjaro: To the Roof of Africa,</i> accomplished mountaineer and writer Audrey Salkeld presents a comprehensive and awe-inspiring portrait of this noble mountain and its myriad facets. To be published in conjunction with the release of David Breashears&#146;s stunning new IMAX&#174; film about Kilimanjaro, this book is an extraordinary journey to the roof of Africa.</p></span>

                    <span>The Mountain Club of Kenya recently (and regrettably) acquired a copy of this book. Using the Club library, I read it and was shocked to see that some of the Club's photographs had been used to illustrate it (e.g. picture of Arthur Firmin); apparently without the Club's permission. National Geographic and Audrey Salkeld should be sued for copyright infringement.<P>Kilimanjaro is a much over-rated mountain. Serious mountaineers don't go anywhere near it unless they are herding the countless tourists up and down. It is filthy pig-sty and clients are forced to pay ridiculously high charges for the privilege of "climbing" (actually walking up) it.<P>Salkeld completely ignores this fact, as she ignores the fact that all the local guides on the mountain know absolutely nothing about mountaineering and what they do know is downright dangerous! She ignores the fact that 20-odd people a year die on the mountain; completely needlessly as they rush up too fast, trying to save some money on the outrageously high park fees charged daily by the authorities. She ignores the fact that on average, for every tourist (please don't call them "climbers", Salkeld), there are at least two "guides" or porters, collectively three times more people on the mountain than is necessary: rubbishing the environment, chopping down trees for fuel, eroding away at the trails, defecating in the water sources.<P>In short, Salkeld wrote a typically boring tome that poses as a coffee-table book. And National Geographic, supposedly a serious scientific and geographic society, published something akin to the worst papparazi tabloids.<P>I won't be buying this book.</span>

                    <span>I saw this book right after returning from a trip to Mt Kilimanjaro, and was amazed by the high fidelity of the images in the book. I believe it truly captures the essence of the moutain. The main risk related with this book is that, after reading it, you may find yourself dreaming with this moutain. It also contains an interesting introduction to the mountain's and the surrounding area's history.</span>

                    <span>Kilimanjaro, an African icon, is the only one of the seven summits that can be climbed by anyone, including children and senior citizens. This coffee-table book is a great choice for armchair travelers and anyone who wants to climb (or has climbed) Africa's highest mountain. The book documents the journey of a party of climbers who accompanied David Breashears and his team as they made an IMAX film about the mountain. Author Audrey Salkeld, who specializes in books about mountaineering, has assembled a great mix of Kilimanjaro ecology, geography, history, lore, and travelogue related to her climb. The story starts with East Africa's Chagga people and their legends, then moves to missionary Johannes Rebmann whose story of equatorial snow was met with disbelief, then on to the other explorers, and eventually the first (known) mountaineers who climbed the mountain. Several other authors contributed articles on the Kilimanjaro's relation to the Rift Valley, Missionaries in Africa, Elephants, Mountain Sickness, Film and Literature, Plants, Volcanic History, etc. Very well illustrated with color photographs and historical images, as one would expect from a book published by National Geographic.</span>

                    <span>Kilimanjaro is the highest point of Africa and therefore one of the "7 summits". But even without this statistical feature it is a place you should have visited to know what others mean when they call it a great place...<P>Kilimanjaro rises almost 5000m above the plains and offer climatic zones from the savannah to alpine glaciers, although the latter are melting quickly due to the global warming. Unique flora and fauna on the border of Tanzania and Kenya.<P>Well, David Breashears (known from the Everest IMAX and his book) has shot a new IMAX film on Kilimanjaro and this is the accompanying book.<P>Much information about the historic exploration of Eastern Africa and it's majestic summit; geological and biological contributions mixed with full page pictures and the trip report of the climb along the scenic Machame/Mweka route (with a variation through the Western breach).<P>'Kili' is one of the treasures of our earth and this book shows why. Too heavy for your backpack, but not to be missed on your coffeetable.<P>Ps: the book is 271 pages, not 31 as Amazon states!</span>
