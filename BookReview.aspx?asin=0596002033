                <span id="Label1">Apache is far and away the most widely used web server platform in the world. This versatile server runs more than half of the world's existing web sites. Apache is both free and rock-solid, running more than 21 million web sites ranging from huge e-commerce operations to corporate intranets and smaller hobby sites.  Updated to cover the changes in Apache's latest release, 2.0, as well as Apache 1.3, this useful guide discusses how to obtain, set up, secure, modify, and troubleshoot the Apache software on both Unix and Windows systems.  Dozens of clearly written examples provide the answers to the real-world issues that Apache administrators face everyday. In addition to covering the installation and configuration of mod_perl and Tomcat, the book examines PHP, Cocoon, and other new technologies that are associated with the Apache web server.  Additional coverage of security and the Apache 2.0 API make <i>Apache: The Definitive Guide</i>, Third Edition essential documentation for the world's most popular web server.</span>

                    <span>This is a fairly comprehensive, 600-page guide to the Apache web server software. The book begins with an overview of what a web server and browser clients do, how they work, and planning/installing Apache. The book covers versions 1.3.x and 2.0.x, and the differences between them. After installation, the next few chapters explain the initial configuration required to get a working webserver, including the various directives blocks, access control, and setting up virtual hosts.<BR> Chapter 5 discusses how to implement authentication, passwords, and more on access control, such as using .htaccess files. Following chapters describe how to change settings for various web filetypes, indexing, imagemaps, and redirection of web page requests. Chapters 9 and 10 explain using a proxy, and the multitude of logging and status options which can be configured.<BR> One of the longer (and important) chapters, Chapter 11, goes into excellent detail about the security aspects of running a webserver. It includes discussion and examples on signatures, certificates, using SSL, and firewalls. General security precautions, real life scenarios, and even potential legal issues are addressed.<BR> The next section goes over building and administering a large website, and the issues associated with that. Also there is a chapter on adding web applications to your site to allow flexible user interaction, such as forms submission. There are then several chapters regarding add-ons and extensions to get even more from the webserver. These include PHP, CGI, Perl, mod_perl, XML, and Cocoon. There are numerous examples of coding provided, although most of them are somewhat basic in nature. One subject that I thought should have been addressed more was integrating the webserver with a database (such as MySQL), as this is a very common requirement.<BR> The last two chapters go over the Apache Application Programming Interface (API), and how to write Modules for Apache. This may be useful to more serious developers, but is probably too technical and difficult for the average casual user. The book closes with a good Index and there is also a very handy foldout inside the back cover which contains quick-reference data for the most commonly used configurations and commands.<BR> Overall this book seems to "cover all the bases". It was useful to me as a beginner to set up a testing webserver, and yet has extra details and information for those more advanced webmasters. The quick reference section especially, should be very useful to experienced Apache users. I would highly recommend the book for anyone wanting to start or improve their knowledge in running the Apache webserver.</span>

                    <span>Just as an intro, I am likely to be biased towards this book because it does not cover topics that are particularly helpful to me at this time.<P>If you are a System Administrator, get this book. It will help you configure Apache down to great detail. If you are a programmer, get the online information. It is more up to date.<P>This book did increase my knowledge of security for Apache, as security is covered well in this book. It covers troubleshooting for both Unix and Windows (As if a Windows system is secure enough to run a web server) Systems.<P>As I am a programmer in the Java Language, I was disappointed to see that the authors pushed toward using scripting languages with Apache rather than full programming languages. This will limit what you can do with the Apache Server. This is a very sad commentary.<P>Also, being a programmer, I am more interested in the API's rather than the configuration of a Web Server. Now that the book is already outdated, the API's in the book are no good to me. So I use the API's provided with the Apache documentation. Not to mention, the authors recommend using Java 1.1. It has been several years since Java 1.2 has even been released. Did the authors do their research on Java before they printed the book?<P>This book covers the installation and configuration of mod_perl and Tomcat/j_serv, this was just fine for mod_perl (a scripting language), but did not help my cause, as I use Tomcat, and the authors are not very knowledgeable for Java based applications.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking at this book for information about Tomcat, DON'T! The information is out-dated and limited. The authors discuss Tomcat 3.2 because Tomcat 4.0 uses Java 1.2 and the authors state "...Java 1.2, is less widely available than Java 1.1..." This book was Published in December 2002. Java 1.2 was available in 1999, you do the math! This is unacceptable. I find it ironic that another book, "Professional Apache Tomcat," (WROX), which was published before new Apache book covers 4.0, even 4.1! It also appears, from the tone of the book, that the authors do not care much for Java and would rather the reader use Perl. <P>Do not buy this book if you want Tomcat information. Honestly for straight Apache information I would stick with the 2nd edition of the Apache book and use on-line resources. <P>Sadly O'Reilly books are lacking in quality lately.</span>
