                    <span>It contains practical detox recipes and instructions, muscle testing guidelines and easy to read charts. It goes into alternative therapies and yet, thankfully in my case, skips gem therapy.</span>

                    <span>The book did cover Clinical Kinesiology and related areas, but not at the depth that I had expected based on the other reviews of the book.  The authors presented "real" examples, but failed to follow up with corrective solutions for the "lay person".  Most of the solutions were "your muscle tested weak, see a professional for help".  I didn't expect the level of detail that is contained in the six Beardall books, but some corrective examples (like in the Touch For Health books) would have been appropriate.  Enough said, it was interesting reading.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very insightful and detailed. It is easy enough for laymen as well as the professional. I got a hold of this book after training in Applied Kinesiology (AK). After a long hard look it appears that this book is the only Clinical Kinesiology book in print. All others appear to be out of print. I would enjoy more published work based on the late Alan Beardall, D.C.. Also, I'd like to comment on the great section in the book on sub-clinical Candidiasis.<br>Truely a great book (especially for the cost).</span>

                    <span>This is a very well written and explained book.  It is worth buying.  It is well documented, scientific and no theological junk of the author is thrown in like so many other dissapointing books.  However, it does take an  investment in time and can be difficult for those who are not advanced  readers.  If you are just starting, start with "Your Body Doesn't  Lie".  Another great book, not so in depth and smaller but easier to  read.</span>

                    <span>Having had some personal experience with clinical kinesiology I find it  quite fascinating.  Strange as it all sounds it really works!  And it's a  positive alternative to traditional medicine.</span>
