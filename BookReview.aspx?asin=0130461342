                    <span>I had a hard time reading this book. It is good in the sense that I got some of the code working pretty quickly, but once I started to ask WHY things worked, I was lost with the book.<P>I had no idea about Web Services before reading this book. The book presents detailed information - which almost works - for 5 different implementations of SOAP-based Web-Services Plattforms. After which the example is depending on one special - non open source - plattform. Porting the code to AXIS was not straigth forward because I could not find out what the different statements in the example did.<P>I hope the next book on Web Services provides more useful information.</span>

                    <span>This book does not have any real-world examples. The specifications mentioned in this book are also dated. The content in this book is a little dated. For a current book on Web Services check out Java Web Services Architecture published by Morgan Kaufman.</span>

                    <span>This book has a random collection of topics. I cannot believe a publisher actually published it. It discusses DTDs and XSLTs in great detail while completely ignoring XML Schemas and SOAP basics. I absolutely decided to return the book when I found a section discussing viruses - specifically the ILOVEYOU virus. If Amazon provided a way to give this a negative rating, I would gladly do so.</span>

                    <span>Written for Java programmers, this new book in the DEITEL Developer Series applies their signature LIVE-CODE approach to Java Web services. Every important concept is presented in the context of fully tested programs, complete with syntax highlighting, detailed line-by-line descriptions and program outputs. The book features 103 LIVE-CODE programs that contain over 13,000 lines of proven program code. Thanks to the world renowned Sean Santry, the brains behind the book, the information is presented in a way that, for me, made learning a passion. My nights were spent in front of the fireplace with a cup of java in hand, broadening my knowledge in Java more than I ever thought possible. There's no faster way for experienced Java programmers to master Web Services development!</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I've seen that gives more than trivial examples of JAX-RPC and JAXM from the Java Web Services Developer Pack. It also gives excellent coverage of configuring the Java WSDP reference implementation for JAXM messaging providers, which is poorly documented by Sun. I wish this book had been published 8 weeks earlier; it would have saved me a lot of angst.<P>As with most other Java Web services books, its main drawback is that it is overly ambitious: it covers XML, DOM, XSL, SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, as well as Java WSDP, all in 700 pages. I would have preferred more in-depth coverage of Java WSDP. But it's still the best Java web services book I've seen.</span>
