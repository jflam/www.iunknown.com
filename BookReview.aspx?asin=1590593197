                    <span>Let me start by saying that I have no intention of being a game developer, but since I need .NET for my job, I thought this would be an interesting read. It doesn't disappoint at all.
<br />
<br />What stand out is the author's repeated advice that you need to "just do it" from end to end to understand the process of creating a game. I think that's true for most tasks in programming, but it's especially true here. There are a lot of basic concepts that apply to nearly all games, and it's funny because you begin to think about them when you play one!
<br />
<br />Clearly if you want to get deep into 3D math, you'll need another book, but this one gets you started at least with an understanding of the basic DirectX tools.</span>

The authors took a very difficult subject and made it easy to understand. After each chapter, you can code your own game with all the tips they gave you.<p>A must have if you want to start writing small games in C#.</span>

                    <span>Good book overall. However, the development flow was non-intuitive. The complete game source is not included in the book
<br />and the downloaded game code is a different version than 
<br />what's in the book. Also, the book has a lot of coding errors.

                    <span>In programming, one of the single biggest applications is games. The speed of a multigigahertz cpu, plus vast memory and disk space gives you a huge drawing board. Also, since games are a mass market, then you want to code for Microsoft PCs.
<br />
<br />In response, the authors show how Microsoft's .NET environment and C# programming within it can be used to make viable games. They start by conceding that the fastest twitch games, like Half Life 2 or Doom 3, can't really be effectively coded using the book's Direct X methods. But they point out that C# is certainly adequate for other types of games.
<br />
<br />The book walks you through very basic game algorithms. If you've programmed games before, many of these ideas will be familiar. Like the fundamentals of detection of collisions between 2 objects on the screen.
<br />
<br />Naturally, since visuals are crucial, space is devoted to constructing 3D objects and rendering them with various textures. Frankly, for the pure graphics, the book only touches on the algorithms. You will need another text devoted to the latter. But within the space constraints of this book, there is an admirable job of conveying how to write games in C#.</span>

                    <span>The first program I ever wrote was in 1984, being a text-based, command-driven NBA basketball game on an Apple IIe in BASIC.  My how games have progressed since.  Having said that, I'm strictly a web developer, and from behind the comfortable confines of the web browser is about where my programming acumen begins and ends these days.  But like most people my age (I'm 30) I grew up playing Nintendo and have long been a fan of video games.  
<br />
<br />Being a user and not a creator, I'd long wondered how such things were brought to life, and this book does a great job of showing just that for the newbie.  
<br />
<br />The code and concepts, despite the title, are fairly advanced, and not at all tutorial-driven, so not every line is described ad nauseum.  So an open mind is needed to let it sink in.  That having been said, the object-oriented nature and accessibility requirements for device hardware for modern video games is adequately described, with some very relevant games used as practical examples.  The purpose of, need for, and uses with, Managed DirectX 9 is very nicely done.
<br />
<br />The authors use a very friendly voice, and cite several well-known games as exhibits of the fundamentals they describe throughout the text.  For example, a Tetris offshoot is described in the book's initial chapter, demonstrating how such a simple game is likely a lot more complex in its design that you might realize, but simultaneously not as laborious as one might think.
<br />
<br />This book defines the major areas of concern for creating a great game, being that all elements within a good video game must exhibit some sort of (1) artificial intelligence, (2) spatial awareness, and (3) reactionary behavior in the event of collisions.  I also now know I'll probably never be a good games developer, as one should be very patient, be really, really, really good at math, and use some pretty advanced OOP/OOD concepts to create a good game.  
<br />
<br />Now being aware of the number of skills needed, algorithms with which to be familiar, and areas that are more deeply covered in other specialized books, this book won't allow you to create the next Quake, Grand Theft Auto 3 or Super Mario World right off the bat - but it will get you started.
