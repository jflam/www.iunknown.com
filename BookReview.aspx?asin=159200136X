                    <span>Just responding to a mistake by another reviewer. This book comes with an unmodified stock version of Torque, specifically version 1.2, downloaded from CVS on January 10, 2004. If you buy a Torque license (cost $100), you will be able to download that old version of the Torque source.
<br />
<br />>The book includes a pre-compiled version of the TGE, 
<br />>however it is not a stock version and no source code 
<br />>is included in the book, so the book's engine cannot 
<br />>be re-compiled or debugged. The TGE included in the 
<br />>book also has been modified by the book's author at 
<br />>the C++ code level. Therefore, it doesn't behave like 
<br />>the stock TGE in all respects.
<br />
<br />I have not read this book, and my rating is based on its reputation among Torque users. It is a good beginner book with occassional (minor) mistakes in the code.</span>

                    <span>But was is it?  To answer that I will first say what it's not: An all-in-one guide to 3d programming.  Far from it.  
<br />
<br />I would, however, say this book is *the* title to pick up if you are serious about making games using Garage Games' "Torque" engine (the engine behind the "Tribes" series).  This book *is* the definitive all-in-one beginners guide to creating 3D games with Torque.  I I have been making online games professionally for the last 5 years and I can tell you from experience that no single individual has a chance in the proverbial hell to achieve a high production value, AAA Massively Multiplayer title (which seems to be the first thing on many people's mind).
<br />
<br />MMO's are out of the grasp of 99.9999% of all indie developers.  Fun, exciting and *profitable* multi-player games, however are well within the reach of one or few indie developers.  The Torque engine gives you to the tools you need to develop a top-end multi-player 3D game.  There are a *lot* of issues to be considered in such a game, but most of them are gracefully handled by the Torque engine.  
<br />
<br />In this book you will learn how to harness the various tools within this engine... all in one book.  :)
<br />
<br />I wholeheartedly recommed this book and this engine for anyone with some programming background interested in making a game within a reasonable amount of time.  The engine is only $100 bucks (no royalties unless you make over a quarter of a million bucks on the game) with all of the source code, but you get a copy of the engine on the CD included with this book.
<br />
<br />Definitely pick this one up</span>

                    <span>Does anyone notice that this book is rather boring. I started off excited to learn something, but that wore off when I was forced to read page after page of code. The author never explained why there are certain files, or even what files are neccessary.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book about two months ago on the recommendation of the GarageGames.com site, which sells the Torque Game Engine upon which the book is based.  I also purchased the Torque Game Engine (TGE) at the same time from GarageGames.  I was hoping to use the book to learn the Torque Game Engine because the book uses the TGE as the basis for its tutorials.
<br />
<br />I quickly learned, however, that the TGE has many faces and that this book examines only a few of them.  For example, the TGE is a C++ based engine that must be compiled before it can be used to build a game.  The book includes a pre-compiled version of the TGE, however it is not a stock version and no source code is included in the book, so the book's engine cannot be re-compiled or debugged.  The TGE included in the book also has been modified by the book's author at the C++ code level.  Therefore, it doesn't behave like the stock TGE in all respects.  This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to run any other TGE samples from other sources using the book's TGE engine.  I ended up running one version of the TGE when using the book, and the other (stock) version of the TGE for all of my other learning experiences.  This makes for some confusing learning cycles.
<br />
<br />I thought I might be able to use the stock TGE to run the tutorials in the book, but I found out through experimentation that the tuturials depend on the custom code in the TGE that comes with the book.  Again, I was thwarted in trying to use the book to learn the stock TGE.  I really don't understand why the author chose to modify the TGE.  All of the tutorials in the book could have been built on a stock TGE.  In the end, I set the book aside for the most part and am learning the TGE from the GarageGames.com forums and from other resources on the net.
<br />
<br />I also had some issues with the code included in the book samples.  For instance, the Chapter 3 tutorials worked fine, but the Chapter 4 tutorials would not run at all on my computer, but froze up instead.  The audio libraries included in the book did not work on my computer, but I am able to use the stock audio libraries from the TGE just fine, so I assume this is some sort of bug in the author's compile.  I also had trouble with some of the demo software that came on the CD.  For instance, Milkshape 3D expired two days after I installed it, leaving me with no choice but to purchase a 3D modelling tool to complete the tutorials on modelling.  No big deal for me since I was planning to purchase Caligari Gamespace anyway, but it would probably upset less resourceful programmers.
<br />
<br />The upshot of this review is this: I don't think the book is going to be really helpful to folks who are trying to learn game programming with the TGE because it doesn't in fact teach game programming, it tries instead to teach TGE scripting, but is hampered in this effort by its own proprietary use of the TGE source code.  I recommend getting the stock TGE instead, and learning it through experimentation.  This book may occasionally assist that effort by example, but that's about it.</span>
