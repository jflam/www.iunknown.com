                    <span>I recently purchased the book "Girlfriends" by Jayne Wexler and Lauren Cowen for my girlfriend.  She had recently lost her best friend from childhood to cancer, so I thought the book would be theraputic for her.  I  couldn't have been more right!  She treasures this book.  The images  captured by Jayne Wexler are poignant and Lauren Cowen's words will  certainly strike a chord with any woman who has ever had or has a very  special friend.  I had purchased their earlier book, "Daughters and  Mothers" as a Mothers Day gift for my Mom and know how much it meant  to her.  Wexler and Cowen seem to have a keen insight into what matters to  women--and express it beautifully in both pictures and words.  Either of  these books would make a great gift for any woman.</span>

                    <span>This book has certainly become a treasure to my girlfriends and I.  Our dear friend Loretta had to leave us,  she died of cancer.  Her story is in this book on page 20.  Lauren Cowen and Jayne Wexler have done such a  supurb job recapturing her spirit on paper.  This tribute alone  indicates  the tenderness and compassion shown in their artistic talent for conveying  the everlasting bond of girlfriends.  Many of the stories contained in this  book remind us of our soul's thirst for love of our female friends.  Famous  or not, rich or  poor our needs are the same.Each story will touch your  heart.  Take my advice and cherish your girlfriends while they are here.</span>

                    <span>It is refreshing to see a coffee table book that has not only wonderful pictures, but inspiring stories.  Lauren Cowen has captured the essence of  the female spirit across the ages.  It exemplifies the many different sides  and interests of women.  All share the common bond of female camaraderie.   These stories depict real women who in their daily lives support each  other.  I was truly inspired by the group of women who courageously took  care of their dying friend.  Their bond with each other appears so strong  that it transcends death.  This would be an exceptional human interest  story to pursue.  These women are not famous, but truly rich in their  caring and compassion for each other.</span>

                    <span>From the moment I saw the cover I knew that "Girlfriends" would be a beautiful book to hold, peruse, read, and give as gifts to the women  in my life whom I call my bosom buddies. The photography is stunning and  evocative, the words reflective of what it means to be a female. Simple and  solid, "Girlfriends" reminds us of how little it takes to anchor  us in a commercialized world that suggests we need more.</span>
