                <span id="Label1">"""You don't need to be a grammar nerd to enjoy this one...Who knew grammar could be so much fun?"" -Newsweek  We all know the basics of punctuation. Or do we? A look at most neighborhood signage tells a different story. Through sloppy usage and low standards on the internet, in email, and now text messages, we have made proper punctuation an endangered species. In Eats, Shoots & Leaves, former editor Lynne Truss dares to say, in her delightfully urbane, witty, and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. This is a book for people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with."</span>

                    <span>When you hear that this book is about punctuation, you might think that it would be really boring.  I thought that too, but I really enjoyed this book.  I learned a lot about punctuation, and now I can point out common mistakes that people would not normally recognize as an error.  
<br />
<br />Lynne Truss is a very interesting author.  She made me want to learn about correct punctuation.  She has more of a sophisticated sense of humor, but if I can understand it, I'm sure you can too.
<br />
<br />I would really recommend reading this book.  Its very educational, and its also fun to read.  It clears up some of the confusing punctuation in the English language, and its just a quick, fun read. 
<br />
<br />WARNING: After reading this book, you might be looking closer at ads and writing to pick out punctuation misuse!</span>

                    <span>This was a quick and fun read.  If only the people who actually need to read this book would do so.  It drives me crazy when people puralize a word with an apostrophe before the s.  Didn't they pass second grade?  For her next project, maybe Lynne can write a book on basic grammar.  I develop an eye twitch when I get e-mails from my boss signed, "If you have any questions, ask Bob or I."  Grrrrr!
<br />
<br />I did think Lynne was too hard on people who write "it's" when they mean "its."  After all, this is an exception to a rule.  And in the same vein, it would not be illogical for "one's" to follow the "its" rule referred to above.  There are some gray areas and room for indulgence.  
<br />
<br />This may be an opinionated and sanctimonious post (and hypocritical if there are any errors), but Lynne really struck a nerve.  And apparently not just with me, either; it was heartening how hard it was to get a copy at the library.
<br />
<br />I would recommend at least reading this book, if not buying it.  It wouldn't be bad to have it on hand for reference.

                    <span>I head up a team of transcribers and proofreaders; we produce the online and printed versions of our pastor's teachings.  One of my proofreaders gave this to me as a gift, and from the moment I saw the title - and every time I read any of it - I laugh.  It conveys much of what the dry manuals attempt to, but they usually fail to relay the rules in a fashion that is to be remembered and later applied.  Lynne's book paints useful pictures, but what the reader gleans from it is up to them.
<br />I'm giving copies as gifts to my other team members!</span>
