                <span id="Label1">Given the legendary life of its subject, it's not surprising that <I>Mark Twain</I> is perhaps the most entertaining documentary Ken Burns has made. The creator of <I>The Civil War</I> and <I>Jazz</I> achieves reverent harmony with the magnificent story of Missouri-born author Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain), encompassing legend and fact with an exhilarating sense of adventure. Hailed by Hemingway as the originator of American literature, Twain (a nom de plume taken from a riverboat pilot's term for "safe waters") viewed himself as <I>the</I> American. Burns's film backs that claim as it follows Clemens's literary odyssey around the globe, from unrivaled acclaim as a writer to near destitution and the devastating deaths of his wife and three children. As usual, eloquent writers and scholars (including longtime Twain performer Hal Holbrook) provide a wondrous flow of anecdotes and observations, recounting Twain's remarkable humor while acknowledging a darker side that felt anger toward an indifferent god. Like all of Burns's films, <I>Mark Twain</I> is must-see viewing.  <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>I use this film every year in my American literature class to introduce my students to Mark Twain before they read Huckleberry Finn. My students stay glued to the television during the week that we watch the videos. I find it to be a far more effective introduction to Twain than I could ever give. And I love rewatching it every year. It never fails to make me tear up! This film brings Twain to life in a way that allows students to see him as a human being rather than as just another author to add to our list. </span>

                    <span>I know I rated this picture just one star, but I just wanted to be next to those who rated it the same. Ken Burns is a master story teller. If you want "just the facts" go to the library. I don't know why he catches flack from some people, but I guess it's their lose. It's hard to believe you could be so wrapped up in a story about any historical figure. I only wish my teachers and proffesors could have kept me this intrested. Amazing.</span>

                    <span>How many times can one man pan around a still photo?  We do not know yet.  Every K.B. documentary is as bland and self-glorifying as the last.  The voice overs, the predictable music, the lack of insight, the glossing over the dark side of every single topic.
<br />How much more can the American public take of this simplified, sanitized, sacchrine view of history?  We do not know yet.</span>

                    <span>It's very clear that this "musical biography" has been extremely well researched. Famous people often have multiple biographies, but very few have them turned into musicals. It takes a tremendous collection of talent to put together history, poetry (lyrics), music, costumes, staging, and acting into something like this. This video was shot during a live performance and yet there are close-ups and different camera angles which make for good TV. It's apparent that meticulous attention was paid to many details and it makes for a wonderful viewing experience. I found myself enjoying the parts of Twain's life I already knew about and also learned a few new things. The large production numbers are very entertaining and some of the individual performances are spectacular -- some of the solos are captivating. The music itself is very well done and it's surprising that this musical doesn't find its way to production companies around the country. This is a very entertaining way to get some history about this amazing person without your typical "documentary" flatness.</span>

                    <span>Before I watched this DVD, I thought I was going to learn some biographical facts about Mark Twain with images, but I got a lot more.  Mr. Burn's poetic touch to Mark Twain's life was like a marriage between art and the story of the greatest American writer.  Mr. Burn's style of telling the story is very cinematic with well chosen sound tracks (a lot of good quality photos).  It captivated me through out the whole 3 hour of it, which is divided into 2 parts.  <p>The DVD also shows the commentaries and interpretations of Mark Twain's work by present American writers.<p>It can't be better!!  I am also going to check out Mr. Burn's other works.</span>
