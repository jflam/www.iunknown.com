                    <span>I was completely new to hanging molding. This book will cover what you need in order to cut crown molding (molding closest to the ceiling), however, do not expect to learn how to chair rail or baseboard molding correctly. In my opinion, theis book, "touches" on the subjects, thus not providing enough info to get your job done as efficently as possible. <p>To restate the point on crown molding: This book will teach you a mathematical formula so you can hang ANY size crown molding correctly. <p>All in all, there are about 6 pages in this book that helped me out a bunch, but its definately not worth the buy. The book is EXTREMELY OUTDATED! They speak of Pnuematic nail guns (no one uses them anymore.) In addition, a COMPOUND MITER SAW will get your job done in a snap as compared to using a POWER box or POWER saw.<p>Craig savage came out with a DVD this year (2004). I'm going to purchase it and see if its any help.<p>David</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of Fine Homebuilding and Fine Woodworking so I figured this was a great opportunity to capture some very useful information on "how to" (as the book is billed) install trim work.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  The book's articles are dated (pneumatic nail gun review from several years ago!) and not all apply to trim work.  To make matters worse, there are not too many detailed tips to actually use.  Just short articles which merely touch on the subjects.  Definitely not worth the money if you're looking for any sort of ideas or lessons on finish carpentry.</span>
