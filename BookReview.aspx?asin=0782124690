                    <span>I have finally found a book that progresses at MY rate. I find that other "Teach Yourself" books usualy stick to basics for 50% of the book, and then dable on a couple of advanced features of VB. Hence you usualy can't use a "Teach Yourself" book as a reference guide, even if they do give you somewhat of a solid base in VB.<P>THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT!!! It explains concepts concisely, clearly and with interest (not dry). This means that many concepts can be conveyed in the shortest space of time. This also allows the reader to progress very quickly to in depth advanced features, which is great if you are already familiar with VB, or other languages. <P>Because of the in depth coverage of advanced VB features, the book is also a very good reference guide. Because the book is so cheap, it must be one of the best investments a person, or company, can have.<P>There are only a small number of drawbacks to the book. Most of these drawbacks occur due to the fact that that several books are combined into this book. This means that various writing and code styles appear which takes a little getting use to.<P>This is definitely one of the GOOD books!!</span>

                    <span>Microsoft has created, deliberately or otherwise, an aftermarket of books that supplement its product documentation: Microsoft, like the traditional computer programmer, seems as a corporation to hate documentation. It now ships manuals on CD and is moving towards placing documentation on the Web, and its help systems are difficult to use. Microsoft deserves thanks from the trees that surround its Pacific Northwest headquarters for not printing manuals, but the new modes of documentation can be difficult to use and distracting.<P>So it's hard to select books on Visual Basic because of the number of offerings.<P>I recommend this book because it's inexpensive and earth-friendly, being printed on lower-grade, apparently recycled newsprint. Don't worry about the permanence of the paper, for it is likely that Visual Basic 7 will render this book useful as a door stopper, or as an anchor for a very small boat. <P>You won't curl up with this baby and read it from cover to cover (unless you're even stranger than me.) It is instead a good book to keep at the office. I recently used it to call the Windows Registry API interface and this book worked fine. <P>The Internet is somewhat overkill for, for example, finding out the syntax of an API call, for the hyperdimensional quality of the Internet, combined with a low span of attention, finds the programmer, who just wanted to find out why his DLL is not registered, scanning www.threeStooges.COM instead. An old fashioned book without much glamour helps to focus on the task at hand, known in some circles as work, and in others as RTFM (Read The Fool Manual.)<P>One issue is the anonymity of the authors. I do hope that this is not a trend. People like to form an image of the author of a book and SOMEBODY wrote this. If it is a bunch of guys in Belarus, let us know who they are. Everybody deserves his 15 minutes of fame.</span>

                    <span>For my introduction to today's Basic (no longer all caps, I note) and my re-education in programming, I found this to be the best value if you already have the Basic 6 program. If you haven't you might want to try one of the other books, such as Practical Visual Basic 6 by Bob Reselman and Richard Peasley which includes a disk with the Working Model Edition of Microsoft's Visual Basic 6. Professional programmers of course will want to buy the full-blown Visual Basic, but even they might find this manual handy.<P>I came from the environment of the line numbered GW Basic and even "Shingo" Basic after taking a class in Basic programming at the local junior college in the late eighties. After that I learned QuickBasic on my own. QuickBasic was a programming language developed from Basic that incorporated the structured programming techniques and some of the commands and ideas used in more professional languages like C, and I forget what else. I wrote some moderately complicated programs of eight or nine hundred lines and then I didn't do any programming for years. When I returned a couple of years ago I discovered that what was now the state of the art for the amateur programmer was Visual Basic. I took a look at the program (a stripped down version that came with Word Perfect) and was absolutely flabbergasted. I could not figure out how to even begin writing a program!<P>So I went to the bookstore and found several shelves of Basic books. I tried one (I don't recall the title) but found it so lacking in information and guidance (for the price) that I actually took the book back the next day and got a refund. Some other books were entirely too advanced and too specialized for my needs. Then I tried this generic title, and with help from doing the exercises in Reselman's and Peasley's book, it brought me up to speed in Visual Basic enough to write a program to keep track of some stock market data that I was interested in.<P>What this book does not do that I wish a Visual Basic book would do is include an equivalence table in which the old commands from the world of QuickBasic are paired off with the new commands, and a one-for-one comparison of the old and new ways of doing things. This would be very handy for those of us who learned our Basic some years ago. I looked around for such a book but without luck.<P>Fortunately many things have not changed. The random number generator works the same, for example. The techniques and commands for using sequential files, for another example, are vitually the same. The really startling changes are in the way information is presented on the screen. If you're like me and haven't done any programming lately, you will probably find yourself facing a brand new learning curve here.<P>This book begins with an introduction to Visual Basic 6 and the concept of object programming in Part I, followed by practical guidance in Part II, and then in Part III introduces the reader to scripting and using Visual Basic for Internet programming. Part IV is Visual Basic for Applications, which I didn't get to, and Part V is a reference. The various chapters are taken from other Sybex publications such as e.g, Steve Brown's Visual Basic 6 In Record Time.<P>In the old days, the "quick and dirty" way to really learn a programming language was to jump right in with a project and get it to work. However, like the "spaghetti code" techniques of old, such an approach will not work well if one wants to write complex programs. So I found that there is no substitute for laboriously learning a significant portion of the commands and techniques before actually trying to write a program. Writing small programs guided by experts is the best way, and that is why I do not recommend any single book for the beginner. I recommend instead that this book be purchased as complement to another book, again Practical Visual Basic 6 mentioned above would be adequate. That way if one explanation or guidance is not entirely clear, you can have the advantage of another writer's approach.<P>Bottom line is the Visual Basic program itself, a way to interface and develop programs in concert with Microsoft's Windows that will astonish you with its power. Or at least it astonished this old weekend programmer.</span>

                    <span>for its price, and the amount of information provided, this book is an absolute must have for anyone who does any sort of visual basic programming. while it does skim over some of the more advanced topics in some places, it does what most other visual basic books do not - provides the reader with an awareness of the advanced topics so that they can then decide whether they wish to pursue those subjects further. with example programs that can be downloaded from the Sybex website ... and heaps of explanations and exercises within the book, it will take you to a whole new level of visual basic expertise.</span>

                    <span>If I had looked closer, I would have realized most of the book exercises work ONLY if you have at least the VB 6 product and resources, rather than the VB CCE 5 free version I have. I was unable to follow along hands-on with most of the exercises, so that made this book INCOMPLETE for me and a waste of money. I found it's a little skimpy on some important subjects; for example, developing menus through Menu Editor. A better way I found for myself, and it's FREE, is to register as a Microsoft Developer and go onto the website for lots of real hands-on interactive tutorials including plenty of pictures and examples. Cover a tutorial, notebook paste it if you wish, then experiment with your VB platform. My niece is a top level software executive and she told me to just get in there and code, make mistakes and try it again. I was in the computer industry for a decade, and I agree with this hands-on approach. But I think the RIGHT books, together with hands-on, can facilitate learning. Don't just assume a book is going to be right for you by the ratings here. The RIGHT book should include all of the detail without having to resort to outside resources. I have adjusted my grade for this book to C.</span>
