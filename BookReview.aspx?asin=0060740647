                    <span>"Running Money" is a fast-moving account of the fast riches that Andy Kessler made during the high-velocity go-go days of the late-90s tech bubble. The former Wall Street semiconductor analyst takes the reader through the ups and downs (but mostly ups) of Velocity Capital, the tech-focused hedge fund that he and Fred Kittler founded in 1996.
<br />
<br />"Running Money" is a combination of economic theory, investing vignettes, and Silicon Valley anecdotes. Kessler doesn't delve into the details of running a hedge fund, but focuses instead on the big picture. An early chunk of the book is dedicated to recounting the evolution of the market for steam engines. And an interesting chapter late in the book -- "Why It's Imperative to Drive a Beemer" -- discusses America's trade deficit and "margin surplus."
<br />
<br />"Running Money" hardly lets the reader be a "fly on the wall" of a hedge fund. The business aspects of running a fund -- marketing, legal issues, risk management, etc. -- are barely addressed in this book. The devil may be in the details, but Kessler's strength is telling a high-velocity story at a very high level. "Running Money" is a fun little read, but certainly shouldn't be considered "required reading" for any serious audience.</span>

                    <span>Quite a disappointing work from Andy Kessler.  Yes, he succesfully ran a long-only fund and made a bunch of money for his investors and himself, but please don't confuse the luck with the talent - anyone who happened to buy a dot-com stock in 1996 and happened to sell in the early 2000 would have achieved similar or better return on investment (this is not to say that he's not a talented investor, it's just his track record doesn't prove much).  As far as his new economic theory - i.e., "it's really different this time" - it's a bit naive and superficial.  I found a bit annoying the fact that he belittles other hedge funds, companies and investors in Silicon Valley, and even some of his own clients! </span>

                    <span>I read a LOT of financial storybooks, and this one is nothing exceptional:  the author seems more interested in historicaly references than factual tales of beating the bushes for clients and investment ideas.  Sometimes felt as if I was re-reading a history book versus a financial tale, which is what I expected to be buying.
<br />
<br />Nothing Special.</span>

                    <span>Mr Kessler has shared his thoughtful analysis of the creation and spread of wealth in an easy to read format.  He writes in simple terms, and thus simply communicates some concepts that are truly deep and thoughtful.
<br />
<br />He does not feel the need to demonstrate his intelligence (already well proven by his track record in technology as well as investing) to the reader, as many do, and thus communicates effectively.
<br />
<br />This is one of my favorite books of all time.  A literal "page turner" analyzing and explaining such normally boring topics as wealth creation and investment strategies, with an emphasis on the digital revolution of the late '90's, and suggestions on lessons learned from this time period to aide in 21st century investing.
<br />
<br />Great book.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Although "Running Money" is peppered with the same brand of sophomoric humor that permeated Kessler's first book, "Wall Street Meat", this book clearly has intellectual pretensions, with Kessler repeatedly adopting a professorial tone to air his views on America's massive trade deficit, among other things.  Sadly, this is the book's major weakness.  Kessler's core competency is as a raconteur, not a thinker.  When he tries to style himself as a thinker, he inevitably embarrasses himself.
<br />
<br />For instance, he contends that America's trade deficit should not be a cause for concern, as it is the natural result of the developing world's competitive advantage as a producer of low-margin goods (which are subsequently imported into America).  If the trade deficit is really so worrisome, shouldn't America become a producer of low-margin goods in order to curb its imports?, Kessler asks with a touch of sarcasm.  This is patent nonsense, of course.  The problem is that, like a spendthrift consumer racking up too much credit card debt, America is importing goods from abroad and incurring alarming amounts of obligations to foreigners in the process.  Nobody is suggesting that America take the extreme and atavistic step of nurturing its low-margin industries in order to rectify this problem; rather, America should live within its means.  I could go on, but Kessler's gaffes are too numerous to list.
<br />
<br />Kessler's self-deprecating style partially redeems his many blunders - but perhaps there is truth in jest.  Like many others, he simply went along for the ride during the bull market of the late 1990s, leaving me with the impression that the stellar performance of his fund was nothing more than dumb luck.  "Don't confuse brains with the bull market", he admonishes when describing other high-flying but incompetent fund managers who eventually got their comeuppance.  Ironically, Kessler would do well to apply those words of wisdom to himself.</span>
