                <span id="Label1">The Restless Northwest provides a brief, easy-to-follow overview of the geologic processes that shaped the Northwest.  <P>One of the attractions of the Northwest is its varied terrain, from the volcanic Cascade Range to the flood-scoured scablands of eastern Washington and the eroded peaks of the northern Rockies. These vast differences are the result of a collision of the old and the new. The western edge of Idaho was once the edge of ancient North America; as eons passed, a jumble of islands, minicontinents, and sediment piled up against the old continental edge, gradually extending it west to the present coastline.  <P>Figuring out how and when these various land forms came together to create the Northwest took much geological detective work. Unlike many geology books that focus on rocks, The Restless Northwest emphasizes the human drama of geology. The narrative is sprinkled with firsthand accounts of people involved in the exciting geological discoveries made in recent years.  <P>Hill Williams uses an informal conversational style to explain complex processes to a general readership. He enlivens the story of long-ago geologic events with fascinating asides on everything from enormous undersea tube worms to the Willamette meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States. Interested readers will discover much about Pacific Northwest geology without getting bogged down in an overabundance of details and scientific terms.</span>

                    <span>"The Restless Northwest" by Hill Williams is a well written commentary on those fundemental processes responsible for shaping our Pacific Northwest. Hill's straight-forward style of presenting technical subjects makes the book an excellent source of geologic information, particularly for the casual reader. His depth of understanding of complex processes and ability to explain them in a manner comprehensible to most readers is commendable. With numerous simple diagrams together with easily understood discussions, he has clearly explained such technical processes as plate tectonics, geologic terranes, the great floods from ancient Lake missoula and many others. Willams has a knack for accurately converting complex sientific data to a form well understood by the general public. I have read a number of books that attempt this challenge and in my opinion "The Restless Northwest, a geologic story" is one of the best of its kind.</span>

                    <span>Retired Seattle Times Science Writer Hill Williams has hit a home run with this book. His easy-to-read style takes the reader by the hand and leads him through the thousands of years of geologic upheaval that formed the breathtaking scenery in present day Washington, Idaho and Oregon. <P>Williams is intimately familiar with his subject matter, writing and researching the Northwest for nearly 40 years with the Times, and he passes this on the knowledge to the reader in a way that is easy to understand. <P>This is not a book for professional geologists, full of technical jargon. This book is written for anyone who has ever looked at Steamboat Rock, the rolling Palouse, the Columbia Gorge or the remains of Mt. St. Helens and said "Wow. I wonder how...."<P>As a lifelong resident of Washington, I have always known how incredibly special and beautiful this area was. Until I read Williams' book, however, I had no idea how this beauty was created. Page by page, it was revealed to me with easy to grasp explanations and illustrations. I would recommend this book very highly to all who consider themselves curious.</span>
