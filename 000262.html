<h3 class="title">My Other Life</h3>

<P>I spent the years from 1986 through 1995 studying <A href="http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/gradinfo/research/organic.html">Organic Chemistry</A> at the <A href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</A>. Why the life change? In the middle of 1986, as I was preparing to graduate from <A href="http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/agincourtci/">high school</A>, I was very unhappy with the state of software development. Remember, however, that I worked on Commodore computers, programming various incarnations of the venerable <A href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/zone5/cat440/3443.htm">MOSTEK 6502</A> microprocessor. From 1979, when I first laid hands on a Commodore PET at <A href="http://www.gbrownc.on.ca/campuslocations/index.html">George Brown College</A> in Toronto, through 1986 <EM>nothing had changed</EM>. Sure, I had color graphics and 64K vs. 8K of RAM. Sure, I had a 1541 floppy disk drive vs. a tape drive. But that improvement wasn't even an order of magnitude. Contrast that with the change in PC technology from 1994 through 2001!</P>
<P>So, to protest the lame state of affairs in my little corner of computing, I decided to do something completely different. I decided to study chemistry at the University of Toronto. I had a lot of fun during those years. I accumulated my three degrees, and my mom is very happy that I'm a Doctor. I learned a lot of transferable life skills during those years as well: the ability to think critically, the ability to communicate both in writing and in the classroom, and the dangers of basing your work on untested assumptions. </P>
<P>During this time, I actually spent very little time working on computers. Sure, I used them to type up reports and perform calculations, but I spent very little time actually writing software. To be fair, towards the end of my Ph.D., I got the bug again and wrote some software to automate the pH-stat in our lab, and to analyze NMR spectra on PCs. </P>
<P>So, what did I actually do during my time in Chemistry? I worked in <A href="http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/people/academic/klugerr.html">Professor Ronald Kluger's</A> lab from 1990-1995, where I figured out the detailed mechanism of the fragmentation reaction of a model thiamin adduct: hydroxybenzyl thiamin. If you're interested in this stuff, check out&nbsp;my <A href="/Files/THESIS2.pdf">Ph.D Thesis</A>. </P>

<p>Well it's about time somebody did!</p>

<p>Hey John, I really enjoyed your presentation at VSLive in Toronto on May 5, 2004.  I also really enjoyed chatting with you during the bus tour.</p>
