                <span id="Label1"><p><i>User Interfaces in VB. NET: Windows Forms and Custom Controls</i> goes beyond simple coverage of the Windows Forms and GDI+ namespaces by combining a careful treatment of the API with a detailed discussion of good user-interface design principles. After reading <i>User Interfaces in VB. NET: Windows Forms and Custom Controls</i>, you'll know how to design state-of-the-art application interfaces, program graphics, and much more. </p> This book contains the following:  <ul> <li>An overview of how to design elegant user interfaces the average user can understand <li>A comprehensive examination of the user interface controls and classes in .NET <li> Best practices and design tips for coding user interfaces and integrating help </ul> <p> Although this book isn't a reference, it does contain detailed discussions about every user interface element you'll use on a regular basis. But you won't just learn how to use .NET controls&#151;you'll learn how and why to extend them with your own custom controls. As a developer, you need to know more than how to add a control to a window. You also need to know how to create an entire user interface framework that's scalable, flexible, and reusable. </p></span>

                    <span>I'm a fairly new programmer in vb.net(finished vb.net II) and I found this book to be VERY good.  Yes it is very theory intensive but the examples it gives are fairly straight forward and if you aren't the world's best programmer they show you how to make controls to make some really slick looking programs.<p>There are a few .net 1.0 examples that will not work in the new 1.1 (notably the xp theme visualizations) but this book is well worth it if you are interested in making some "professional" looking forms for your application.</span>

                    <span>For someone who has already used other languages for GUI design, this is a great book to get quickly up to speed in the .Net view of Windows forms. It didn't cover everything in enough detail for me but good enough to get me started. I would of liked more on data grid (how about a whole book on it as it's complex enough) and context menus but I eventually figured it out on my own. I could go for an advanced version of this book too.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be excellent. It isn't 100% comprehensive, but it is full of real, practical code and suggestions for using controls. It's the only book I've found that dealt with the treeview, listview, and imagelist in enough detail. Particularly noteworthy are the descriptions on how to create custom controls based on these controls that have built-in application meaning. For example, the book explains how to create a treeview that has a hard-coded "structure" and exposes custom methods for adding/navigating your type of data. Similar advice is given with validation, drag-and-drop, form inheritance, MDI workspaces, and data binding strategies. Basically, the book is a solid guide to mastering .NET controls. Note that this book isn't the best place to learn GDI+. Although there are two excellent chapters on the subject and the basic charting control, both Apress and Wrox provide dedicated GDI+ books that focus more closely on custom drawing. <p>Probably the best example in the book is the document-view architecture with the print preview--simple, elegant, and worth the trouble. Overall, high-content, well-written and genuinely **USEFUL**!</span>

                    <span>Don't get me wrong, this book contains a lot of useful info but its just not enough. This has a little sentence saying Expert's Voice on the top. I would assume that if it is the expert who is writing a book it would be more interesting. This book needs more code and less theory. Book about a user interface should contain more of GDI+ instad of a gradient label and hot track button, which is the thing that absolute beginners of GDI+ controls start with. I dont really recommend buying this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is about the details of form building. It is not about the details of backending a form to a database or website.  It has a very specific remit and if you are not an experienced VB.Net programmer you could be badly caught out here. This is not a book to cut your UI building teeth on.  There are introductory texts to do that.  It is also not a UI design book. So don't expect lashings of advice on usability theory, design and test. They are just not here.<p>The focus on the book is on form controls creation and the various arcana in .Net that support them.  Many interesting and useful topics are raised in the book (there is an overlap between some of these and the coverage in other books, e.g. MDi and GDI+). However, the extent to which they will generalise for the 'average' programmer is another question.  I am not convinced that the book has sufficent novel content over an above other more general texts of the market.<p>Unless you specifically need detail about form controls, form splitters, personalised system trays etc, this book may be overkill. A good deal of topics in the book is covered in Deitel and Deitel (and more besides),and Balena.  So if you are learning VB.Net be careful in your choice.</span>
