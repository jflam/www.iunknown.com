                <span id="Label1"><p>This new edition of <I>Database Modeling & Design</I> continues to focus on the techniques for relational database design introduced in previous editions, starting with the entity-relationship (ER) approach for data requirements specification and conceptual modeling. Author Toby Teorey then looks ahead to the common properties in data modeling and operations shared among the relational model and advanced database technologies such as the object-oriented, temporal, and multimedia models. A full chapter is devoted to database design techniques for data warehousing and online analytical processing (OLAP).<br><br><p>Teorey covers the database life cycle from requirements analysis and logical design to physical design for local, distributed, and multidatabases. The discussion of basic principles is supplemented with a common, running example: a company personnel and project database based on real-life experiences and classroom testing.<br><br><p>Written for both the novice and the professional database designer, this book is the essential resource for database modeling, including the building of standard SQL data definitions. The design rules set forth in this book are applicable to any SQL-based system, including IBM DB2, Oracle V8.0, Informix IDS-UDO, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise.<br><br>* Continued focus on relational model<br>* Integration of information about data warehouse and OLAP, plus other advanced database technologies, including object oriented, multimedia, and temporal database<br>* Discussion of basic principles is supplemented by examples based on real life cases</span>

                    <span>I have experience on commercial website databases with 10000+  users per month, and picked up Teory's book to look for a primer or for some pointers.  I am fairly frustrated in trying to get through this book to find straightforward explainations.<p>Alot of database design is common sense.  When looking through most DB books, this common sense understanding of database design is blocked by jargon loaded walls of words.<p>Excerpted example of befuddled writing:<br>"Analyze redundant relationships carefully.  Two or more relationships that are used to represent the same concept are considered to be redundant.  Redundant relationships are more likely to result in unnormalized tables when transforming the ER model into relational schemas.  Note that two or more relationships are allowed between the same two entities as long as the two relationships have different meanings.  In this case they are not considered redundant."  (page. 50, 3rd ed.)<p>That was an example of the paragraphs that wastes my time, and irks me to want to tear my hair out.  Shall we posit that: 'the expository text therein displayed above for the reader is an example of the endemic pomposity of academic writing that conveys ideas in a form that is far from concise; nay, in fact in a form that is too wordy.'  Or am I being redundant?<p>I have no wish to be too harsh, it does have some valuable DB knowledge at an academic level.  It is to be lauded for being a computer book on a substantial topic weighing under 400 pages.  But please: to DB & academic writers out there -- drop the pretension, and cut down on your verbiage, and get to the point in a plainly said style.<p>[The ratio of : (words of Jargon)/(practical information conveyed) = the average overcharge submitted by the job title in question, and the artificiality of the barrier to becoming a competing member of that profession.]</span>

                    <span>PREAMBLE: I have experience with creating small DBs in Access and basic SQL and have been a business user of DBs for many years. I am knew to the DB modeling and design world and was looking for an introductory text on conceptual & logical DB modeling. I consider myself a novice.<p>The GOOD: Chapters 1-5 are done well. The book does a good job of introducing the reader to the Entity-Relationship(ER) model approach using the Chen notation and its extensions. It also does a good job explaining how ER modeling can be applied to a database life cycle, in particular, requirements analysis, conceptual and logical modeling. Also, the transformation of the ER model elements to SQL constructs and the process of DB normalization are explained well. The "real-life" case study helps with the explanations. The book provides an extensive list of literary references. <p>The BAD: From Chapter 6 and on. It started reading like an academic literature review of all advanced database related topics like Data warehousing (DW), Object-Relation DB(ORDB), and Object-Oriented DB (OODB), OLAP. The topics were covered in a cursory manner and then the reader is directed to the referred reading list for more information. Also, the book becomes much more academic on how the DBMS deals with the physical elements like access methods, indexes, data allocation, execution times, etc. These topics are way to technical for the novice DB user. The book does not really provide any real in-depth informaton on DB modeling and design for the other DB structures/tools discussed (DW,ORDB,OODB,OLAP).<p>CONCLUSION: The primary reason for the "2 stars" is the misleading commentary that this book would be useful to the novice designer. This book is not for a DB novice, but for intermediate-advanced DBA/Architect/Modeler. Overall, I found the book tries to cover too many topics and in the process diluting all the topics. Leaving the reader with the feeling of not really learning that much. If you are an intermediate-advanced DB user then I can see the book being useful in providing a roadmap to the DB literature while providing a basic introduction. Books of this nature should not try to tap both sides of the experience spectrum; pick one and then stick to that level.</span>

                    <span>This book gives you guidelines on how to design a database.  These guidelines do not assume that you know anything about databases, but do assume that you have lived through at least one major development project before.  This is not a quick-start "how to" book, nor will it explain how to use relational database software; the guidelines are more along the lines of "Classify multivalued attributes as entities," and "Attach attributes to the entities they most directly describe." <p> The exercises were useful and informative, and the author presents the material in a concise and clear way, free of typographical silliness or excessive personal familiarity, neither of which would contribute in any way to the material.  The style is, roughly, 10% textbook, 90% cookbook.</span>

                    <span><br>Yes it's dry. It's database modeling. What did you expect? :)  That's what I like about the book though. It is very concise and to the point.  I think it makes a great reference book when designing databases.  It is  database specific though.  Not much help on how to use a correct database  design from a real-world application. <br></span>

                    <span>I have no formal schooling in programming, but find myself having developed one major database application and about to embark on another larger project.  I bought the book because I wasn't sure if my intuitions about database design were the right intuitions.<p>Given what I was looking  for, the book was excellent.  It described (perhaps in dry language) the  theoretical underpinnings of a well designed (or normalized)  database.<p>Also, the book gave me the proper smybolic and linguistic tools  to tackle the task of DB design in a more organized and effecient  process.<p>In short, it turns out there are very strict rules about what  makes a database a well designed database.  Given that previously I was  designing on intuition alone, I found this book an excellent developmental  tool.  There were a few things I was doing wrong that I won't do  again!<p>By the way, there are 2 chapters in the book that most people  won't use.  Or rather, if you need these chapters you probably don't need  the other chapters.  These are the chapters on geographically distributed  database applications and the chapter on how the physical implementation of  the database in memory can relate to query optimization.</span>
