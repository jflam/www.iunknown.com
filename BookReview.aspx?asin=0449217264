From the near-forgotten past, to the highly technological present, from self-defense to self-determination, here are the men and women who tried to tame the land, seize its bounty, and lay claim to the elusive spirit that holds native and visitor spellbound. A stirring portrait of a human community living on the edge of the world, ALASKA claims a bold heritage of survival against all odds.<br>"Michener has done a fine job....Few will escape the allure of the land and people he describes."<br>LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK REVEIW<br></span>

                    <span>When I was about 12 my mother told me that she was tired of buying me Hardy Boys books which I would whiz through in about an hour. Books had starting climbing in price and it was getting pretty costly. So I asked my mom what she wanted to do for a solution. She produced a book that had to be almost 2 inches thick to my young eyes. The title was Alaska. I was quite intimidated by the size of the book but since I was a bookworm I decided to try Mr. Michener out. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. James Michener's impeccable research methods and character developments were genius. I had finally found a favorite author. I've read several of his books since. His books require a lot of time of course. Right now I'm working on Chesapeake. But, I will never forget Alaska. I'll remember the Tlingit, the stories of the pelt salesmen, the Yukon, etc. Michener makes historical fiction far more enjoyable than one would imagine.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading Alaska. The way Michener always goes into such detail explaining his characters and their struggles is very interesting. The descriptions of the land made me feel like I was right there with all of his characters. It gave me a whole new outlook on the state. I always thought of Alaska as just a cold place but he showed me in his writing how beautiful the state really is. I always learn about the history of the places he writes about. My mother's uncle went to Alaska during the gold rush, hoping to make his fortune so I was able to associate with that part of the novel. I would recommend this book for reading because it is a very enjoyable book to read as well as a lesson in history and geography.</span>

                    <span>>>>>>Alaska by James Michener, March 30, 2002 <BR> Reviewer: Cathy Sweetser from Maine <BR>I gave the rating a 1 star since I haven't heard it yet. I never received the Audio tapes. I was charged for them and never got them. The seller claims to have sent 2 copies? I am very dissapointed with the marketplace. The seller said that they would refund my money but never did. Original order was back in Oct.This is March. I leave for a trip to Alaska very soon and wanted to listen to this book on tape while I read other books. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title <<<<<<P>Why rate the book bad because someone didn't send you the tape. Deal with that person, don't put the book down. I thought the book was great, I learned a lot about the state of Alaska. My favorite Michener book is still Mexico, but Alaska is up there too.</span>

                    <span>There are two books that are a must read if you or anyone you know is intersted in Alaska. They are ALASKA by James Michener and LOOKING FOR ALASKA by Peter Jenkins. Remember Jenkins from his book, A WALK ACROSS AMERICA, Michener from so many big sellers like TEXAS. Michener offers more of the history, in his fact-ion kind of style, Jenkins offers many fascinating views of real people and actual places from today. Michener wrote this book in the 70's and it is a very, very long book, so there is thirty years of Alaska that is no where to be found and this place has changed so much in that time. Peter Jenkins lived there for a year and a half in 1999 through the end of 2000 and traveled thousands of miles in search of the amazing Alaska of today. I wish Jenkins had included more history, is there a place that has had much more of a diverse and fascinating one than Alaska, I wish Michener had met more of the actual people and gone to the actual places and lived the Alaska life like Jenkins did. For these reasons I suggest both books to the several thousand people every year that I work with as they plan their tours of The Last Frontier. Many of my clients have told me after reading these books and going to Alaska that the books greatly enriched their trip and made them go back. One couple I book travel for has been to Alaska five times in the last three years!</span>

                    <span>Michener has a unique ability for making history come to life in the most interesting of fashions. This book is no exception. I started this book feeling like I knew very little about Alaska and its value. By the time I finished I felt I like an expert on the history and the imense value of "Seward's Folly."<P>The characters come to life in memorable fashion. One character that I am puzzled by is Captain Michael Healy. For about 40 years he was the law in Alaska, battling pirates, rescuing lost seamen, importing reindeer from Siberia to ease starvation in Alaska. The reason I am puzzled is that Healy is one of the greatest Black Americans, with a "folklore" level history and virtually nobody has heard of him.</span>
