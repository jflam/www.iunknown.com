                <span id="Label1">As a player, former hurler Jim Bouton did nothing half-way; he threw so hard he'd lose his cap on almost every pitch. In the early '70s, he tossed off one of the funniest, most revealing, insider's takes on baseball life in <i>Ball Four,</i> his diary of the season he tried to pitch his way back from oblivion on the strength of a knuckler. The real curve, though, is Bouton's honesty. He carves humans out of heroes, and shines a light into the game's corners. A quarter century later, Bouton's unique baseball voice can still bring the heat.</span>

                    <span>All I can say is that Jim Bouton should keep us updated periodically: about his life, and about what is happening in baseball and culture generally. I say that because this edition, with its new epilogue, is excellent reading. 
<br />
<br />What shines through is an intelligent, funny, very likeable, and exceedingly sane -- partially by virtue of his craziness -- person. I think we should be hearing and seeing much more of him than we do: just providing a reasonable voice and open, honest critique of current events. Bouton's voice gives hope somehow.
<br />
<br />Keep on keeping on, Mr. Bouton!

                    <span>My teacher for my History of Sports class recommended this book and I bought it. He told us that is was a very controversial book at the time because it spoke of things that were better left unspoken. That is the best recommendation you can get! <p>It is a very funny book, sometimes Bouton describes things that could be in a movie about baseball, a National Lampoon version that is. There is drinking gambling and looking at girls from all angles. But didn't we all expect them to this anyway?<p>He was ostracized by baseball but it is really harmless fun, the new sections in this edition also talk about what happened after the first edition came out. Get it</span>

                    <span>Jim Bouton's Ball Four has rightly been called the best sports book of all times by publications that actually matter, but I figure I'll throw my two cents in, too.  In a day before an ol' ballplayer could hire a ghost and slap together some fond memories or pathetic pleas for forgiveness (hiya, Pete Rose), Bouton, making a comeback as a knuckleballer with the expansion Seattle Pilots, toted a tape recorder with him for an entire year in order to write this day-by-day account of life in the bigs.  <br>The humor is at once anecdotal and observational, and, most importantly, consistent.  The Seattle Pilots were rather like the Cleveland Indians in the film Major League - a haphazard collection of rookies and cast-offs trying to make it.  Of course, Major League had to have the whole underdog thing going on.  <br>The issues that face baseball today - drugs, salaries, lack of interest by hometown fans, the Yankees being the source of all evil - are all present in Ball Four.  The only part of the book that hasn't aged perfectly is the scale of the salaries - Bouton and his teammates hold out for an increase of a few thousand dollars, instead of the millions today's players make.  <br>In summation, there is no baseball book you should read before this one, and there are precious few books you should read, period, before this one.  Ball Four is in every right an American masterpiece.</span>

                    <span>Ball Four is a must read for all sports fans.  The first of it's kind, Bouton takes readers on the wild ride of a baseball pitcher that has played with the greats (Yankees) and the not so greats (Pilots).  Ball Four is a book that reaches all generations and should be on every book shelf.</span>
