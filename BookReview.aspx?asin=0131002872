                <span id="Label1">The legendary author Bruce Eckel brings Java to life with this extraordinarily insightful, opinionated and downright funny introduction. <I>Thinking in Java</i> introduces all of the language's fundamentals, one step at a time, using to-the-point code examples. More than virtually any other book, <I>Thinking in Java</i> helps you understand not just what to do -- but why. Eckel introduces all the basics of objects as Java uses them; then walks carefully through the fundamental concepts underlying all Java programming -- including program flow, initialization and cleanup, hiding implementations, reusing classes and polymorphism. Using extensive, to-the-point examples, he introduces error handling, exceptions, Java I/O, run-time type identification, and passing and returning objects. He covers the Java AWT, multithreading, network programming with Java -- even design patterns. The best way to understand the real value of this book is to hear what readers of the online version have been saying about it: "much better than any other Java book I've seen, by an order of magnitude..." "mature, consistent, intellectually honest, well-written and precise..." "a thoughtful, penetrating analytical tutorial which doesn't kowtow to the manufacturers..." "Thank you again for your awesome book. I was really floundering, but your book has brought me up to speed as quickly as I could read it!"For both beginner and experienced C and C++ programmers who want to learn Java.  <P>* From the basics of object development, all the way to design patterns and other advanced topics.  <P>* By the author of the best-selling Thinking in C++ -- winner of the 1995 Jolt Cola Award!  <P>* On-line version has already received tens of thousands of hits -- there's a huge built-in demand for this book!</span>

                    <span>As an object-oriented consultant and author myself, I wanted to express that I believe this is one of the great Java books avaiable. What distinquishes it from other books is that it is written by one of the few people whom I consider to be an expert in both object-oriented design and Java. The fact that Bruce clearly understands how to teach and write makes it even more valuable. Extensive code examples allow people who like to see the details wade through them. If you are more conceptually oriented, his bigger view of object-oriented design makes learning why you do certain things clearer.<P>Bruce even brings in design patterns in a very applied manner. Until I read his explanation of how stream io was an implementation of the decorator pattern, I always wondered why it was done this way.<P>If you are a detail oriented individual, it may be that you would want a more reference type book to start with (say, Horstmann's Core Java). However, Thinking in Java would still be an invaluable companion to peruse in tandem. If you are a bit more conceptual and like to understand why you might be doing what you are doing, then this book is definitely the one to use.<BR>Alan Shalloway, author of Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design</span>

                    <span>If your are new to Java or just the whole OOP programming concept, this is the book for you.<P>Here is my story:<P> In the beginning of Sept. of 1999 I started read Bruce's Thinking in Java with only a structured programming background. I had previously done some programming in a language called CSP (a Cobal generator) on the mainframe and had some experience with VB and C. A friend and I made a commitment to get java certified by January of 2000 or around then because if we were going to learn java, might as well do it the right way. So, through five month of reading and doing almost every example in the book, I was java certified on January 14. The point I am trying to make is 1. use this book as a launch pad into the java and OOP world, 2. I would recommend learning Java with a friend because it is easier for you to stay focused on the true goal, and 3. do all of the examples in the book. This, obiously is not the only way to learn, however, it was a way that helped me.<P>Note: I was working full time.<P>So, I would recommend "Thinking in Java" for beginners and intermediates programmers</span>

                    <span>I'm a software engineer and I obviously read and studied various books on diffirent programming languages. My biggest claim to fame is C Programming, but I thought about object orientation for a long time and that's how I came across "Thinking in Java". <P>I Downloaded the book and even printed it and eventually bought a proper copy, because I was convinced it should be on my bookshelf. After reading the firts couple of chapters I have to admit that for the first time I really do understand object orientation through the clear and concise explanation backed up by good examples given on the subject.<P>Any one interested in Java should defenately own this.</span>

                    <span>I consider myself quite experienced in Java but from the moment I started this book I couldn't put it down. The reason is such clarity in logic and simplicity in explanation of sometimes very complicated subjects, which by itself is an art. I believe that anybody with just basic knowledge of software development will understand the innerworkings of Java described in this book. It explains not just the semantics of the language but also a philosophy and logic behind certain decisions. I believe that a reader will get not only a guidance about practical aspects of programming in Java (which this book certainly provides) but he will also become a better software designerin general. <BR>I see that Bruce Eckel has two more books related to Java (about patterns and enterprise Java - unfortunately there are only electronic versions) that are available on his web site. I am looking forward to reading them.</span>
