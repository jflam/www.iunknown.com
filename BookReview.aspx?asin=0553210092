                    <span>THE SCARLET LETTER IS A GREAT BOOK. IT'S ALSO NONFICTION. IT EXPLAINS SIN WAY BACK IN THE PAST. THIS WOMAN, HESTER HAD AN AFFAIR AND GOT PREGNANT WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY. SHE WAS LOCKED AND LATER RELEASED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION EVERYBODY WANTED TO KNOW, wHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE CHILD? SHE WAS LOCKED UP AGAIN BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T TELL. HER HUSBAND RETURNED AND TOLD HER NOT TO TELL ANYONE HE WAS HER HUSBAND. HE WANTED REVENGE ON THE CHILD,PEARL, FATHER. LATER ON, EVERYONE FOUND OUT IT WAS THE REVEREND. THE ONE EVERYBODY ADORED AND LOVED. THIS BOOK WAS HARD FOR ME TO PUT DOWN. I EVEN READ IT MORE THAN ONE TIME. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE AUTHOR'S LAST NAME BUT HIS FIRST WAS NATHANIEL. HE PROBABLY HAS LOTS OF GOOD BOOKS PUBLISHED AND I THINK I'LL BE READING SOME MORE OF HIS WORK. THE BOOK IS NO LONGER THAN 400 PAGES. THATS LONG BUT IT'S WORTH IT ALSO. READ THE BOOK. I THINK EVERY BOOKSTORE HAS HIS BOOKS AVAILABLE.

                    <span>The book is set in Boston, Massachusetts, during colonial times.  Hester Prynne, who is believed to be a widow (it's thought her husband died at sea on his way to Boston), gives birth to a little girl she names Pearl.  Hester is convicted of adultery, and her punishment is to wear a scarlet letter "A" on her chest for the rest of her life.  Since Hester refuses to name the father of the child, and he doesn't come forward on his own, he goes unpunished, while Hester and Pearl become outcast in the town.  Roger Chillingworth is a doctor who is a newcomer to the town.  He is actually Hester's husband, but no one knows that other than Hester.  Chillingworth swears he will find out who Pearl's father is and get revenge.  Meanwhile, the Reverend Dimmesdale, who is Pearl's father, is consumed with guilt about his sin and about the fact that he allowed Hester (and Pearl) to take all the punishment for it.     
<br />
<br />I first read this book 20 years ago in high school and recently re-read it.  I enjoyed it much more this time around.  This is a very difficult book for a young adult to read.  The pace is very slow, the vocabulary words are rather advanced, and the author is very wordy--he takes half a page to say something that could be said in one sentence.  Those reasons are why I only gave the book 4 stars, instead of 5 :)  Still, it's important to remember that the book was written over 150 years ago.
<br />
<br />Even with all those 'problems' the story itself is wonderful.  It's a story of sin and the price that people pay for them, as well as the price that others are forced to pay for those sins.  It's a story of guilt and the effect it has on you.  It involves difficult decisions--do you admit your guilt and accept the punishment or do you hide it in an effort to still be in a position to do some good in the community?  And do you forgive someone who hid his guilt while you accepted complete punishment?  
<br />
<br />It is a book that makes the reader think about some very hard issues.  And that's always a good thing.

                    <span>Set in seventeenth-century Puritan New England, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is the story of an adulteress, Hester Prynne, and her struggle to maintain a functioning relationship within the Puritan orthodox community she lives in. She must  cope with  the wild nature of  her imp-like daughter, a physically and emotionally twisted husband, and the adulterer,  Reverend Dimmesdale, who remains unknown as Hester's lover and the father of her child until late in the novel.
<br />	After giving birth  to a daughter she names Pearl , Hester is punished with the scarlet letter "A"  which she must wear on her breast and  marks her as an adulteress.  The shame she bears is immense. The village looks upon her with scorn and ridicule. Her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, whom Hester had presumed dead at sea, sent her to Salem, Massachusetts two years previously  to await his later arrival, but sent no word after. He appears unexpectedly as she is being publicly displayed upon the scaffolding in front of the church, which serves as a punishment for criminals.  He sees this public humiliation and is enraged. He sets out to find  her lover and get revenge...Hester  must deal with her husband's evil nature and with her own daughter, who's erratic behavior doesn't improve the village's view of her.  
<br />	The scarlet letter is a symbol for the shame which Hester Prynne is burdened with. As a confessed adulteress  she deals daily with public humiliation while the Reverend  Dimmesdale is left to bear the shame inside his heart, shut away in the confines of his lodgings, living out each day as a lie.  Hester is depicted as being strong, self-reliant and courageous in contrast to Reverend Dimmesdale who is weak and guilt ridden. He is a hypocrite, a man of God , living a lie. 
<br />	Hester's suffering is  easier to bear than Dimmesdale's.  She is hardened , refined, made almost heroic by her punishment and all the ordeals it brings with it.  Dimmesdale is irreparably broken apart, suffering his own judgment, living in a daily personal hell.	I was impressed  by how Hawthorne managed to convey so many truths about contemporary society in general  by focusing on one incident  in Salem Massachusetts that transpired a hundred years in the past.  I would recommend The Scarlet Letter to anybody who is willing to face the character of human beings that remain unchanged throughout time. The truths about evil, lies, love, beauty, courage  and the heroism of the human spirit  which can not only survive, but endure for generations.</span>

                    <span>Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master.

                    <span>As always, it is difficult to describe a book (or rather novella) as intricate as The Scarlet Letter. On the surface its story of adultery may appear plain, longwinded, and uninteresting, but Hawthorne never wrote primarily for the "mob" reader who only likes action and suspense. Instead, what he wrote is a book that captures the zeitgeist of the puritan era, both stylistically and figuratively. Don't badmouth the literature if you are not going to invest your time in it. </span>
