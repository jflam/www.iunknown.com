                    <span>This book targets people looking to make a full-time living selling on eBay. It is not targeted at buyers or infrequent sellers. The book does a good job of presenting information and it has a number of great tips that will benefit any seller. Infrequent sellers will have to wade through a lot of business strategy text to uncover the most valuable tips. Overall, it was one of the better eBay books I read.
<br />
<br />After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:
<br />---Beginner with eBay and computers---
<br />1. The Official eBay Bible
<br />
<br />---eBay Seller---
<br />1. Sell it on eBay
<br />2. eBay Hacks
<br />
<br />---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---
<br />1. eBay Strategies
<br />2. eBay Business the Smart Way</span>

                    <span>Having been an eBay Seller for over 5 years, and a PowerSeller for as long as they've had the program, I really appreciated FINALLY finding a book that could bring me to the next level.  Tired of reading the same old re-hashed text on how to take a good eBay picture?  Want to join the big boys on eBay?  Then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>Definitely a 400 level college business course on how to succeed on E-bay! Although the author's extensive use of his personal business service made the book come across as his version of "buy the book and receive my free advertising".  This is a very logical and comprehensive tool for serious E-bay users that carefully explains the online business cycle. However, it leaves the reader wondering what to do with psychological strategies involving negative feedback and customer statisfaction issues...
<br />Great research, statistics and graphs regarding E-bay trends, history and the future of E-bay marketing.  Just be sure to start with the back of the book and review the glossary and terms. You will be better prepared for the excessive use of acronyms while you read the book( I always wanted to learn a 3rd language). 
<br />
<br />This is definitely one of the most analytical E-Bay books I have ever encountered.  A must read for every serious E-bay marketing entrepreneur.

                    <span>This book is not easy reading; it is like taking a crash course in management accounting, economics and marketing.  The author also freely scatters acronyms throughout the text (they are very well explained on first use though).  The book is well worth the effort, and has excellent chapter summaries to convey key points.
<br />
<br />My ebay (and other auction site) selling ambitions are limited; I am looking to generate a secondary income (books target audience is the full time business, not casual seller).  This book has made me rethink some previous auctions, in particular exclusive use of $1NR. 
<br />
<br />The assessment of listing upgrades has made me rethink what I will do in future auctions.  The promotions strategy is great, the material on keyword searching is excellent.  
<br />
<br />The chapter on branding and the use of the me page is excellent: I incorporated some of the suggestions into linking my me page to web pages, despite a very impersonal web address, http://mysite.verizon.net/vze48sdz/ - the flow of traffic was surprising.  Combined with the industrial strength ebay hacks book advice on affiliate selling this prooving effective!
<br />
<br />The real life scenarios are superb; they really do help clarify the strategies outlined in the book.
<br />
<br />Excellent book that has easily repayed it's cost.</span>
