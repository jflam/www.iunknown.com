                <span id="Label1">In his Booker Prize-winning third novel, <I>The English Patient</I>, Michael Ondaatje explored the nature of love and betrayal in wartime. His fourth, <I>Anil's Ghost</I>, is also set during a war, but unlike in World War II, the enemy is difficult to identify in the bloody sectarian upheaval that ripped Sri Lanka apart in the 1980s and '90s. The protagonist, Anil Tissera, a native Sri Lankan, left her homeland at 18 and returns to it 15 years later only as part of an international human rights fact-finding mission. In the intervening years she has become a forensic anthropologist--a career that has landed her in the killing fields of Central America, digging up the victims of Guatemala's dirty war. Now she's come to Sri Lanka on a similar quest. But as she soon learns, there are fundamental differences between her previous assignment and this one: <blockquote> The bodies turn up weekly now. The height of the terror was 'eighty-eight and 'eighty-nine, but of course it was going on long before that. Every side was killing and hiding the evidence. <I>Every side</I>. This is an unofficial war, no one wants to alienate the foreign powers. So it's secret gangs and squads. Not like Central America. The government was not the only one doing the killing. </blockquote> In such a situation, it's difficult to know who to trust. Anil's colleague is one Sarath Diyasena, a Sri Lankan archaeologist whose political affiliations, if any, are murky. Together they uncover evidence of a government-sponsored murder in the shape of a skeleton they nickname Sailor. But as Anil begins her investigation into the events surrounding Sailor's death, she finds herself caught in a web of politics, paranoia, and tragedy. <p> Like its predecessor, the novel explores that territory where the personal and the political intersect in the fulcrum of war. Its style, though, is more straightforward, less densely poetical. While many of Ondaatje's literary trademarks are present--frequent shifts in time, almost hallucinatory imagery, the gradual interweaving of characters' pasts with the present--the prose here is more accessible. This is not to say that the author has forgotten his poetic roots; subtle, evocative images abound. Consider, for example, this description of Anil at the end of the day, standing in a pool of water, "her toes among the white petals, her arms folded as she undressed the day, removing layers of events and incidents so they would no longer be within her." In <I>Anil's Ghost</I> Michael Ondaatje has crafted both a brutal examination of internecine warfare and an enduring meditation on identity, loyalty, and the unbreakable hold the past exerts over the present. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>Anil, the woman with the second-hand name, returns to Sri Lanka after 15 years of western life. She returns as a forensic doctor working for an international human rights organization, to investigate political crimes during the civil war. During this time she meets herself and other Sri Lankans, dead and alive, in these difficult times.
<br />
<br />The book is well written, no doubt, and has some great movie-like changes of scenario and story, including the death of the president Premadasa (nicknamed Katugala in the novel) amidst a multitude in May 1983.
<br />
<br />I approached this book willing to read about the recent history of Sri Lanka, about the complex civil war (or wars) that the government has been fighting against the Tamil Tigers and the JVP insurgents in the south. It took me several visits to Sri Lanka to find the terrible atrocities that have been occurring there: thousands of executions and disappearances, public expositions of the corpses (often just their heads), mutilations, tortures, etc. 
<br />
<br />However, the book explores extensively the psychology and experiences of the main characters, which is ok, but I didn't need it. By the second half of the book I began to get a little bored, but I must say that the last 30 pages satisfied me as a reader. I also liked the continuous reference to the rich Sri Lankan ancient history (one of the characters is an archeologist) and some descriptions of Colombo's atmosphere and its hospitals in crisis time. I couldn't agree with the distant attitude of Anil towards her country, where she lived until 18 years old: she even seems to have forgotten her mother language! The book is good, but not much my type.</span>

                    <span>Poetry via vivid depiction and an eye for detail is what pushed me to finish this book. Otherwise I would've dumped it away, as the story-in retrospective-was very dull and often suffered with BOD (Bouts Of Digression). Reading other reviews I've noticed the fact that many did not finish the book, something which could be justified in this scenario. Only an avid fan of Ondaatje's prose or Sticklers of poetry would bother going through each dense passage. For that matter, when we muster up to read Ondaatje's work the fact should be in mind that he was a poet before he turned a successful novelist-and a good one too; only here he doesn't live up to expectations.

                    <span>This book, almost a series of vignettes more than a connected narrative, transports us to Sri Lanka, where widespread political violence mars the tranquility of the lush island.  Author Michael Ondaatje (of The English Patient fame) weaves into this broken tropical landscape a story about the effect of such random brutality upon the lives of four main characters.
<br />
<br />The title character, thought not necessarily the main one, is Anil.  Born and raised in Sri Lanka, she goes abroad to study and advance in her career as a forensic scientist and returns to her native country as part of a human rights mission to uncover the truth behind the political killings.  Anil becomes obsessed with the murder of Sailor, the name she gives to a particular skeleton she unearths in her search for evidence to bring to justice those responsible for the mayhem.  She and Sarath, an archaeologist assigned to work with her by the human rights commission in charge of the expedition, follow Sailor's trail of facts, all of which point to a governmental campaign of killing and terror.
<br />
<br />All this seems straight out of a Victorian detective novel - the forensic scientist sniffing out the bad guys, the sinister conspiracy, the exotic locale at the far reaches of the Empire.  This is at least the narrative structure of the novel, but it proceeds in a very fragmentary and episodic manner.  It soon becomes clear that Anil's Ghost is not a plot-driven novel at all.  Rather, the detective story merely serves as the canvas on which Ondaatje can paint his rich ensemble of characters, each of whom occupies our attention for a significant chunk of the novel.  I almost want to withhold judgment after only a single reading, because I initially felt that the story was too disjointed and confusing.  But the resulting vignettes ultimately prove to be rewarding, though difficult.
<br />
<br />Who is Anil's ghost?  It could be her past - old lovers, friends, family, the memory of a peaceful Sri Lanka where life was not dominated by fear or anguish over a lost loved one.  It could also be the ghost of Sailor.  A man she never knew, he comes to symbolize the way in which Anil has a foot in each of two different worlds.  He embodies her fierce pursuit of success in her career as a forensic scientist and her status as a Sri Lankan expatriate who bemoans what has befallen her homeland.  This ambiguity in what the title even refers to is just one example of what makes Anil's Ghost so challenging and complex.
<br />
<br />Ondaatje's most spectacular success lies in his depiction of the complex relationship between Sarath and his brother Gamini, a doctor who toils seemingly without end to save the victims of the island's senseless spasms of violence.  Gamini, the younger of the two brothers, earned the nickname "Mouse" as a child because of his bashfulness and reserved personality.  He fell in love with his brother's wife and had an affair with her, a tantalizing episode that, disappointingly, Ondaatje never explores further.  Nonetheless, its effects upon Gamini's temperament and his relations with Sarath are clear.  Gamini now takes speed to keep himself going (to stay alive?).  His hospital rounds never end, and his personal life consists of nothing but despair.  Ondaatje's portrayal of his depression and suffering at the hands of the war is stunning.
<br />
<br />This silver lining has a cloud, however, because this relationship and ultimately Gamini himself overshadow Anil, ostensibly the book's main character.  Perhaps Ondaatje simply identifies better with Sarath and Gamini than he ever could with a female protagonist.  Whatever the case may be, Anil remains frustratingly flat and undeveloped throughout the book.  I never ended up caring about what happened to her.  Ondaatje's tosses in an episode from her past here and there: her torrid affair with a married man she met at a conference, her penchant for bowling back in college, and her complex relationship with a girl named Leaf, whose ambiguous status as a friend/lover is a considerable source of frustration for any reader who wants to truly know Anil.  But what are Anil's motivations for returning to Sri Lanka?  Are they personal, or professional, or both?  What are Anil's feelings toward the people she meets?  We never really know.  Anil is nothing but a collection of actions to the reader.  Her mind, her thoughts, her beliefs -- all remain impenetrable.  Although this uncertainty could come off as complex and profound if Ondaatje executed it correctly, instead it merely comes off as exasperating.</span>

                    <span>I, like many others, apparently, felt like I missed something.  Yes, the characters were interesting in their starkness and detached-ness.  Yes, the way this author uses language is impressive.  Yes, the premise was intriguing.
<br />
<br />But I got to the end and thought, "huh?"  I re-read the ending 3 times and still had no clue what had happened.  I met with my book club to discuss it and still felt like I didn't get it.  I am not an idiot-- I'm a pretty avid reader of a wide variety of literature-- but this book just did not do much for me.  I felt very frustrated-- like some said here, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure what to say about this book. I thought that the basic idea of it was very good. That's what pulled me in. But then...I don't know what happened. After the basic premise of the plot was introduced, it seemed like the author got tired of it. So he began another plot, and another. Most of these had something to do with the main story, but some of them I couldn't understand. And then at the end, all the loose ends were tied up, all the plots had climaxed, except for the main story with which the book had started in the first place. I wish I would have liked this book more, but it jumped around from plot to plot a lot and seemingly at random. I thought that the main plot-a forensic anthropoligist sent to her homeland to try to help solve a string of possible government murders-was excellent, and I loved Michael Ondaatje's poetic style. But that didn't seem to help the fact that I didn't understand what was going on half of the time. Maybe I just don't have enough background.</span>
