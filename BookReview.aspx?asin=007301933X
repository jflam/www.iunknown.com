                <span id="Label1">For over 20 years, <i>Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach</i> has been the best selling guide to software engineering for students and industry professionals alike.   <P>The sixth edition continues to lead the way in software engineering.  A new Part 4 on Web Engineering presents a complete engineering approach for the analysis, design, and testing of Web Applications, increasingly important for today's students.  Additionally, the UML coverage has been enhanced and signficantly increased in this new edition. <P>The pedagogy has also been improved in the new edition to include sidebars.  They provide information on relevant softare tools, specific work flow for specific kinds of projects, and additional information on various topics.  Additionally, Pressman provides a running case study called "Safe Home" throughout the book, which provides the application of software engineering to an industry project. <P> New additions to the book also include chapters on the Agile Process Models, Requirements Engineering, and Design Engineering.  The book has been completely updated and contains hundreds of new references to software tools that address all important topics in the book. <P>The ancillary material for the book includes an expansion of the case study, which illustrates it with UML diagrams.  The On-Line Learning Center includes resources for both instructors and students such as checklists, 700 categorized web references, Powerpoints, a test bank, and a software engineering library-containing over 500 software engineering papers.  TAKEAWY HERE IS THE FOLLOWING: 1.  AGILE PROCESS METHODS ARE COVERED EARLY IN CH. 4 2.  NEW PART ON WEB APPLICATIONS --5 CHAPTERS </span>

                    <span>The sixth edition is better organised that earlier editions. Its coverage is broad though not deep. For example the chapter on Agile methods gives a brief description of the different flavours, including their strengths and weaknesses and summarises what Agile methods have in common. It is targeted at a manager/team leader whose responsibilities do not normally include cutting code. Also it is geared towards enterprise architecture as the `Safe Home' running example amply demonstrates. So if you are writing parsers or numerical applications this is not meant for you. </span>

                    <span>Horribly organized with too many fillers.
<br />Too many meaningless phrases only makes sentences longer making meanings less understandable.

                    <span>I had the 3rd edition many years ago for a course I took. At the time I was a junior programmer and did not see the usefulness for all the management and other information in the book.
<br />
<br />Now that I'm a software development lead, I have dusted off the book. It has been a god-send.  In one volume is most of the information one needs to gather requirements, price, design, build, test and deploy great software.  It is not dogmatic, which may be why it is not more popular.  Pressman lays the necessary truths for each step of software development, then gives the reader choices for how to perform the tasks.  
<br />
<br />The book cites great sources, and is easy to read. Quite a bargin, considering its wide-range and utilitarian nature.
<br />
<br />I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>The book is extremely dry and is very wordy.  There is a lot of information present and the subject is rather dry to begin with, but this book still falls short.  It also lacks examples of major documentation (requirements definition, requirements specifcation, etc.)</span>

                    <span>Used this book in an undergraduate software engineering course (apparently it's big in the college scene). A number of my mates complained that the chapters were boring and long. I think its a good book, probably a slow reading, but still informative (a lot of stuff could definitely have been done without). It's not the best, and there's bound to be something better out there. For college kids, hopefully it'll grow on you. <p>It talks on a broad range of SE activities - process models, design, analysis and modeling concepts, OOA & OOD, testing, metrics, management issues, systems engineering etc. Towards the end of the book when it talks on cleanroom SE, web engineering, formal methods, it's not very detailed and very obscure at best.You get a broad feel for what SE entails even if you eventually plan to later focus in one area. I think the authors goal is to make the reader understand the principles behind SE.</span>
