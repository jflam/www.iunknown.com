                <span id="Label1">Anyone who's done programming work knows that you spend half your coding time looking for other people's solutions to the problems you're facing in your project. Particularly when you're dealing with times, dates, standard calculations, and other common problems, you find yourself saying, "Someone must have solved this before." And, indeed, someone usually has. <I>Linux Programming by Example</I> is a dense compendium of Linux software solutions--tools, algorithms, and procedures that solve data-processing challenges of the sort that crop up in all sorts of software projects. Though it does not address X11 user-interface programming or network communications much, this book does a great job of communicating recommended practices for command-line interfaces, filesystem manipulation, internationalization and localization, and inter-process communications. Taken together with <I>The Art of Unix Programming</I>, this book will help you solve difficult Linux programming problems quickly.<p>  Unlike a lot of code-oriented books, this one manages to keep its samples concise, and devote more space to discussions of why things are done than to the code that actually does them. This promotes understanding: You can always mess around with the code yourself on your own. Overall, Arnold Robbins does an excellent job of stripping away some of the hacker mystique to reveal the code behind the curtain. This book shows how to work Linux magic. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Linux programming in C, mostly at a level concerned with user input from the command line, file I/O, interprocess signalling, and memory management.</span>

                    <span>Linux Programming by Example: The Fundamentals is a great book that covers three main concepts in Linux programming: files, processes and debugging.  In each part the author explains and gives several examples of functions, systems calls and APIs that will help the Linux programmer.  He also includes several real world examples of how these concepts are implemented.  Here are the some things that I found interesting:
<br /> 
<br />The Good: 1)  This book really focuses on the use of standards and good program design.  Right from the beginning, the author goes out of his way to make the reader aware of standards from ISO and POSIX and how they apply to good programming and design.  Along this line I also like that the author explains the benefits of - and promotes - the use of Gnu software.  Being an avid Gnu user myself (as most Linux users are) I agree that Gnu software is generally better software.
<br />2)  I feel that knowledge is power, and the author goes along with this idea by showing how some things should *not* be done.  He often points out several functions that are available but should be avoided.  I appreciated this, and feel that it makes the reader an all-around better programmer.  The author also frequently gives extra information and history which helps explain why things are the way they are.  This was especially useful when explaining mount points and types of file system.
<br />3)  I liked the fact that the author uses real world examples to demonstrate the ideas being presented.  I really appreciated the fact that he uses V7 code (older, smaller and less comlex code) to demonstrate his examples.  This allowed me to be able to see how the features were implemented in simple code, without being overwhelmed by the modern equivalents.  A great example is the V7 echo program - only 23 lines!
<br /> 
<br />The Bad: There weren't too many things that I didn't like about this book, but if my arm was twisted I would say the following:  1) This book is called *Linux* Programming but really it is about Unix programming.  I know they are similar, and maybe I am splitting hairs here, but the title could really be *Unix* Programming.  Most of this stuff is generic Unix programming, and the author points out the special exceptions not only for Linux but for other Unix variants as well - such as BSD.
<br />2) Don't confuse the word "Fundamental" with "Beginning."  This book really isn't for beginning Linux programmers, but rather it teaches basic (or fundamental) concepts that Linux programmers should know and use.  The reader needs to be moderately familiar with the C programming language if he or she is to be edified.
<br /> 
<br />  A great read, with some excellent examples of well written Linux programs.  If you are interested in moving beyond basic Linux programming then you should definitely pick up a copy of this book!</span>

                    <span>This is an exceptionally fine book.  
<br />
<br />Robbins has supplied the reader with a vast number of
<br />programs and a lot of elucidation.  This is a primer in 
<br />Linux programming, but also serves as a tract on UNIX 
<br />programming.  The illustrations stem, for the most part,
<br />from actual GNU and Linux code.
<br />
<br />This is an invaluable resource for those converting from
<br />another system to Linux.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. It's earned an honored place on my bookshelf, and I'm going to recommend it to people who need information about Linux and UNIX development.<p>Many computer books are practically obsolete before they ship: within a few months, "Learn Foomatic 4.3 in 21 Days" is in the bargain bin at the Dollar Tree. Some books have longer lives, and a few can remain useful for years. "Linux Programming by Example" (LPE) is in this last category; this book can stand alongside Steven's "Advanced UNIX Programming" as an essential tutorial and reference.<p>LPE covers everything you'd expect (working with files, processes, signals, users) and some things you might not (internationalization). But it's this book's voice and unique perspective that make it truly a gem. LPE is written in a clear, friendly, authoritative style. As I read, I often felt that I had gained a new understanding of things I've known for years.<p>The long and twisted history of UNIX has given rise to multiple competing APIs. Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is the way that Robbins cuts through these thickets, explaining your choices, pointing out the best alternatives, and explaining why they're the best. LPE's modern vantage point means it can cover V7, BSD, POSIX, and GNU APIs. The chapter on signals alone is worth the purchase price of the book for the way in which it clearly compares and contrasts the various signal APIs.</span>

                    <span>I am very impressed with this book.  Arnold covers the basics of Linux and Unix programming in a clear, easily-understood fashion.  He has brought a wealth of programming experience to the job, and it shows -- the comments on portability, for instance, have a certain world-weariness about them that makes it clear that the lessons were hard-won.<p>I thought the choice of using Unix 7th edition source code was inspired.  The code is elegantly written, and comprehensible enough to be used as a teaching aid.<p>I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for an introduction to programming on Linux or Unix.</span>

                    <span>Don't judge a book by it's cover, especially this cover, with the cheesy lightsaber which screams, "secrets of the Unix Jedi". Read the the lines, "Linux" and "Fundamentals" on the cover, and that is what you need to know.<p>If you are familiar with the classic "Advanced Unix Programming" you will be familiar with what this book covers and appreciative of the update. In short, this book covers the fundamentals of shell programming with C; files, directories, signals, memory allocation, process control, permissions, that sort of thing. It does not cover network programming or X11 GUI programming.<p>What I liked about it was primarily that it imparted experience. For example the section on creating temporary files pointed out both good and bad ways to write the same functionality. The text was expository and informative. Where Advanced Unix Programming was a little dry and stiff in tone, this book is a little heftier, goes into more detail, and is written in a more experiential and friendly manner.<p>There is a lot to like about this book. If the subject, within it's constraints, interests you, then you should get it. If only to broaden your depth of understanding as to how Unix works and how to write programs for it. If you are looking for books on network programming, xml, multi-threading, web serving, or X11, you should look elsewhere, but you should probably still look at this book to bone up on 'Linux' 'Fundamentals'.</span>
