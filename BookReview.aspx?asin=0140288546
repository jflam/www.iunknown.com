                <span id="Label1">A popular cat expert and award-winning author of four books on feline behavior reveals the key to a satisfying and rewarding relationship with your cat. <br><br>Think it's impossible to train a cat? Think again! Yes, you can learn to understand your cat. No, cats are not always aloof. No, they don't ruin furniture out of spite. Most often feline "misbehavior" is the result of owners not understanding their cat's needs. In this comprehensive book that takes readers through every step of cat ownership, Pam Johnson-Bennett helps you understand the instincts that determine feline behavior, positive and negative. An authoritative resource for cat owners of all stripes, <i>Think Like a Cat</i> covers everything from where to get a kitten to choosing a vet; from basic health care to treating more serious medical problems; from selecting an irresistible scratching post to avoiding litter box problems. A seasoned therapist and former veterinary technician, Johnson-Bennett offers welcome advice in a straightforward manner that will help cats--and their owners--share a happy, healthy life together.<br><br> Johnson-Bennett's first book, <i>Cat Love</i>, was chosen by <i>Cat Fancy</i> magazine as one of the best books ever published on cats.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on an article on feral cats which was written by Pam. Curious enough I decided to check her book and I bought. I have 3 cats and I thought I knew everything but I was wrong! The book cover all the topics a cat owner should know and I recommend it if you are thinking about getting a cat. <P>The medical appendix is extremly useful and gives a brief description about common cat diseases. Her appendix helped me to explain better to my vet about what was going one with one cat of mine who was sick.<P>The behaviour tips are very good, and Pam really explain the importance of using interactive toys with cats, and specially important how to keep the peace if your house has more than one cat. Also the chapter about the litter box is a must-read. Many concerns about location, how many and which kind of litter are all explained<P>If you think about getting a cat this book has a very comprehensive description of what to look for. Her tips involve not only good sense but also important aspects people should observe when getting a new cat. The part about the shelter is certainly the strongest part and very nice explained.<P>I strongly suggest this book, for new cat owners and for experienced cat owners. I have read at least 3 times and I still use as my personal reference.</span>

                    <span>Before this book, I was going nuts with my two kittens. I didn't understand why they would scratch my rugs, walk on table tops and eat my plants. After having read this fantastic book, I completely understand what's going on in their minds (well, almost) and our relationship has gotten so much better. Now, I cannot even live without them and my cats have brought me so much joy in my life. This book made a difference between night and day... Pam knows cats best.<P>The book is easy to read, funny and really in tune with the cat owner in mind. She provides plenty of resources and information. Even my vet has to consult her book for understanding cat behavior! This is a must buy and every cat owner should have one on their bedside!</span>
