                <span id="Label1">As <I>Chaos</I> explained the science of disorder, <I>Nexus</I> reveals the new science of connection and the odd logic of six degrees of separation. How can geometry explain the puzzles of human behavior? In this incisive, insightful work Mark Buchanan presents the fundamental principles of the emerging field of "small worlds" theory&#151;the idea that a hidden pattern is the key to how networks interact and exchange information, whether that network is the information highway or the firing of neurons in the brain. Mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, and social scientists are working to decipher this complex organizational system, for it may yield a blueprint of dynamic interactions within our physical as well as social worlds. Highlighting groundbreaking research behind network theory, Buchanan documents mounting support for the small-worlds idea and demonstrates its multiple applications to diverse problems&#151;whether explaining the volatile global economy or the Human Genome Project, the spread of infectious disease or ecological damage. <I>Nexus</I> is an exciting introduction to the hidden geometry that weaves our lives so inextricably together. 20 illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Networks have become a very hot topic, as shown by the spate of recent books on the subject. Nexus, Mark Buchanan's recent work on "small worlds and the groundbreaking science of networks" is one of the more readable and less sensational takes on the theme.<P>Buchanan, a physicist, science writer and editor at Nature and New Scientist, has the credentials to know what he is writing about and the ability to present it coherently. He starts with the now famous "small world" or "six degrees of separation" observation, first made in the 1960s and since studied and demonstrated in a variety of important, real-world networks. Buchanan's thesis is that physicists and mathematicians are discovering some remarkably simple laws that describe a huge number of complex systems, quite independently of the elements that make up the system. For example, The linkages that connect everyone in the world with just six steps can be treated the same way as the linkages that connect neurons in our brains or web pages on the internet. "Some of the deepest truths of our world may turn out to be truths about organization," Buchanan writes, "rather than about what kinds of things make up the world and how these things behave as individuals."<P>Building on this theme, Buchanan systematically explores areas such as the spread of infections diseases, key social and governmental systems, brain organization, protein-based control networks within our cells, and even networks of sexual partners. Similar features, especially the "power-law" distribution, characterize all these systems. Whether the issue is the number of sexual partners, the number of chemical reactions, or the number of connected neurons, a few key elements account for a large percentage of the connections within each system. Buchanan shows how this grows out of a simple common dynamic characterized by the age-old observation that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<P>Buchanan then goes on to trace some important implications of these emerging findings. These include the vulnerability of ecosystems to sudden collaps when a few key plants or animals are lost, the explosive transformation of a slumbering pathogen into a deadly epidemic, as seen in AIDS, and--economists and would-be-reformers take notice--the distribution of wealth. Buchanan shows that, although the exact percentages vary from country to country, the shape of the wealth-distribution curve is the same. And he demonstrates that this distribution can be shown to stem from a few extremely simple assumptions. I was struck by Buchanan's observation that economic polices that foster business and trade, including regressive taxation as a kind of enforced exchange, produce a flatter, more democratic distribution of wealth. On the contrary, an environment that fosters speculation inevitably transfers wealth from the poor to the rich. It turns out that the more volatile the investment markets, the more extreme the transfer. This certainly seems to match what the U.S. experienced during the savings-and-loan bust and the recent dot-com debacle. More people riding around in limos, for sure, but far more people trying to eke out a living flipping burgers. I'd sure like to see our economists and lawmakers pay attention to that finding.<P>In short, this is a clear, readable and fascinating introduction to the emerging science of networks. Since we are made of networks, and live embedded in them, it's hard to imagine a more relevant subject. Nexus certainly doesn't supply the last word on this complex subject, but it's a rewarding place to start.<P>Robert Adler, author of Science Firsts: From the Creation of Science to the Science of Creation (Wiley & Sons, September, 2002).</span>

                    <span>In Nexus, Buchanan describes the behavior of complex network systems - things like the internet, the nervous system, and human social networks. But what is so intriguing is how he reveals how entirely different kinds of constituent phenomena can naturally develop into systems and networks that evidence very similar kinds of organization. That is, there seems to be a kind of essential architecture that naturally guides the evolution and growth of such structures. Nexus provides the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of this architecture and how it can explicate what would otherwise be considered bizarre and extraordinary events. By understanding the fundamental architecture of these systems, scientists are looking at how to apply it to real world problems- like how to stabilize ecosystems, or protect the internet from attack. The book is engaging, well-written, and informative. The ideas of Nexus will give readers an appreciation of "the big picture", and tip them off to the comparatively simple and elegant rules that guide vast systems and produce seemingly chaotic events.<P>In short, Nexus succeeds on all counts.</span>

                    <span>The author makes a strong case that many diverse phenomena can be modelled in very similar ways. This book can be summarized as a very brief introduction to network models, followed by numerous examples from the real world.<P>The level of mathematical sophistication needed to comprehend the matterial is minimal. I do not believe there are any equations in the entire book. There are many easily understood graphs and a few percentages.<P>The basic concept of the networks is very easy to explain and to understand. The applications are the interesting part. Thoughout the pages are clear and interesting examples that make you want to turn the page to see what is coming next. In my case I often found myself thinking how I would have approached the problem and more importantly what problems could this have been applied to. Any book that can do that is a good one in my book!<P>Like many good books, this one leaves more questions unanswered than it answers. The subject area is a generic one that allows it's self to be applied in many many different fields. The question becomes not is this model of the world valid but rather how can it be applied.<P>This was a quick read, certain to change my views on how the world works.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading Nexus right after I finished Steven Johnson's book, Emergence. Both are great, quick reads. The ideas are fascinating and build upon chaos theory that James Gleick gives a history of in Chaos, which is the last book I read that addressed topics such as complexity. It's a great thrill to receive journalistic reports on what has happened in the small-worlds theory and gaining a cursory understanding of its current and future applications. I also just started reading Harold Morowitz's The Emergence of Everything, which is interesting in its subject matter while the writing is much more austere than in Emergence and Nexus. I look forward to reading everything I can on the small-worlds, complexity theory-type popular science books.</span>

                    <span>The surprising answer is yes. I picked this book up after reading Steven Strogatz's Sync which mentions a great deal about the science of networks. Buchanan explains how networks exist everywhere - the net, the web, the power grid, our circle of friends, our sex partners - and that they are in fact very similar to one another.<P>The phrase "six degrees of separation" comes from the fact that two randomly chosen people, A and B, will on average be connected by six social links. A knows C who knows D who knows E who knows F who knows G who finally knows B. Considering the world has over 6 billion people, an average separation of 6 seems unbelievable small, but the explanation of this incredible phenomenon lies in the makeup of our social network. Our close friends know each other but our cluster of friends has weak ties to other clusters through acquaintances, people we really don't know that well - that's why when one is looking for a job, it's better to tell an acquaintance rather than a friend so that our inquiry can jump to other clusters. Our social network is essentially highly clustered but enough links exist between these clusters to allow us to jump from ourselves to any other person through just an average of six links. Buchanan shows us how this kind of network exists everywhere as mentioned above although he distinguishes between egalitarian networks where clusters are roughly the same size and aristocratic networks such as the WWW where gigantic hubs like Amazon.com exist that link to millions of websites. <P>One of the most interesting chapters in the book deals with sexual networks. It turns out that in the network of sex partners, certain people have a great many more links than the average person in the network. Buchanan explains how the structure of the sexual network actually accounts for the rapid spread of HIV. The virus spread quickly because the hubs in the network spread it to their numerous partners. In fact, it turns out that a significant percentage of the inital HIV cases had a sexual relationship with one particular flight attendant.<P>As I wrote in my review for Strogatz's Sync, we are entering an era of science where disparate fields of study are being linked because many phenomena that we used to regard as unrelated now appear to have very similar underlying bases. It is exciting to read books like Nexus because it illustrates this point. You should definitely read this book if your are interested in the science of networks and want to know how so many different phenomena are being explained by the same underlying principles.</span>
