                <span id="Label1">More than just a translation, Richard Wilhelm's <I>I Ching</I> is a profound introduction to the Chinese world-view. The <I>I Ching</I> (<I>Yi Jing</I>) is recognized by both Confucians and Taoists as a foundational work, and Wilhelm shows why. He separates his work into three books. The first book is about the hexagrams--the meanings of the lines and Wilhelm's extensive comments. The second presents two early commentaries that interpret the wisdom of the divinatory text, also with Wilhelm's helpful notes. And the third book takes us back to the hexagrams for more detailed commentary from both ancient Chinese thinkers and Wilhelm. Wilhelm is able to offer such enormous assistance because he spent the better part of a decade in China studying under classically trained scholars. His love for the work is thus as broad as his understanding.  <p> The <I>I Ching</I> was originally used for divination, kind of like palm reading or interpreting the stars. It differs from simple prognostication, however, in that it demands us, as diviners, to cultivate an understanding of the world and ourselves. Without this understanding, the text is useless, hence the value of the commentaries, particularly Wilhelm's. This version is not without its biases, of course--it is a European's understanding of the <I>I Ching</I>, through a late-Qing dynasty Confucian perspective, translated into English by a Jungian psychoanalyst. Nonetheless, it succeeds like no other. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>I was set into the path of The I Ching in an unusual way: by reading a sci-fi classic "The Man in the High Castle". The I Ching is used all along that interesting book and my curiosity was aroused.
<br />I've started reading the first translation I was able to catch. Then I bought William Legge's translation. Finally I discovered Wilhem's translation and I was amazed.
<br />So many deep commentaries & explanations! It was and is a delightful experience 
<br />The fact that Wilhem was a Christian missionary do not diminish the insightful lessons, it make them more understandable for Westerners that as myself have a Christian background.
<br />
<br />This is not a book to read lightly, is full of ancient wisdom and each hexagram is discussed lengthily.
<br />When used for divination many meaningful paths are at your disposition. You must be patient and read each answer more than once. The Book of Changes will never fail you. May be sometimes it will let you baffled. May be other times the answers are not the ones you were expecting. But if you put your questions in writing and date them as I did, you'll see how accurate the answers were, and even if at the moment you are not able to understand them, after a time they will be clear for you.  
<br />An extra feature is Carl G. Jung's foreword, it gives the reader a very short & compact introduction to the significance of this book and also how you can use it.
<br />
<br />Afterwards I have collected some other versions and translation of this amazing book, but Wilhem's remains unsurpassed.

                    <span>The pages written by Dr. Jung alone are worth reading. I've gotten very amazing answers using the oracle. The answers that were incomprehensible may have had something to do with my less than perfect "Ling". Also, the Instructions for consulting the oracle are in the back of the book.

                    <span>Have you ever wondered how the duality of exhistance ought to be?  Why society seems so profoundly different from the oddness of our predetermined day?  Indulge in this great read.  There is no other - that can compete with well over six thousand years of tried and true universal truths.  You know, the unspoken beauty that eminates from our event horizon.  Not quite following me?  Get the book, read it, love it and just be.  Raise your conscience to a more universal level.</span>

                    <span>This book is my first exposure to I Ching divination.  Mr. Wilhelm went through a lot of detail except he forgot to mention just how does one use it... but no matter.  The information like "9th line in the second place... can be found on the internet).  This book is so detailed that it's not something I'd recommend sitting down and reading, you'd get lost (or bored).  It's more like an unfinished sculpture that you keep chipping at mentally.  Armed with the basics, 3 pennies, and the book, you can start divining immediately.  I must say that the book's answers are uncanny.  You can ask questions on the past, present and future (even other people...:-))  And somehow the hexagrams line up exactly to answer your question.  The language is a bit old-fashioned and it takes some intuition to figure out what the I Ching is telling you based on Wilhem's explanation alone. This translation should be on your shelf as a reference, even you eventually get a simpler breakdown of the I Ching.  I recommend it.</span>
