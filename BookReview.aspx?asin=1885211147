                <span id="Label1">By the time you read the first of these "Traveler's Tales,"  you'll be flipping to the back of the book to find out more about how  to get to Nepal. The country's beguiling mysteries are revealed by  teachers, musicians, photographers, poets, and authors such as Peter  Matthiessen and Broughton  Coburn. Carefully selected quotes from other writers end every  section, helping to give another perspective on each theme. <p> Charlie Pye-Smith sums up the essence of this collection in <I>Travels  in Nepal: A Sequestered Kingdom</I>: "I believe that there are a  few memories which we carry with us beyond death and from which we  shall never be free.... Perhaps it is just a smile or a strand of hair  or the smell of warm breath, caught in a chunk of light and time and  frozen like a fly in amber. But sometimes there is more than that, a  whole world with movement and sound and changing colour."</span>

                    <span>This collection of essays and excerpts about Nepal and her people greatly exceeded my expecations. The editor displayed refreshingly high standards when it came to picking which authors to include. The writing is of high quality, and the vast range of works included gives you an thorough, unvarnished look at all aspects of life and travel in Nepal. Taken together the entries accomplish the difficult task of helping the visitor-to--be know what it will FEEL like to be there.<P>You just don't get this kind of stuff out of guidebooks.<P>The book has enhanced my trip preparations and brought my excitement about going to Nepal to a fever pitch. I highly recommend this to anyone about to make a similar journey.<P>I hope to find more books in this series available for all the other countries on my travel wish list.</span>

                    <span>This is the book to read when you are sitting around in Pokhara by the lake, or hanging out in your hotel room. Full of the quirky flavor of travel in Nepal. And yes, of course, I'm biased -- I wrote one of the stories in it -- but I don't make any money by getting you to buy it. Just like the book and want it to stay in print!</span>

                    <span>Traveler's Tales is the postmodern guidebook. Instead of lists of iteneraries, temple admission prices and grainy photos, the authors of this book allow the reader to imagine Nepal in all of its tantalizing fullness. The excerpts selected range on topic and style, but all present unique aspects of the Nepali experience-- rural and urban, male and female, touristic and holistic. In opening the pages you can smell the spice markets, hear the chants of priests, feel the grinding poverty, inhale the crystalline Himalayan air and allow yourself to be carried down the narrow alleys of Pokhara. After reading Traveler's Tales: Nepal, I assue you you'll immediately run to Expedia to check fares to Kathmandu.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book, it was a great travel book. This book gave me insights into the culture and beliefs of Nepal, not just places to stay or to eat like most travel books. All of the stories were unique and made me really excited to hop on a plane and travel there. With this book I know what to expect once I get there and know enough not to offend their culture as an American.<P>I recommend using this to supplement a Fromer's or Lonely planet travel book.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book is indeed a great experience. I am really thankful that people abroad have made the effort to introduce Nepal's romantic realities to the world. I am sure that anyone who wants to know about Nepal would definitely benefit from this book. I am glad that I bought this book and learnt so much about my own country. To be honest though being a native, I was not familiar with the panoromic details about Nepal that the book has captured. After reading various tales collected in the book I am inspired to visit those beautiful places and experience the joy myself.</span>
