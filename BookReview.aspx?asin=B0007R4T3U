                    <span>A hotel manager houses Tutsis refugees during their conflict with the Hutu militia.  Heartwrenching performances and the overall message of bravery and courage were defined clearly by Mr. Don Cheadle.  There is a definite lesson in this movie about giving of oneself and the testament of the human spirit.  High recommend.</span>

                    <span>"Hotel Rwanda" is the story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a resort hotel manager who turned his hotel into a refugee camp, trying to save ethnic Rwandians from a deadly civil war.  Paul is very smart man, and now he puts all his managment skills, favors, (or just plain bribary) to work to barter for food and safty.  Don Chedle puts in the performance of a lifetime here, he exibits the quiet strength and resorcefulness in a very believable delivery.  Likewise, Nick Nolte also puts his best work in many many years as the UN peace keeping soldier who means well, but is hamstringed by politics.  This movie tells a story that I can not remember hearing about on the news.  I was thinking when I watched this movie that it is a shame that such a huge news event went unnoticed.  Then I found out it wasn't.  There were a lot of news stories about the Tutsi tribe being murdered by the Hutu.  The I also found out most Americans were not anxious to go over there and help, not after the incident in Mogadishu, Somolia where 18 U.S. soldiers were killed the year before.  It was up to this one little man, a hotle manager, to save over 800 native Rwnadians, whether they were Tutsi or Hutu.</span>

                    <span>Hotel Rwanda is an excellent film that has obvioulsy pulled at a lot of heart strings judging from the comments by reviewers on this site. Well, people ... it's all happening again, right now in Darfur. The Sudan area is and has been suffering for quite sometime and again, no one is really taking an interest in the plight of the innocent. All you people who have written reviews claiming to have been "changed" by this movie, here's your chance to take some action. Do some research, find out about the current genocide happening right now and take some action. Whether it's spreading the word, making donations, or writting your elected representatives to push for US involvement. Don't wait to see a movie in about 10 years to find out about events going on right now.</span>

                    <span>Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan Hutu and manager of the luxurious Mille Collines hotel.  The film is efficient in its story-telling and we are told early that there has been tension ever since the Belgians left because when the Belgian colonists first came to Rwanda they arbitrarily divided up the native Africans into the more elegant and fair-skinned Tutsis and the darker, broader-nosed Hutus.  The Belgians gave a measure of power to the small amount of Tutsi's, and after Belgium leaves the tensions escalate.
<br />
<br />Rusesabagina is a Hutu, married to a Tutsi (in a wonderful performance by Sophie Okonedo).  A peace agreement is quickly ignored, the Rwandan President's plane is shot from the sky, and the Hutu's are driven by voices of hatred to "Cut the Tall Trees" - a chilling phrase we are told early on is a "signal" for Hutus to murder Tutsis.
<br />
<br />Rusesabagina opens the doors of the Mille Collines to everyone, most significantly to terrified and hiding Tutsis.  Don Cheadle is the heart and soul of this movie, and we are amazed as we watch him save 1,200 lives by bribing, pleading, outsmarting and standing up to the murderous forces that come to the Mille Collines.  There are several astonishing scenes where Paul essentially shames white Europeans and his Rwandan staff into "doing the right thing".  At one point he is quite certain that the hotel is about to be over-run and everyone inside murdered.  He is incredibly calm as he phones the Belgian headquarters of his hotel company (a brief, but effective cameo by the wonderful Jean Reno) and thanks the company for what they have done, then informs him that they are about to all be killed. 
<br />
<br />Nick Nolte brings the right combination of fear and fearlessness to the role of the Canadian Colonel representing the United Nations, leading a tiny force of UN "peacekeepers, not peacemakers" - he and his troops have their hands tied.
<br />
<br />This film effectively displays the irrationality of hate crimes and genocide.  The accompanying documentaries are enlightening showing the real Paul Rusesabagina, and we get a sense that the heroism shown in the movie is no exaggeration.  We are also chillingly reminded that genocide is ongoing in Africa (at present in the Congo and Sudan).  The challenge is plainly issued for the world to step up.</span>

                    <span>i cannot begin to explain the affect this film had on me. prior to viewing this film i had limited knowledge of what really went on in Rwanda 1994. as the genocide took place when i was about ten years old, world politics was not my priority and the shocking reality was not brought to my attention.
<br />
<br />this shocking yet amazing tale of paul rusesabagina's courage is uttertly astonishing. Although i was disgusted by the UN's lack of intervetntion i was astounded by one ordinary hotel managers bravery. 
<br />
<br />This is the sort of film that people need to see. people often like to try to ignore things that are going around us and pretend that they are not happening, but this is reality and the fact is that genocides such as this did take place. after watching this film you find yourself thankful for the civilised societies we live in and if you live in the western world you will certainly not take it for granted.
<br />
<br />This is an unforgettable must see movie that will move you like few films have the power to do.</span>
