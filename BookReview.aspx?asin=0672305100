                    <span>I start off with saying that this is the best book to buy if you have never even programmed before. This book gives you the best start you can get..Dont buy books like "C for dumbies" by googin or whatever his name is. I seriously reccomend this book. It starts of with standard I/o like printf() and scanf() et cetera...Then goes on to teach you data structers, loops, heap memory, intermediate i/o, and making your own functions. It teaches you how to organize your code and make it more easier to read. The writer puts everything in a CLEAR easy to read way, unlike other books that explain things in a very difficult manner and don't put much depth into it or make jokes to get the point through like your stupid. After this book I reccomend "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie. Buy this book and you won't regret it...That's a fact. Just don't think that your a master at C after you read it. Practice will make you a better programmer.!</span>

                    <span>I've always wanted to program and was fortunate to have bought this book. Unfortunately it was a year after buying K&R which, even though it was easy to do "hello world" didn't explain the language to me. <P>I like to know why things are done how they are and this book clearly explains what a seasoned programmer may see as obvious without the tech speak ... and I myself am a techy.<P>Although I've not completed the book yet, lots of code I've seen before now makes literal sense to me. This is a great text for teachers who may also want to touch on C with a class of youthfull programmers.<P>A wonderful buy ... 5 stars</span>

                    <span>I am 13 years old and I just finished reading this book. I got interested in programming after playing some of my favorite games, and so this is where I started. This is a great and very easy to read book. I would seriously recommend this book for beginners or people who used to program in a different language (BASIC, Java).</span>

                    <span>If you've never programed before, this is the book for you. I've tried several different books, and most either start out by pointing out that the author doesn't "really" think you're the village idiot, or drone on about why C is too complicated for mere mortals to swallow anyway. <P>Instead, Perry leaps right into the coding while minimizing the techno-babble. He makes it seem as easy as it really is, from start to finish. He starts with the basics, keeping them basic, and presents each new concept in an easily digestable manner. The information flows so easily and coherently that you'll be surprised at how quickly you're picking it all up. This isn't to say that learning C won't take dedication on your part, just that it is not rocket science as most would have you believe.<P>By the time you've finished the book, you'll have a decent understanding of how to write simple DOS programs. Once you feel comfortable with C, I'd recomend Charles Petzold's, "Programming Windows". Windows programming is a bit more complicated, but with Perry's help you'll be better prepared to takle it.</span>
