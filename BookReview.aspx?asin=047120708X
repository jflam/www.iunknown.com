                <span id="Label1">Learn how to use the hottest new Java open source tools for eXtreme Programming<br>   eXtreme Programming (XP) is a new development methodology for building software systems quickly without sacrificing quality. New Java open source tools have appeared recently that help with the most time-consuming and difficult part of the XP process-testing, integration, and deployment. Java Tools for eXtreme Programming is the first complete guide to using those tools for XP. Throughout the book, author Richard Hightower uses a sample application to demonstrate how each Java tool is used. For each tool, he provides a concise description of key concepts, plenty of code examples, and directions for setting up scripts for automating the development step in which the tool is used. The book also features a detailed reference to each of the major tools, complete with coding examples.<br>   * XP is the most popular new development methodology<br>   * A practical, code-intensive guide to the tools that enterprise Java developers need when using the XP methodology to build applications<br>   Companion Web site features sample code, XP software tool updates, and links to useful XP sites.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book hoping for a quick jumpstart to getting a simple xdoclet/struts app up and running.
<br />
<br />The example code from the "Building Struts Apps with Ant and XDoclet" is so bad, it's a disgrace.  I spent more time figuring out why their code wasn't even close to working, than I would have if I had just skipped their book altogether.  It couldn't work, it never worked, and it shouldn't have been published.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book based on the title and the preview content here on Amazon (I couldn't find it at the B&N near my work). I was very pleasantly surprised at the practical, nuts-and-bolts approach that the authors took to XP and the tools in this book. I was also extremely pleased at how well the authors showed the integration of these tools into a sophisticated and professional development environment. This is not easy, especially when working with a wide range of tools which includes
<br />* CVS
<br />* Ant
<br />* XDoclet
<br />* JUnit
<br />* JUnitPerf
<br />* Bugzilla
<br />* JMeter
<br />* Cactus
<br />* jcoverage
<br />* Swing testing tools like Jemmy
<br />* Maven
<br />* Anthill
<br />
<br />And even though all these tools are O.S., some projects are very territorial (eg they consider other tools to be the competition) so just reading the docs will not always help you choose the right tool for the right job or learn how to use the tools together.
<br />
<br />The code I downloaded from the Wrox site was a little rough (some missing files), but the version I downloaded last week was *much* better and has solved all the earlier problems I was having. I'm glad the authors were responsive and willing to release fixes. Great stuff!</span>

                    <span>Seriously, I can't find any other book right now that lays Maven out in such an easy to approach way.  All the material online is reference based entirely and my fingers are practically bleeding from digging through google every five seconds.  If you've never setup Maven before, buy this book while you still have your hair.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book mostly because I am fairly new to open-source development and was looking for a good reference to tools such as Ant, JUnit, Cactus, and Maven. These chapters were concise and had plenty of supporting examples. I also liked the fact that the book provides plenty of tips, and has references to good practices. I definitely recommend it to less experienced developers, or to those looking to have a better understanding of open-source tools.</span>

                    <span>This book is a convenient way to get a decent introduction to Java tools because all of the information is condensed into one book.  However, there is nothing in here that you can't read online for free if you take the time to find it.  I am really angry that I paid $40 for a book that is full of typos.  There are literally typos on every other page.  I have never encountered so many typos in a book before this one.  The typos are especially troublesome because they often occur in the examples so if you are unfamiliar with the syntax of the new tool being taught you will get unexplainable errors when the bad examples don't work for you.  Print out online tutorials, this book is a waste of money.</span>
