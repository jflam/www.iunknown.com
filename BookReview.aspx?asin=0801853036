                <span id="Label1">Long before Jackie Robinson crossed baseball's color line, before Jack Johnson spawned a line of Great White Hopes desperate to take the heavyweight boxing crown back from a black man, Major Taylor was setting records and fighting bigotry in one of the most popular athletic arenas of the turn of the century. The "Extraordinary" in the title of this steady biography is not just spinning wheels.<p> Both a world and national champion, Taylor bicycled to glory on three continents. His name on the marquee meant added revenue and attendance. In Europe, he was a superstar, and treated like one. Yet he was mocked by fellow riders in America, shunned by his sport's establishment, and died forgotten and penniless in Chicago in 1932. Part of why Taylor should be remembered is the way he reacted to the hatred he had to ride against: "I always played the game fairly and tried my hardest," he wrote in his own autobiography, which Ritchie thoroughly mines, "although I was not always given a square deal or anything like it ... I only ask from them the same kind of treatment which I give and am willing to continue to give."<p> Ritchie does yeoman's service in reviving Taylor's story and giving it context with a carefully studied examination of what life was like for black Americans 100 years ago. More importantly, he reaches into the muck of the past and returns with a clear picture of an endangered species: the thoroughly decent human being. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>As Ritchie points out himself, it is surprising that it took a white englishman to compile such a comprehensive history of an American black man who was one of, if not the first black world champion in any sport and one of cycling's orginal superstars. 
<br />
<br />While the book makes for a good short history of the early years of cycling as a sport and how it has evolved, Taylor's transcends the sport of cycling and provides a rich glimpse into early 20th century racial issues, the development of transportation in the US, the twighlight of the Guilded Age and the onset of the Great Depression. Ritchie weaves all of these together in a compelling manner.
<br />
<br />In hindsight, while the likes of Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson are often credited with being the original trailblazers for black athletes, they owe much to the brave steps taken by the now sadly little remembered Major Taylor. This book is long overdue. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book was originally published by Bicycle Books in San Francisco. I would hope that it would still be available, even though 5 years ago hardback copies were selling at chain bookstores for as little as $4 a  copy. The Ritchie book is written not just from the perspective of  bicycling history (although it is well-researched from that point of view),  but as an important social history. In addition, it reminds us of the  history of the development of transportation and how bicycles were  eventually pushed out of the public vision of having right-of-way to being  relegated to the closed track of the velodrome so they wouldn't get in the  way of the growing automobile culture.  Major Taylor's career is important  in the history of racism and attempted and often effective exclusion of  Blacks not just from racing opportunities, but from the subsequent business  opportunities that followed on the heels of the age of the  turn-of-the-century racers. The largest reason that Major Taylor died a  pauper was because he was not allowed to participate on an equal level with  White businessmen in the developing automobile industry, according to  Ritchie's research. Turn of the century bicycle racers, as Ritchie points  out, were instrumental in contributing to the design of the shock system  and the use of pneumatic tires, among other features, of the emerging  American automobile. They also were some of the large investors in the  industry upon their retirement from active racing status. Taylor wanted to  participate in the design process and applied to a university for formal  education in engineering, but was denied access, despite his hard-won  efforts, previous inventions in bicycle design and testing, and celebrity  status. The fact that the man died early of a stroke and alienated from his  family and community in the end can only speak of a man who, after putting  out his entire life, had finally been broken by the pressure of living in a  racist society. Yet, writing his autobiography and selling it door to door  evokes the phoenix-like quality of many members of the Black community who  survive and thrive in spite of great hardship, even in our present times.</span>

                    <span>This is a very enjoyable book.  Very well researched and documented (almost to a fault).  Anyone who is serious about the history of bicycle racing in the USA must add this book to their library.  After reading this  book one must wonder how great Major Taylor would have been if the playing  field was equal.  Highly Recommended!!</span>

                    <span>I found this story of a black man in this early 1900 era extremely fascinating.  His beliefs in fair play, extrodinary dedication to his faith and his hobby made him a role model for any and all to follow.  his persistance in perfecting his beloved sport despite all of the negativity of this era, to me was unbelieveable.

I read few books cover to cover but I have had the pleasure of reading this one 4 times.  Ritchie has this book so well documented that anyone reading it would have no problem of becoming totally engrossed in it.  A well done from me.</span>
