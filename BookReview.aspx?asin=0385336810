                    <span>As soon as I saw this novel by Sophie Kinsella, masterful author of the Shopaholic series, I grabbed it off of the shelf and shirked all weekend chores to polish it off. Kinsella has not lost her ability to get her character into a sticky "I can't believe this is happening" situation.<P>It was a fun read - that's for sure. But the ending was rather disappointing - lots of build-up for a predictable, not-completely-satisfying conclusion. It almost seemed like Kinsella tried to cop-out of developing the ending, as if she were tired of writing the book. <P>Emma, the main character, is likeable and believable, but just so similiar to Becky from the Shopaholic series. Sure, she's got her own quirks... but I think the problem is in Kinsella's wonderful writing voice - the writing style between the novels is so similiar that the reader is bound to make comparisons, even when the descriptions are different. I didn't think Emma was quite as engaging as Becky; when reading Shopaholic, I began to feel like I was the one with an overdrawn account.<P>This is a good read, but some of Kinsella's creativity was lost. I almost wish she'd focused her efforts on a fourth Shopaholic book. I mean, can you imagine what Becky would be like trying to decorate a nursery and preparing for motherhood?</span>

                    <span>I have to say, I was a bit let down by this book. I am a huge fan of Ms. Kinsella's Shopaholic series, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of this. I made my husband drive me to a bookstore while were on vacation, so I could get this book the day it came out. I have to admit, if I wasn't an insomniac, I may not have finished it, but it is an easy read, so I was able to polish it off in a couple of nights. Now, for the part about why I didn't like it. This kind of book is not deep, so I wasn't expecting that, however, I was hoping to connect with the character, or even the story, and I didn't do either. Sort of amusing, and I'm sorry to say, sort of boring. Sorry Ms. Kinsella! If you havn't rushed out to buy this, borrow a copy or wait for paper. This book won't stop me trying her next one, but I just didn't think it was up to the Shopoholic books. Next time!</span>

                    <span>Okay, Emma is slightly dopey with all her little secrets, but haven't we all at one time or another left the scene of the copy room when the paper got jammed? Believing she'll never lay eyes on the handsome stranger who sits beside her on a turbulent flight, Emma reveals her innermost secrets and most fatal character flaws. The fun begins when the stranger turns up on her job. He's the CEO! Be prepared to laugh uproariously.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantasic read. Emma is a character everyone of us can relate to. She is a little off the walls but a true princess. She is constantly being caught in the act if not with her boring boyfriend Connor then its nipping off for coffee with her collegue. <BR>Jack her boss who she deeply fancys but will not acknowledge is every girls dreams, full of surprises. This book captures your imagination. From secrets of uncomfortable thongs to poisioning spitefull friends plants, you will laugh out loud for the entire book. You will not be able leave this down.</span>
