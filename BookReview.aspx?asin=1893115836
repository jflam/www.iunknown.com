                    <span>I love this book because it's not so much about theory (leave that in college or for newbies) it's more about how to apply code to real-world problems.  something that I find hard to find. :-)<p>like it.</span>

                    <span>No sense repeating what's been said; read the other reviews to<br>find out what the book covers. One of the benefits I got out of<br>using Garth's book is that it's organized in a manner that helps<br>me be more productive. When using it as a reference, info is easy<br>to find, and the code samples are not all trivial as in many<br>other books. Therefore, one can derive new solutions to issues<br>not covered in the book. My copy has been loaned to three others,<br>and is dogeared from use.<br>This one stays in the toolbox.</span>

                    <span>I compared this book with several others & it stands head and shoulders above them. The extensive coding provides examples that not only explain "how-to" for those familiar with T-SQL, but also provide "Oh, you can do THAT?" types of functionality for those becoming familiar with the language. <p>This probably shouldn't be the first book in one's SQL reference library as not all the material would be appropriate for beginners ... but if your interests/work take you onto the programming side, this is a must-have.</span>

                    <span>Garath Wells book is a unique guidance to T-SQL programming.<p>In "easy to read terms" the book explains working with T-SQL and gives you the basic skills to write effective Stored Procedures and triggers.<p>The book gives many, easy to understand examples that help you build your own code. I often use the book as a T-SQL-manual. Many of my existing SQL server applications has now been tuned to run mush faster with less code thanks to the skills I developed though this book.<p>If you are new to Stored Procedures or just want to learn more - don't hesitate to buy "Code-Centric: T-SQL Programming with Stored Procedures and Triggers"</span>
