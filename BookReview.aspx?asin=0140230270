                    <span>I had initially read "The Pact", given to me by a friend, and absolutely loved the work of Jodi Picoult. I ordered "Harvesting the Heart", and read in less than two days. Another "could-not- put-it-down-until-I-knew-the- ending" type of book. The characters are real and believable, and you could picture them living next door to you. I, personally, am not a mother (yet!), but reading this book gave me insight into motherhood, marriage and love...and what they truly entail. The story of Paige and Nicholas is truth in fiction. And as with "The Pact", I did not want this book to end, but to continue on to see exactly what happens in the lives of these people who are dealing with emotions that many readers can connect with. A moving story of, simply, life...and definitely worth reading.</span>

                    <span>Although Harvesting the Heart was one of the first books that Jodi Picoult had written, it was one of the last of her books that I read and I must say that it was just as great as all the others! I have fell in love with Jodi's writing and have yet to find another author that I enjoy as much as her. Her writing style stays the same throughout all of her books, but the story lines change. They aren't the classic love stories, but rather Jodi's books tell a story that we can all relate to. Jodi makes the characters in "Harvesting the Heart so real. I found myself hating Nicolas for treating his wife the way he did. I found myself intrigued by Paige and her choices and talents. I couldn't help but laugh and cry with the characters in the book! If you loved "Harvesting the Heart" you will love any others written by Jodi Picoult.</span>

                    <span>I have read every single book Jodi Picoult has written. I am on my way to purchasing the eleventh, My SIster's Keeper. This woman is absolutely amazing. Well, The Pact is about two teenagers, a boy and a girl, who grow up living next door to eachother. Well, the lovestruck teens decide to make a pact and commit suicide together. The story unfolds the truth behind their 17 years together, from being infants in joint cribs to becoming highschool seniors! Picoult throws in a courtroom dramam that keeps you turning the pages!</span>

                    <span>AFter reading many of the reviews in here, I went to buy the book, excited to read it! Well, it only took me 3 months to finish it! I just couldn't pick it up! It was a chore to get thru this one. I so enjoyed the Plain Truth but Harvesting the Heart just didn't flow as well. Very tough to stay interested. However, the last 100 pages were very good and the only part of the book worth reading. I'm now a bit hesitant to read a third Judy Picoult book.</span>

                    <span>I have now read three novels by Jodi Picoult and have loved every one. This is a good book about relationships, motherhood and the choices we make. The book centers around Paige and Nicholas Prescott. Paige is a co-dependent mother who has recently given birth to a son, but who seriously doubts her abilities as a parent. So, she leaves her son with his father for a time and goes off in search of answers about herself, her mother and her life. As we as the reader travel with Paige throughout this journey of self discovery, we find out that Paige is indeed a strong woman in her own right. Nicholas Prescott is a Cardiologist at the top of his game, he is very stoic however and has a bit of a God complex. He goes through a transformation of his own and soon we are able to get a glimpse at what at his good qualities as well and also see what agood father he is. This is a good book to curl up with on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Ms. Picoult is a masterful writer who gets the reader involved in the lives of her characters and really makes you care about them. More than once since finishing this book, I have wondered how Nicholas and Paige are doing.</span>
