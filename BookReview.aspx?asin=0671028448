                    <span>When Tupac Shakur was killed, the world went into mourning.  Not because of another brother felled, but because a dominating lyrical force would be no more.  THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE is a collection of poems, brilliantly written, without premise or shame from a young man who constantly fought against society's injustices, cruelties and convictions.
<br />
<br />Realizing that life is nothing but a collection of soul searching, Tupac captures his deepest feelings on paper during a time of loss, pain and anger.  Most of these poems written in this anthology are from his teen years, while others are from his stint in prison, where he was able to let his rawest emotions flow without prejudice.  He freely voices his opinions on life, honestly faces his views on love and shamelessly embraces the mistakes he made, making sure to poetically infuse his "language" into the hearts of many.
<br />
<br />With passion and grace, Tupac commanded respect.  He wished for hope and peace; within himself and the world.  THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE is a vivid snapshot of who the man really was, a picture of a lyrical genius.  Although it's been a number of years since his departure, he has left a legacy that will never be erased.

                    <span>Appropriately juvenile and genuine, The Rose That Grew From Concrete, by Tupac Shakur, provides an interested reader with a volume of heart felt and raw poetry written by the late Shakur at the impressionable age of 19. The entire collection is strongly unified by themes of faith, love, poverty, and racism. Most of his poems and entries are organized into traditional meter and rhythm that some may recognize from his song lyrics. Having grown up with music, I not only valued this book for its content, but I also appreciated the explicit and human way in which it was presented. Each individual poem is shown side by side on corresponding pages. The left side of the spread contains a photocopy of Shakur's handwritten text, while the right side is the same poem, but in a traditional font and structure. Upon reading his poetry for the first time, I was strongly affected by the original format. I found myself more able to associate with the young street poet, and the emotions evoked by the words alone can be magnified by his shorthand penmanship. This book is ideal for those who value Tupac's music and philosophies, however it would also prove very entertaining and informative to those who know next to nothing about the controversial artist.</span>

<br />
<br />This book is remarkable! This is about how Tupac began writing poetry like any other person. This book made me feel like I can write my own poetry and become a hit when I grow up. Tupac is an inspiration to all. If you understand how he writes you'll love it, most definetely...You'll see...
<br />
<br />Trust me, you'll feel his words...

                    <span>I know most reviewers are giving this book 5 stars because of their love for Tupac but if we examine the book objectively we see that it is a very poorly written book of poetry. While Tupac displays tremendous emotion he doesnt quite understand rhythm or structure too well and it seems he tries too hard to create an artistic vision that lower his poems into a category of sloppy and trite high school works. I know his fans will counter that he was 19 when he wrote these works but don't call him a master of poetry because he clearly was not. But the most dissapointing aspect for me was the complete lack of subtilty in his works. With the majority of his works you can understand the complete theme and concept of the poem by just reading the title and none of the poem itself.
<br />
<br />Tupac was a very talented man with out a doubt. But that talent was in rapping (and acting) not writing poetry. I'd much rather listen to 2Pacalypse Now than read this book.</span>
