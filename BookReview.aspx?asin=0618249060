                <span id="Label1">First published by Houghton Mifflin in 1962, Silent Spring alerted a large audience to the environmental and human dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides, spurring revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water.&#160;"Silent Spring became a runaway bestseller, with international reverberations . . . [It is] well crafted, fearless and succinct . . . Even if she had not inspired a generation of activists, Carson would prevail as one of the greatest nature writers in American letters" (Peter Matthiessen, for&#160;Time"s 100 Most Influential People of the Century). This fortieth anniversary edition celebrates Rachel Carson"s watershed book with a new introduction by the author and activist Terry Tempest Williams and a new afterword by the acclaimed Rachel Carson biographer Linda Lear, who tells the story of Carson"s courageous defense of her truths in the face of ruthless assault from the chemical industry in the year following the publication of Silent Spring and before her untimely death in 1964.</span>

                    <span>I didn't think that this book was very interesting and I didn't think that this book was very dull either. It made me think about some of the current issues of today that deal with pesticides. Rachel Carson talks about how insecticides are sprayed to kill insects, but they not only kill the target insects, but also those that no one wants to kill. Now, in present day, there have been sprayings to get ride of the mosquitoes carrying the West Nile Virus. I was wondering what other insects/animals we are killing. Even though the West Nile virus is a serious disease, it does not affect the majority of the population. Less then one percent! Is that enough to risk endangerment of hundreds of animals? Or even humans that will come in contact with the insecticides? <BR> Also, she talks about how once pesticides are in the water; it is very hard to get rid of them. This reminded me of a present day issue about the "Frankinfish." They are putting pesticides into the water to try to rid this area of the fish, but are they thinking about the other animals that they are endangering? We are already destroying habitats of animals that we have not even discovered, why do we want to kill more? <BR>All in all, this book made me wonder about how all of this is still relevant to life in the twenty-first century and what we can do to get the results that we want without using harsh chemicals.</span>

                    <span>When Rachel Carson published "Silent Spring" in 1962, her goal was to make everyone aware of what the toxic substance DDT was doing to the delicate ecosystems in North America, most notable its role in the destruction of bird populations. After reading "Silent Spring", one can see why the book was a turning point in the movement of environmentalism.<P>Rachel Carson did a massive amount of research to study the effects that pesticides like DDT had on the environment. Her chapters are filled with highly-documented scientific facts, but they also possess a poignant element which helped stir the nation into doing something about it in the late sixties-early seventies after the book's release.<P>Al Gore's introduction eloquently details the sentiments and actions that this book prompted and it compliments the text very well.<P>This book is high on my list of recommendations.</span>

                    <span>I am pleased to write this very short review of Carson's book. I have joined an eco reading group in hopes of saving at least two or three of human kind to continue life on this planet. Carson has set the background for what my favorite scientist/writer of the 21st century, Dr. Hulda Clark has dovetailed on. It comes as no surprise that Dr. Clark books which were written starting 1993 were met by the same kind of corporate outcry and government disclaimer as what happened to Rachel Carson. I hope society learns something from how they mistreated Carson and not make the same mistake with Dr. Clark.<P>I am a strong supporter of Dr. Clark and her protocols for curing/preventing/treating many of the ills,--cancer, hiv/aids and immune system destroying diseases--as Carson fortold in her books some 42 years ago.<P>Presently, the government is dragging Dr. Clark to court because they do not want her work to be recognized for improving the health of many Americans. I SCREAM FROM THE HIGHEST TOWER THAT HER SCIENCE HAS SAVED MY LIFE AND I AM ETERNALLY GREATFUL.</span>

                    <span>In most countries, DDT was banned only for agricultural use, NOT for control of malaria, in fact it is still widely used today for that purpose. Of course this isn't a long term solution, because of the resistance problem, as Carson foretold all those years ago.</span>

                    <span>Many people are accusing this book for causing deaths in places like Africa from malaria. They aren't paying attention to what this book is trying to say. She may have said several times that DDT is dangerous, and should not be used, but she also mentioned how quickly these insects are going to evolve and adapt to it. It will not stay poisonous to them forever. Once they have adapted to it malaria will once again be a problem, and our environment will be hurt. This world is meant for many different organisms to live on. We should try our best not to interupt the cycle of nature, because we too make up a small part of nature. I thionk it is time we start thinking about every animal that will be affected, and what might happen in the long run. Please people, think seriously about this situation, don't continue on the same path of ignorance and greed!</span>
