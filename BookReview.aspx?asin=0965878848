                    <span>I decided to save time and review this book without having read it. But then it occurred to me that this would not be fair to the readers of the review as they wanted to hear about it from someone who had read it. But that would mean for me investing time in getting it, and investing more time in reading it before I wrote about it. And then I thought perhaps I could write a book about ' 175 ways to take more time' when doing something enjoyable or profitable or educational or simply good' I thought about writing which would teach us how to slow down so as to enjoy life more. And once I realized I was thinking about this I realized I was really wasting my time by writing this review for which I would get no money, no honor, nor even the real satisfaction of having done the job properly i.e. of reading the book and writing about it. 
<br />So I now think towrite a new work called "Wasting one's time by writing reviews on Amazon" and Other activities of a fool living out his own self- delusion" 
<br />And this said I apologize to the readers of this review for the time they have wasted reading this review. I actually would like to read the " 175 ways book" and find a few tips for saving time in it. For even now I feel pressed for time and know no way  out.</span>

                    <span>Author David Cottrell, founder of CornerStone Institute, has done a tremendous favor for the 21st century business community by publishing this handy and quick read.  In less time than it takes to watch a sitcom on TV, "175 Ways" inspires you to cut through the time-consuming portions of your day to have the time you need to do what you do well.<p>This little book is a "must" for every new graduate, every veteran business person and everyone in between.  Not only can you learn to save time, but you can also learn how to get the most out of every minute, whether at home, commuting or at the office.<p>By virtue of its application to every lifestyle, this book may well replace the "One-Minute Manager" as required reading for every employee of every company in America.<p>And, for the price, each time management tip is worth its weight in gold!</span>
