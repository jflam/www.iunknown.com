                    <span>I have long believed that for the most part your company pay plan is competitive within your industry.  Then by definition, you are getting paid what you are worth in your environment. As a manager/supervisor that also means that you can not reward with money.  To become successful leader, your had better look in other directions.<p>My suggestion is using Mr. Brayton's Recognizing and Rewarding Employees as your starting point.  He presents you with the tools.  We all need to consider our method of using the tools.<p>Picture the chapter headings as your core principals.  Within each principal, the author lays out methods, details, actions or thoughts to support the principals.  Take the chapter content to develop your leadership and managerial style.  We are all individuals and as such will use different styles.  However, the core principals being presented within each chapter remain constant.<p>I found it helpful and easy to grasp the principals through the side boxes and the manager's check boxes.  <p>Understand the key principals, develop the tools to fit your style and you will improve your managerial results!</span>

                    <span>Author R. Brayton Bowen takes a thoughtful approach to understanding the new generation of employees who seem to need rewards and recognition to spur their motivation. He attributes their incentive-based work ethic to workplace changes, such as downsizing and a decline in loyalty, which has tainted the work environment. Bowen proposes a variety of recognition systems, including intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and he outlines strategies for using recognition to empower the whole person. His in-depth ideas about building motivation through recognition and rewards will appeal to anyone who manages other people, from supervisors to top executives, though he cautions that true motivation can't be bought, but must come from genuine achievement and internal drive. Since Bowen provides a thoughtful context for the workings of motivational strategies, as well offering some hands-on tactics, we [...] recommend this book to managers and human resource professionals at all levels.<br /></span>

                    <span>Just as recognizing and rewarding customers lead to loyalty, the same is true for employees. Creating a caring culture is a tall order for employers, but it's exactly what employees want--and value. This book is brimming with ways to create that caring culture. Any business person can realate to the stories and examples. Best of all are the gray boxes sprinkled liberally throughout the book (almost on every page) that provide tips, tactics, and examples. I can randomly open the book and read one of these nuggests -- and within 30 seconds, I have a new insight, idea, or understanding. This book is a must-read for every manager who cares about employees.</span>

                    <span>The notion of leading from the inside out was refreshing and relevant<br />in today's world where managers often believe that changing their<br />behavior is sufficient.  I am using the notion of Recognition As A<br />Whole Person Experience in my graduate management class.  It is well<br />stated and is representative of the book as a whole.  The eye-catching<br />icons, checklists, and sidebars make the book easy to read and apply<br />to practical situations.  The book is very useful to practicing<br />managers and this is the primary group in our MBA program.  I will<br />recommend the book to them without reservation.  John T. Byrd, PhD<br />Professor of Management Bellarmine University<br /></span>

                    <span>Finding aides for managers which help make the complex subject of employee supervision, motivation and commitment understandable are rare discoveries.  Brayton Bowen's book, "Recognizing and Rewarding Employees" is one of those infrequent finds. This book includes practical, every day examples throughout. I found it could be read quickly, a few sections at a time. It is filled with real world examples throughout which include useful tips as well as insights you will conclude could only have been written by someone who's really "been there". Reading this book would be an excellent investment for all managers responsible for achieving results through others.</span>
