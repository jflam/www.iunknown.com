                    <span>Basic is a good concept of a movie. The 100 minutes you get are entertaining and suspenseful. The cast is excellent- John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Connie Neilson, Giovanni Ribisi, and other very recognizable names make this an A list group of actors. Plus, the execution of the storyline is superb and holds the interest of the viewer well. <P>The storyline is rather simple. On a routine training mission, a group of rangers encounter some problems and some of them get killed, including their leader, West (Jackson). Travolta, a former ranger and current DEA agent, is brought in because it is assumed he will get more answers than Neilson. There are two survivors of the incident, who of course, give completely differing versions of the events. This film has been compared to the Kurasawa classic Rashomon because of the differing versions of the events not lining up but it seems more Usual Suspects to me. We have just a couple of eyewitnesses who are telling us some truth and some lies when it will serve them well. Just about all the soldiers present are blamed at some point in the story for the death of West.<P>Fine and good, but Basic is way too concerned with messing with your mind and twisting the story beyond comprehension. Not long into the movie, what seemed relevent is no longer as important, and then another twist changes our previous perceptions, until finally, at the end, we are given the whole truth, that nothing we have seen really matters and that it was all a lie.<P>This would be ok, if the movie gave us some clues to figure out what was going on. Movies I have loved recently, like Identity or the Sixth Sense had massive twist endings as well, but they played fair throughout the course of the film. When you went through the movie a second time, you could see where the clues were given. The twist in this film is so far out there, it is impossible, and I call that not good storytelling, rather not fair and uninteresting. In that way, it also parallels the Usual Suspects, because that movie also was practically impossible to figure out, but the ending of that film was also more interesting. The ending of Basic is difficult to even care about. <P>Honestly, the film was well made, not dull at all, and the characters were interesting. But the movie tries too hard to lead us astray, and as a result, we are left out in left field, with no chance to care about anything that happens at the end.</span>

                    <span>John Travolta plays Tom Hardy, a ex-military Ranger now DEA agent brought in by an old friend to investigate the disappearances and/or deaths of several Army Ranger trainee's and their legendary drill instructor, Sgt. Nathan West (Jackson), during an exercise at a basic training camp, Fort Clayton, in Panama. <BR>Once Hardy gets there a series of different storys are told and changed by the trainee's that he question's on the events that occurred at this training camp. Which starts to form a huge question in the audiencies mind, WHO'S TELLING THE TRUTH? However by the end there is a huge climax and everything is explained and leaves you in half shock, half amazement. I recommend this movie to anyone who liked 'A Few Good Men' or 'Mission:Impossible'.<BR>'Basic' has terrific performances by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta although a shaky performance by Connie Nielson. It also has great supporting acts from Giovanni Ribisi, Taye Diggs, and Brian Van Holt.</span>

                    <span>Besides Identity, Basic is probably one of the best, well-made drama/suspense films I've seen. Roles were well casted; Samuel L. Jackson always makes a good, hardened army soldier, and John Travolta makes a good investigator who is very quick, nimble, if not full of mystery. I will admit it has taken a few times to watch to fully understand everything this rich plot had to offer. I would say my only reason for a 4 was the language... I usually don't mind language, but please take note this film as language-ridden like none other before it. For me it was a bit too much than what the film really called for.<P>However, weighing everything, this is a good film worth it's money.</span>

                    <span>If you don't like to think while you're watching a movie then stop reading this and go rent some overblown blockbuster. Basic is an incredible movie with more viable twists than I've seen in any other movie. It's fun to watch it multiple times simply to try to figure out how it all fits together (which, I assure you, it does). I can't help but like Travolta in this movie, and Jackson is always great. Critics panned the movie in theaters- more proof that critics actually don't think themselves- but everyone I've shown it to has enjoyed it. If you like suspense/mystery, then don't miss this one.</span>

                    <span>One's enjoyment of this movie probably will be determined by one's tolerance for being somewhat "cheated" by the screenwriter and director. If you don't mind a certain degree of dishonesty in the service of plot and surprise (and don't mind John Travolta), you'll probably rate this higher than I did. On the other hand, if you believe that a well done thriller by definition has to play fair with its audience, you'll likely feel manipulated and, yes, cheated.<P>This is one of those films that are difficult to discuss without spoiling the plot. Suffice it to say that I found the production values first rate, and the sound and action sequences generally well done. I don't mind Travolta, like Connie Nielsen, and wasn't too put off by a fairly cliched performance by Samuel Jackson as the (usual) hard-bitten Sergeant.<P>However, the movie cannot stand up to close analysis of the plot and its various devices. Sins against the viewer are committed by the screenwiter and director--the principle one being that characters who are shown to have certain knowledge at the end do not act consistently with that knowledge throughout.<P>That's all I'm going to say except that having the DVD will enable you to replay some of the scenes sufficiently to see the extent to which the viewer has been manipulated. There is honest and clever manipulation that always takes place in good thrillers, but this movie, while clever in spots, isn't very honest.</span>
