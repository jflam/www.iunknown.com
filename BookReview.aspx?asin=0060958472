                    <span>This book is a little difficult to categorise. It is not really an autobiography, it is not a poker 'how-to' manual although it does provide some interesting insights. So what is it? It seems to be a book about deciding to write a book.
<br />
<br />Andy Bellin has a simple, easy to read prose style. The book proceeds at great pace mixing personal experiences and anecdotes very effectively, providing an interesting and illuminating insight into the world of poker and addiction. I was gripped from the first chapter and read the book very quickly. It is often funny, sometimes chilling and slightly scary but it always holds your interest. It is also thought provoking as it prompts readers to consider their own attitude to gambling and addiction in general.
<br />
<br />Recommended.

                    <span>this was my first read on the subject of poker. it gives a very good feel for the real life of people who take poker very seriously.
<br />a good sociological overview of the people who let a form of gambling become too serious in their lives.

                    <span>This is not an instructional manual on how to play poker.  There are already way too many of those in publication, with every pro player writing one these days.  This book is a look at the poker lifestyle, the players, the history, with a little theory thrown into the mix.  Bellin tells some good stories and seems like a good guy, not someone who thinks he's the best poker player in the world.  This book is entertaining and informative. Read it. Poker has become huge, and now, everyone who sees it on TV thinks they can play at the professional level.  I watch a lot of basketball on TV but I know there's no way I could step onto the court and compete.  So give up the dream folks, because you're not world-class poker players.

                    <span>Bellin takes you into the excited world of Texas Hold'em through his own learning of poker and playing in underground New York card rooms.  The book give a powerful shot of the poker world, good and bad.  Infused within Bellin's wonderful stories is an insight into the strategies of hold'em.  You learn about outs, pot odds, and of course; the nuts.  The book won't teach you when to fold Seigfried and Roy (a pair of queens) or bet after the flop with big slick (Ace-King), but it will make you want to learn and play like the pros.</span>

                    <span>This book isn't for you if all you want to do is learn to be the best poker player in the world. However, if you are interested in learning about poker in several realms such as learning it, understanding it's origins, terms, positives and negatives, and stories, then this is the book for you. Honestly I couldn't put the book down and Bellin writes it beautifully. A must read. Worth every cent.</span>
