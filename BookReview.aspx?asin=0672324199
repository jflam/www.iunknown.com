                <span id="Label1"><P>The introductory chapters provide a solid basis in using Direct3D and DirectSound in a 2D gaming environment, providing not only the necessary theoretical discussions, but also sample programs that demonstrate the concepts discussed.  Once the reader learns these basic DirectX techniques, the book leads the reader through the design and programming of a console-style computer role-playing game.  As the reader builds the game piece by piece, he not only applies what he's learned about Direct3D and DirectSound, but also learns the fundamental skills needed to program games.  Currently, no other book on the market covers the same material.</P></span>

                    <span>this book does not provide a proper grounding of information for directX. when typing in source code from the book i find that i haven't seen or learned about most of the code yet. i end up having to figure out most of the language by myself through experimentation. if you are a beginner, stay away from this book because it is very confusing and irritating. I have read this book and found i couldn't really program a game. if you are an intermediate level, then you will just get confused from the frequent jumping and going suddenly to an advanced level. if you are an expert, this book won't help you as it doesn't teach you much more that basics-inter. i had to buy a second book to learn directX since this one was pointless. dont waste like $30 on this book. GET A DIFFERENT BOOK.</span>

                    <span>This book introduces DirectX 8 to beginners in a easy and clear way. I bought this book a year ago without any knowledge of DirectX and had a lot of funs with it. The whole book focuses on DirectX 2D programming and the way the author explains it is very clear. DirectX is not easy but this book definitely will give you the good start.</span>

                    <span>The author definitely sets out what he intends to accomplish, although it may not be what the reader was expecting. Everything in this book is essentially geared toward 2D game development, and covers what used to be called the DirectDraw API. The book is poorly titled, although I'd be more likely to blame the publisher than Walnum himself for that.<P>The tone of the book is very down-to-earth, and it reads fairly easily. It even borders on being patronizing, and the humor reminds me of how I act when there's a girl around that I really, really like--one just gets the feeling that he's trying too hard.<P>All in all, Teach Yourself Game Programming with DirectX is an excellent introduction to the basic features of the former DirectDraw, but anyone wanting to make a remotely modern-looking game will want to look elsewhere, or at least pick up a companion to this book.</span>

                    <span>This book provided me with a good start on learning directx. All my previous attempts to learn directx had failed. While this book doesn't dive into anything close to advanced it provides you with a good base knowledge of Directx 8 and game programming. There are some grammar mistakes, so that's why I didn't give it a 5.</span>
