                    <span>Anyone with a love of mountains or photography would be hard pressed to pass up Wolfe's "High Himalaya" offered at this price. Perhaps it would be difficult to fail to capture dazzling images, given the singularity of the books subject matter - the Himalaya are unique in their scope and majesty and even amateurs like me, equipped with a good camera, have returned from this awesome locale not only with the gnawing desire to return, but also with photos that blow friends away. Still, whenever I feel like I'd sacrifice my thumbs to be Himalaya-bound immediately, this book is one of the first I reach for. The clarity and diversity of presentation of the images makes me feel, alternately, as though I'm approaching a peak, at its base or viewing others from some overwhelming vantage point.
<br />
<br />On the technical side, a great thing about Wolfe's books is that he includes useful technical data on each photo - including camera, lenses, filters and film used for the shot, as well as exposure time - in well-designed appendices.
<br />
<br />Ultimately, however, the book's small size is its biggest drawback. Subjects of the monumentality of those in this book suffer from small-scale reproductions like these. The price, however, compensates well for this shortcoming.
<br />
<br />Finally, as to the comments of a reviewer below, baselessly disparaging Mr. Wolfe's work and drawing reckless conclusions about what this book implies for the state of our culture, I can say only that I consider his views reactionary. I own "Himalayan Odyssey" as well; though it is a remarkable book, especially given the technical limitations imposed by the equipment the photographer carried with him, those photos are not technically superior to Mr. Wolfe's in any way. Merely, the subject matter is vastly different; thus which book one prefers is a matter of taste, not "cultural" certainties. Honestly, my own photographs from this region attest that an amateur  would have a much easier time reproducing the work in "Himalayan Odyssey" than that in "High Himalaya."</span>

                    <span>Are there better photography books on this subject?
<br />
<br />Sure.....
<br />
<br />Alain Cheneviere's book is supurb, one need go no further....
<br />
<br />but the other reviewer's snide comment that Art Wolfe is a mediocre photograher at best is beyond absurd and beneath contempt....
<br />
<br />I can only attribute such nonsense to professional jealousy and/or a boatload of misplaced hubris....
<br />
<br />Wolfe is a marvelous photographer; his work in the natural world often captures both the moment and the essence of his subjects in priceless portraits; check out some of his other efforts for confirmation....

                    <span>I'ts a great book for the discounted price, I picked up my copy from a book store for 10.00, I wouldn't pay the previous price though.. while there are some great renditions within its wide covers, I have definitely seen better photography books on the Himalayan.
<br />
<br />The reviewer under me is spot on and I also suggest picking up a copy of Himalayan Odyssey if you are interested in the Himalayan, but I still think this book is worth its discounted price. I enjoyed it. </span>

                    <span>This book represents how far we've dropped visually as a culture. Especially  when there exists books out there, self published, like David Robbins "Himalayan Odyssey" that capture true insight into the Tibetan culture over a long, rigourous time and method. Instead, we're once again merely given more of the same pretty landscapes and fuzzy warm children that any passing tourist with a good working knowledge of  their camera could do. Art is (was?) a wonderful person, I'm sure, though a mediocre photographer at best.  Check out David's book for the real deal. I am a published photographer myself, albeit in a totally different genre.</span>

                    <span>This book has plenty of the stunning landscape and nature photos I expect from Art Wolfe. It's a most dramatic scenery, and Wolfe's images capture that aspect beautifully.  Three short "conversations" with noted climbers help animate the high peaks. Wolfe also includes technical/field notes for each photo.  What is wonderfully surprising to me is the light that Wolfe finds in the eyes of the people of the Himalaya. There must be something to the altitude, or maybe the benefit of living a life inextricably tied to the landscape. These people look happy, at peace with themselves, and that's the feeling that resonates with me long after I put the book down.</span>
