                <span id="Label1">From a seemingly disastrous decision to declare war to the glory of the stars and stripes, THE HISTORY CHANNEL&#174; PRESENTS: THE WAR OF 1812 chronicles of one of america's most defining moments. Only 30 years after gaining independence, the upstart United States found itself once again battling Great Britain. At stake were the future of emocracy and America's Manifest Destiny. Pitted against the world's most powerful nation, victory seemed unlikely. But then Andrew Jackson's brilliant leadership, a lone sniper, and one of the most lopsided victories in military history turned the tide of the war. THE HISTORY CHANNEL&#174; PRESENTS: THE WAR OF 1812 is the authoritative chronicle of one of America's most defining moments. THE HISTORY CHANNEL&#174; PRESENTS: THE WAR OF 1812 contains the following programs: FIRST INVASION:  THE WAR OF 1812--President James Madison declares war on Great Britain, a decision that at first appears disastrous. SAVE OUR HISTORY: THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER--The history of the stars and stripes and the poem penned as a tribute. THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS--General Andrew Jackson leads American forces to improbable victory. ANDREW JACKSON: A MAN FOR THE PEOPLE--A&E BIOGRAPHY&#174; unveils the man behind the leader, from General to President. THE IRONCLADS--A revealing look at the battleships put to sea in the War of 1812. DVD FEATURES: Behind the Scenes of "First Invasion: The War of 1812"; "Surviving an 1812 Battleship" Episode From Extreme History, hosted by Roger Daltrey; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection</span>

                    <span>I saw this on the History Channel while Channel Surfing.  I have the attention span of about 15-20 seconds before I switch channels.  This documentary caught me spellbound.  I always thought 1812 was an irrelevant war, one that just kind of happened and wasn't that important.  By viewing this film I found that at first the War looked catastrophic for America during the first bombardment of Baltimore harbor.  But then I was relieved to see Jackson's troops overwhelm the British in a victory so lopsided because the British forgot their ladders.  This victory, from original defeat solidified America as a force to be recognized.  This war symbolized America as a country which led to the Western Fronteir (via Louisiana Purchase).  This movie encapsulates what the Star Spangled Banner means.</span>

                    <span>The main 1 1/2 Hour documentary about the War of 1812 was informative, entertaining and well done.  I also enjoyed the biography episode about Andrew Jackson that was included.  Although I have no particular criticism of the documentary about the Ironclads, I am puzzled about what it is doing in this DVD set about the War of 1812 since it talks mostly about the Civil War era.  More frustrating is the fact that the specifications make you think you are getting more documentary than you really are.  The Battle of New Orleans and the Star Spangled Banner are both covered in good detail in the main documentary only to have the footage reused and repackaged as two additional seperate documentaries on these topics. Survining an 1812 Battleship, at a paultry 20 minutes, spends a good portion of its time letting the host make bad or profane jokes.
<br />Would I still have purchased the DVD set?  Maybe, but I might have waited for a used copy at a lower price if I had known how much repetition of footage there was.</span>

                    <span>I live in the Lewiston/Queenston area, one of the battle sites of this war. There are numerous plaques and statues dedicated to this war on both sides. The people living around this area on the US side have no delusions about what happened. I am a Canadian living in the US and although the History Channel may produce this type of patriotic history drivel the locals aren't buying it, I have had some humorous banter with americans about them losing this war to Canada. I just wanted to set the record straight that just because HC makes it doesn't mean thats the opinion of americans, HC makes historical entertainment shows based on demographics and board room meetings. I will still watch there shows because they are entertaining but dig deeper for the real history.</span>

                    <span>As an American history buff, I thought I knew enough about the War of 1812, but after watching "First Invasion: The War of 1812" on the History Channel, I found out I didn't know nearly as much as I should. The War of 1812 was a very pivotal moment in this country's history, and this DVD does the most amazing job of presenting the war as just that: a pivotal moment, not a "footnote" as it is so often presented in many history books. It never really dawned on me just how big a victory the Battle of New Orleans was for the United States; a rather "ragtag" group of American soldiers soundly defeated the greatest army in the world, the same army which had just defeated Napoleon! It's no wonder Andrew Jackson became such a larger-than-life figure to so many Americans after that battle. The DVD contains not just the excellent History Channel documentary, but several other programs related to the War of 1812. I especially enjoyed the episode of "Extreme History" with Roger Daltrey and the biography of Andrew Jackson. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves American history! </span>

                    <span>Well in the UK we were taught that the US LOST the war of 1812, so it is interesting to see it being given the star bangled banner treatment. 
<br />
<br />We were taught that the Americans got their **** whupped after invading Canada in a nakedly hostile act of conquest. Oh I know the programme rehashes some rather spurious pretexts but no one believed them then or should now. In any case, the truth is US forces were chased back across the border and got their capitol burned to the ground as a result. Now THERE'S a useful history lesson...
<br />
<br />The shame is that "my-nation-right-or-wrong" history like this breeds a righteousness that can be as damaging as helpful. If my nation can do no wrong then... how can it do wrong? </span>
