Over many years they've been sharing their unique knowledge with each other at conferences, around the OakTable, and in coffee shops, restaurants, and bars on five continents. Now they want to share their key insights with you. </p>  <p>A major focus of this book concerns the ways in which you can avoid common and debilitating mistakes when building Oracle software projects. From these stories, you'll learn the simple steps that will help you avoid real pain on your next (or current) Oracle project. </p></span>

                    <span>Declaration of Interest: I was lucky to have worked alongside one of the authors. So that's why I bought it.
<br />
<br />Glad I did. Read it on the beach over Easter weekend. Dipped in and out. Learned and laughed. Certain to re-read some chapters, and to refer back to it. The very different styles of the contributors make it all the more readable - you just don't know whats coming next.
<br />
<br />Its worth the price for pretty much any 3 of the 11 chapters, even if you chose them at random. And you can hit your SAN manager over the head with it, he probably won't feel a thing anyway.
<br />
<br />Thank you OakTable.
<br />
<br />But its not in your shopping cart yet is it, because I've marked it down a star. Look, there are some minor bugbears. Don't be put off, just setting expectations:
<br />
<br />1) There's some heavy name-dropping, perhaps in keeping with the project. Perhaps I'm jealous my brain isn't the size of a planet; these chaps' are. 
<br />
<br />2) You can see from (1)that HHTGT was funny once, about 20 years ago. My dad has been citing it as the answer to everything ever since; its worn a bit thin. I'm sure he would love this book for exactly that reason. 
<br />
<br />3) I'm the sure the sequel will be even better.
<br />
<br />You can put me down for 2 copies of "Seeing Double: Tales from Under the Oak Table" while I'm here.</span>

                    <span>This book is intended for Oracle internals experts who want a deep, deep drill down into the guts of Oracle to look for optimizations. It's well written and very in-depth, but you should have a look at the table of contents to make sure that you can get anything out of this book before you buy it. If you aren't the target audience then you are likely to get little or nothing out of it.</span>

                    <span>This book is not designed to teach you anything about programming, database administration, or architecture. It is an excellent series of essays about real life professional experiences. Two essays stand out above all the others. The first essay in the book about the evolution of the Oracle database provides excellent insites into how the database has changed over time.
<br />The other article that stands out is the last one by Tim Gorman about the worst project he has ever been on. The project was run so badly it put a young company out of business. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book is aimed squarely at an existing Oracle user. It offers idiosyncratic viewpoints devoted to filling in gaps in the official Oracle documentation. The authors are longtime Oracle experts who offer advice on how to optimally use various Oracle versions, and how to avoid potential pitfalls in usage. Being a mostly MySql user myself, there was little here germane to my database operations. 
<br />
<br />But the first chapter stands well apart from the rest of the book. A behind the scenes history. Presumably unfettered by Oracle's corporate lawyers. A fascinating warts and all technical commentary on the development of the Oracle database. [And there are plenty of warts.] It can and probably should be read by anyone in the database field. Enough technical details are given to illustrate the best and worst features of each major Oracle release. Yet during all this 25 years, Oracle rose from nothing to being the world's largest database company. They must have been getting crucial capabilities implemented correctly. The first chapter is a good complement to other books on Oracle that are written for a general audience. Those books describe more of the business/corporate side of Oracle. Of necessity, they had to go easy on the technical details. This chapter helps fill in those gaps. Also makes one wonder what a similar description of IBM's dB2 history would say.</span>

                    <span>You will certainly get very useful insights into managing Oracle RDBMS (up to version 10g). This book is worth every penny you are going to pay for it. I would say it is like oracles of Oracle speak! The list of authors (every one of them wrote a separate chapter) speaks for itself. Enjoy! (Your spouse might not like this book because unless you read every page of it, you won't put it down).</span>
