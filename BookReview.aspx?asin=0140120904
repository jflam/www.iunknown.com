                    <span>because it was written by a female!!!!!!!!!  PIt Bull, Running Money, Monkey Business, Liar's Poker - they are ALL worth reading... at least twice. But this book??? It is terrible!!!! Again, it was written by a female, and this is a terribly boring read. Do NOT waste your time. Read the other books above. You gain NOTHING from reading this pedantic author - she really is a waste of time.  GET TO THE POINT WOMAN! USE A CURSE WORD AT LEAST ONCE! FACE REALITy - the disgusting bIIIITch. </span>

                    <span>I am a lawyer myself, doing Masters degree right now. This book was recomended for M&A class. The reading is amazing. I read it in 4 days (taking into account that English is not my native language). I would not spend a lot of time argueing that this book is too narrative, sketchy etc. The boook is brilliant. If you are not looking for a casebook on M&A, LBO and securities but rather a kind of popular reading on the subject - you will love it.</span>

                    <span>A year or two ago I heard someone refer to "the infamous Michael Milken," and I had no idea what they were talking about.  This book gave me the answer.  The Predators' Ball tells about the rise of Drexel Burham Lambert, a second-rate bank that was completely transformed by the arrival of Michael Milken and his plans with junk bonds.  Milken broke ground in changing the way banks thought of junk bonds, those bonds that are so poorly rated that they are a substantially greater risk to investors.  The flip side to this is that if you take a risk on a junk bond you also have the possibility of making significantly more money, as the rates are much higher.
<br />
<br />Previously, other banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley wouldn't touch junk bonds, as they felt that junk bonds were "below" them.  When they saw how much money Drexel Burham Lambert was making, they began to salivate for junk bonds too.  Michael Milken pioneered this new change at Drexel Burham and became somewhat of a god-like figure.  He made Drexel Burham king of the junk bond market.  Milken decided he wanted to move to Southern California, and so he opened a Drexel Burham office there, bringing the best and the brightest in the company along with him.  He and his partners would get to work at 4:30am and stay til the wee hours of the night.  They were richly compensated for their efforts, and many became multi-millionaires in a very short period of time.
<br />
<br />This book gives you terrific insight into the world of Drexel Burham at its apex, when it was at the top of the business world.  It tells you about Michael Milken, his intense personality and the loyal following he built.  It also explains some of the inconsistencies, conflicts of interest and other problems that brought Drexel Burham to its knees and put Milken in jail.
<br />
<br />Even though this book was written many years ago, I learned a lot and enjoyed the story.  I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Intertesting book about the mega-acquisition wave triggered by the creation of the junk-bond market. It will give you some info about the social-working atmosphere at Drexel and those who along with Milken surfed the biggest financial wave in the 80's. It is an easy-reading novel. Don't expect a thorough analysis about the Junk-Bond Market and its creation.</span>

                    <span>From his humble roots to his 15 minutes of fame to his downfall, this book spans the entire career of the Junk Bond King. Memories of the 87 market crash & the SnL scandals of the 80s came back to me while reading this book. A definite must read for those interested in banking, financial history, american history & especially for business students. I found this book very helpful as background info for many of my undergraduate economics courses.</span>
