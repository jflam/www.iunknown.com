                    <span>I have spent a lot of time trying to find books that would help me improve my skills in portrait photography. I would buy a book thinking it would answer my questions on technique, and the type of equiptment used, etc., only to be disapointed in the generalness of the information. Finally I have found a book that is specific enough to learn something solid.</span>

                    <span>I got a little sleepy several times trying to muck through the text, but all the info you need to get started setting up a studio light setup is there. Technical terms abound, though, so make sure you know a gobo from a barndoor.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps it is my own fault that I didn't read the book title carefully. The book was indeed on "Studio" photography. I was hoping to get some more general expert insights on lighting and posing. Instead, I was overwhelmed with suggestion about what kind of equipments to buy. The author assume that you are a professional photographer, who owns a studio, a medium format camera, and $10k+ for some lighting equipments. If you are such photographer, you might like this book. For me, I was lucky enough to own a 35mm SLR and a decent flash. This is not a bad book and the presentation is very personal, but this book is not for me. If you are like me, who just want to improve your chances of getting good pictures of your families and friends, try ISBN 1584280344 instead.</span>

                    <span>I found this book extremely helpful. I am a beginner in studio portraiture. Allen helps you understand all of the elements that come in to play when making images of people under studio conditions. He discusses everything from light meters to posing stools to the psychology of portraiture. I recomend this book to anyone who is trying to shed some light (sorry:)) on portraite photography.</span>
