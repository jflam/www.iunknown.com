                    <span> a movie about a simple guy cursed with a normal family start's to dance well learns to dance all that jazz...or dance music whatever blah blah blah wife finds out out at first thinks he's doing something else need I say more?then (of course she hires a PI what a suprise)finds out that he's taking dance lessons then when she come to this thing...uh...compition everything turns into a bloody mess ends well of course it is a hollywood movie Richerd gere acted better than all. j-lo should really stick with music although your distracted from the plot because of the suger drenched script I mean I laughed I cryed...but after the fifth time I said "aw" I started banging my head against the coffe table. although I admitt the scene where john brought her that rose was cute but along with most of the script way to suger coated I mean if I ever saw my dad do something like that I would more than likely puke although Gere pulls off the romance thing nicely I'd rather see the japanese version myself it is most definetly sappy and over acted by all the actors except for gere  
<br />so if you like sappy romantic bad acted badly written comidies then you'll enjoy it I half did </span>

                    <span>The Japanese version of this movie falls into the comedic category of a "Manners Comedy." In a Manners Comedy, the characters are so super-concerned with what other people will think about them that they do crazy things to avoid being "found out." This is set up beautifully in the opening narrative of the original, where the narrator makes the statements about Japanese culture and reserve, how couples will not show affection in public, and that to be caught actually enbracing a stranger in public would be "beyond embarassing."
<br />
<br />The script of the original has a beautiful balance of characters who are "safe" and characters who are "dangerous." The charming older lady teacher is "safe" and the lead character naturally gravitates to her. The overweight and unfiltered "fat lady dancer" character is "dangerous" and leads, at all points in the movie, to embarrassment. Yet in the end, she too is a supportive friend and there is a wonderful mutual acceptance among ALL the characters. This is part of the charm of the movie - the notion that in the end, dancing promotes civilized, harmonious interaction. The characters are ALL exposed in the end, and that creates a caring and a bond between them.
<br />
<br />The original is a very sweet, beautiful little movie.
<br />
<br />Now to this movie:
<br />
<br />1. Richard Gere should never have been cast. It is simply  impossible to accept him as a man who feel overwhelmingly trapped in his mundane life. 
<br />
<br />2. Jennifer Lopez should never have been cast. She doesn't have the substance required for the role. For one thing, she is a terrible dancer. For another, she lacks the polish of someone who has been trained to compete at the world level in such a "sophisticated" endeavor. The role requires someone like Audrey Hepburn or Ingrid Bergman. Instead we get "barfly"
<br />
<br />3. All the fundamental conflicts and goals that drive the plot  in the movie are missing in this version. In the original movie, the main character's melancholy was brought on by a recent home purchase. There is a vitally important scene in the original movie that was left out of the remake. In the original, the Stanley Tucci character has a conversation with the Richard Gere character in which he praises the latter for being "a big success - you're moving up." In response, the Richarad Gere character says "I had to mortgage my life to the firm to pay for it." This is a fantastically critical line because it tells the audience, as early as possible, what the main character's conflict is - he feels TRAPPED. He worked all his life to buy this house and now that he has it, it feels like a ball and chain. In the same scene, the Stanley Tucci character is ridiculed by his co-workers. He too feels trapped in a life that is not right for him, too. Yet because of Japanese reserve and manners and traditions, both feel guilty - they must "do their duty" and live their lives as others tell them life should be lived.
<br />
<br />In America, the fundamental conflict that drives the whole movie really doesn't translate very well, does it? In America we all can already do pretty much anything we want. To translate the plot to Chicago would require subtlety and intelligence. This director is apparently devoid of either.
<br />
<br />In the Japanese version, the wife character is TOTALLY dependent on her husband. This is important. In the American version, the wife character seems completely independent. If she loses Richard Gere, it's not life or death - she gets a very healthy alimony and immediately moves on to someone else. In Japan, divorced women cannot so easily remarry. The stakes for the wife are much higher in that movie. And since it is a Manners Comedy, she is too embarrassed to confront her husband directly. Instead, she hires a private detective. This makes no sense in the American version.
<br />
<br />4. A fundamental question of the original movie is, "is the relationship between the lead and the dancer adulterous?" What drives the Richard Gere character to the J-Lo character? How can we forgive him for doing it?
<br />
<br />In the original, we know the lead character is TRAPPED. ("mortgaged his life to the firm"). He explains to the    Stanley Tucci character that he got married and had a child    almost before he knew what he was doing. He feels he SHOULD be happy - he has accomplished all of his goals - yet something    is missing. And he doesn't know what it is.
<br />
<br />When he sees the beautiful young woman looking out the window,  he doesn't just say to himself "hubba hubba! what a dish" and    resolve to bed her. Instead, he is drawn to her because she    appears to be "trapped" too. She is like a beautiful bird in    a cage, looking out at the world. She wants to fly away. He    can sense this. He wonders why - she is so beautiful, how can    she not be happy? Why is she like me? Why is it that we both    have everything society tells us we need to be happy, yet we    are not happy? 
<br />
<br />In the original, you can get the gist of this because of the    way the plot is set-up, and because of the excellent use of    the camera, and because of the natural grace, dignity, charm    and elegance of the actress. In this remake, it is completely    absent. You just see this curvy bimbo looking out the window from a distance. 
<br />
<br />In the remake, there is no way for the audience to appreciate the lead character's feelings of relationship, and connection. So when he pursues her, it doesn't really make any sense.
<br />
<br />I could go on and on about why this movie is vastly inferior to the original. Instead, let me just say that I could only bear watching this monstrosity for about twenty minutes. It is so hideous and unintelligent compared to the original, it is REMARKABLE!  How could this director ever have been given the money to butcher the movie in this way? He obviously didn't have the slightest understanding of the original, how it was put together and what made it work.
<br />
<br />It is an example of Hollywood at its worst. Stupid people with lots of money who have no ability to analyze plots. Instead they just sign a couple of big stars and hope for the best.
<br />
<br />Hanging would be too good.</span>

                    <span>SHALL WE DANCE? is a Hollywood fairy tale about ballroom dancing; what is portrayed here doesn't exist in the real world. In the everyday ballroom world, many dance studios are money traps for lonely women who take years of expensive lessons only to be able ultimately to follow their young, attractive dance instructors and nobody else on the dance floor. The studio system is a racket and is not realistically portrayed in SHALL WE DANCE? But this, after all, is a love story of sorts with a ballroom background and not a documentary, so all is forgiven. We ballroom dancers will enjoy this entertaining, sweet film about our activity if only because there are so few such offerings. Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez both give subdued performances as the angst-filled lawyer and the jilted Blackpool-level dancer, respectively. What motivates the middle-aged Gere character to go to the studio in the first place is never really clear. It could be a desire for romance or just a need to accomplish something new. But then why not sky diving or fly fishing? Susan Sarandon gives a competent performance as the spouse settled ridgedly into the suburban, upper-class housewife role with blinders on. The best scene for me was when JLo (an assistant teacher at the dance studio) was explaining and demonstrating the rumba to the Gere character: "It is a vertical expression of a horizontal wish..." That was one of the few scenes with any emotional intensity. My favorite characters were the stereotypical private detective and his Great Books-quoting black assistant hired to follow the lawyer. Light fare, SHALL WE DANCE? is a perfect flick for a first date or a date with your spouse, but it won't win any trophies at Blackpool.</span>

                    <span>Shall We Dance is a fairly good adult film that might bore younger viewers. 
<br />
<br />The movie was definitely made with more mature audiences in mind, and moves at a relatively fair pace. Not a great movie by any means, it does manage to entertain throughout. 
<br />
<br />John Clark (Richard Gere) is a fairly successful estate lawyer who seems to be finding himself a little bored with his life. He has a good career, a loving wife (Susan Sarandon),  2 children, and a beautiful home, but something seems to be missing. On his way home from work each night on the subway, he passes Miss Mitzi's dance school. Intrigued by the beautiful women who he often sees standing in the window (Jennifer Lopez), he decides on impulse one day to give it a shot, and take a look inside. 
<br />
<br />From there on, he decides to enroll in ballroom dancing, which he comes to find as quite refreshing and therapeutic to his "mundane" life. The rest of the film has to do with Gere learning to appreciate dance, and not being embarrassed by it. He keeps this secret from his wife and kids, and develops a whole new set of relationships with his dancing teacher Miss Mitzi (Gillette), instructor Paulina (Lopez), and other fellow students. 
<br />
<br />This was a good supporting role for Lopez, and she shines here much more than in her other starring roles from previous years. As Paulina, she plays an ex competitive ballroom dancer turned instructor who has become a little jaded with life, with men, and with dance. 
<br />
<br />It all leads up to a amateur dance contest, with Gere and his other fellow classmates taking part. He's coached mainly by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), with a little help from Lopez. There is a great dance sequence between Gere and Lopez that I found to be the highlight of the film. Both dance exceptionally in this movie, with Lopez doing some really fine work. 
<br />
<br />In the end, Gere learns to be open about his love of dance with his wife & kids, his co-workers and even with himself. 
<br />
<br />There are not too many adult films like "Shall We Dance" being released by the studios these days, so in that sense, the film is a little refreshing. At times far-fetched, "Shall We Dance" is still an enjoyable "one time watcher". 
<br />
<br />Recommended for more mature adults, I do not feel that this is really a movie to be enjoyed by everyone. If your like most twenty somethings, & your not interested in "middle aged man" syndrome or dancing....then you really need not apply.

                    <span>Stanley Tucci saved this film from a 1 star rating.  He & Richard Gere's other male dance students, Miss Mitzi, the detective & his hiliarious assistant made the movie fun!!  Otherwise, it was a dud.
<br />
<br />The marriage of Gere & Sarandon had no chemistry.  That the wife & stupid kid showed up & ruined his big day, stunk.  
<br />
<br />Jennifer Lopez is mesmerizing to watch, beautiful as always, but they stuck her in a corner!  It was a crime and a waste of Lopez's tremendous screen presence.  </span>
