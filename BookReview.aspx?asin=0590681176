                    <span>Imagine being under water in the ocean and a shark is about to attack you with nothing there but a dolphin to save you. Or having your dog save you from your burning house. These two incidents happen in the book, Ten True Animal Rescues! If your'e an animal lover and like to read exciting books, then I definitly recommend this book to you!! All of the stories in this book are true and that's what amazes me!! I think that you'll be amazed too! Some of the stories are unbelievable!!! You should really read this book!!!

                    <span>Ten True Animal Rescues <BR> Ten True Animal Rescues was a great book.I would definitely recommend this book to all animal lovers.This book totally stunned me.It showed me how much these animals care for their owners and complete strangers!I could tell you that the best chapter I think is the first one.It's called Three-Alarm Fire.It's about a little hamster who saves a whole family from a fire.If you want to know more,then you'll have to read it to find out.So far out of all the books i've read in the fifth grade,this one is the best. <BR> ...</span>

                    <span>What if your house was burning or on fire? Could your hamster save you? What if you were trapped under a snowbank with only a dog in sight? These were some amazing stories. I recommend this story too because the stories get very tense. You might think that pets just make you smile or keep you company. Not the ones in this story. They save lives. by,michael</span>

                    <span>Ten True Animal Rescues <BR>I wouldn't recommend this book unless you truly love animals and adventures. I thought some of the stories were ok and some of the stories were boring.If you think you like this book,just listen to this.A pony getting you to saftey!A dog saving your life!I know it sounds crazy,but it's all true.</span>

                    <span>I would recommend this book to all animal lovers. It was amazing to read true stories of animals that saved the lives of many people all in different ways! For example, in chapter 8 a man named Donald Motram is rescued from being crushed by an angry bull by a bellcow named Daisy! There are 9 other stories you can hardly believein this book. From hamsters to ponies and many other animals , any animal can be a hero.</span>
