                <span id="Label1">The Dalai Lama's autobiography should leave no one in doubt of his humility and genuine compassion. Written without the slightest hint of pretense, the exiled leader of Tibet recounts his life, from the time he was whisked away from his home in 1939 at the age of 4, to his treacherous escape from Tibet in 1959, to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The backdrop of the story is the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet. He calmly relates details of imprisonment, torture, rape, famine, ecological disaster, and genocide that under four decades of Chinese rule have left 1.25 million Tibetans dead and the Tibetan natural and religious landscapes decimated. Yet the Dalai Lama's story is strangely one of hope. This man who prays for four hours a day harbors no ill will toward the Chinese and sees the potential for good everywhere he casts his gaze. Someday, he hopes, all of Tibet will be a zone of peace and the world's largest nature preserve. Such optimism is not naive but rather a result of his daily studies in Buddhist philosophy and his doctrine of Universal Responsibility. Inspiring in every way, <I>Freedom in Exile</I> is both a historical document and a fable of deepest trust in humanity. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>This incredible story of the Dalai Lama is a must read for any person. He guides us through his life up to recent years to help us understand what the Tibetan people, his people, have been through. Any religious person, of any religion, should read this book to get a perspective on a different, beautiful religion. The average person should read this book to understand about human suffering, and how one person overcame.</span>

                    <span>Right up front, the Dalai Lama claims that English is not his first language and he requests the reader bear with him. At times, the english is a little stilted but it never detracts from the story being told. His honest account of the young days having been found as the 14th Dalai Lama but still being a little boy is wonderful. He leads you through a chronological account of his life and spiritual work.<P>The book was an education for me on the basics of Buddhism, the struggle of the Tibetans, the role of the Dalai Lama and glimpse of China's past and present. I'm motivated to read more on all these topics - in particalar, Buddhism and the history of China (the notable Gang of four).<P>If you're looking for information on the Tibetan struggle and the Dalai Lama, this book is it. THe Dalai Lama is always honest and frank about his opinions on events and people. His strength and poise comes across clearly in his writings. <P>The pain and trauma of the Tibetans has left a mark on my conscience. The Dalai Lama's non-violent opposition of the Chinese is admirable and to be an example for us all.</span>

                    <span>Knowing nothing at all about His Holiness The Dalai Lama or Tibet/China relations I was eager to learn more. As a convert from Catholicisim to Buddhism, I was pleased to read that the Dalai Lama considers himself to be just a regular human, who was chosen to fulfill a specific role. After reading this book, you get the sense that he would be a very pleasant person to talk with. <BR>On the downside, I was absolutely shocked to read about what the Chinese Government has done to Tibet and its people. Tibet is a peace loving country and to be in the army, was the lowest form of life. A 17 point 'agreement' was drawn up by the Chinese for Tibet. Members of the Tibetan delegation were forced under duress to sign the agreement and phony Tibetan state seals were used. Large Tibetan estates were confiscated and redistributed by the Chinese. After monks and nuns were arrested, they were forced, in public, to break their vows of celibacy with one another and even to kill people.<BR>The Tibetan Freedom Fighters were no match for the Chinese army. Besides using bombers to obliterate towns and villages, the Chinese army also crucified, disembowelled, beheaded and buried many Tibetans alive. In order to prevent Tibetans from giving praise to the Dalai Lama on their way to execution, the Chinese tore out their tongues with meat hooks.<BR>It was really disheartening to read about what happened to these people. I think this is a book that everyone at some point needs to read. It really opened my eyes.</span>

                    <span>Not long ago, the question was posed to His Holiness the Dalai Lama as to why he penned his autobiography -- Freedom in Exile. To this query he responded with: 'I am human being who had quite a lot of sad situation, yet my mental health seems not bad. I think some people might find some idea [in my tale], some small contribution for inner peace, for happiness.' The story starts in a small village in the roof of the world at an altitude of 3 miles deep in Eastern Tibet... Lhamo Thondup was only 2 when the monks came to fetch him 1937. The search party waltz right into his peasant parents' farmhouse and things were never the same again. Lhamo Thondup was eventually taken away to Lhasa -- the fabled capital in the Land of the Snows. He was God - recognized through the a dozen omens - skeptics will always question - (a) the way the head of the recently deceased 13th Dalai Lama had turned in its coffin toward the east, (b) the direction of the boy's home, and (3) the vision of the child's very house seen in the lake of Lhamo Lhatso by a Reting Rinpoche. When the young Lhamo was escorted to the late 13th Dalai Lama's room at the summer palace in Norbulingka, the toddler allegedly motioned toward a little case and announced nonchalantly, 'My teeth are in there.' To the amazement of the accompanying monks a set of the late 13th false teeth were contained therein. <P>The Dalai Lama told Newsweek, 'Exile has made me tougher.' Moreover, according to his younger brother Tenzin Choegyal, exile has 'enabled him [the Dalai Lama] to realize his full potential.' This achievement did have a price -- in the Potala, His Holiness the Dalai Lama was both secluded and isolated. If one positive thing has resulted from his having to depart Tibet, was that he was brought closer to the plight of his own people and the rest of the world. Tenzin Gyatso, now the 14th Dalai Lama was given the chance to see things as they really are. In 'Freedom in Exile' the message becomes a universal one - one that transcends a locality and that is what makes this book so compelling and necessary. From being the most secluded leader of the modern world, the 14th Dalai Lama is now among the most traveled, most celebrated and best known. The humble figure in maroon robes has become the locus of attention for the world's angst about Chinese authoritarianism and ideological expansion. The situation of the Tibetans - as penned by the Dalai Lama in 'Freedom in Exile' is proof positive that despite Mao's utterances that 'Religion is Poison' - we are left thinking perhaps the reverse is true - 'Non-Religion is Poison'.<P>Ironically, this is not the role to which he was born. The Dalai Lama not have mixed with ordinary people in Tibet if it had not been for the Chinese invasion. I guess this statement may never be proven true nor false as it hinges on pure speculation. In 'Freedom in Exile' the Dalai Lama does allude to the need form change j-but not at the pace and form that the Chinese used. As he outlines in his autobiography, 'Freedom in Exile,' on the rare occasions he left his official residence -- the cold 1,000-room Potala palace in Lhasa -- he moved past his minions on a yellow silk palanquin, pulled by 20 army officers in green cloaks and red hats and surrounded by hundreds of men: monks and musicians, sword-wielding horsemen and 'porters carrying my songbirds in cages and my personal belongings all wrapped in yellow silk.' To ensure the people didn't get too near, the monastic police encircled the whole entourage. 'In their hands they carried long whips, which they would not hesitate to use,' he wrote. Sad for one so attuned now to the needs of his people.<P>The country over which he ruled was a land of people who believed the Buddha's tenet that one's action in this life determines one's fate in the next. Since the establishment of Buddhism as Tibet's chief religion in the eighth century, parents had inculcated into their children that all life, animal and human, is sacred. 'I have never seen less evidence of hatred, envy, malice and uncharitableness [than in Tibet],' penned Hugh Richardson, British India's trade consul to the remote nation in the 1940s. However, that peace in the 'Rooftop of the World' was violently destroyed when in 1950, 84,000 PLA troops launched a dawn offensive against six different positions along the border. According to his account, in 1959, the Dalai Lama, by then age 24, fled for his life through the snow across 17,000-foot Himalayan passes into India in an effort to preserve his nation, his people and his heritage. Since then, he has lived in the Indian mountain village of Dharamsala, the capital of the Tibetan government-in-exile. The book is full of references to a man with a sense of purpose -- rising at 4 a.m. daily to meditate, meet with cabinet members and refugees and pursue worldly interests that include Western neurobiology and physics.<P>Miguel Llora</span>
