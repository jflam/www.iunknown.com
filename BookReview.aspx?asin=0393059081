                    <span>Ideals of Heaven is quite a unique collection of short stories in that a secondary character in one story has a chance to tell his or her own views on life, love and faith in the next offering.  All of the stories are in first-person narrative and each character has its own take on life, relationships, sex, and other subjects.  This book enthralled me from beginning to end because each story spoke to me -- the voice of each character has something special, with musings and insights that make the reader nod in agreement and be touched as well.  My favorite stories are "Ideas of Heaven," "The High Road," and "My Shape."  The aforementioned stories touched me the most.  The link of characters in each story makes this book all the more interesting.  Joan Silber is a great author.  I recommend this wonderful piece of work.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up because of the  controversial comments some critics made about the 2004 National Book Award nominees.  I was looking for something different from the usual bestsellers that sit out front in Borders or Barnes and Noble, bestsellers that can easily be turned into Hollywood blockbusters.
<br />
<br />Silber's book was a refreshing change.  You don't read this book for the plot, you read it for the language and the wonderful exploration of the relationship between sexual and spiritual longing.  It's not a deep, dense philosophical treatise on the subject though; you see the tension  of unfulfilled longing played out in the lives of mostly normal, everyday characters.
<br />
<br />I started out thinking about the characters of the first two stories as losers - people who made bad choices in search of fulfillment.  But as I kept reading, I came to recognize that many of the weaknesses of the characters were weaknesses I shared - I'm often blind in the same way they were blind about the mistakes they were making. This is what made the book compelling for me.
<br />
<br />In the end, this book was just a  lot of fun to read.  I had a great time sitting on the couch and savoring Silber's beautiful language.</span>

                    <span>Ideas of Heaven is the third of the National Book Award nominees I've read recently, and while the other two (Madeline is Sleeping and Our Kind) did not particularly impress me (gave both a 3), each still had its strong moments. The same can't be said about Ideas of Heaven, whose nomination I admit I just can't fathom.  
<br />  As the title implies, the stories are somehow connected, most obviously by character.  In the first, the main character takes lessons from a bitter dance instructor who then becomes the narrator for the second story and so on through the book. There are also clear connections in theme and subject, especially love and loss.  The structure therefore is gimmicky, though it needn't  have felt as such.  Cloud Atlas, a far better book, has a slightly different but similar structure, but it feels woven into the work, amplifying the stories' strengths rather than simply calling attention to itself. Here, in Ideas of Heaven, the gimmick feels like a gimmick because it doesn't seem to add much.  Yes, the second story clarifies why the dance instructor acts as he does in the first, but the payoffs never seem worth the structure.
<br />  The structure, however, is the least of the problems here.  The stories are all first person narrations, almost all dealing with love and loss.  This sameness of point-of-view and theme is risky; careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the stories differentiate themselves in voice and style. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen.  Though the stories are set in different locales and different times, the narrators themselves are extremely repetitive, sounding like the same person again and again.  The one true exception to this is the title story, also the best and most effective story in the collection.  Coming as it does near the end, however, and being a mere exception rather than the rule, it doesn't do enough to save the book. 
<br />  Another problem that runs through the work is too often the author falls into the first-person trap of telling the reader things rather than showing them.  Characters are constantly telling the reader they are in love, or they are deeply stricken, etc. but it would have been better to have seen/felt these developments rather than hear of them, and in some cases I simply didn't believe them.  In terms of style, the writing is serviceable with a few wonderful lines, but is nothing out of the ordinary and so can't overcome the problems with voice and structure.  
<br />  My usual comment about a book of stories is that it is uneven, often an admittedly obvious point to make since it's rare that someone can string together 8-15 excellent stories.  One always hopes that the balance tips toward the positive (preferably heavily so), but even when it does not, when it is more evenly split or even tilts negative, there are usually a few gem stories that one can recommend someone pick up the book for.  Sadly, that's not the case here.  You should weigh this review against the fact that this book was nominated for a major award (a fact that still stuns me), but for this reader, a recommendation to skip this one.</span>

                    <span>These six sometimes connected stories set around the globe are simple, eloquent, and touching in their honest revelations about matters of the heart. Told in first person narratives Joan Silber creates a series of unique voices, some with heartbreaking circumstances, all with hope and faith. A particular favorite of mine is the title story, where a family of missionaries moves to China to spread the Gospel of the Lord. Slight enough to read at one prolonged sitting, it's cumulative effect is strong enough to make you catch your breath.</span>
