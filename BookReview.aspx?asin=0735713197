                    <span>I bought this book hoping that this book would shed some additional light on Dreamweaver MX templates. Mistake!!!! I found that the first 150 pages are very technical and would have been more useful if there were some excerises to augment the explanations. I have been using lots of Dreamweaver MX books lately and this is one of the poorest that I have come across. The authors are writing in a way that is hard to understand. I have also purchased Dreamweaver MX Magic and I found that much easeir to learn from mainly because the points that the authors are trying to make are made through supporting exercises. I was forced to rate this as one star but i feel that this book doesn't deserve any stars.</span>

                    <span>Dreamweaver MX Templates is the only book on the market that cover the complexity of the new MX template system. This book is codecentric and it has some pretty advanced concepts that might be difficult for a beginner in Dreamweaver. <p>There are some answers in this book to some questions that I have had since the upgrade from DW4 and my life working in templates has now become much easier in dealing with DW Templates. Another good point is that the authors have a ready made site with hands on examples that get you working in the concepts that they explain.<p>I think the book could have been written better, but the content is good and for the most part accurate.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on all of the glamourous reviews it received about 5 months ago, upon its release.  When I read the book, I was really skeptical about its integrity and ability to teach the subject.  I'm a very experienced web-developer and programmer, so I typically gobble up computer books with a great understanding.  This one, to be honest, was really hard for me to follow.  I went through the entire book, and yet I still don't feel comfortable using templates.  To be honest, in many ways I am more confused.  I used to use templates all the time in DW4 and that was all self-taught by simply reading the online Macromedia help.  However, since DWMX added a slew of new template features, I decided to buy this based on all the feedback I read here, as well as the official DW message board.<p>I really think the authors have a hard time communicating their thoughts.  They are very technical people, and often technical gurus have a hard time conveying information in a concise, useful manner.  There are many steps that are so poorly worded that they have to be read a few times to get a good understanding.  Also, I was really disappointed that they didn't cover more on Nested Templates.  That was really the main reason I purchased this book, and yet, it was barely covered.  Also, they didn't cover ANY template usage with dynamic server languages (ASP, ASP.NET, PHP, etc.), and I think that may have been really helpful.<p>Here's my big problem with this book.  Although I only rated it "2 stars", I would still buy this again.  Why?  Well, unfortunately, it is the ONLY book that covers Dreamweaver Templates with some form of detail.  Other books (such as Dreamweaver MX Bible, Inside Dreamweaver MX) just touch on templates.  To make matters worse, you can't rely on Macromedia's help because it is full of errors (some have been fixed), and is also incomplete and confusing.<p>So, unfortunately, if you can put with the long-winded explanations and need to know templates, then I would recommend this book.  It is the only book of its kind.  Obviously, these writers were paid by the page, because this could have been written much better in about 20 pages.</span>

                    <span>First off, this book is not for someone who doesn't already know how to use templates. See previous comments by readers concerning "spawn child pages" which is a vague term not used anywhere else relating to dreamweaver except in this book. What they mean to say is "open as new from template." It took me many many hours to discover this discrepancy.<p>The main problem with this book is that it goes through 150 pages of explaination without any examples. When they hit you with the actual hands on templates tutorial at page 151, they assume you digested the previous 150 pages and give you ZERO meaningful direction back to the relevant topics being demonstrated. The benevolent authors feel that "use methods described in earlier chapters" is enough direction for their readers, which is absolutely ridiculous.<br> <br>In frustration, i began searching the web and found an excellent tutorial on pattysite.com about creating nested templates that was infinitely more valuable than this book for getting started with templates. it explained the overall structure of templates in a very concise manner.<p>After working through the pattysite nested templates tutorial, the book was a somewhat useful guide to the inner workings of dreamweaver templates. Also to be fair, the authors are fairly active on the dreamweaver newsgroups and are readily available for grilling / answering questions. (they will be hearing from me shortly)<p>So summarizing my rant above, buy this book if you already use templates and want to learn some new tricks, skip it if you don't. This book could easily be reduced to half its size, but as we all know, that doesn't sell very many books. The common logic is that the heft of a  manual is directly proportional its value...</span>

                    <span>I bought this book with some hesitation, but decided to give it a shot. I really want to learn more about templates, and be able to use them on future sites.  What a big dissapointment!!  I received the book today and just finished reading the majority of the book.<p>I followed the examples, did the exercises, but to not much avail. The book makes vague references such as see previous chapters, when refering to instructions such as "spawning child pages."  Rather difficult to understand!!  Perhaps I will give it another try, but for now, I am going back to Dreamweaver 4 and the previous versions of templates.<p>Definately not recommended!!</span>
