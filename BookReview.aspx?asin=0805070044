                    <span>Sorrows of Empire depicts the rise (and warns of the potential fall) of the "lone superpower", the United States, to world hegemony in the 21st century. Historian Lord Acton warned that "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" and that is the central theme of his book. He understands the historical roots of other Empires, especially the Roman and British Empire, and draws parallels,such as the way in which the Roman Republic became transformed into the Roman Empire, with it losing freedoms and depending on naked force, a process he sees happening now in the US Empire.He depicts the link between militarism and empire warning, as Eisenhower did, of the military-industrial complex, which have built up the corporate sector but ignored the needs of ordinary voters. Historical factors that have led to the collapse of empires include financial problems,especially those of imperial overstretch; the competition for resources that can lead to conquest,as in Afghanistan and Iraq; the destruction of civil liberties; and a self-righteousness that depicts all evil as belonging to the enemy and not to ourselves. The immoral and illegal actions of such secret agencies as the CIA can also bring unexpected retaliation, as he shows in another book, Blowback. Altogether, this makes uncomfortable but very instructive reading.</span>

                    <span>Before 9/11 in BLOWBACK, Chalmers Johnson anticipated dire consequences and negative active reactions to the American U.S. foreign policy that has run roughshod over much of the world, but especially Asia. In his latest cautionary book, Mr. Johnson pulls no punches as he accuses the Bush crowd of global militarism using a "private army" of Special Forces to keep the American colonies "in line". Referring to Presidents like Eisenhower, Mr. Johnson makes the case that the military-industrial complex has already happened, but is really a federal government-industrial complex. He insists that the State Department, EPA, and Interior, etc. have been silenced by the war machine and the oil magnates. "Preemptive intervention" is just a fake way of covering the administration's belief that the USA is the New Rome."<P>Though he takes the clever Clinton to task as a disguised imperialist, Mr. Johnson spends much of his criticism on Bush bashing. The author insists that the "boy emperor" and his merry men (and a few women) are destroying the nation with their illusions of grandeur policies. This segment of THE SORROWS OF EMPIRE is the strength of the book as Mr. Johnson lays out powerful evidence with astounding and absorbing details of outlandish defense overkill with related scenarios and incredible spending that Everett Dirksen could not imagine. However, the book lacks substance on what can be done besides booting out the current Congress perhaps because the author feels we have crossed the Potomac. Still the case for American imperialism endangering the future of this country is strongly made.<P>Harriet Klausner</span>

                    <span>Johnson's tirade may appeal to Leftist ideologues, but it is thoroughly weak on facts. Most obviously: What "empire"? Are bilateral, contractual, mutually-agreed military bases equivalent to imperialism? This seems ridiculous considering the fact that the US' partners can end their relationship at any time. The US presence around the world is about as "imperial" as Volkswagen factories in Brazil and Mexico. Perhaps there is some discriminatory aspect, then, of this interrogation. And secrecy?? Is he kidding? The US government couldn't keep a secret if it wanted to. Many a commentator had remarked that Watergate coudln't have happened in France because it would have been successfully covered up. I almost burst out laughing upon hearing this charge. Indeed, few countries have as transparent and open a political culture as the American one. End of the Republic? Rumours of its death are greatly exaggerated. Johnson is strong on melodrama, weak on facts. Perhaps this book will appeal to ideologues and foreign xenophobes wishing to demonize the US, but more critical minds must look elsewhere.<P>Johnson has made a career out of smarmy, America-bashing fare.</span>

                    <span>Chalmers Johnson is a perfect example of somebody who gets an advanced degree and few academic credentials to his name and starts to pontificate. The man is absolutely clueless, and it is readily apparent that he has spent his life holed up in academic settings and has never been out and actually seen and experienced the world. Send this nut back to Berzerkely where he belongs.</span>

                    <span>I've read both Blowback and The Sorrows of Empire. Chalmers Johnson is a brilliant political scientiest. He loves his country, but he wants to see change. Hopefully America heeds the lessons of this powerful book.</span>
