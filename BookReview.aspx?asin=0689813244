                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought that Walter was a very intelegent young person. I thought Marie Hammontree did an excelent job at making a usual boring biography into an intresting tale.I wish that there where many more pages in the book so I could read more and more about Walt Disney. I thought that Marie made him sound like a very lively young child. I thought that Walt was a very big risk taker. I would have hoped that the book would have had more information and details though. all in all I thought that this was a great book.</span>

                    <span>This book was enjoyable.  Marie Hammontree described how a person can be a big success while being a little poor.  It shows the ups and downs of Disney's life.  She describes what it took to get to the top of his career.   This book tells who he was inspired by and how they helped him.  She told  me his problems in his life and how they were solved.  It gave me the  puzzle pieces to his life so I could better understand it.  All in all I  think it was a really informative book.</span>
