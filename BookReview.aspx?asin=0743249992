                    <span>As a non-gambler, I find this book very fun to read. To see these MIT students abandon their traditional upbringings and values, and subccumb to the money and flashy lifestyle of Vegas makes me wonder if I would do the same if I have the skills and opportunities.
<br />
<br />We read about the crazy lifestyle that people lead when they have the money and fame. For someone who seem to have a bright future ahead of him and has things that most people only can dream of: MIT diploma, upper middle class family, a girlfriend who is about to go to med school, a 6 digit salary. Yet he prefers the lifestyle of Vegas: professional cheerleader girlfriend, VIP access to strip clubs and five star hotels, having multiple fake IDs, carrying thousands and thousands of dollars on your body nervously though airport. 
<br />
<br />This really makes me wonder under certain circumstances, anyone of us, given the chance, probably would choose that kind of lifestyle. At least I think I might.
<br />
<br />I recommend this to anyone who is out for adventure of any sort in the safety of his own home.

                    <span>I bought this book to feed my appetite for behind-the-scenes information about Las Vegas.  However, my BS-o-meter kept flicking off the scale, as various aspects of the story seemed extremely unlikely.  First, contrary to what the reader is led to believe at the outset, the team's primary means of obtaining a statistical advantage over the house was a basic, balanced "hi-lo" counting method, which, knowledgeable people will tell you, isn't very powerful and produces only a slight advantage.  (It's difficult to imagine anyone making the huge killings this group supposedly made in the relatively short timeframe indicated in the book.)  Second, I can't conceive of any Las Vegas casino, even in the bygone days of the early 1990s, allowing players to flit from table to table--especially in VIP pits--playing five-figure hands.  (These people aren't, and never were, so stupid that they wouldn't have known what was going on.)  Third, the idea of a player leaving town with tens of thousands of dollars in high-denomination casino chips, and then showing back up the following weekend--or whenever--and playing with those chips, with no marker or cash buy-in, and without raising suspicions, heavily strains one's credulity.  (These places keep very close track of their high-value chips and would know when a large quantity of them has left the premises--and why would the typical high-roller leave town with a boatload of chips?)  And finally, although the author hints that the group experienced the ups and downs that one would expect with a ~1.5%-2.0% statistical advantage, the rate at which this team apparently won suggests a much-higher, impossible advantage.  (Card-counting, difficult though it is to do well, does not require mathematical genius, and the fact that one may possess mathematical genius will not--contrary to the implicit suggestion planted by this book--turn him into some kind of super-freak card-counter.)
<br />
<br />In short, this book, well-written and interesting though it may be, reads like fiction.  I have no doubt that MIT students have played team blackjack and have even been moderately successful, but this story is simply too much to take at face value.</span>

                    <span>Ben Mezrich has done a great job with this book.  It brings an incredible amount of excitement in every page.  It's one of those books that are impossible to put down.  If you are exciting book which captures the excitement of gambling when a person is up at a casino this is that type of book. 
<br />
<br />The story is about 6 MIT students that were taught how to card count and eventually took a few million dollars out of Vegas and a few other places.  It demonstrates how they were first taught how to card count, then used a twist of what a usual card counter usually is and that permitted them to get away for a few years.  Then... well let's not ruin the book.

                    <span>I'm of two minds about this book.  On the one hand, I am duly impressed that these students managed to take the 'big houses' of Vegas for as much money as they did.  On the other hand, I found it very hard to get over the author worshipping at the alter of MIT.  And by this I mean that the author took every opportunity to let you know that these weren't just any students who took Vegas for millions, they were MIT students.<p>My beef with the author's love of MIT aside, the premise of this book is fascinating.  To learn or hear of people, in this day and age, being able to make bucket loads in the Vegas casinos, is fascinating.  What's more, the author presents the story in such a fashion that it is almost part story, part 20/20 documentary.  He (the author) does a nice job of explaining to you exactly how the students managed to make all of their money from the casinos, while at the same time sprinkling enough information in each chapter to keep the reader interested to find out if the protagonists will make it rich, or get caught in the process.<p>Everyone gambles.  But it is only a few lucky people who have learned to gamble well and make money.  And if you're interested in getting a glimpse into the lives of those who do gamble for the big bucks, then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is an unforgettablly fun, compulsively quick read and a true story about a group of smarty pants M.I.T. students, recruited to count cards at casino black jack tables from Las Vegas to Atlantic City and many steamships in between.
<br />
<br />A riprolicking ride that recounts the arch of our hero, Kevin Lewis's gambling career, BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is a satisfying exploration into the world of high stakes gambling and an admirable firt time, non-fiction effort from its author, Ben Mezrich.  
<br />
<br />Complete with Lewis's sweaty-palmed introduction to professional black jack through his appreciation for a high roller's fringe benefits (glamorous women, piles of cash, spectacular meals and wines) all the way to Lewis's inevitable retirement, BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE delivers enough heart-racing, page turning action to keep even a casino-phobic reader interested.
<br />
<br />What's more,and probably due to both the author's intelligence and his subject's natural mathematical skills, BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE also delivers enough nuts and bolts information about a card counter's strategies and techniques to satisfy almost any reader who understands the laws of probability.
<br />
<br />If you have any interest in gambling, excitement, men or the beauty of a mathematical equation, BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is an ideal read for a cross country trip, a lazy day at home or an exciting evening alone.
