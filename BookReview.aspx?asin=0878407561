                    <span>I must say that I read this book from cover to cover. It is an extremely readable book, which is quite amazing, since it deals with epistemological, ontological, and metaphysical positions of the six orthodox Indian schools, as well as the materialist school and various Indian Buddhist schools. The book is subtitled "An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought", and it is a fine introduction, for both those who are newcomers to the field, and those with some knowledge of this intriguing area of human thought, but would like to put the many pieces of the puzzle into a more structured frame.<br>King's writing style is impeccable, and he also uses highly amusing examples not to frighten away his readers...   <br>The introductory and concluding chapters are very valuable as well, dealing with the areas of hermeneutics, and ethnocentrism, and the study of religions in this postmodern age (for the West at least...) His comments in these areas are very thought provoking, and offer the interested reader a new approach and methodology for the study of religions. It is a pity that King has not included the philosophical stance of the Jainas in this work. It is perhaps not his area, but it seems that the Jaina perspective is seriously lacking: a few gems of Jaina epistemology would have made this book a most fine one for students of the Indian traditions. I recommend this work highly to one and all.</span>
