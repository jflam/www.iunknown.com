                    <span>this is my opinion should have its own category in the video store.by this i mean it should be under terrible movies that cost to much along with the day after tomorow.I think that this movie really did hit an iceberg and it was only popular because of its stars these stars i must add were not that great they were ok but nothing special.And i would rather shoot myself than hear another person singing my heart will go on.I really do not like this over expensive movie bu5 i suppose that thats just my opinion.</span>

                    <span>titanic...The Movie....Is just that.<BR>I enjoy the story, from that perspective.<BR>I appreciate the effort to create a level of interest in such an event. Drama can attempt to capture, only you can respond! <BR>In reading short 4-5star reviews, and Loooong 2-3star reviews, I believe the connection has been made, as planned!</span>

                    <span>... but as an account of the ship and its demise... a 2....<BR>Here we got a Romeo and Juliet-story on-board the Titanic with a cliche-ridden dialogue-("I can fly.....") prologue and epilogue... What Cameron really should have done - STORYWISE - was to let the ship and its passangers speak for themselves... <P>We are not unbeknownst 2 her story, so why mock us Mr Cameron??? As a fiction however; it is great - if on the trashy side. The authency of the Titanic and production values are first rate. The music by James Horner(and the humming by Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb√∏)was a milestone at the time....The photography of the wreck!? - a must-see....</span>

                    <span>Remember when this movie was first released on video, and they kept saying something to the effect of "Now you can own the movie of the century?" Well, la-di-da, what a priviledge! I hadn't seen Titanic in the theater because it was so popular that I didn't want anything to do with it. All I heard was how everyone loved it except for a handful of people. Because I don't like trends, I wanted to be among the handful until I finally rented it a few months after its video release. We had a big screen TV, so I fell in love with it upon first viewing and was so haunted that I had to get it for my own.<P>Most people have seen this by now, but for those of you who haven't, I'm warning you right now, it wears thinner and thinner with each play. You begin to realize what a flimsy love story James Cameron wrote, and you really start to feel cheated as you realize the script is absolutely pathetic where the love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo De-Greasy-Crapheado is concerned. A rich girl like Rose wouldn't want a poor guy who just happens to be able to draw for very long, so that's unbelievable right there. What's really funny is, given the distinct separation of classes like there were on those large ships, the only place Jack and Rose could have convincingly met was the church, yet he's denied entrance in Cameron's account. <P>The historical inaccuracies in this film are gastronomical (Such as Picasso paintings sinking with the ship that hadn't even been released to the public until after the tragedy, and the fact that nobody told Molly Brown to "shut that 'ole in yer face!"), but the larger crime here is how much more eyeliner Billy Zane is wearing than Kate Winslet. Worst of all is the lame dialogue. How many times must we hear these two say each other's names until you never forget them? Jack, Jack, Jack. Rose, Rose, Rose. Barf, barf, barf..."I'm the king of the world!" No, you're not. You're a really lucky guy with a big, fat, greasy head, and you look like a 12 year-old who wants to rake my leaves instead of a hot stud. Kate Winslet deserved a better actor to play her man than this! When he drowns I don't even care. At least his hair finally gets washed. The worst piece of dialogue in the film happens to be, "A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets." Only a man would write a stupid line like that, and only a highly paid actress would say it. <P>I've made it crystal clear the love story is crap, but I will say that the special effects and the actual scenes having to do with the disaster are very well done...well, except for the part where the boat is all full of freezing water, but Jack and Rose are still cavorting around in the passageways of the ship like it's a water theme park. They'd have had hypothermia too badly already for any of that to have happened. The underwater shots of the old boat are eery, but the one scene I find very disturbing is the longshot of all those people screaming for help in their life jackets after the boat has finally sunk. That living grave always sends a chill down my spine. <P>Titanic has very impressive moments, good costumes, and excellent effects. The tragedy is replicated on the screen with harrowing efficiency enough to haunt a person long after the credits roll to that awful Celine Dion codependent shrieking. It's just such a shame James Cameron had to ruin it all with a sleazy, hollow, unbelievable love story to rival the old nighttime soaps like Dallas. "If you jump, I jump," Rose and Jack take turns saying to each other in two different sections of the film. I couldn't agree with them more. God to dear God, JUMP already!</span>
