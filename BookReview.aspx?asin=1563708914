                    <span>This book may be long, but it is easy to get through. I loved it! I absolutely recommend it for resume writing. It took me only a week or two to read and come up with a resume I am proud of. I am also receiving compliments from prospective employers (one said it was "unique" and not boring like all the other resumes she sees).</span>

                    <span>I don't give five stars to just any book. They must richly deserve it. Like this one. This is unqualifyingly the best how-to-write-a-resume book out there and I've seen dozens of them. Ms. Whitcomb has a get-to-the-point writing style and offers hundreds of tips, suggestions and examples. Her book is very well organized and she writes with amazing clarity.</span>

                    <span>I was overwhelmed,<p>This book is more of a resource book than a clear guide on how to quickly write a great resume. I found the volume of information overwhelming and it only served to frustrate me in that I did not know where to begin. <p>Trying to read the book from start to finish was a daunting task as it doesn't follow a logical series of steps to produce a great resume; it makes a great reference book but not a hand-holding guide.<p>I returned the book and purchased Robin Ryan's "Winning Resumes" (0471263656). This is an excellent, short book/instruction manual. Actually, I purchased both of her books; her cover letter book is "Winning Cover Letters" (047126348)<p>I purchased Ryan's books after I had sent 20 resume and cover letters and received nothing back except one rejection letter. After reading the books and following her step by step instructions I produced a much better set of material. <p>I have sent ten Cover letters and resumes since adopting her ideas and I've had three responses in just two weeks!!! I've had an interview with two of the companies and the third is still taking apps and will "get back with me".<p>Good luck in your search... <p></span>

                    <span>I said, "How can resume-writing be this complicated?" before carrying this 600-page 8.5" x 11" book home.  Susan Whitcomb did a good job of compiling tips and advice and presenting them at the right time.  There are tips on left vs. right justification, including personal information, and picking fonts, and long discussions on CVs vs. resumes, on functional vs. chronological, on printed vs. scannable vs. ASCII, and on grammar and mechanics.  She's obviously a great copyriter and page designer.<p>Because, indeed, a resume now must look good enough so it will be read.<p>One chapter did nothing but help you choose which sections and section titles fit your situation.  I found that weird, until I began the next chapter, which read, "Even experienced writers can feel some fear and trepidation when facing the start of a new project. You already have a good outline in which to work (chapter 4), which puts you beyond the 'blank sheet of paper' stage."<p>Inside the "tweaking" section, she even gives the keystrokes you'll use for both Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect.<p>You'll also find 250 "impact-mining questions" to ask yourself to come up with powerful accomplishment statements.  Is that a lot?  Well, no, but it gives you a good start!  When you expect a resume-writing book to have a list of action verbs, Susan diligently wrote a impressive example for each verb.<p>I do not agree with her treatment of ASCII resumes, though.  Of course, her discussion on online promotion and online resume submittal has grown stale; her ideas on "keyword resumes" is as outdated as advice on META TAGS on web pages.<p>Bulky... comprehensive... a great workbook.</span>

                    <span>I was skeptical of this book since I've read several other books of this type that turned out to not be of much help. I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised - this book covers just about everything and does it in a way that's easy to digest. It's a thick book - 600 pages - but it reads much faster than that due to the large number of resume before/after examples.<p>To follow the strategies in this book will take some work on your part, but if you work at it, you'll end up with a great looking resume that gets noticed.<p>Read the entire book before you start writing your resume - it makes a big difference.</span>
