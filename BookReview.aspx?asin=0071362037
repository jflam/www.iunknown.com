                    <span>I started paddling just 2 months ago and bought this book before my first venture on the water. After reading it I felt like I had a basic idea of the kinds of things that could happen to me and what I could do about them. It contains advice from many experienced paddlers who want to help you avoid their mistakes and have a great time paddling. Being new to the sport I didn't even know what questions to ask - this book covers topics I hadn't even thought about. It gives advice on the best fabric choices in clothes for the weather, what to pack on the boat, what to have waiting for you at the end of your trip (hot cocoa among other things), how to tie some basic knots, how to scare bears away, how to pee without leaving the kayak (valuable information for women - like me). It's interesting, fun to read and not at all didactic. It includes many tips for more experienced paddlers and I will reread it often as I advance in the sport. The tips are offered by paddlers who obviously love their sport and want to share their great time with everyone else.</span>
