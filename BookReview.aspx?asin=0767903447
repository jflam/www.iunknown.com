                <span id="Label1">As the reigning rabbi on the mysteries of golf from 100 yards in, Pelz has earned the right to anoint his expansive instruction on the short game a "Bible." A scientist by training, he's analyzed the macros and dissected the micros to come up with a gospel for pros (Lee Janzen, Vijay Singh, and Anika Sorenstam, to name a few disciples) and weekend hackers alike. Pelz fills his scripture with photos, illustrations, charts, and plenty of sage advice on pitching, chipping, sandplay, putting, equipment, execution, mechanics, technique, practice, attitude, lots of questions, and plenty of answers. Much of the <I>Short Game Bible</I> is pretty sophisticated stuff aimed toward better players--or, at least, players who take their golf seriously. But its basics are appropriate to any skill level of the game: Accurately assess your own weaknesses, and then go about improving them <I>systematically</I> with the author's carefully researched and tested plan. It seems so obvious, but the truth is, most golfers either beat balls on the range in search of distance or slave over eight-foot putts on the practice green; they fail to pay enough attention to the shots in between. Pelz does the math for you here; his figures add up, so that yours can go down--the golfing equivalent of forgiving sins and absolving trespasses. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>Dave Pelz starts this anecdotal exploration of the game of golf from 100 yards in to just off the putting green by describing his career in golf, and telling the story of how he discovered that the key to money earnings on the PGA tour was not ball striking ability, not driving distance, greens in regulation, fairway percentages, or even putting, but pitching, chipping, and the rest of the short game. He spends a lot of pages bragging about all his pro golfer students, and then he starts teaching.<P>At last, the good stuff.<P>Pelz tells the story of how he discovered, by observing his pro golfer students, the best way to play the short game in the most accurate and repeatable way. And he tells how every golfer can choose clubs and practice his or her short game in order to improve it. Will it turn every golfer into a Seve Ballesteros or a Tom Kite of the short game? No. Does it contain everything that a golfer needs to make the short game the strongest part of their game? Yes.<P>I have seen other books on the short game but haven't bothered to buy them. They might list more trick shots, but none compare to this one.</span>

                    <span>As a collegiate golf coach, I have made Dave Pelz's book Putt Like the Pros required reading for the members of the team for over 4 years now. IT is real, and it works...The Short Game Bible can be expressed in the same terms. Unlike the pile of golf literature out there written by some big name player and providing advice that, while probably entertaining, will never lower your score...Dave Pelz PROVES it to you. Practicing the techniques in his book, with a practice buddy to make sure your form is correct, just twice a week for an hour...will give you a tremendous confidence boost, and the KNOWLEDGE to lower your score. I have been teaching these Pelz techniques to my team since I took his school with great results...this book just makes it simple and visual. Add another item to your summer reading list boys...Thanks Dave.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent for the more scientific-minded golfer. Dave Pelz is a true scientist and breaks down golf from an entirely different angle. His practice sessions are a little unreasonable for most people, though. Not too many people would have the time or resources to figure our exactly how far each short game shot travels, but the book is worth the price simply for the reviews of the fundamentals of the short game swing. Just by reading the book and changing the way I practiced, I have taken about 5 strokes off of my handicap!</span>

                    <span>As a 10.2 index, this program has turned around my outlook on the short game and golf in general. I am SOOOO much more consistent from within 100 yards, and even though my longer game suffered last year (due to some injury and lessons, reforming my swing a bit), the short game kept my handicap from ballooning.<P>All other things being equal, Pelz's simple approach to the short game will make you a better golfer. He backs up his recommendations for setup, and how to control your distances with stacks of statistical data, instead of feelings or conjecture.<P>Update (1/20/04): Due to a great short game in 2003, my handicap has dropped to a 7.1. Certainly no thanks to my driver, that's for sure. I bagged the driver for the month of August and actually dropped to a 6.0, because giving it another go and rising the extra shot. But the short game kept it down. Thanks Dave!</span>
