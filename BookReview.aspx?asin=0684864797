                <span id="Label1"><P> It is late May in Alaska, the height of the climbing season in the world's most treacherous mountain range. Three Englishmen are clawing their way up the sheer West Rib of Denali, the highest mountain in North America. During a break in the weather, they attempt a mad dash for the summit 4,000 feet above them. Twelve miles away, clinging to a vertical wall of ice, two experienced American climbers also see the break in the clouds as their chance to reach the summit of Thunder Mountain, the third highest in the Alaska Range. But, as every mountain guide preaches, good weather is the most dangerous: it always goes bad when you least expect it. And what neither climbing party knows is that two weather fronts are about to collide above their heads to create one of the most hellacious storms Alaska has ever seen.  <P> Within twelve hours the three Englishmen are trapped at 19,000 feet on Denali in whiteout conditions, hypoxic and dehydrated, their radio frozen, while one of the Americans has narrowly escaped death in a fall and is now pinned to a narrow ledge, depending on his wounded partner to reach the help that will save his life. With this, the mountain foot- patrols and flight crews of the U.S. Air Force's 210th Pararescue Squadron are mobilized and "The Rescue Season" begins.    <P> Because of their low profile, the Air Force's parajumpers, or PJs, are the Special Forces you've never heard of. Now their remarkable achievements are revealed for the first time in Bob Drury's thrilling account of one season in the life of Alaska's 210th Pararescue Squadron, the only PJ team in the world devoted to civilian rescues. The lives of countless men and women -- mountaineers trapped on the immense 20,320-feet Denali massif, fishermen adrift in the chaos of the Bering Strait, lost hunters wandering the endless tundra, and even Navy SEALs freezing to death on a glacier the size of Rhode Island -- are the responsibility of this uncommonly trained, close-knit unit of thirty citizen-soldiers.   <P> A spot on the 210th is a coveted assignment, for PJs, like civilians, appreciate the lure of Alaska, a territory that defies overstatement. But they are also fluent with its risks. In 1991, veteran PJ Mike Wayt helped lower a trapped Korean mountaineer down one of Denali's sheer slopes above 14,000 feet. The climber lost both hands to frostbite; Mike Wayt nearly died, unintentionally setting a new standard for heroism for the squad. Now they must find five stranded climbers in the midst of a storm that threatens everyone on the mountain. <P> <I>The Rescue Season</I> is a true tale of the perilous beauty of nature and the rousing community of men who live in the grandest heroic tradition: they risk themselves in unimaginable ways on behalf of strangers.</span>

                    <span>"The Rescue Season" tells the courageous story of the rescue teams, primarilly the "PJs" of the U.S. Air Force, who ply their trade in Alaska, particularly in and around Denali National Park. Author Bob Drury recalls some harrowing tales of rescue and tragic death and portrays his protagonists as rugged heros who seem driven to do what they do by their own genetic makeup. Drury is a fine writer and his prose is eminently readable. He introduces the reader to plenty of interesting characters and locales.<P>That said, the book is also a bit disjointed. There is a main search and rescue story that is introduced in the beginning and which Drury returns to at times over the whole course of the book. Drury also tends to throw a lot of geography, geology, meterology and history lessons into the mix (at least once, I got the impression that he was showing off his knowledge). All of this is interesting, but gets in the way of his narrative. He also makes a couple of mistakes that I noticed, for example once referring to the "Seven Summits" as the "Seven Sisters." Ultimately, the book doesn't hold together as a story, like with "Into Thin Air." Instead, it is a collection of good stories that should be quite pleasing to anyone with an interest in the subject matter.</span>

                    <span>PJs have been going through the pipeline, and more have tried, for years, and it's about time they were recognized for their hairy, heroic efforts that would leave most men dumbfounded with their pants wet. (I can only hope Mike's daughter inspires a sequel to this book!! You go girl.) Bob Drury really did justice to the work these men, and the others in the Forest Service,etc., put in every day, and the camaraderie that goes with risking their lives together.</span>

                    <span>I read a lot of books covering a wide variety of topics. This book is so poorly written that I actually threw it in the trash after completing it so that no one would be tempted to pull it off the shelf and read it. I kept hoping that at some point the story would come together and I would be pleasantly suprised. The suprise was that it never got better from chapter 1 throught until the end.</span>

Adventures about the rescue team (mostly former military) under horrible, inhumane conditions (ice, cold, storms, broken bones) in Alaska's mountains. Very dedicated, but fit pararescuers. Keeps you on the edge. Good present if you have a pilot in the family!</span>
