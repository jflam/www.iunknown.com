                    <span>I found this book inferior to Fatal Vision (which I read with much appreciation on 5 Jan 1985) and to Cruel Doubt (which I read 11 Nov 2002). Many of the names of the people involved in this case have been changed. One can get the actual names of the people, including the girlfriend, by reading the legal opinions concerning the case. The conviction was affirmed in a 175-page opinion by the New Jersey Supreme Court in State v. Marshall, 586 A. 2nd 85 (1991). The most recent decision in the case is Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F. 3rd 36, decided Sept 11, 2002, which ordered a further hearing in regard to effectiveness of counsel in the penalty phase of the trial, which readers will remember was handled somewhat lackadaisically according to the book. The book spends a lot of time repeating the whining of the murderer, which surely grew old and tiresome. I think the book deviated too much from the truth and made up a lot of stuff and I prefer true crime accounts to be as accurate and factual as possible. This one flunks the veracity test.</span>

                    <span>Joe McGinniss's excellent follow up to "Fatal Vision" is one of his best yet. "Blind Faith" takes us into the home of Rob and Maria Marshall and their 3 sons, a family in the "Leave It To Beaver" mould whose idyllic life was the envy of all who knew them. But the tragic murder of Maria in September 1984 revealed a twisted underbelly of asociality where the life of a beloved daughter and loving mother could be traded for a sum as measly and paltry as 1.5 million dollars. Joe McGinniss slowly draws the reader in to the complicated investigation which is littered with people who seem to be direct from the central casting of an Alfred Hitchcock film as the police and the district attorney quietly and resolutely hunt down their quarry - Maria's "loving" husband, Rob Marshall, who in court was finally revealed for the avaricious and cunning sociopath that he is. Although this tragic, cautionary tale transports the reader on a journey into the dark side of the American dream which will haunt us long after the last page is finished, the true success of this book lies with McGinniss's depiction of 3 grieving boys who went from initially believing totally in their father's innocence to finally angrily acknowledging his guilt.</span>

                    <span>Having lived in Ocean County, NJ, I tore through this book, mostly because I was curious to find recognizable names and locations. I have to say that Mr. McGinniss' description of life in the upper echelon of Toms River was accurate. It was and still is all about people (mostly from cities) with modest backgrounds, coming down to the Jersey shore, buying big houses and eventually learning how to put on airs and living to keeping ahead of the Joneses. I had to laugh at his description of Holiday City (a retirement development) which he described as a "ghetto for old people". That is not accurate. Humorous, but not accurate just the same. When he attempted to describe the Township of Brick, he said "a raggedy collection of blue-collar tract homes and mini-malls..." Again, not accurate. If you are going to write the story and call it "true", you have to be accurate. I was also quite disappointed that he did not use real names, nor was there one photograph to be found in the entire book. I would have liked to see family photos and pictures of the crime scene, at least. That aside, this book was a fast read, it held my attention and served its purpose (beach reading). I would recommend this book but can only give it 3 stars, due to the lack of photographs, the authors inaccuracies and the lack of usage of real names. On a personal note, I strongly believe that Robert Marshall is guilty as sin, is exactly where he belongs and should never see the light of day for the rest of his miserable life. My hope for the Marshall boys is that they stick together from cradle to grave and stand tall.</span>

                    <span>Looking for a who-done-it? Then you can skip Blind Faith, the story of the 1984 murder of Toms River, N.J. housewife, Maria Marshall, and the prosecution of her insurance salesman husband Robert O. Marshall for the crime. <P>Author Joe McGinniss portrays Rob O. as such a pig, with his slutty married mistress and flashy ways, you don't doubt for a moment that he is capable of murdering his wife. The only mystery here is why Rob expected anyone to believe his ludicrous alibi in the first place, especially his three teenaged sons, who cling desperately to the belief that Rob is innocent. <P>But mystery isn't the point. This is a book about illuisons. Seems the Marshall boys weren't alone in clinging to them. McGinniss paints Toms River as a Mecca for phonies who maintain the mutual illusion that they're all hot tycoons and socialites, when in reality they're just small town posers, with nothing more going for them than a few credit cards and a full set of teeth. <P>McGinniss suggests that the quest to maintain those illusions, especially concerning the reputations of certain powerful citizens, perverted the prosecution of Rob Marshall, obscuring the true motive for Maria's murder. He hints that it may even be what cost her her life in the first place. <P>Blind Faith is neither as sophisticated as Echoes in the Darkness, nor as suspenseful as Cruel Doubt, but it's marvelous sociology and a good read.</span>
