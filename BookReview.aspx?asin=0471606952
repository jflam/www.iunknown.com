                <span id="Label1">Designing application and middleware software to run in concurrent and networked environments is a significant challenge to software developers. The patterns catalogued in this second volume of Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures (POSA) form the basis of a pattern language that addresses issues associated with concurrency and networking.<br>    <br>    The book presents 17 interrelated patterns ranging from idioms through architectural designs. They cover core elements of building concurrent and network systems: service access and configuration, event handling, synchronization,<br>    <br>    and concurrency. All patterns present extensive examples and known uses in multiple programming languages, including C++, C, and Java.<br>    <br>    The book can be used to tackle specific software development problems or read from cover to cover to provide a fundamental understanding of the best practices for constructing concurrent and networked applications and middleware.<br>    <br>    About the Authors<br>    <br>    This book has been written by the award winning team responsible for the first POSA volume "A System of Patterns", joined in this volume by Douglas C. Schmidt from University of California, Irvine (UCI), USA.<br>    <br>    Visit our Web Page</span>

                    <span>First, the patterns in this book are very good. It was nice to see some coverage of low level networking patterns. As an experienced programmer, I was vaguely familiar with many of the patterns already, but it is really helpful to see the lines drawn in the sand, to hear why the authors chose to break things up as they did, and to understand the ramifications of the patterns in greater detail (eg, their clarification of the  difference between Observer and Interceptor was quite helpful). I even got to learn some new patterns! (The Leader / Followers pattern was new to me.)
<br />
<br />That said, the writing style about drove me BANANAS! I have never lost my place in a sentence when reading a book so many times. I must have read every line twice. Look, I'm a computer geek - I LOVE dense technical books, but this is something else. It's like reading Shakespear, or Charles Dickens. The authors must have been paid by the word. The specific implies the general! Have mercy! I don't need the difference between an interface and its concrete implementation belabored every time it comes up (and in a patterns book, believe me it's often!)</span>

                    <span>Big problems really are different from small problems. Solutions to small problems rarely scale well - the big solution often has to be different in kind from the small one. This book is about solutions to big problems, the kind that may involve hundreds of servers and thousands of clients, or more.
<br />
<br />This gives a clear, thorough description of about 15 design patterns that work well large, performance-sensitive applications. Some (like "Scoped Locking") depend on the specific semantics of C++, but may work in Java or C# if used carefully. Others are highly specialized implementations of more general patterns. The "Leader/Followers" pattern, for example, is a one implementation of the "Object Pool" pattern (see Grand, 'Patterns in Java', 1998) used for a particular purpose. On the whole, the authors did a fair job of relating these patterns to others in the literature. I was only occasionally frustrated that I did not have that literature at hand when reading this.
<br />
<br />The authors go into extreme detail in describing implementations based on each pattern, something sure to help some readers. There is often a C++ implementation as well, at least in skeletal form. The descriptions go on at great length, averaging almost thirty pages of discussion for each pattern. More isn't necessarily better, though, and some descriptions would have benefitted from a slimming program. I would also have been grateful for more differential discussion - comparing patterns, in terms of the specific decision critieria that argue for one pattern vs. another.
<br />
<br />The back matter in this book takes about 100 pages - glossary, bibliography, and indices by pattern, topic, and author names. Very helpful stuff. If it's going to be that long, however, a sentence or two about the more important references would have added little bulk but lots of value to the bibliography.
<br />
<br />The book is a good one, giving lots of practical information about the patterns it discusses. It's aimed at an experiecned reader, someone already conversant with OO programming, patterns, and at least a taste of problems bigger than classroom exercises or solo projects. A bit less mass chosen a bit more carefully would have improved this book, but it's still a worthwhile addition to my technical library.

                    <span>Doug Schmidt is a world authority on Corba and a helpful and unassuming person; so I was eager to get this book since he is listed as one of four co-authors. <br>However after 1 1/2 years of sitting on my shelf and not being used much, I think someone needs to point out to the editor, that it is not very readable.  <br>The GOF patterns book (by Vlissides) was a pleasure and easy to read. However this book is full of bewildering sentences like (page 217, 2nd sentence, 1st para). Exact quote:<p>"When asynchronous service processing completes, the application must handle the corresponding completion events delivered by the operating system to indicate the end of the asynchronous computations."<p>If most of the reader's mental effort is spent in parsing such sentences, rather than grappling with concepts, then the purpose is lost. <br>The hallmark of a skillful writer lies in being able to explain great (though complex) concepts clearly.<br>It is puzzling because Prof. Schmidt's papers are clearly written; "too many co-authors spoil the broth" :)</span>

                    <span>It's a great topic for a book - concurrent network programming.  <p>Although the documented patterns suit server and client applications, I would have prefered to see them treated in a more general context.  I would also prefer to see the patterns explained in far fewer pages.  Each pattern is usually described with a heavy emphasis on a very specific example (like an HTTP server) rather than in conceptual terms.</span>
