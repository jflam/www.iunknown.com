<p>Congrats!  Having nearly made it to my toddler's 3rd birthday, I'll share with you three important things I learned (out of many, many things):</p>

<p>1 - When baby sleeps, everyone sleeps.  Don't let yourself be lulled into thinking "ahh, finally a chance to veg or write or read or eat or ...".  With sleep coming in 1-3 hour spurts every 2-3 hours, just take a clue from Matthew and close your eyes too.  I didn't, and experienced a degree of sleep deprivation I wouldn't wish on anyone.</p>

<p>2 - If there's something happening that you're not sure you can live with or take much longer (a feeding or sleeping schedule, or fussiness, or whatever), don't worry, it will change, soon.  The way it is today is not the way it will always be.  In fact, it may not last the week.  It helps to remind yourself of this when things are particularly tough.<br />
  <br />
3 - Hugs and snapshots, lots of them.  I'm telling you from experience, in just a little while (a finger snap in time), you'll be sitting there talking to your 2.5 yr old at the dinner table about why he thinks hot dogs are the greatest thing in the world or why he doesn't want to use the potty, listening to a voice that's now amazingly familiar but that you longed to hear for years, wondering how you got here so quick from those (now) blurry all-nighters pacing and patting him on the behind to calm him down to sleep.  It's amazing.</p>

<p>Enjoy it all.<br />

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Oh yeah, one more:</p>

<p>4 - Never sit down with Matthew in a position that you can't comfortably sustain, because if Matthew falls asleep, you will resist moving at all costs in order to sustain it (even as parts of you fall asleep, or begin to ache).  It's best to just get comfy right up front.<br />

<p>Honestly, it's simple: babies love routine - you enforce the wake/sleep cycle on them. You need to patch their BIOS asap: their "natural" wake/sleep cycle is non-optimal!</p>

<p>Congratulations! Raising a child is the most important thing you will ever do in your life.</p>

<p>I totally agree with Eric - no matter how much you want to stay awake to get some extra work done, GO TO SLEEP WHEN THE BABY DOES. I learned this the hard way. You don't really get that much productive work done (you're sleep deprived, remember?). I've found that I got my best work done while the baby was nursing. Or the best sleep, for that matter.</p>

<p>Cook. Clean. Do the laundry. If you didn't do these things before the baby was born, learn how. Be prepared to do it without ever getting any thanks - Mommy's going to be awfully busy and may not notice. It also goes a long way towards preventing the otherwise inevitable fight that will occur because you're both exhausted and trying to cope with your new responsibilities.</p>

<p>Finally: be patient. The first couple of months SUCK but it does get better. The baby will start sleeping through the night, he'll stop needing his diaper changed every five minutes, and eventually he'll start being able to entertain/soothe himself.</p>

<p> -Be sure to take time out to continue dating your wife.<br />
 -Be sure to give Mama frequent breaks so she can have time to catch her breath.</p>

<p>Make good sleeping habits.  As time goes, you will be tempted to have the baby sleep with you due to late night feedings.  Don't do it!  Also, when the baby gets a little older, avoid pre-bed rituals that you are not willing to live with for awhile.  For example, if rocking or bottles is a bed time setup, then it might be required anytime they wake up during the night.</p>

<p>Also, you'll figure a lot of this stuff out over time.  Loving parents have done it for many years now.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You didn't post the specs for your latest hardware, what's Matthew's dimensions and mass?</p>

<p>One piece of advice - Go out to nice resteraunts while the baby is still sleeping all the time. It's much more difficult when he is alert and vocal. :)</p>

<p>Don't hurry back to work. The best thing I did for the arrival of my firstborn was to take four months off. It made everything so much less stressful for all of us.</p>

<p>Eric, Thanks for your tips! My wife really loves #2 and #4. It's actually quite amazing the contorted positions that I've found her in while she's holding / feeding Matthew!<br />

<p>Enjoy your son. He'll grow up faster than you can imagine. I have a 2 year old and it seems like it was just yesterday he was like your son is in the pictures. </p>

<p>Spend time with him! I think that's the best gift a father can give his children. Teach him all you can. Don't be afraid to show him stuff. He will learn faster than you can imagine.</p>

<p>Spend time with him! Factor that into your global life schedule now. </p>

<p>During night time feedings, keep the lights down very low and maintain quiet (no talking). Feed, change and back to bed. It helps let the baby know that its not time to be awake. My daughter started slepping through the night after just a week and a half.</p>

<p>As I have daughter who'll be two in a bit under a week I must especially agree with the tip about the restaurants!</p>

<p>As the other comments seem to agree, the most important thing is to enjoy the experience, as that makes a lot of the other good things happen almost automatically.</p>

<p>There are a few things that my wife and I wish we'd found out about earlier in the scheme of things (the "Why didn't we buy/think of/hear about this before?" moment). YMMV, of course, but two that spring to mind are Metanium (or whatever the brand name for titanium dioxide cream is in your neck of the woods) which clears nappy rash quicker than you could ever imagine, and a bath seat which resembles a deck chair (consists of some towelling stretched over a frame) which infinitely improved the whole bath time experience for all concerned.</p>

<p>If any more occur to me I'll report back here (or maybe even post them on my blog, as there seem to be an ever increasing number of "new daddies" amongst the techie bloggers I read...).</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>Paul.</p>

<p>1.  Keep the house noisey.  Don't lower the volume levels when baby sleeps, otherwise he'll end up requiring absolute quietness to get to sleep.</p>

<p>2.  Mama's breats getting sore from breastfeeding ?  Frozen cabbage leaves make a comforting compact.</p>

<p>3.  Excellent books are Babies (and later) Toddler Taming by Dr Christopher Green</p>

<p>4.  Get a sheepskin rug to use as his primary bedding surface.  Studies indicate that this decreases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome  (aka cot death).  But much more importantly, this will become viewed as his bed and is totally transportable.  So you can go out and he'll still sleep in a strange environment because he has his lovely soft sheepskin.  Both of our babies loved their sheepskins, and we are able to truck them around and they would sleep *anywhere*, even at loud parties.</p>

<p>5.  Best encouragement you can give your kid:  "You're so clever !"</p>

<p>Enjoy ! </p>

<p>Hi, We are an Indian family, (Asian Indian).My daughter just turned 1, aug 31st. Man, has it been fun so far. Some thoughts as a dad for 14 months.</p>

<p>1. Freedom. Never restrict the child in anyway shape or form. This way they learn very fast. While crawling, if they hit somewhere, don't panic (unless there is a reason to, you know what I mean :-)). Mothers are the first to panic. If you don't panic, the child doesn't learn fear for a long time.</p>

<p>2. Don't say no for anything. Diversion is a better alternative if you can handle it. (That way they learn not to say no to others).</p>

<p>3. Don't get frustrated that you are not getting any time with either the child or the mother. That is the way it will be for sometime :-).</p>

<p>4. Leave the child free during associations, with others. This way the child becomes very much socially friendly with everybody and doesn't fear going to people. This is the problem I have seen with children who have turned introverts. BUT, keep an eye on the child at ALL times.</p>

<p>5. In the long term, never fight in front of the children, (did you say you don't fight at all??!!, well thats great then :-)).</p>

<p>6. The child will always respect/disrespect the people that his/her mother respects/disrespects, in the short term. In the long term it is the father that the child takes after (usually).</p>

<p>7. Till the child reaches youth, quantity time is more important to the child than quality time.</p>

<p>All the above are my opinion and so take what you like. :-).</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, do cook for your wife sometime during the week (if she is the one doing the main cooking). They will love it and its a sure way for a romance springing up. :).</p>
