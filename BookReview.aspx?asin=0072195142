                    <span>I gave it 2 stars because the content - all 1,000+ pages of it - doesn't match the title. It should be called "Web Programming - The Complete Overview."
<br />
<br />If you want to learn to use Dreamweaver specifically, look elsewhere. Of a thousand pages, exactly FOUR are dedicated to creating a form within Dreamweaver, two to creating a site map. There are whole chapters on ASP, Coldfusion, JSP, PHP, SQL, server authentication - notice that none of those topics are Dreamweaver-specific and all of them could easily be found in books specific to those topics.
<br />
<br />I hate it when programmers try to write for end-users. The content usually wanders woefully off-topic as they pursue what interests themselves rather than their readers. If you want a book for using Dreamweaver, this isn't it. If you want an overview and concepts about various types of web programming, you might like this. </span>

                    <span>This book is written the way computer books should be written -- easy to follow, tutorial style that also acts as a reference. Also, one of the main problems with books of this type is the adherence to the manual that is supplied with the software. That is not the case with this book. There is almost no overlap with the manual. There are quite a few Dreamweaver books out there, but most of the books I've seen are mere rehashings of the manual. Thanks to the authors Ray West and Tom Muck for delivering a quality work.</span>

                    <span>Dreamweaver MX The Complete Reference is a bit overwhelming at first, but so is the Studio MX Suite.  This book takes on the daunting task of explaining the ins and outs of DMX plus introduces the reader to Fireworks MX and Flash MX files. FMX and FLMX are part of the Studio MX Suite and I found it quite helpful to have an introduction as to how to integrate those files with DMX. <p>If you read UD4 The Complete Reference or are knowlegeable about the web, then definately skip Chapter 1.  Beginning with Chapter 2 though, hang on to your hat!  The chapters are arranged by task and by server technology.  For example, Chapter 9 deals with DMX's Advanced Page Design Tools.  It begins with templates and ends with the link checker.  Developing ASP pages is covered in chapter 15 and PHP is covered in chapter 18.  This arrangement makes it easy to find answers to your questions.  Depending on your needs, you may not have to or want to read all of the chapters. <p>On the whole, I've found DMX TCR a very good resource to have nearby when I need a quick answer.  The only problem I've found is that a few of the chapters are slow in getting "to the good stuff".</span>
