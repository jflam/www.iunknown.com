                    <span>This book explains the simplifed concept of PC-Card and PCMCIA. but it is not enough to understand well. If you want to develop the PCMCIA card device driver in windows operating system. Please choice this book. also Peer-to-peer communication is not care of this book. But you can find the source code of this book. .... exactly It is difficult to find the source code to me.<P>If you expect Windows NT or XP device driver, you need to buy the other WDM book to develop the Windows NT/XP device driver.<BR>also If you are going to develop the PCMCIA linux device driver. It is not good chioce for linux.</span>

                    <span>At the high price it's listed at, this book is definately not worth the money. Even with a publication date of April 2001, this book feels old. ASCII graphics were used instead of proper tables or graphics in numerous places, and many of the examples given are dated. In addition, a whole 20% of the book was devoted to DOS/Win3.1/OS2 (like anyone still use those), with 30% more being a copy of the freely available Linux PCMCIA Programmer's Guide (by David Hinds). That leaves 10% about Windows 95/98/NT/CE, 30% of introduction, and 10% of user documentation on utilities that are possibly useful. The book does however have a fairly decent overview (though incomplete) on the PCMCIA API's of the aforementioned OSes. It also makes a feeble attempt at covering CIS and Multi-Function cards (pretty much to the extent of "Just use this API" with no explaination behind it). The book definately falls short of the cover promise of being "everything you need to understand 16-bit, cardbus and multi-function pc cards".<P>If you're new to PCMCIA and want to get a general feal on PCMCIA programming on one of these OSes, this book might help you.... Otherwise, it'll probably be a waste of time and money. Consider getting something from the Mindshare series.</span>
