                    <span>"Tell me not in mournful numbers/ Life is but an empty dream.......Life is real/ Life is earnest/ and the Grave is not the goal/ Dust thou art, and to Dust thou turnest/ was not spoken of the soul."
<br />This is from Longfellow's " Psalm to life" and has the kind of affirmative, willful strength that much English Victorian poetry( Henley's Invictus, Tennyson's 'Ulysses' ' Browning's "Rabbi Ibn Ben Ezra" )
<br />Longfellow was the most highly esteemed poet of the nineteenth century . His long- poems were taught in American schools well into the middle of the twentieth century as American classics.I can remember going through 'Evangeline' and 'Hiawatha' and 'The Courtship of Miles Standish'( which is in this volume) in seventh and eighth grade.
<br />Longellow's reputation declined drastically perhaps because of his quite conventional language, and style.
<br />There is a  solidity, and sobriety in his verse which did not win twentieth - century favor. 
<br />However I find many of his poems have insightful and telling. I think too he should be valued as one writes in a positive and dignified way about the country and culture of which he is a part.   </span>

                    <span>"Working in these walls of time,<br>Some with massive deeds and great,<br>Some with Ornaments of Rhyme"<p>These are the lines of the first verse of a powerfully written poem "The Builders" which, to me, seems to be about living a moral, honorable life on which to build a future for all of society.  Such powerfull and truthfull words to live by.<p>On a whim, I recently pulled this book from my bookshelf to read(I have a copy in 'The Classic collectors edition' which I like mostly because it's prety decoration for my bookshelves.  As a child I learned "Paul Revere's Ride" in school, but never learned the full depth of Longfellow's works.  So refreshing are the realistic moralism of yesteryear, from a time when a persons works and deeds counted for something.<p>I was captivated by the brutality of "The Saga of king Olaf" as it recounted the brutal nordic kings' religious conquest of Scandanavia.  "Hiawatha's Song" swept me up into a tale of beauty of a time lost.  The poetry of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is writen with a beauty and elegance and even excitement which conveys thier meaning in stunning clarity.  As I read "Paul Revere's Ride" for the first time in over a decade I found myself speaking in the rythm of the hoofbeats of that steed Paul Revere rode.  <p>These historic poems are truly great, and should be read and cherished by all.</span>

                    <span>This slim paperback book from Dover Thrift Editions is an excellent starting place for those who are not familiar with the poetic works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It's inexpensive, a quick read (at only 84 pages), and contains much of Longfellow's most popular poems, plus some selected prose as well as a few more obscure works. Longfellow (1807-1882) was an absolute master of rhyme, meter, and the the actual SOUND of words, and he wrote with a strong sense of morality and ethics (one reason that he is gererally disregarded by modern poetry snobs, but loved by his faithful readers!). All in all, if you want to explore the poetic mind of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow for the first time, you can't go wrong with this book! Check out his masterful choice of words and imagery in poems like "The Christmas Bells", "The Slave's Dream", "Hymn to the Night", "A Psalm of Life", "The Building of the Ship", "The Reaper and the Flowers", "Excelsior", etc., etc., etc. Longfellow enthusiasts looking for a more complete or scholarly volume should check into some of the other Longfellow books offered on Amazon, particularly "The Complete Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow", although I found "Complete's" small print, (in columns, like most modern Bibles) to be a bit rough on the eyes....Either way, explore this excellent master of rhyme!</span>

                    <span>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was one of the most noteworthy poets of the 19th century United States. "Favorite Poems" brings together selections from about 40 years' worth of his career. While some of the poems seem very dated -- due to their sentimentality and conventional structure -- the best of these poems remain rewarding and enjoyable.<p>The focus in this collection is on Longfellow's shorter poems. So his long poems "The Song of Hiawatha" and "Evangeline" are not included, and not even excerpted. But the volume does contain many of his most memorable pieces: "The Wreck of the Hesperus," "The Village Blacksmith," etc. <p>The longest poem in the collection is "The Courtship of Miles Standish," a mini-epic of more than 30 pages. "Courtship" is a fascinating poem about the colonial era Puritans, and offers a fascinating perspective on gender relations, race, religion, and other aspects of Puritan culture. "Courtship" makes for an interesting companion text for both actual Puritan era writings (like Mary Rowlandson's captivity narrative) and later literary works about that era (like Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible").<p>Another noteworthy poem is "The Slave's Dream," a somewhat romantic, but sympathetic view of an enslaved African-American. Also included is "Paul Revere's Ride," a wonderfully musical poem that, like "The Courtship of Miles Standish," looks back at American history. "Paul Revere's Ride" has a particularly impressive rhyme scheme to complement Longfellow's masterful use of meter. Yes, some of Longfellow's work may not seem very relevant to contemporary audiences. But "Favorite Poems" contains much that remains vital, and deserves a continuing readership both in and out of schools.</span>
