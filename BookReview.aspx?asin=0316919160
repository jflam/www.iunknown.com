                <span id="Label1">Microsoft's interview process is a notoriously grueling sequence of brain-busting questions that separate the most creative thinkers from the merely brilliant. So effective is their technique that other leading corporations--from the high-tech industry to consulting and financial services--are modeling their own hiring practices on Bill Gates' unique approach. HOW WOULD YOU MOVE MOUNT FUJI? reveals for the first time more than 35 of Microsoft's puzzles and riddles.</span>

                    <span>There's been a need for a book like this for years. Like most people in IT, I've encountered these types of questions and have had complicated feelings about them. (When I solve a puzzle, I think they're great, of course.) I've read several of Poundstone's other books and knew he was a terrific writer. This didn't disappoint. It looks perceptively at how these questions are used and misused today. It is not a long book. I read it in one weekend, and I wish more books were like that. Well worth it for anyone in the job market, anyone who likes puzzles, anyone interested in the whole idea of measuring intelligence and creativity.</span>

                    <span>Mount Fuji is one of the best nonfiction books I've read in a long while. If epod would read it, I think he'd agree. The book is *NOT* some simplistic cheatsheet. It's a serious, nuanced, critical look at employee evaluations. Needless to say, one cardinal theme is that you don't ace these interviews by memorizing right answers. It's all about showing the interviewer how you approach a problem. Unless you do that, you're dead. With some questions, it's good to come up with a unique answer the interviewer hasn't heard . . . It's also interesting to learn of the backstage voting on candidates, which is hilarious and scary. I learned a lot from this book, and unlike most books of its kind, it's written in a style that makes it fun to read.</span>

                    <span>I bought a digital copy of this book and was hoping I could read it from my notebook. The problem is the stupid Adobe ebook can only be installed in one computer, and once the computer has problem, your book gone. The worse is after I tried to open this book after couple weeks, the stupid Adobe reader asked me to activate the software again, and even after I activated it, it still don't allow me to open it. A dialog box with message "Would you like to learn more about documents protected with Adobe DRM?" kept poping out.<P>I have no idea why Adobe can sell such immatured software and why Amazon use such stupid software to hurt her customers???</span>

                    <span>I liked 'How Would You Move Mount Fuji?' I really did - until about the middle of it. It starts with a very thorough and interesting survey of the history of the technical interview and continues to make a nice analysis of its purpose and several of the techniques used in conducting interviews. But that's where the good stuff ends.<BR>A vast part of the book is dedicated to listing dozens of brainteasers of various levels of difficulty and describing their solution (sometime in an excruciating level of detail). This might be fun if you're a first-time riddle solver, but it has almost nothing to do with the topic of the book - how does Microsoft conduct their selection process.<BR>I bought this book as part of trying to become a better technical interviewer. Not that I would ever use brainteasers in an interview (I think that's wrong for O so many reasons), but I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the way the people from Redmond do it. And that's exactly what I didn't get. Instead, I got a list of questions that, by publishing this book, became unusable even if I had intended to use riddles in my interviews. Besides, if you want to read sample interview questions asked at Microsoft, turn to Google.<BR>So if a list of riddles is what you're after - go ahead and buy this book (although there are better brainteaser books out there). If you want to learn how to give or pass interviews, this book is not the one for you.</span>

                    <span>The book is only about 140 pages in the hard-back, which is fairly short. The remaining pages are solutions to some puzzles listed in the book. <P>Poundstone gives a nice history of the use of puzzle-type interviews. You learn some Microsoft trivia, get some cool puzzles with solutions, and a discussion on the pros and cons of puzzle interviews. My only gripe is that the puzzles are in the 4th of 8 chapters. I skipped that chapter, and after reading the book I am now working the puzzles. Very entertaining if you enjoy logic puzzles/brainteasers.</span>
