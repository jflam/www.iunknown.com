I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT I CAN AT LEAST 2 PUTT ON EVERY HOLE. THIS BOOK GOES INTO SCIENTIFIC DETAIL AND THEN MENTAL DETAIL ABOUT PUTTING. IT IS EVERYTHING YOU WILL EVER NEED TO KNOW</span>

                    <span>I give this 5 stars because it's an excellent book, which is not to say *you* will love it - it just might not be your style. There aren't a lot of anecdotes, and surely no fluff. That last reviwer sure got it wrong - first he says it's very techical, then it's an infomercial? Which is it? 2 stars because Pelz mentions how to use a couple of his products? I found that helpful. If you don't want them, skip those few paragraphs.<P>But on to the meat. This is just packed with hard facts based on real research. Anyone who doesn't like this book will probably be the type of person who just wants a band-aid. There is no quick fix here - you will be told what it takes to seriously improve your putting. And that kind of improvement does not come for free. But Pelz boils it down to the core. This is *the* putting bible, as far as I'm concerned.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book, but we must leave room at the top for better books (by Dave Pelz, of course :-) Since his "Putting Bible" came out, there is no longer any need for this book. "The Bible" has everything this book has and then some. If you are looking for a used book in paperback to save a lot of money off the hardcover bible, then this represents an excellent value, since the basic ideas are here.<P>Note - this is not for those looking for a few tips, band-aids, or just some feel-good words to make you feel better about yourself. This is serious game-improvement stuff. If you just want to daydream about being a better putter, get a putting book by one of the other guys. If you REALLY want to be a better putter, get this and get to work!</span>

                    <span>I've watched Dave Pelz on the golf channel and took some of his chipping tips to the practice green where they really helped. I expected as much from this book. Unfortunately most of the practice methods in this book require using Pelz' special practice equipment and therefore aren't very helpful unless you have these items. There is some interesting info on the lack of consistency in how a golf ball rolls, but other than that I didn't get much out of this book. I certainly didn't need to read this to know that taking several hundred practice putts a week will make you a better putter, and that is the bottom line.</span>

                    <span>This well-written and easily digestible book by Dave Pelz is as good as any book you're likely to encounter on the subject of putting. It teaches all the fundamentals and backs them up with Pelz's research.<P>One of the most useful parts of the book is the putting games that it describes. The most useful of them, "Safety Drawback," teaches you to hit the ball into a "cone" past the hole.<P>Reading this book alone won't make you a better putter, of course. That'll take about 10,000 more practice putts. :) But at least you'll know what to practice.<P>I can't find any major faults with this book. Pelz suggests a particular technique but he also accepts that many other strokes and techniques work well. Whether you're a beginner who is still trying to figure out what a decent putting stroke looks like, or an experienced player who is just trying to work out the kinks in his game, you'll find at least something in this book to help you. Highly recommended and, at present, there's no better book on the market as far as I know.</span>
