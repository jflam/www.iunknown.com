                    <span>Anne Bruce and James S. Pepitone have written a basic, hands-on book about motivating employees more effectively. They emphasize the need for your employees to become self-motivated, since only intrinsic motivation truly works. The book provides good, specific suggestions about ways to increase motivation. However, its core principles sound familiar - like material from an Organizational Behavior 101 textbook. Nonetheless, this book provides a good, easy-to-read summary of these fundamental ideas. We [...] recommend this book to supervisors or managers who want to refresh their foundation in motivating employees, or to new managers who need to acquire this ability.<br /></span>

                    <span>This book was a great inspiration for me.   I am just starting out in my career in my first management position and I seek out different philosophies so that I can meld together the parts that I like in order to  create a unique and effective management style.    After reading Motivating  Employees, I am eager to practice the theories in my current position and  take with me what I have learned, to use at each stage of my career.  <p>I  expect this book to influence a lot of people in extremly positive ways  because of its inviting format and practical theories.</span>

                    <span>Having read many books on motivation and leadership in the work place, I can't think of one that "hits home" as close as this one. <p>Its conversational, no-nonsense tone takes the reader through theory and  application in an effective, easy-to-understand way. How refreshing to  actually be able to understand the complexity of Theory X and Theory Y!  And, not only that, but to be able to begin generating practical ideas as  you read this book for your own work environment!<p>The format's quick tips  and chapter highlights add valuable impact that keeps the reader thoroughly  engaged. The book examines some of the world's most admired companies and  their unique approaches to developing people and influencing positive  motivation and overall morale. <p>As a senior manager for one of America's  largest financial institutions, I highly recommend this book. I'm very  eager to get started on the other books in this series.</span>
