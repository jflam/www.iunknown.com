                    <span>Exodus by Leon Uris is a gripping novel. This epic story is the epitome of human natures ability to suffer, to persevere, and to succeed. This novel comes highly recommended by me. <P>The Exodus follows the story of people. Not just any people, a special type of person, a Jew. The Jewish population has undergone numerous tyrants that have tried, unsuccessfully, to banish the Jewish population from the face of the earth. The Exodus follows these people as they return to their rightful homeland of Jerusalem. During the course of this novel, they face numerous obstacles on there road to the rebirth of a Jewish homeland. Even after the forming of the Jewish state of Israel, Jews are persecuted for pursuing peace. The story of the Israel is astonishing. I was quickly surprised by the benevolent and unselfish ways of Jews through their lives. They give all to their Israel, including their life. <P>The Exodus focuses on a few important characters. Yakov Rabinsky a.k.a. Akiva, Jewish extremist fighter. Jossi Rabinsky a.k.a. Barak Ben Canaan, brother of Yakov, Jewish conservative, father of Jewish politics. Karen Hansen Clemet, Jewish refugee in search of her father. Dov Landau, Jewish survivor of the German concentration camps. Kitty Fremont, American nurse out to look for a daughter figure. Jordana Canaan, Jewish sabra fighter. And finally, Ari Ben Canaan, famed fighter for the Jewish people.  The Exodus has been the one of the few assigned reading books that I have enjoyed reading. The story of these people and their home is an example of human nature at its best. This novel connects with me. The story, the character, the settings, and the plots all are not fanaticized. Whether or not it these actual people existed is irrelevant. It is all so believable. The novel is filled with tragedy, but the common goal was something worth fighting for. Once everyone united and fought for it, it was achieved. And that I believe was the best thing about the novel, to see that everyone's unselfishness, benevolence and hard work came to show in the birth of Israel. The Exodus does have one downfall. The beginning of the novel is slow and somewhat confusing. The beginning of the novel lacks a common antagonist and therefore leaves you confused. Once you do get past the first fifty eight pages, the novel takes off and you can get quite interested. <P>Despite this minor setback, the Exodus was gripping and inspiring. Some parts of the novel made you angry, made you want to cry, made you want to fight, and most important, made you contented at their success. The Exodus was an excellent novel and should be read by anyone with the opportunity.</span>

                    <span>Prior to reading this book I did not understand the history behind anti-semitism and its place in the World War. I come from a part of the world(Asian) where we were hardly affected by the Jewish plight. This book quite accurately describes the Jewish struggle to reclaim what they had lost and what was rightfully theirs. I agree with some of the reviews that Leon Uris' emotional involvement as a Jewish himself and the resulting portrayal of all Jews as heroic and all British and Arabs as evil comes forth. But why would it not . . . I'm not sure that anyone could remain totally objective if one's ancestors were treated by the world the way Jews have been. But more importantly he should be given credit on depicting the historical events as accurately as possible. To the critics, I would like to say that even if an iota of this book is true (and I believe its much more than that)its still a heroic achievement on the part of the Jews. I fell in love with two of the heroes .. Barak Ben Caanan and Ari Ben Canaan. If one sees the enormity of what the Jews have accomplished against all odds its not hard to believe that such heroes must have been in abundance. I am not a religious person but I can't wait to visit the land of Israel someday and pay my respects to this amazing accomplishment of the amazing Jewish people.</span>

                    <span>"Exodus" isn't perfect. The characters are rather<BR>stereotypical. I think Herman Wouk is a better author.<BR>But I found "Exodus" at just the right time in my life<BR>for its message, I guess. One has to remember it IS<BR>historical fiction, and one might describe some of it as<BR>propaganda, but it is powerful. He is sympathetic to the<BR>Palestinian Arabs, used as pawns by the <BR>Arab governments, who <BR>are the main villains of the story<BR>though they don't come off as heroic as the Israelis....I can live with all the<BR>characterizations.</span>

                    <span>This is the story of Jewish statehood with a few contrived characters awkwardly attached - like the miniature bride and groom on a wedding cake. The Jews were strong, courageous, beautiful, and full of sensual vitality. The Arabs were weak, treacherous, and motivated by hate and ignorance. In the end, the Jews achieved independence and the reader is assured the Arabs will regain their own cultural prominence once they resolve to follow the example set by the Jews. It's a nice story, but for historical accuracy, I'll stick with Harry Potter.</span>

                    <span>The book Exodus is a fabulous introductory text about the history of the founding of the state of Israel. It tells the story of the people and places that made Israel what it is today. Leon Uris weaves several amazing stories into a historical fiction with some of the most descriptive, evocative literature ever written.<P> Exodus is not a story of only one person. Uris was able to interlace the stories of several different characters into a common time and place while still developing each character very well. The novel itself, was surprisingly accurate, almost every event mentioned occurred when it was listed and happened as Uris described it. Maybe that's why Uris himself spent years researching his tale.<P> I particularly liked the book for several reasons. First, Mr. Uris wrote the book from the standpoint of several different characters, which allows the reader to develop several different opinions about the events taking place. Second, because there are so many characters, there are more heart stopping moments, moments when you laugh or cry. Finally, Leon Uris' imagination allowed for the characters within the story of Israel have a story all there own which is at least as heart pounding as the story of their homeland. <P> Exodus is truly a must read for those who know little about the foundation of the modern state of Israel and would like to learn more. I highly recommend this book to anyone.</span>
