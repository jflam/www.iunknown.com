                <span id="Label1">The second edition of Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming is essential reading for beginners to functional programming and newcomers to the Haskell programming language. The emphasis is on the process of crafting programs and the text contains many examples and running case studies, as well as advice an program design, testing, problem solving and how to avoid common pitfalls.  <P>Building on the strengths of the first edition, the book includes many new and improved features:  <P>Complete coverage of Haskell 98, the standard version of Haskell which will be stable and supported by implementations for years to come.  <P>An emphasis on software engineering principles, encouraging a disciplined approach to building reusable libraries of software components.  <P>Detailed coverage of the Hugs interpreter with an appendix covering other implementations.  <P>A running case study of pictures emphasizes the built-in functions which appear in the standard prelude and libraries. It is also used to give an early preview of some of the more complex language features, such as high-order functions.  <P>List comprehensions and the standard functions over lists are covered before recursion.  <P>Early coverage of polymorphism supporting the "toolkit" approach and encouraging the resuse of built-in functions and types.  <P>Extensive reference material containing details of further reading in books, journals and on the World Wide Web.  <P>Accompanying Web Site supporting the book, containing all the program code, further teaching materials and other useful resources.</span>

                    <span>This book, in conjunction with other resources, is a good introduction to Haskell.  http://www.haskell.org has a lot of guidance as well.  
<br />
<br />If you are like me and you are learning Functional Programming after many years of other styles of programming Haskell can be daunting.  Books like this explain things from the fundamental levels to more advanced levels.  If you read the introduction to the book you will see that it is natural to skip around chapter to chapter when it becomes appropriate to do so.  Deciding when it's appropriate is going to depend on your goals.  If you want to write full-blown applications in Haskell you may find yourself skipping around much earlier than someone who wants to cover the language completely.
<br />
<br />Overall I find this to be a very good book but some of the exercises can be very difficult for someone new to Functional Programming.  Almost anything worth doing is not easy though :).</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent piece for individuals in the software industry who have programmed and have excellent skills with programming languages however did not encounter the other concept which I call functional programming. It's a good start depending what is the intended goal and use. If you're currently programming some sort of mathematical logic programs or a combination of boolean algebra and proover verification systems, then that's the book for you. It serves the purpose.</span>

                    <span>This book may indeed be suitable for beginners in functional programming. Having had some previous exposure to FP, I found it very slow going, with tediously long discussion of trivial toy examples.<p>Aggravating these flaws is the typography, which is not just ugly, but dysfunctional: The font used for the unnumbered section headers is not sufficiently distinguished from the text font, so it is impossible to skip over the examples to new material being discussed.</span>

                    <span>This was my first text on Haskell, and it certainly got me up to speed on all the essential elements. I prefer Hudaks text for most things, but there is no good reason not to own every Haskell book you can get your hands on. This book is especially strong on learning how to prove things about programs. <p>It doesnt get to Monads until near the end, but  perhaps that is a good thing. It depends on what you want out of a text. <p>I used this text for self study, and it is well suited to such a task.</span>
