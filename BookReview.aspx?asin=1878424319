                <span id="Label1">Sit at the foot of a native elder and listen as great wisdom of days long past is passed down. In <I>The Four Agreements</I> shamanic teacher and healer Don Miguel Ruiz exposes self-limiting beliefs and presents a simple yet effective code of personal conduct learned from his Toltec ancestors. Full of grace and simple truth, this handsomely designed book makes a lovely gift for anyone making an elementary change in life, and it reads in a voice that you would expect from an indigenous shaman. The four agreements are these: Be impeccable with your word. Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions. Always do your best. It's the how and why one should do these things that make <I>The Four Agreements</I> worth reading and remembering. <I>--P. Randall Cohan</I></span>

                    <span>The Four Agreements is a fantastic book that brought me a lot of inner peace and new understanding. This book is now among my favorites, and I found myself more and more at peace from reading it. I would refer back to this book again and again. 
<br />It's clearly a classic, and now one that I treasure because of the insight it brought me. Excellent! </span>

                    <span>This book is simple and concise. There are four things to be conscious of and  practice. If you are looking for an uncomplicated way to practice spirituality, this may be the one for you.</span>

                    <span>The Four Agreements presented in this book are fantastic. They are simple, easy to put into practice, and they make a difference. It's too bad that the rest of the book is filled with New Age spiritual mumbo jumbo and meaningless platitudes. (I don't take it personally, though . . .)  This "filler" material made it hard for me to trudge through the book.</span>

                    <span>Yes, the ideas presented in the book may seem "simple" and "obvious," but I think that's the point.  Those on the path to self awareness sometimes make things a little more complicated than they are.  If you keep these four guidelines close to your heart, all the answers to your questions will come to you when the time is right.
<br />
<br />As to those who are reviewing this book so negetively after reading it, I just have one piece of advice: refer to Agreement number 2.</span>

                    <span>Don Miguel Ruiz wrote the Four Agreements based on ancient Toltec Wisdom. However, these simple truths are repeated over and over in every spiritual tradition, from Christianity to Hinduism. 
<br />
<br />The most exciting thing about this book is its simplicity. In a nutshell, this book is about taking responsibility for how we feel and what we say and do. It is about how our words and thoughts create our realities and that by simply listening to our internal dialogue and noticing when the "judge" is in charge, we can change our lives. Heaven and Hell, Ruiz claims are purely states of perception.
<br />
<br />This is simple and deeply profound wisdom that can change your life. Take the time to read, learn and live the Four Agreements.  </span>
