                    <span>Sometimes a writer's bias is so transparent that you don't even need to develop a rebuttal. You simply acknowledge his bias and respect his right to express his extreme, albeit twisted, view of the world. 
<br />
<br />Goozner is an economist, I majored in economics in both undergrad and grad school, the rest of my education is in chemistry, molecular biology, business and law. He writes about academic research, I have worked at National Laboratories and well known universities. He writes of the pharmaceutical industry, where I spent nearly a decade. And he writes about the biotechnology industry, where I spent another decade. Amazingly, all my life I have spent discovering and developing drugs. So I think I can say I read this book not as a layman, although at times it seemed to be written by one. 
<br />
<br />I usually enjoy books that are critical of things. They have a tendency to keep us honest and make us all too aware of our faults. But this book, while laudable for its story telling and historical walkabout, did not really get to a point where it stood on firm ground. So in the end, it was so overstated in its extremism, I could not take it seriously. Any good point that could have been made was underminded in its credibility by statements at times so braced by sheer nonsense, I felt bad for the author. I never did take this book seriously.
<br />
<br />Goozer is one of those folks that does not believe the constitution is correct to provide protection to inventions through patents. Nor does he seem to believe in capitalism. Rather, he posits that pure open academic research is all that is needed to develop drugs. To him, the Bahy-Dole Act was a license for the pharmaceutical industry to steal from academia.
<br />
<br />He would have us believe that all the great drugs developed today really come from academia. If you believe that, then you believe that the internet, as we now know it, including Amazon.com itself, came 100% from academia. Well no Mr. Goozner, Netscape founders and developers of Mosaic did indeed develop their "inventions" at the University of Illinois, but it took good old capatilism and $$ to turn all that into sophisticated products and tools. That is called fundamental research, basic research, being developed into marketibal products. The goal of academic research is not to develop marketable products, it is to further knowledge. The Bayh-Dole Act briged that basic research to the marketplace and last year alone, "academia" made $4 billion from license fees it recieved from those crooks that stole their technology and passed it off as their own after faking an $800 million investment.
<br />
<br />The tens of thousands of industry scientists that spend decades developing drugs based on technology licensed from academia should be insulted by a book claiming they had no role in developing the product. I know I am, and I was in academia once.
<br />
<br />Lots of things in his book are just plain wrong. To many to list. No need to, because his fundamental thesis is wrong to. I don't question his telling of all the history though, just his conclusions from it.
<br />
<br />Lets take the $800 million. He tells us it costs only $100 million and not $800 million to develop a drug. Well, that is not quite what that number means. The $800 million is the cost for the one drug that made it to market, and the 50 that failed in research. That is called an absorbed cost. You see, the vast majority of drugs that are developed never see the pharmacist's shelf. I worked on one such drug that was abandoned after my company spent over $50 million developing it. Now if you are a stockholder, you think you might want a return on your investment. That one successful drug is it. 
<br />
<br />If we follow Mr. Goozner to the end of his diatribe, we would find that he literally expects the entire drug industry to be a non-profit industry. Well then, since Amazon.com was created from technology that came from academia, it should declare non-profit status and give away all its profits.
<br />
<br />What could have been a strong calling to task on the pharmaceutical industry turned out to be nothing more than the fringe, almost socialist, views of an anticapitalist.
<br />
<br />Finally, for an economist I was amazed that he managed to oversimplify how the pharmaecutical industry makes development decisions with all his "me too" drug conclusions. If I have to explain that one I am afraid I am going to have to hop on my pro Posner/Pareto/Coase pedistle and preach, which I don't want to do. That takes me back to my first statements. This author is bias against patents, capitalism, and a little uninformed about science (when he tried to be one, he made it obvious why he is not one). But I did like the walk through history, enough to ignore the misleading filters through which me wanted us to view that history. I gave him an extra star for that one. If you are a social engineer or igorant, you might like this book. If you are at all informed, it will leave you like a parody, amused and nothing more.

                    <span>This book tells the truth behind the cost of new drugs. Why do life-saving prescription drugs cost so much? American taxpayers are getting bamboozled by paying for government-funded research with their taxes and then by paying sky-high prices for the drugs resulting from the research.
<br />
<br />The first question is why do new drugs cost so much? The second question is how many of these new drugs are truly highly-effective and life-saving?</span>

                    <span>I won't discuss the content of the book, as many have already done so.  I will merely mention the aspect of the book that struck me the most - Mr Goozner's suggestion that there doesn't need to be a pharmaceutical industry at all.  The amount of work that took place at NIH and NIH-funded labs on so many key compounds surprised even me, and I work in Big Pharma clinical development.  The perfidy of companies like Burroughs-Wellcome, who resisted working with live HIV after the NIH was ready to hand over a nearly complete clinical program to them for AZT, was breath-taking.  The newest industry propaganda website on medical advances (I refuse to provide a link) highlights the development of AZT, Taxol, etc with the implied message that they provided those medicines to the public.  Read this, and you won't be able to stomach those Lane Armstrong Schering ads any more.  </span>
