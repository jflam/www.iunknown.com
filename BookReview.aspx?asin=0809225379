                    <span>First I would like to thank Talane Miedaner on writing an excellent book on this subject. I have studied several books on self improvement and tried to apply their techniques in my life. But most of the books suggestions are not pragmatic. For example, almost every book stresses to avoid negative thinking. But no book tells you how to do it. 
<br />The brilliant feature of this book is that it gives practical step by step methods to improve your life. Instead of talking about vague ideas and idealistic world, this book tells specifically what to do. 
<br />The most important concept I found in this book is about "Taking excellent care of yourself". To often in daily routines and trying to push ahead in life, we ignore ourselves. As we ignore ourselves, people ignore us too because other persons will value us as we value ourselves.
<br />I strongly recommend this book. It really improved my life.</span>

                    <span>What can I say? Except that this book is the hands down best thing I have bought for myself...ever! The advice is extremely pragmatic and you'll find yourself doing things to improve your life before you even finish the first chapter.  The seemingly small tasks you'll undertake usuing this book will yield BIG results -- everything from getting out of debt to communicating more effectively to looking better. She does a great job of explaining how you can do some elements of the program that seem expensive and indulgent in low-cost ways. **NOTE: The majority of the tips do not require any money at all.<br> <br>I am living proof that using Talane's methods work. Before this book, I was hopelessly in debt, making less than I deserved, looking and feeling downtrodden and depressed. Six months later, my credit is great, debts manageable, I make more money, enjoy my job more, I have hired an image consultant, I get manicures every week, and things just keep getting better.  <p>You don't have to do every step in order or do all 101 at once. And you don't have to be rich. Talane helps you build a strong foundation and then take steps to reach your potential. I can't explain it, but you will find yourself taking better care of yourself than you ever thought possible...and getting out of debt, making more money, with more confidence, looking better, in a cleaner home, more relaxed, and enjoying your life more than ever before. <p>If you can't afford to hire Talane herself to coach you, get this book. She has been very generous with sharing her coaching techniques in this wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>I picked up the book because I was interested in life coaching as a career as well as in useful self-help/life improvement tips. Well, taking the author's words and advice to heart, I also got a better, happier life!  <p>The book is divided into chapters of steps to take in order to move towards your ideal life - personal organization, self-care, career, relationships, money management, etc.  Although you are supposed to do the actions as you read them, I read the book through cover to cover first (which I recommend).  Knowing all of the steps from the outset really helped to get started on the right foot when I went back the second time and started doing the steps.  Plus it's exciting to see all that you will be working on and how it will change your life!<p>Besides an overall excellent program, the author's writing is conversational and very easy to read; the success stories are motivational and really hit home the points the author conveys. <p>Beware - the life changes don't happen overnight.  It takes belief in the system, hard work, and consistency.  But my life has not been the same since reading this book.  I've become a lot healthier physically and mentally, improved on all of my relationships including my marriage, moved to where I really want to live, and am pursuing the career of my dreams.  I don't think I would have had the tools and the courage to do all of it without this book, and I can't imagine where I'd be now without it.  <p>This is a book to keep in your library, to return to time and again, to reference, and to give to your family and friends.  Read it, believe it, do it, and change your life!</span>

                    <span>This book, in a few short days, gave me more insight into how to really stop thinking about my aspirations and how to get up and begin to live like they were just around the corner. It is incredible, and even if you think you have it together you can still learn a lot.</span>
