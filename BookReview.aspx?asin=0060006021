                    <span>Jeez, aside from about 30 pages of goodness about Steve Mcqueen and a few old-time H/A stories-which are told using lame-o aliases and seem to be recalled through a certain haze...this is just a steamin' pile of crap. Crap I could hear if I went to the gaywad leather bar in my town. What can I say, I have all the respect in the world for Barger, the H/A's, whatever, but I didn't pay money to read about a yuppie's BMW road trip. Seriously.
<br />
<br />I just expected better from somebody who has better stories than this (really, he's gotta have better stories...Son-come on, you don't have better than this??). I just kept thinking that Barger just really didn't want to be doing this, and it came down to these two nutsucker ghost-writers grasping at straws.</span>

                    <span>This book contains the most insipid Hell-raising stories I have ever read.  By Mr. Barger's standards, my accountant with a new Harley is likely a Hell-raiser.  Livin' Free apparently refers to the rare occasions that these petty criminals are not in jail for domestic abuse or writing bad checks or some other Hell-raising crime.  Mr. Barger says that the stories are partially or wholly invented.  This begs the question - How can fictional stories be so boring?  You might think a guy like this would write like a seventh grade kid with a lukewarm IQ.  You would be right.  In defense of the book's title, it is quite possible that many of the characters are ridin' high.  Perhaps if I was high, I would have enjoyed the book more.</span>

                    <span>Zimmerman's easy read of Barger's memories is a bit of history. One begins quite quickly to realize this history lacks credibility. Barger has reinvented the story of the gang-beating of Hunter Thompson. Skip Workman himself admitted in a 1967 television interview that women once in a while needed to be beaten like a rug. A woman's beating is the reason Thompson expressed his disapproval and was subsequently beaten (Workman's comments were specific to the Thompson beating). Barger softens the story in the book, as part of his overall attempt to change the reputation of the club and make them appear to be heroes. Barger further hopes to canonize himself through this self-fashioning. Once this credibility is broken, one cannot help but question the account of Barger's wife's accidental death while attempting to self abort. Barger freely admits he did not want children. As long as you are ready to indulge the over 60 Barger's attempt to use this quick read to convince you he is an American hero (he supported the Vietnam war), take a peek, it won't take much of your time.</span>

                    <span>I'm a native Californian and lifetime bike rider.  Like a lot of people, I've always had a kind of fascination with Hells Angels--and that debauched life-style.  I bought this book on a whim, thinking it might be interesting anecdotes/episodics. I was wrong; really wrong. <br>This book is a loose string of stories--some interesting, some boring.  The thing that really impacted me as a reader is the poor prose.  Even with two "with" writers/editors, it reads like a series of remedial essays.  Mix in the justifications, sexism, and plain hostility and it's just sad and a waste of time and money. <br>There's no way I'd read the other book (Hell's Angels) now.  This was so poorly written it was a near painful read.  I wish it had been different--but I just can't get past the constant attitude and room temperature IQ presentation.  Oh, one other thing; it's stated early that some of the stories are "true" and some are not...what the ...?!?  Yep, I used to teach and tutor English; given the context of publication, I'd have to give it a D.</span>

                    <span>Coming down hard off my last two reads, Saramago's All the Names and Llosa's Feast of the Goat, although great books, I was primed to drop the academy for a while and get high on some hard-boiled treat of American narrative. Behind the well-designed pulp-ish cover of "Ridin' High, Livin' Free," rebels rule, Barger's book calls out, like drag pipes tearing through town, custom painted gas tanks a glint in your girlfriend's eye. Here's the raw, street-wise tone Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett made famous, from tattoos and tears to biceps and the poetry of the search, American style, like Route 66 it never ends. Anecdotal ironies abound, the mystique, the myth, the clubhouse fish tales, stories of life, the other side of life, just trying to get though life, hang on to your life, get out and ride to save your life¯a little sympathy is ok, but don't complain. Don't be afraid to pick up this book, mainstream middle class sensibilities need to be stomped. Professors, assign it for your Literature of the Deviant class. These tales are for and about those who can still think for themselves. And if you like documentary photography, some of these photos helped create the archetype. Ride high, live free, the American code. Helmets off to Barger and the Zimmermans. Thanks for the refresher course. Now I want to crank up my Road King, tear across the states and rip pages from this book in hopes they find windshields.</span>
