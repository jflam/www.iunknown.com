                    <span>I read this book just after reading a really good C# book. This one paled in comparison. The writing is weak and hard to follow. I only made it about half way before I got bored and moved on.</span>

                    <span>If you're thinking about buying this book, don't.  Go with a reputable publisher who puts out quality work like O'Reilly or Wrox.  This book is a piece of trash.  The only "interesting perspective" it provides is the nearly half of the book that is dedicated to praising what a wonderous achievement the .NET platform is.  The author just can't get enough of telling people who already bought the book that .NET is better than Java and actually is an original idea.  Well, he does a lot of this and very little of teaching the language.  There are very few examples, and those that are there aren't useful at all.  The index is also terrible, making this book also worthless as a reference book.  I really can't find any redeeming qualities about this book except that it's printed on fairly high quality paper.  Far better than it deserves.  If you're completely new to this, it might be useful as an introduction, but there are better books for that as well.</span>

                    <span>Of the 25 computer books I've read this year, this is the worst. <br>I paid less than $2 for this book and may keep it for reference, but the author has no clue how to teach a subject or how to write about it. I suspect the outline was made by the publisher because the table of contents looks good. Unfortunately, everything between headings is poorly explained.</span>

                    <span>I've read the first 4 chapters twice and started reading part of chapter 5 before I gave up. The writing style is terrible. Do not get this book if you are a total beginner to ASP. Actually, do not even get this book at all. I have taken classes in C++, VB, and Java and it was still difficult for me to follow this book. The author goes into some really unnecessary details and there are many lines of code that he should not even be mentioning in this type of book. Lastly, this book was written with a pre-release version of Visual Studio .NET, so you'll just confuse yourself more. I wanted to learn how to build a web-based database application and figured that using ASP.NET would be the way to go. I think I'll try a book on PHP and MySQL next.</span>
