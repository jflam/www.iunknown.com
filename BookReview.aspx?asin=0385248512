                    <span>There are lots of books about business.  There are probably an equal number about creativity.  This book is about creativity in business.
<br />
<br />This book is the distillation of the course that Michael Ray and Rochelle Myers taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  It is theoretical.  It is practical.  It is wonderful. 
<br />
<br />The special delight of this book is the mixing of the theoretical and the research findings with the practical applications.   The authors present us with points, then give us stories and examples from the world of business and underpinnings from the world of scientific and psychological research that help explain why the examples work.  
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a book to give you a quick, simple way to come up with creative ideas in business, though, this ain't it.  This is a book that presents you with tools and some understanding of why they work, so that you can apply them in your life and in your business.  The key to the book is the title of one of the very first chapters: "Business As Art."  
<br />
<br />To practice an art, you must be creative.  You must go beyond the established norms and rules.  But you must also master some craft.  This book will give you an introduction to the craft of creativity, an introduction to the ways that you can make your creativity not only more effective, but more powerful as a transformer of your business.</span>

                    <span>Calling this book Creativity in Business is about as accurate as calling the New York Times something like Sportsweek. This was a great book but it basically encompassed WAY more than its promised subject. Most of this book is about eastern philosophy and western physics as it relates to business. I didn't expect to get a chapter on the universe and my cosmic place in it and how to meditate to tap into it. If you have read anything by Thich Naht Hanh or the Dalai Lama you can skip this one. Otherwise, it's probably worth a read.</span>

                    <span>A collection of thoughts, insights, anecdotes, exercises and real life examples of applying creativity to business.  If this is a structured approach, as the authors imply, the structure is hard to detect.  However, the exercises are intriguing and the anecdotes are inspiring.  Nice section on destroying the Voice of Judgment that shoots down creativity.  I'm baffled by the other reviews that describe this as a "new age" or "occult" book.  It is well-documented that creativity and intuition go hand-in-hand, but I guess this is just too esoteric an idea for most business people.</span>

                    <span>When I picked up this book, I expected something more structured and similar to many of the other business books I've read.  To my surprise, the authors have approached their subject by integrating Eastern philosophy  into Western business.  In my 25 years in business, I have experienced many  of the concepts they mention, so it's reaffirming to understand some of the  scientific explanations and similar experiences other successful business  people have had.  Business creativity requires this type of "out of  the box" thinking.  This is a terrific, mind-opening book - highly  recommended.</span>
