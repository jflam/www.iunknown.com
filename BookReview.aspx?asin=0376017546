                    <span>This book is jam-packed with great ideas.  Some of the rooms are just unbelievable.<p>The colors, patterns and storage ideas are very helpful.  And having all of the photos helps with getting the kids involved in picking out what they would like in their rooms.<p>My oldest daughter likes window seats, and we saw a bed in here with a curved entrance made like a window seat, and she really liked it.  So, I made her one similiar to the one in the book  and she really loves her bed.</span>

                    <span>I brought this book when I was planning a nursery for my little girl. It gives lots of realistic ideas budget wise and safety wise. There are lots of photos and it gives good tips on how to plan a room for your child that  he and you will not be sick of after a year or two.</span>

                    <span>This is a fun books with many good ideas.  I enjoyed the "fantasy" aspect of designing a child's room.  The main setback for us with executing many of the designs is budget limitations.  Also, be  aware that this is the same book as Sunset's "Ideas for Great Kids'  Rooms".  We bought both not realizing they are the same book.</span>
