                    <span>This book is a gem!  The information is well written, with a great balance of visual and narrative information.  The lessons are wonderfully easy to follow and even presented in nice 1 hour chunks.  If you like a hands-on approach this book is highly recommended.  I tried Visual Quickstart before reading this book and I was exasperated by the choppy narrative that left me feeling either over qualified or underqualified, but never just right.  The Macromedia book has done wonders to recover me from that abyss.</span>

                    <span>This book is fabulous for those who have never seen a copy of Dreamweaver in any incarnation.  The author gives simple and thorough explanations of each new skill and reinforces the skills throughout the book so that the student comes away with a working knowledge of the program and is confident enough to strike out on her own.  The author also interweaves simple design and programming philosophies into the text.  For those with some background in either HTML programming or in using Dreamweaver, the author also provides a quick synopsis so that students can skip sections that they do not need.  I own many training manuals for various programs and this is one of the best I've come across for those who are new to WYSIWSG web design programs.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I agree, this book should come with Dreamweaver. A phenomenal resource and wealth of information on Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004, a full-featured, professional, and seemingly complex yet intuitive software program. 
<br />I am a graphic artist/print professional who has toyed with the idea of getting into web design for years. Talk about timing! I love that the book supports a self-paced learning environment, that it is well-written and illustrated, self-critical of possible Macromedia bugs, written from the source, and full of alternative commands and shortcuts to obtain the same effect different ways--and best of all, informative without being overly "techno." 
<br />Great stuff! </span>

                    <span>I bought this book by mistake. I have a good basic understanding of Dreamweaver and this book is of no use to me. In fact this is the manual that should come with Dreamweaver. Very easy to use and follow but offers nothing to anyone who has gotten past the basics.</span>
