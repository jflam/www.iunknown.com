                <span id="Label1">Leon Zeisel is in big trouble. He is perpetually exhausted due to an  overactive icemaker in the hotel where he lives, he discovers in his  mother's desk a confidential envelope from his school announcing that he  displays "a troubling lack of fine motor skills," and worst of all, he  begins fourth grade under the tyrannical tutelage of Miss Hagmeyer, a  black-cloaked, black-wigged, mushroom-eared woman who is obsessed with  sewing, a fine motor skill if there ever was one. Insisting that all  instruction should stem from the Middle Ages and "The Heavenly Stitches  of Virtue," the Hag forces her students to sew an "animile" per month,  a stuffed animal of sorts that is not to exceed four s.p.i. (stitches  per inch) in the inseam. What happens when Leon decides to sew his  end-of-year "Master Piece," the "spitting image" of Miss Hagmeyer, an  exact miniature replica down to her liver-colored panty hose? Allen  Kurzweil creates a magical, eccentric world where, as in many of the  most satisfying children's books, adults are benevolent but flawed--and  kids are in delicious control of them. Fans of Daniel Pinkwater's novels  will feel right at home with this clever and suspenseful  underdog-turns-champion story with a dribble of magic.

                    <span>I liked Leon and the Spitting Image a-lot. Whoever that other reviewer is, who says that this book is boring and that the author is a Rowling Wannabe, clearly needs their head examined. This book has nothing in common with Harry Potter and the story easily stands on its own. The story is funny and exciting and kept me laughing out loud - and I read a-lot of books. I am getting this book for my cousin Leon for his birthday. I think that this story would make a good movie. I recommend that you read this story, I think you will like it. - Jack</span>

                    <span>It is one of the best book I ever read. The book started in a hotel where Leon's mom works. Leon collects taxi drivers homelands. He meets a taxi driver named Napoleon and they become friends. He always picks Leon up from school and drops him off. His teacher is very weird all they do practically is sew. There is a locked cabinet in the back of the class and Leon takes a peak. They make critters called animles because the teacher does not want them to call them animals because they will get attached to them. This book is very good and I suggest you read it.</span>

                    <span>This is a must read children's book. <P>Very smart. Witty. On target. Yes, it is mixed w/fantasy but if I told you what made it fantasy it would ruin the book. Dodge ball is the game played in gym class. There is the ultimate bully. Issues w/the 4th grade teacher. The ice machine. Hotel. Cabbies and so much more. Plus the added perk of three friends sticking together trying to over come ...<P>I will be buying this for my nieces and nephews this year. Great, cannot put down read.</span>

                    <span>Needing a book to read at the end of the year to my kids, I e-mailed a trustworthy librarian friend of mine, and this book was on the top of her list. That afternoon, the book was in my hand, and the next day, it was finished. Leon and the Spitting Image was an imaginative, drop-dead funny book that I can't wait to read to my class.<P>Written by Allen Kurzweil, who's better known for writing adult fiction like the wonderful "A Grand Complication", this book is all about Leon, a rather inept, un-dexterous lad who gets the misforunate of being assigned to Mrs. Hagmeyer's class. The Hag, as she is affectionately known, loves sewing above all else, much to the chagrin of Leon. As if in a labor camp, her students are forced to sew "animiles", little animals stuffed with her old panty hose. Leon's cohorts, P.W. and Lily-Matisse, engage in the mystery throughout the book, who is this horrible teacher Hagmeyer, and what can she possibly be doing with the creations?<P>The book is funny on two levels: children will love it for it's low-base humor (although I must admit to chuckling from time to time as well!), and smarter kids and adult will love it for it's sly, occasional puns, and situational humor (like a group of mimes, staying at the hotel that's Leon's home, complaining that their microphone isn't working). Writing a children's book is challenging because you must cover both arenas for a truly entertaining book, but Kurzweil holds up well. It is hardly reminiscent of Harry Potter, but much more in the vein of Roald Dahl.<P>By the end of the story, you don't necessarily want it to be over. Hopefully Kurzweil has in himself a few more books, so we can spend more time with Leon, his pals, a maid, an ice machine, and Napoleon!</span>
