                <span id="Label1"><I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> begins and ends in a pine-scented  forest, somewhere in Spain. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert attached to the International Brigades, lies "flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees." The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him,  Jordan has his doubts: "I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out." For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. <blockquote> "I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted. If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us. If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go. I am tired of all this. You hear?" He turned to Robert Jordan. "What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?" </blockquote> In one short chapter Hemingway lays out the blueprint for what is to come: Jordan's sense of duty versus Pablo's dangerous self-interest and weariness with the war. Complicating matters even more are two members of the guerrilla leader's small band: his "woman" Pilar, and Maria, a young woman whom Pablo rescued from a Republican prison train. Unlike her man, Pilar is still fiercely devoted to the cause and as Pablo's loyalty wanes, she becomes the moral center of the group. Soon Jordan finds himself caught between the two, even as his own resolve is tested by his growing feelings for Maria.  <p> <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> combines two of the author's recurring obsessions: war and personal honor. The pivotal battle scene involving El Sordo's last stand is a showcase for Hemingway's narrative powers, but the quieter, ongoing conflict within Robert Jordan as he struggles to fulfill his mission perhaps at the cost of his own life is a testament to his creator's psychological acuity.  By turns brutal and compassionate, it is arguably Hemingway's most mature work and one of the best war novels of the 20th century. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>I have to admit that the only reason I read this book was because I had heard good things about Ernest Hemmingway and was looking to discover some of his work.  Much to my chagrin, however, For Whom The Bell Tolls came up somewhat short of a satisfying read.  One of the biggest problems with this novel is that it is a five hundered word novel that could easily be written in a modest one-hundered and fifty: only a couple of days go by throughout the duration of the novel.  Another flaw I found in Hemmingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls is the trivialness behind the main character's job and even personality.  For five hundred pages the reader is forced to read about a simple man who has the simple job of traveling from America to Spain to blow up a specific bridge when given the order.  In the mean time, the main character, Robert Jordan, lollygags around in the woods with a few other Spanish rebels whose sanity/motivation becomes a bit doubtful.  In the end, Robert Jordan ends up dying under a dead horse opposing enemy fire.  Although I was hoping to recognize some of the insight behind this "timeless" classic or its author, I was disappointed as I found For Whom The Bell Tolls to be nothing less than an average novel written in an average style.  I reccomend reading The Sun Also Rises if you're looking for a fulfilling introduction to Hemmingway's work.</span>

                    <span>According to the book's jacket, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is Hemingway's finest novel.  I disagree.  While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time.  So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action.  This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band.  Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.
<br />
<br />The plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland.  He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge.  Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members.  In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria.
<br />
<br />Utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character.  Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert.  Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader.  Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo.  Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan.  Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter.  And so it goes with many of the other book's characters.
<br />
<br />The book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste.  This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel.  In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book.</span>

                    <span>I had put off reading this book because I felt it would be "boring." I was so very, very wrong! Granted, I have not read everything Hemingway has written, but I find it difficult to believe he could have written anything to surpass this novel. I am thankful that I read "A Farewell To Arms" and "The Sun Also Rises" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high.
<br />
<br />In the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing "The Sun Also Rises" Hemingway breaks through with "For Whom The Bell Tolls!" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story. 
<br />
<br />The ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled.
<br />
<br />This book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best. This is not just a "guy's book" - not at all! This is a story for both genders. Treat yourself to a literary masterpiece! You will not be disappointed!</span>

                    <span>For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway, tells the story of Robert Jordan's mission to blow up a bridge during the Spanish Civil War and takes places over the four days prior to the blowing of the bridge.  This fictional war novel which takes place in the pine covered hills of Spain, discusses the themes of the futility and barbarity of war, death, and friendship.
<br />	Robert Jordan is an American fighting in the International Brigades against the fascists in Spain. The orders he is given are brief: "To blow the bridge at a stated hour based on the time set for the attack"(13) "so that no reinforcements will come up over the road"(14).  With these orders, he slips across the battle lines and meets up with a band of gorilla fighters led by Pablo, an experienced gorilla warrior.  This small band of fighters is to assist him in taking control of the bridge so he can blow it up as ordered.  Over the next three days he lives with Pablo's band and learns about true friendship.  He also learns about true love when he falls in love with a girl named Maria.  Robert Jordan reflects "I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time."(402).  Jordan, feeling that his time is limited, lives life to its fullest in the four days and firmly believes that he has been lucky.  "And you had a lot of luck, he told himself, to have had such a good life.  You've had as good a life as any one because of these last days."(491).  Ultimately, the end of the novel leaves an optimistic and pessimistic feeling with the reader; Hemingway leaves it to the reader to decide how they feel at the novel's conclusion.
<br /> 	Hemingway brings forth several themes in this novel.  The foremost is the futility and barbarity of war.  Nowhere in the novel is this stressed so well as Pilar's account of Pablo killing the fascists in the town of Avila.  Pilar says of it: "all of it [is] ugly.  Even that which is glorious...it is brutal"(112).  The fascists who were in the town were "beaten to death with flails and thrown from the top of the cliff into the river"(116).  This story is the most brutal example of war in the book and successfully shows that "war is a bitchery"(489).  Another important theme is death.  Death is discussed before El Sordo, the leader of another band, dies in a standoff with the fascist calvary.  "One's death is difficult to accept.  Sordo had accepted it but there was no sweetness in its acceptance even at fifty-two, with three wounds and him surrounded on a hill."  He goes on to think, "Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it nor fear of it in his mind.  But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill"(330).  The novel reinforces the fact that death must occur, but shows that life is far more pleasing.  Lastly, the novel discusses friendship.  Jordan finds true friendship among those he has known for four days, but must fight alongside.  Jordan notes, "Anselmo is my oldest friend.  Agustin, with his vile mouth, is my brother, and I never had a brother.  Maria is my true love and my wife."(402).  Ultimately, it is shown that those which life and death occur with, understand each other the best and become the closest together.
<br />	Hemingway constructs an extremely believable story with the novel.  In part he does this with the style he uses.  Hemingway uses a formal diction for the narration and a informal diction for the dialog.  The informal diction fits the characters well since one would expect them to speak in that manner.  Hemingway also uses Spanish words intermingled with English to remind the reader that they are in Spain.  This technique is done effectively, although one must guess at some meanings if one does not know Spanish.  Hemingway also effectively paces the book.  Robert Jordan spends only four days with Pablo's band, however, the pacing is slow enough to include a lot of imagery of the setting and enough detail about the characters and the war to develop the themes. Hemingway is able to stretch the time out, especially before the battles, just as a person living through them would experience it.  As a result, the reader gets a slight indication of what life in war is like.  With this in mind, if Hemingway's goal was to write a beautifully narrated, well paced and believable war novel which causes a reader to think about the themes it brings up, then I believe he achieved his goal.
<br />	Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is not simply about blowing up a bridge during a war.  It is about who we are as people and what it means to live and to die.  I believe Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an enjoyable story and an education, just as Robert Jordan received when he lived his life in four days.  The title comes of the book is an allusion to "Meditation XVII."  "Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."  Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an appreciation for mankind.  For when one dies, everyone dies; and when pain and suffering is brought on one it is brought on all.  Without a doubt Hemingway effectively and pleasurably presents these ideas while narrating a tragic but wonderful story.  I would highly recommend this book, as it is a true classic.</span>

                    <span>Rarely do I come across a book that affects me in a way that stays with me for months.  FOR WHOM was just one such book, as was the stellar collection of short stories by McCrae titled THE CHILDREN'S CORNER. FOR WHOM starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a "code hero," a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine. <p>At the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now "gone bad." He cares primarily for his horses. His "woman" Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the "love interest."<p>I love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is explosed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.</span>
