                    <span>Monkeewrench is an excellent read and you surely will enjoy the wonderful plot line and characters. I was, at first, put off by the inclusion of this book in a local book club. I normally hate books that have been selected by this club and was pleasantly surprised by depth of the storyline and plot. I read the entire book in the span of one day, I read it late into the night, I did not want to put it down. I do wish that the book was a bit longer because I had become so attached to the characters I did not want to end the story. An excellent aspect of the P.J. Tracy books is that it is a continuing story line, the next books have the same wonderful characters and follow a similar plot line! You will fall in love with the cast and will be left wanting more and more! </span>

                    <span>I can only agree with all those who've praised this wonderful debut mystery.  With an engrossing, although not perfect, plot, interesting characters, and excellent dialogue, this is an excellent 1st book and authors who've been added to my "must buy" list. </span>

                    <span>but cliched. It was fun to read, but more than anything it was a "fluff" book - one that I read when I just want something light. Pretty much forgetable.</span>

                    <span>This terrific first novel is set in Minneapolis and rural Wisconsin, where the police are grappling with a series of murders.  In Minneapolis, the two lead detectives on the case, Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth, are working round the clock to find a serial murderer before he strikes again.  Very early on, they find that the murders are based on a computer game being developed by a local software company called Monkeewrench.  The murderer is playing out a series of twenty murders, exactly as they are depicted in the computer clue-finding game.  The five team members of the Monkeewrench gang quickly find themselves as the prime suspects in the murder.  The Wisconsin murder of an elderly couple in the local Catholic church at first is baffling, until the sheriff finds a clue that possibly relates this murder to the ones in Minneapolis.
<br />
<br />This book was tightly plotted, and the story was extremely suspenseful.  It's the kind of book that you just can't put down.  The ending was amazing, and I certainly guessed wrong about the identity of the murderer.  I can't wait to read "Live Bait", the second thriller from this mother-daughter writing team.</span>
