                    <span>If you're accustomed to Lippman's previous works, this book will fall hopelessly short of expectation. I found this book to be lacking not just in content, but in direction. The "practical approach" employed by Lippman I found to be less-than-practical. The text feels hurried, does not flow well, and the sample code is replete with errors and inconsistencies. There is also alot of useless prose geared towards warming the junior programmer to object-oriented theory. This is not a good book for someone coming from a C++ or Java background hoping to come up to speed on C#. If, on the other hand, you enjoy long-winded hyperbole on "What is a constructor," with ailing code samples to match, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>Lippman's C# Primer assumes that the reader knows C++ or Java. It does not cover basic language constructs so it is not a good choice as a first C# book for people that have not programmed before. The first four chapters include many good insights into the C# language from a professional programmer's point of view. These are hard to find in other texts and make this book worthwhile. A future edition should concentrate on including more language insights and less on WinForms or ASP.NET specifics that are covered better on other texts. Probably some basics should be included to expand its appeal to new programmers.<P>...</span>

                    <span>The first 4 chapters (~200 pages) is where it's at. I read his books on C++ and those and this one are right on the mark. Chapter 5-8 are about the .Net Framework (a bit cursory) and dated (pre-release beta) and much has changed. The first 4 chapters are a gem. But where is Stan ? His firm objectwrite.com is nowhere to be seen on the web. Therefore, sample code is not available.</span>

                    <span>Overall this book is decent, if you have programming experience.<BR>I wish it would contrast C# to other languages; no reason to have to read thru a whole explanation, if he would just say, "this feature works just like Java...".<P>The biggest flaw is that for some of the stranger concepts, he doesn't really build up a sufficient explanation. I am a very experienced OO Architect and Java coder, yet I found his explanations of such subjects as "a Polymorphic Query Language" incomplete.<P>With few exceptions however the book is well written, had minimal typos, and was acceptable</span>

                    <span>It is a perfectly adequate introduction to the langauge and nothing else. The discussion of delegates is confusing -- the online docs were better. <P>The book answers how-to use language features, but not why to use them. It does nothing to discuss any of the pitfalls of the constructs in the langauge, like the dangers surrounding implict conversions and operator overloading. Finally he doesn't discuss the Debug, Trace and Attribute classes in any useful detail.</span>
