                    <span>Dr Norman Vincent Peale's gifts continue working, long after he has gone to receive his reward. My life is enriched every time I am privileged to pick up one of his books. This well-edited volume will give you a "vitamin" dose of positive thinking for every day of the year. If you're like me, you'll just go ahead and read through the entire thing at once. In a world where the negative occurs by default, programming one's mind with a positive antidote is necessary on a regular basis. Books such as this will help you obtain that needed mental nourishment.<p>Consider his powerful conclusion to this book, the December 31st reading and as you think about this message, remember he is, in a way, speaking from the "other side," as he is (present tense)a follower of Jesus Christ:<p>"Know that there is no death; that all life is indivisible, that the here and hereafter are one, that time and eternity are inseparable, that this is one unobstructed universe. We are citizens of eternity."</span>

                    <span>I look at this GREAT little book every single day. Why? Each page has date. And below each date there is a short, highly meaningful quotation from Norman Vincent Peale that helps me keep my perspective. When things are going well, I look at this quote and think about it. And when things are looking bleak (which they do at times) I look at the quote and think about it, and even go back and review the previous day's quote. These short but potent quotes are like a shot of psychological and spiritual Vitamin C. Do you like to simply take mental stock? The quotes are for you.  Or are you into prayer? Then these quotes are for you. Or are you into meditation? Then these quotes are for you. And if you're into all three of these things (to each his/her/it own) they're also for you. The great thing about this book is that you can keep it by your bedside and take it along with you when you travel. Just a minute or two a day, reading and (if you can make the time) pondering the quote can do wonders.</span>

                    <span>that keeps you charged about life one day at a time.  I particularly liked the layout and though some of the passages are not very long in length, they are quite large in their meaning.  Quite simply this little book can change your life no matter who you are or what you have gone through.  This little book can keep you focused and directed when you need it the most.<p>Also reccomended:  "The Power of Positive Thinking" and "The Amazing Results of Positive Thinking".</span>

                    <span>I have kept this book by my bedside for several years.  I may or may not read it every single day, but I do consider it to a 'working' bible for which each day has a message that brings hope, facilitates clarity, and  reminds one of what is truly important.  I have also bought it as a gift  for others.</span>
