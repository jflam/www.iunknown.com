                <span id="Label1">Parents were here first!  How did the kids suddenly take control?  Sure the world has changed from the days when children were supposed to be seen and not heard -- but things have gotten a little out of hand. What about some quality time for the grownups? Author Christie Mellor's hilarious, personal, refreshing, and actually quite useful advice delightfully rights the balance between parent and child. In dozens of short, wickedly funny chapters, she skewers today's parental absurdities and reminds us how to make child-rearing a kick. With recipes, helpful hints, and illustrations, this high-spirited book is the only book parents will really need -- and enjoy.</span>

                    <span>This book is right on! It's a humerous look at child-rearing. I am eight months pregnant and I work in education. I am constantly exposed to spoiled kids, over-the-top parents, and many of the stereotypes Mellor writes about in the book. I already know what kind of parent I DON'T want to be, and Mellor's book just confirms it. It's a great laugh!</span>

                    <span>Christie Mellor provides a wonderfully funny view of life with children then and now. Seeing the reality of the now makes you yearn for the good old days of our youth. She also provides the delightful illustrations on the cover and throughout the book.<BR>She's right on when it comes to the parents of today and hilarious in her reminicences of the child rearing of the past. A great read. Highly recommended to anyone with kids AND a sense of humor.</span>

                    <span>I love this book!!! As a first time parent of a now seven month old baby girl, many people are surprised at my laid back yet firm approach to parenting. This book captures my feel for the way I want to raise my child with so much wit and humor, I find myself laughing out loud while reading it!!! I have reccomended this book to every parent and parent-to-be that I know. Any "uptight" mom and dad should read this!! We were here first!! We get so overwhelmed as parents trying to raise smart, healthy, and safe children we forget to take time for ourselves and RELAX and enjoy our children. We also forget that WE are the PARENTS and WE run the show. Even if you don't have kids this book should be read.</span>

                    <span>When I saw the title of this book I was hooked and the contents have not let me down. I have been in so many situations that Mellor writes about (turns out the east coast of Florida is an exact replica of LA). <P>When I bought this book I was just looking to be entertained but I find myself actually being encouraged to make sensible decisions for my children. The only downside is that my family is sick of me reading excerpts aloud to them.</span>

                    <span>Reading Christie Mellor's take on being a mom made me want to run out and have some kids of my own. She manages to be both hilarious and wise, and I now wish I drank so I could have a martini and be like her.</span>
