                    <span>I'm an architect working in telecom.  I work for a large telecom provider (SBC) in St. Louis and I really enjoyed P. J. Louis's book on Telecom Management. It provided many aspects regarding management I had not yet considered. The only element I say is  missing may be the political aspects which all of us encounter within a large telco enterprise.  For example, my background is in Unix scripting so I personally do not have much experience in telecommunications, architecture, or have much familiarity with managerial principles.  But one thing I've become good at over the years in telecom is the knowledge of how to seek out and find people that do know such things, promote their ideas as my own, take credit for their accomplishments, and then sell them down the river to eliminate any possible kickback. Though these types of practices may seem cold and unethical from a business perspective. These things occur in the real world everyday and have personally helped me (and I'm sure many others) to succeed.  This is just a part of management which I think many books have not fully covered. In this book the perspective of telecom managerial politics is not fully covered in this publication. It has become mainstream in the area of management and I think could be covered in more detail in this book. I would recommend people pick up and read a copy of this book to review the other aspects of traditional telecom management!</span>

                    <span>This book did a good job in expressing what is needed for a manager to be effective. However,  I would also recommend reviewing the book Telecommunications Management by Nolan Vincent Jones for even more information regarding effective strategies to beat the competition.</span>

                    <span>This is a cycle but the <br>telecom market is still getting worse.  It is still a matter of overextension.  Too<br>many companies that have borrowed from banks that expected to be huge<br>players with large market share in too short of time.  This was the book that set the ground work for how recovery can start taking place as the economy goes through this bullish period.</span>

                    <span>I have come to rely on P.J. Louis for insightful, articulate, and comprehensive analysis of telecom issues. His latest book on telecom management is important reading for all those who work at the decision-making level in telecoms - and also for anyone who works with them. This book is highly recommended.</span>
