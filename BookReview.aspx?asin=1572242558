                <span id="Label1">Many yearn to right the imbalance in their lives but hesitate to make what they think are radical changes often associated with true simplicity. However, as this book shows, the kind of simplicity that brings real happiness is not about complex principles but about evaluating one's thoughts and feelings and rebuilding one's life around personal truths. Using practical techniques that lead to real change, the authors help readers examine their values and prioritize their goals. Through a series of exercises ranging from simple tasks to soul-searching, the authors guide readers in finding a true center of focus between work and home, discipline and pleasure, relationship and solitude.</span>

                    <span>What a gem of a little book. Packed with usable and sensible information and suggestions and not just pie in the sky ideas. The authors start out with Find your Balance which wise and something that so many (we own dozens) of simple living books never mention. And as they note "Simplicity is not a state of rest. It's a dynamic, ever changing balancing act that occurs on several continuums: financial, business, relationships, kids, spirituality, you name it".<P> One element I liked seeing written about and something I have come to appreciate and do, is Hire Out. Which means I no longer feel that to be authentically simple living, I must do everything myself. And I have also come to appreciate the fact that in paying someone to do a job that I cannot do, is to hard for me to do, I am in fact providing a self employed person with income that will be used wisely, and I am not the stressed out person I once was.<P>And for me the section on Give Perfection the Boot was a godsend since I tend to be a perfectionist and one who would fret if I didn't sort all the paper from the plastic, or didn't get all the laundry put away or the floors mopped by 7 PM. <P>I did like the 23: Keep A Spending Diary since this has been a godsend as well because it allows me the chance to see where I may be spending on things I really do not need. Like buying a bottle of water rather than simply planning better and keeping six refills in the refrigerator and grabbing one as I leave. Which leads in to 24: Take a Spending Break. Which is something most people could benefit by. Sorta like taking a week long back packing trip and not spending any money, etc. It gives you a whole new outlook on how easily it is to just buy things without much thought. <P>32: Survey Your Tribe reminds me of my friend Nancy;s wise suggestion that I find my own herd. Which has to do with evaluating ones friendships and having friendships that are not draining or shallow, but are life enhancing and empowering. This section (32) is worth the price of the book alone. As is the section 43 which is Let Go of the Past and probably has more life value that one realizes. I wont share much of it here since I want you to read it yourself. Same with the section 36: Think for Yourself. This is a must read section !!!!<P>43: Exercise Your Breath, Heart, and Mind is excellent and actually has more value when it comes to a healthy happy lifestyle than anything in the book, since this section explains how being physically, and mentally active creates positive change in your life. Something the American populace who tends to turn to food, alcohol, pills, and other quick fixes for happiness should be required to read.<P>The book is simply a well written, useful gem which I recommend.</span>

                    <span>I did not get much of value from this book. It never really pushed home its concepts. There were certain important points, but there was not enough development or examples of the points to help much. Yet it was also not the type of book which is full of clever tips for "advanced simplifiers" (to coin a phrase), as the title might seem to imply. At best its a gentle introduction to the subject, to be followed up by a more substantial book or books later.</span>

                    <span>This book is inspiring in a really down-to-earth way. I read it several months ago but its overall message and specific suggestions have really stayed with me. The writing style is accessible, to-the-point, and entertaining. Brief and often funny anecdotes illustrate how to put these ideas into practice in your daily life. <BR>I especially appreciated the point that some forms of "simplicity" are harder work and more complex than the conveniences and short-cuts that modern life offers. For example, reading aloud to your child takes more time and effort than turning on the TV. As the authors write, "Do the 'simple' things because they are more satisfying and enriching, and don't expect them to be really simple." This book helps with knowing yourself and making conscious choices instead of succumbing to busy-ness, exhaustion, and chaos. Whether you pick one "way" a day or read the whole book in a sitting, it's a quick read that will lighten your load!</span>

                    <span>With all the humdrum of fast-paced living, it is no wonder so many individuals suffer from stress and cannot find the number of hours in a day to complete all that is on their plate. Priorities eventually become misplaced among the ringing of cell phones, a career, tending to a home, unexpected guests (who just happen to drop by,) shuffling the children to a variety of school and recreational activities, tending to aging parents and finding time for our partners.<P>Many people today are getting out of the rat-race and realizing there are more important things to life than money, power and material possessions. In other words, they are discovering there is such a thing as a simple life, although it will not come without often difficult changes to one's lifestyle, goals and objectives. We each have 1,440 minutes in a day to do with as we please with the exception of the day we are born and the day we die, and for some reason, time management never seems to be a priority on either of those days. We have the power to choose what we truly want to do with each of the minutes we have during this lifetime, but most people let those minutes slip by without realizing the value of each one of them.<P>This book serves as a guide on how to find that simple lifestyle and some tips on how to make the transition process a worthwhile and relatively painless one. It certainly puts into perspective what is important in the overall balance of life and what is truly insignificant. Our life is all about choices, and this book does present some options that will lessen the load and help the reader find balance and harmony in their life.</span>
