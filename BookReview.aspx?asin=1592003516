                    <span>The book does provide a basis for understanding a 3d game engine but it leaves out pieces in its tutorials, which would fine execpt that the book is written in "step-by-step tutorial" style. If you actually follow the book as a tutorial and code along, nothing will compile. If you use your head a little, though, you can figure out the missing features on your own, either by reviewing the material on the cd or by googleing. All in all, I found the book to be OK but i am still looking for someting better.</span>

                    <span>Stefan Zerbst's 3D Game Engine Programming is a 850-paged guide to constructing a modular, functional video game engine.  This reference was one of the biggest reasons I became confident that I could complete a project of my own and has helped me tremendously in the design and building of an engine based upon the fundamentals of the ZFX Engine.  
<br />
<br />Even though the book does not go into detail and provide the code to all the bells and whistles of a commerical engine, it certainly outlines the basics and even provides code for testing.  (I personally liked not having everything provided so that I could add my own features with a more personalized touch).  Have no fear: all the basics are there to build off of!
<br />
<br />In particular, the text guides the reader through the concepts and code needed to construct an engine that has the ability to support both DirectX and OpenGL (though DirectX is the main focus in the text), Vertex and Pixel Shaders (which is a big plus in upcoming game graphics!), and networkable players.  In addition, the book brought extra possibilities such as Non-Player Characters, AI, and other various effects to the table for the reader to take note of where they could be added on to the engine.  More importantly, he did do an excellent job of keeping these options (and more!) open without forcing his more ambitious readers to reprogram half the engine.
<br />
<br />A very important thing I felt was the key to why I liked it some much was the fact that I understood how the components of the engine worked individually and as a whole to construct a functional game when I had finished the book.  So many times have I read a programming book cover to cover and then still be lost on how everything fits together outside of the demos provided in the text-- but this book was NOT like that at all.  The concepts were presented clearly as well as explicitly outlined within the code.
<br />
<br />However, I will note: this book is not for the faint of heart or for the inexperienced programmer.  (Hopefully the size scares the aforementioned away in a direction to seek some more practice before coming back to this fantastic reference.)  There is a LOT of code and while the text does take care of the graphics, DLL loading, and algorithmic aspects to a FPS game, the book does treat the reader as a programmer and not a novice.
<br />
<br />One last, important feature is the Level Editor that is developed along side the engine (that's right! you build a level editor too!).  This chapter (14) is certainly one of the most useful parts of the text and is where a lot of key concepts come together.
<br />
<br />So, if you are looking for a book that hits the ground running, providing a complete archive of source code and demos in an effort to construct a comprehensive game engine: this book is for you!</span>

                    <span>Yes, the book's CD had some issues.  Yes, the code on the CD and the code on the book are sometimes different.  That being said, show me a programming book that
<br />
<br />1) Publishes every line of code
<br />2) Every published line matches that on the CD
<br />3) The code on the CD contains no errors
<br />
<br />and I will show you a GREAT book.  (BTW, this book does not exist.)
<br />
<br />Criticizing the author for not publishing all source code is ludicrous as half the book would have had to be cut to make room, and then everyone would be complaining about not having enough content.  All source code is provided and this book is NOT for beginners, so having to look at source code that was not published is not a problem.
<br />
<br />Stefan does an excellent job of presenting a workable engine that could be used to create a modern game that could fit about any genre.  He also presents methods to allow for upgrading the engine without requiring all games that use it to be recompiled.  He covers many issues in the space he has and provides a workable game in the final chapter.  He also shows how to implement an editor for the game (albeit a simple one), which is something I had not seen in other books.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a book that shows how to step into game engine programming and ALREADY know about game programming itself, then this is a good book.
<br />
<br />If you are new to programming this book is not for (and is not intended for) you, so please do not read it and then complain when you do not understand.</span>

                    <span>He does have some problems explaining some of the concepts, and does sometimes go off into his own world and show you code that you sometimes write down, when in fact it was just to show you what a function WOULD look like... though you might never use it.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, it's PERFECT. Buy the book, but don't complain like others about the CD. Go to the updates page, and get those patches and fixes. If you want, to remain unconfused, what you will need is Visual C++ 6.0 and get all the files from the CD. Read through those files and understand it that way. It's somewhat easier that way if you're not a C++ guru.</span>

                    <span>The CD mistakes are unforgiveable.  I would say until they release a completed downloadable examples of entirely workable examples DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
<br />
<br />I did visit the errata site and followed a few of their examples on how to build things.  Got a couple of things to build, but when exploring the world in the example of chapter 15, there are bugs and holes in the display or render errors or something.  Or maybe this is the way that it was engineered.
<br />
<br />I think when they provide proper support for this book I will probably give this book 4 stars, because I think it is well written and goes over the topic of Game Engine programming very well.  Too bad they did such a poor job of quality control.
