                <span id="Label1">HBO's wry, enlightening account of 80-plus years of the Boston Red Sox's travails is a fusion of wit and history. "Everything's going fine," says one of this documentary's talking heads, speaking of the Red Sox's legacy of 11th-hour screw-ups. "Then: boom. It's like watching <I>The Wizard of Oz</I> and Dorothy is ripped apart at the end by flying monkeys." Comic Steven Wright compares the team's history to a Dickens novel, and Denis Leary says love of the Red Sox is "sado-masochism." The problem is that Boston's doomstruck organization, fans say, has been in karmic payback since 1920 for then-owner Harry Frazee's sale of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. Historians dismiss claims that Frazee used the money to finance Broadway's <I>No, No, Nanette</I>, and there's evidence the self-destructive Ruth had actually become a liability for the team. In any case, the symbiotic fortunes of the Yankees and Red Sox is entertainingly summarized here. <I>--Tom Keogh</I></span>

                    <span>I don't know about you, but I laughed so hard watching this documentary it hurt. The play by play of 1986 by all of the Bosux fans was classic. Sorry Dennis Leary but 1986 and Billy Buckner was the feel good moment of the year, even if it did occur against the Mets.<P>My only complaint is that there was no real coverage of the 1999 ALCS and no Aaron Boone!!! A must have for any Yankee Fan. The Curse is REAL. Yankees baseball!!!</span>

                    <span>I'm sick of DS making a ton of money off making us Sox fans look like miserable morons. This movie is way to over the top, and focus' on all things negative. C'mon, we're better than that. The sox have alway been competitive, and us sox fans have had many great players to watch & many exciting playoffs to watch. Our time is soon.</span>

                    <span>"Curse of the Bambino" is one of the most provocative yet disturbing movies I've seen (though I was expecting more of a baseball plot). I watched this movie multiple times, and I'm still amazed by Roy's skill in weaving a shocking tale of incest and sexual harassment against the backdrop of Red Sox baseball. Even after seeing it multiple times, I'm still taken aback by the scene in which CH Boyf (the seemingly racist sportswriter/protagonist) visciously belittles the Bambino's mentally retarded nephew, Jeff Stone, in a sick attempt to get the young boy to go to bed with him. I'm still confused, though, about the Bambino's reaction to the abuse of his nephew. Instead getting revenge on CH Boyf, he lashes out at all of Boston -- putting a curse on the city that results in CH Boyf's hateful, illogical columns becoming a mainstay in the city's leading newspaper. That is some curse.</span>

                    <span>For over 80 years the Boston Red Sox have failed to win a World Series, and for many diehard fans the title drought lies with the 1920 sale of pitching star/slugger Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. This HBO documentary tracks the team's star-crossed history--from its pre-1920 success to the heartbreaks of 1946, 1967, 1975, 1978, 1986 et al.; talks with such loyal Sox supporters as Michael Chiklis, Denis Leary and others on the reality of the "curse"; and suggests that other reasons, from playing at Fenway Park to the team's refusal to integrate until 1959, may be to blame. <P>I found this documentary to be a must have for any Red Sox fan. From Bill Buckner's mistake to what may have happen if they one, this DVD points out the crucial eliments of the team and ask the all important question, "Does the curse really exist?". "The Curse of the Bambino" is a must have for any Red Sox fan.</span>
