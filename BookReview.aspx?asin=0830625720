For anyone wanting to learn more about tilework, even if your going to hire it done, this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>I am planning a mud-set ceramic tile project and it was suggested that I buy this book. I did and it is a GREAT book; sure wish I had known about it several years ago when I did my first tile project! I recommend it to anyone starting a tile project. It's written in a way that most anyone can understand and the small cost is worth the time and potential mistakes that will be saved.

                    <span>If you are just starting out, or are wanting to learn more about the tiling do's and don'ts, then this book is for you.<p>As a DIY person, I found the book covered all those little details that other books didn't.  And when it comes to tiling, it is all about detail.<p>It is written in a fun informative manner, and is easy to read and follow.  If you buy one book only on tiling, this is the one to get.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book hoping to get valueable information on the understanding of tile work.In addition to aquire ideas that would benefit me in achieving such goals.This book I found to be poorly written, the examples (pictures)provided were outdated and poorly presented to say the least. <br>Save your hard earned money, this to me was Not worth the price !!</span>

                    <span>I can't believe this book! I have learned more about tiling in the 3-4 hours it took me to read the book, than in the previous tile projects I have done. Mr. Bridge covers it all. I found the section on laying out a project worth the entire price of the book. By following his layout method, I have saved considerable time. Mr. Bridge uses humor, simple explanations, and a great knowledge of tiling to make a do-it-yourselfer feel comfortable about taking on a large project.<p>I am a Maintenance Superintendent for the largest publicly owned utility in the Nation. I have read way more manuals than I care to think about. Very seldom do I actually learn anything. This book covers not only the very basics, but also some of the more complex projects of tiling. It not only tells you what to do; it also explains why you want to do it. An excellent book I highly recommend to anyone. Just don't ask to borrow my book, BUY your own!</span>
