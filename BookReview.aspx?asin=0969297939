                    <span>37 pages of curriculum instruction, 3 pages of history/meanings, 11 pages to teach you how to draw two ovoids one within the other...<P>Nice instructors manual and handout source for a kids workshop, but the lack of _meaning_ and information density is very low.<P>I felt like more than half of the book is missing, perhaps volume 2 has more meaningful discusion.<P>All in all, not a bad book, but not what I was hoping for, if you want an intense course on the mechanics of drawing NWNA, then this is it. If you are teaching children, this is a good resource too.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent opening into NW Coastal art. It does not address the meanings or legends but mainly how designs are created and build up of elements. Lots of illustrations. Its an excellent reference for the carver or artist wanting to work with the designs (note: no carving techniques etc are discussed; just design but that is enough)</span>

                    <span>I bought this book during an Alaskan cruise. By the time we reached our 3rd stop, Ketchikan, we were comfortably literate in North Coast Indian art. (Not experts!) I impressed a carver by being able to identify the animals in the totem pole he was carving. Being able to identify the animals gave our trip a richness we would not have had.<BR>But even better, this wonderful volume, full of instructions, gave me the courage to try to draw something and I am NOT an artist. However, we now have a family totem: a North Coast Indian art version of our Norwich terrier. This book was worth every penny. I can't wait until the volume 2 comes out.</span>

                    <span>I've purchased EVERY book I can find on the topic of Pacific Northwest Coast Native Indian artwork (currently I have over 40), and this is one of the best, especially if you want to try your hand at this type of artwork. <P>This book contains tons of examples, explanations, and a nice amount of info about the tribes and styles. This is the only book I've found with a section that actually takes you step-by-step through the process of creating some Northwest Coast art! (Note that the recently-published volume 2 also does.)<P>If you want to try your hand at drawing this kind of art, I recommend that you buy "Looking at Indian Art of the Northwest Coast" by Hilary Stewart as an excellent book for giving you an overview and feel for the art form, buy this book and volume 2 by the same authors for the extensive examples and how-to information, and I also recommend "An Analysis of Form" by Bill Holm, which is the single most in-depth study of the elements that are used in PNWC artwork.</span>

                    <span>Talented teacher/author Karin Clark and gifted multi-faceted artist Jim Gilbert have produced a truly remarkable new gem of a book about Pacific Northwest Native Indian art. Called Learning by Designing, this comphrehensive ,innovative and lavishly illustrated book offers not only an interesting and thorough history of the various native art forms indigenous to the Pacific Northwest but includes easy to understand step-by-step instructions suitable for both novice and experienced artists. As a neophyte student of this art form , I was surprised at the quality of my own work. In addition, I found the process to be pleasantly relaxing as well.</span>
