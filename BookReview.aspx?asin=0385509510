                <span id="Label1">In 1984, Ron and Dan Lafferty murdered the wife and infant daughter of their younger brother Allen. The crimes were noteworthy not merely for their brutality but for the brothers' claim that they were acting on direct orders from God. In <I>Under the Banner of Heaven</I>, Jon Krakauer tells the story of the killers and their crime but also explores the shadowy world of Mormon fundamentalism from which the two emerged. The Mormon Church was founded, in part, on the idea that true believers could speak directly with God. But while the mainstream church attempted to be more palatable to the general public by rejecting the controversial tenet of polygamy, fundamentalist splinter groups saw this as apostasy and took to the hills to live what they believed to be a righteous life. When their beliefs are challenged or their patriarchal, cult-like order defied, these still-active groups, according to Krakauer, are capable of fighting back with tremendous violence. While Krakauer's research into the history of the church is admirably extensive, the real power of the book comes from present-day information, notably jailhouse interviews with Dan Lafferty. Far from being the brooding maniac one might expect, Lafferty is chillingly coherent, still insisting that his motive was merely to obey God's command. Krakauer's accounts of the actual murders are graphic and disturbing, but such detail makes the brothers' claim of divine instruction all the more horrifying. In an age where Westerners have trouble comprehending what drives Islamic fundamentalists to kill, Jon Krakauer advises us to look within America's own borders. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>Krakauer uses the 1984 Lafferty Murders in Provo to launch an<BR>exploration into the roots and evolution of the present-day Mormon (LDS)<BR>fundamentalist movement. Krakauer presents what may be the most<BR>comprehensive and current assesment of the polygamous/fundamentalist<BR>movement -- the origins, the key players, the major communes, the legal<BR>battles, and the abuses of women, children and the welfare system.<P>Krakauer devotes appropriate attention to the history of mormonism,<BR>which is refreshingly less glossy (and concerned with PR) then other<BR>mainstream accounts have been. Krakauer, unlike many authors who need<BR>the church's assistance with their research, is not afraid to make<BR>frequent reference to "No Man Knows My History", D. Michael Quinn, and<BR>numerous unflattering historical documents and sources.<P>Joseph Smith is portrayed as the cunning, charismatic, delusional,<BR>egomaniacal charlatan that he was, and his frequent run-ins with the<BR>law, the government, supporters, wives (including women that were married to other men) are laid out in<BR>brilliant detail.<P>The historical background of Joseph Smith and the beginnings of Mormonism is detailed, flows well, and dares to include details that most books by LDS authors omit. The historical review covers Joseph Smith's rise to power, his unquestioned spiritual power, and his plans for glory. The reader will learn how 14 year old girls were forced to marry the prophet (or face "spiritual destruction"), and how roving bands of Mormon "avengers" dispatched those who stood in the way of Joseph's kingdom.<P>The story moves to Brigham Young's reign (after Joseph's assasination and a schism over polygamy), the arrival of the saints in the Salt Lake Valley and the ensuing battle with the US government over polygamy. The Mountain Meadows massacre is explored with a precision not seen since Juanita Brooks landmark work on the subject. The Massacre was the premeditated, rehearsed and sanctioned slaughter of an entire emigrant wagon train from Arkansas that was unfortunate enough to pass through Utah. Visits to the site by Federal Investigators revealed a field "strewn with bodies..." and mangled bones of "men, women, children and infants." The massacre was a sort benchmark for the church in Utah; it established that the practice of slaying those who stood in the way of the kingdom would continue in the new Zion (Utah). As the Lafferty murders clearly illustrate, this practice continues to this day.<P>Krakauer makes the argument that it<BR>was polygamy, and the church's love/hate relationship with the practice,<BR>that gave birth to the fundamentalist movement and continues to fuel it to this day.<P>The history of polygamy is laid out right up until the present day,<BR>where the focus is turned to the backgrounds of the Lafferty brothers,<BR>who brutally murdered a sister-in-law and her infant daughter.<P>Instead of simply retelling the sick and gory story a la "USA Movie of<BR>the Week", Krakauer delves into the twisted psyche of the mormon<BR>fundamentalist, and explores how these men went from upstanding members<BR>of the church to self-proclaimed prophets to cold-blooded killers.<P>This detailed and well-thought examination of the knots, bumps and<BR>bruises in Mormon history and theology is unique to non-academic<BR>writing, and is very engaging. Krakauer effectively draws upon<BR>testimony from the trial (psychologists, witnesses, etc) and his own<BR>interviews with the convicted at The Point Of The Mountain to point the<BR>blame exactly where it falls: upon the mormon church, and it's<BR>founders and leaders.<P>His concluding analysis of the current state of the LDS church and its<BR>many fractured spin-offs is refreshingly up-to-date, and the author's<BR>after word provides valuable insight into his opinions on organized<BR>religion, and specifically the mormon faith.<P>This book is a breath of fresh air into LDS studies, and has the unique<BR>benefit of being written by an immensely well-respected nonbeliever<BR>under a major publisher.<P>This is one of the strongest examinations of mormonism in print,<BR>because it is not an "anti-mormon" work. As indicated by modern church<BR>leadership and public relations, nothing is more "anti-mormon" then the church's own<BR>history, leaders, and fundamentalist members. "Under The Banner of<BR>Heaven" is a factual, analytical treatise of a religion that has an<BR>extremely dark and bloody past, and dares to bring to light the painful<BR>legacy that that Mormonism perpetuates to this day.<P>For anyone who has left the church, is investigating the church, is LDS<BR>or knows someone who is LDS, I strongly recommend this book.<P>Sociology, American History, Current Affairs and Religion bookworms<BR>will also find this to be an especially compelling read...</span>

                    <span>Jon Krakauer has long been a literary hero of mine. As a fellow agnostic, I have found his works to be a fecundity of insight and self-examination that result in an acute, if not critical understanding of the human spirit.<P>This book reads incredibly well and weaves the stupefying history of the latter day saints with the horrifying murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty. Ultimately, Krakauer makes the tacit polemic that the legacy of the LDS church, which is replete with both violence and polygamy, should not be underestimated when trying to understand the motives of the murderers--Ron and Don Lafferty. Although the LDS church is quick to distance itself from fundamentalist Mormon groups, which happily embrace polygamy, the history is undeniable. Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were devout polygamists, and believed polygamy to be the most sacred of God's commandments.<P>Many from the LDS church (and reviewers on this site) decry the book as being one-sided. It most certainly is not. Rather ironically, it seems that the ruling patriarchy of the church is the one in fact that is bent on presenting a dubiously researched and one-sided view of its history. To be sure, Krakauer treats all parties mentioned in the book with respect and dignity, remaining an objective narrator throughout the text. This is definitely a recommended read.</span>

                    <span>Jon Krakauer is a superb writer who has taken a controversial subject and not only explained it objectively, but made it entertaining as well. I have read a great deal about the Mormons, my interest spurred by the fact that two of my grandmother's first cousins were wives of John Doyle Lee, and it is incomprehensible to me that any modern woman would tolerate for one moment the abuse and subjection that the church imposes in the name of religion. In the old days, most women were at the mercy of their husbands, but the brainwashing of today is criminal. This is a powerful plea for universal public education, as well as an alert Department of Human Services.</span>

                    <span>This was a fascinating book, but when I finished the last page I felt like I had read a 365-page story from the National Enquirer. The book oozes with juicy descriptions of fundamentalist Mormons, murderers who kill in the name of God, and the checkered history of the Mormon Church.<P>If you're expecting a clinical dissection of a murder, skip this book. It claims to focus on two brothers (Ron and Dan Lafferty) who murdered a woman and her baby two decades ago, but only one-third of the book really talks about the murder. Another third covers the history of the Mormon church, and the final third is a startling (and equally gossipy) survey of polygamist communities from Utah to Canada to Mexico.<P>As a story, the book hits a home run. Krakauer is a great writer, and his eye for detail is devastating. You read descriptions of the polygamist communities and you feel like laughing at the crackpots and crying for the victims at the same time.<P>Unfortunately--and this is why I give the book only three stars--Krakauer can't merely document the history and describe the events. His book quietly advocates two stealth theses. They don't belong in a book like this, at least not secretly, and I think the second thesis is wrong anyway.<P>His theses, which are never spelled out completely but nevertheless lurk below the surface in every chapter, are that (a) religion is a waste, and (b) the mainstream Mormon church has infused its followers with such a spirit of violence that it must share in the blame when its fanatic followers go berserk. These are perfectly valid topics to contemplate, but if you put them forth you should come clean and say so out loud, and then give data to prove them. Krakauer's book tries to prove these theses with anecdotes, extremely narrow vignettes of deranged persons, and sensationalized histories of century-old events. For example, we never hear what the "mainstream" polygamists think of the Laffertys' crime. I think they would probably denounce it, but Krakauer isn't going to give them voice in his book because it would weaken his second thesis. Instead (surprise, surprise) the last chapter revolves around an ex-fundamentalist who found his salvation in atheism. What's his connection to the Lafferty crime? None. <P>Krakauer is extrapolating a line from a single point. Can you really draw general conclusions about a worldwide church from the actions of two fundamentalist kooks? Krakauer thinks you can. Worse, he conflates three very different things (the mainstream Mormon church, the fundamentalist polygamists, and the Lafferty brothers) to the point where naive readers will start thinking they're all the same thing.<P>The author has right to ask hard questions about religion and the Mormon church, but I think it's wrong to write contentious things by making unilateral interpretations without giving all sides of the story. <P>The Appendix to my edition of the book (Anchor) contained a negative review of "Under the Banner of Heaven" by a Mormon official. Krakauer engages him and debates fair and square for a few pages. What the shame the rest of the book wasn't like that.</span>
