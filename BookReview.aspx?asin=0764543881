                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>   <p>   Visual C++ 6.0 was released in 1998 as a component of Visual Studio 6.0. For three years, until the launch of Visual Studio .NET to support the .NET Framework, it was Microsoft's premier development product. Now five service packs old, version 6.0 remains the environment of choice for many developers who haven't yet made the move to .NET. If your aim is to learn how to program in C++ on the Windows platform, with all the help offered by the Visual Studio interface, Visual C++ 6.0 remains a sound choice.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>   <p>   <i>Beginning Visual C++ 6</i> can be broken down into four sections. The first is a fast-paced but thorough tutorial to the C++ language, punctuated with interesting and worthwhile example programs. After that, you'll learn about object orientation with C++, and how this relates to Windows programming - the section ends with the design and implementation of a sizable class-based C++ application.   <p>   The third part of the book walks the reader through creating Windows applications using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). This includes the following:    <ul>    <li>Outputting to the screen and printer    <li>Creating menus, toolbars, and dialogs    <li>Debugging your program    <li>Responding to a user's actions    </ul>   <p>   To illustrate the theory, this section also includes the complete implementation of a simple but fully-featured drawing application. The final section comprises a grounding in programmatic database access, an introduction to Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM), and examples of how to create ActiveX controls using both MFC and the Active Template Library (ATL).   <p>   This book was voted Amazon.com's C++ Book of the Year in 1998. It contains countless examples for you to follow and experiment with, and there are challenging exercises and model solutions in every chapter.   <p>   <b>Who is this book for?</b><br>   This book is for anyone who wants to learn C++ and Windows programming with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. Although progress will be easier if you have some experience of a programming discipline, an adept newcomer will also succeed in taming object-oriented programming and writing real Windows applications.    </span>

                    <span>This book is basically two books in one. The first half of the book is a primer on "plain" C++, and the second half covers Windows programming using the MFC and ATL C++ libraries. Both halves are excellent.<P>The C++ primer half covers the creation of "console" applications - meaning applications that are text-only and do not make use of any Windows functionality. I found this primer to be absolutely perfect for a person like myself: someone who completed several C++ courses in college many years ago, but has not really used the language much since then and had basically forgotten about 50% of the material. I was able to move through the chapters at a good pace, re-learning the stuff I had forgotten and skimming over the stuff I remembered. The writing style is clean, and Mr. Horton does a good job of teaching the important stuff you need to know to get the job done without drowning you in details. Be warned however, if you have zero prior programming experience then this book will probably leave you feeling a little lost since the lack of details and quick pace that were good for someone like me might leave a novice in the dust.<P>The 2nd half takes you into the world of Windows programming. Again, excellent writing style that is both no-nonsense and enlightening without intimidation. After reaching the end of this book, you will have a firm grasp of *basic* Windows programming, and should have no problem working through a more advanced book such as David Kruglinski's "Programming Visual C++".</span>

                    <span>As a Windows Programming MCT, I constantly read "Beginner" books to recommend to my students to supplement or provide backgrounders to the Microsoft Official Curriculum.<P>The book does a pretty good job until you get to Windows programming. Actually I think it's one of the better books to learn the fundamentals of C++ programming.<P>However, the treatment of structures leaves a little to be desired, with common structures that appear throughout the entire Windows API being glossed over in Chapter 7.<P>Contrary to several other reviews, the intro to MFC is not that bad, and provides a good background to move on to other texts more devoted to the subject.<P>ATL should be removed from the text completely. This subject requires a more detailed explanation of COM which is simply not appropriate for a beginers text. My recomendation would be to expand the section on structures in a Windows context.<P>Also, version 6 of Visual Studio introduced OLE-DB as a solution for Universal Data Access, yet there is no mention of it here. Instead the author has applied a cut and paste from the version 5 of the book to give us ODBC. It would've been more appropriate to mention something about OLE-DB templates, and focus on ADO.<P>Overall however, this is a book I would recommend for beginners, to continue with Programming Windows with MFC, 2nd Ed by Jeff Proise.</span>

                    <span>Ivor Horton has an exceptional talent for organizing and presenting C++ that makes it easy to learn. This is a very difficult lanuage, but if you persist, you will learn with his book. It is the best C++ learner book I have found. He leads you through each chapter expanding on the previous. It is slow going at first because you need to know so many things to begin programming. It becomes easy after you get half way through the book and all the pieces of the puzzle start coming together.</span>

                    <span>If you want to have a strong foundation in C++ read this book. All major C++ concepts are explained in detail. This book will reduce the number of situations where you feel, "AHH!!! Why wont this code work, my syntax and logic is perfect", because it is crammed full of even the most minor (yet very important in some cases) information.<BR>If you are serious about C++ programming and want to start windows programming and/or game programming or any API/SDK programming this book is for you. However if you are not serious about programming with C++ find another book, because the author does go into detail on every topic. If you don't like C++ you may become bored.<P>P.S.<BR>I must warn you sometimes the authors coding style may be difficult for true beginners to understand. Don't let this sway you, just keep at it and reread the code and explanations several times.</span>
