                    <span>Over the last couple of years, I have become interested in adapting techniques from improv theatre to organizational training settings. Koppett's book helped me solidly solidify my thinking on the matter. She divides her book into two sections, Principles and Activities. The Principles section is broken into seven chapters that address trust, listening and awareness, non-verbal communications...all the kinds of things for which organizations seek training. The Activities sections has instructions for 50 activities, including an overview, the relevant principles, instructions and variations, and even questions that facilitate discussions after the activity is complete. For added value, the appendices break each activity down into improv principles (trust, spontaneity, etc.) or training application (team-building, creativity, problem-solving, etc.) I've used this resource dozens of times already. In fact, I've had trouble getting it back from several colleagues, and don't lend it out anymore!</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book for two main reasons.  First, it offers an engaging treatment of improvisation techniques that's certain to inform (and inspire) even those without background in the area.  Second, it's an excellent compendium of training activities written in detailed prose perfect for people like me who do a lot of training, but who don't have the formal schooling in training methodology and techniques.  In short, this is a worthwhile read and an excellent addition to one's library of training resources.</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book for people interested in incorporating improv in their training, whatever the topic. The book is clear, to the point, very creative and also very practical. Ms Koppett has collected some tried-and-true improv exercises that are easy to use and really work. Even if you have never done any theatre or improv, you can use this book. Just imagine, a training session in which your participants are inspired, creative, collaborative, funny, cohesive.....</span>

                    <span>The subtitle tells the story:  Practical Improvisational theatre Techniques to Enhance Creativity, Teamwork, Leadership and Learning.  Well it almost tells it all.  This book teaches you in a very readable way about the concepts of improv, which is very interesting and a great read.  THEN it provides you with 50 exercises that you can use immediately or tailor for your needs in training on almost any possible training topic.  The best training book of the year.</span>

                    <span>I have been in the training business for 30 years.  Much of what our trainers do involves designing and delivering games and simulations to improve creativity, communication, team collaboration, problem-solving.  Ms. Koppett's book, Training to Imagine contains the best collection of learning "jolts" I have ever read.  They are fun.  They create "ahas."  They are easy to run.  Her clear explanation of the principles and applications of improv techniques to training is well supported by research and practical experience.  Well done, Ms. Koppett.  I am looking forward to the next one.  Maybe "Training 2: Imagine!"</span>
