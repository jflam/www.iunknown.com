                <span id="Label1"><I>Professional XML</I> is aimed toward seasoned Web or general application developers as a guide for developing sophisticated, real-world XML solutions. It successfully meets the most pressing need for programmers new to XML by putting all of the various component technologies into clear context.<p>  The near boundless potential of XML also means there is much ground to cover, and this book cuts no corners in taking the reader through the network of technologies, exploring both the presentation and data exchange applications of XML. This second edition represents the current state of the ever-evolving set of XML standards, particularly the momentum toward XML Schemas. <p>  The first couple of chapters compose an excellent XML introduction and the basic language syntax. Then the various authors delve into the individual components of XML such as document type definitions (DTD), XML Schemas, XPath, and XSLT. Most of the chapters include some concrete examples of how to implement the techniques in question. Late in the book, a full-fledged case study serves as an excellent compilation of several aspects of XML.<p>  The book goes beyond the basics of XML to give the reader a glimpse of the still unknown potential of the technology. A fascinating chapter on Schema Based Programming (SBP)--an experimental coding technique--adds a degree of excitement to the learning process and is sure to spark innovation in any creative programmer. <p>  <I>Professional XML</I> is another seminal work from Wrox. It should be required reading for anyone looking to become an XML guru. <I>--Stephen W.

                    <span>I have bought several xml books and this one has educated me, taught me and interested me the most. There's no doubt the Wrox technical books are a match to the Oreilley in terms of readability and thoroughness. This book is a little peculiar in that it is written by several people, each contributing a separate chapter. As an introduction, it probably wouldn't be too helpful (although that wouldn't be a problem for someone with a programming background). The strengths of the book (at least what I've read so far) is the discussion of sax v. dom, the section on business applications on edi (really interesting for me), and the great reference source in the back. Can you believe I have xeroxed the css list of command options in the back--amazingly useful? The variety of writers give a fresh perspective, which can be bad and good. With the exception of the first few chapters, which give a good overview, the rest of the chapters are a grabbag of subjects, including 4 case studies. These were very useful in learning xml. It also discussed WAP, which may or may not be useful, depending on how much enthusiasm there is for that standard. For variety's sake, I also bought, XML Unleashed, a bulky book with not as much organization, but just a lot of code (unlike the professional xml book, which really explained almost everything well). XML unleashed is helpful, because its topics really don't overlap with professional xml. It discusses SMIL, parsing xml with java xml tools on the market, using asp with xml and different subsets of xml (vml, and a variety of other specialized languages specific to one discipline. Unleashed is good because it contains discussions (albeit rather brief) of several different languages. Professional XML sticks to explanations and analysis, a lot of microsoft stuff (but not asp, and not too much stuff that linux lovers would want to reject the book. Finally I want to mention another book which I used as a first tutorial, Just XML by John Simpson. It's the best written of the three, although a little bizzare humor sometimes. It was written in late 1998 so some things may not be up-to-date (however simpson does a good job of emphasizing the things that weren't likely to change). This would be a good book for people starting, or if the book were available used. It would also be good when simpson publishes the second edition (later this year).</span>

                    <span>The book covers too many topics and just few are developed in deep while others are superficially introduced because not yet standardized at the time of print. The book claims it covers the following topics: XML, XSLT, DOM, DTD, SOAP, XLink, XPointer, XPath, WAP, WML...and more; but just XML, Schemas, DTDs and SOAP could almost fit the book's size.<P>Chapters don't follow a very logic thread and it doesn't deal enough with very relevant subjects. Wrox probably planned to make this book the XML bible but I think they are far from the target.</span>

                    <span>This book is awful. I can't believe my college used it as a text. this book stuffers the same problems as every other Wrox Press book. It sucks. It's over written because obviously a book with more pages is informative, it's rushed to press, as you can tell by having to have 13 or so authors pound it out practically over night. The book doesn't cover anything well it's written poorly, so poorly eventually I just started skipping around and defacing the book in class. It's amazing I've only owned 2 or 3 other books this bad and honestly their all Wrox Press that Red Cover is a big stop sign. AVOID THEM ALL THEIR ALL CRAP</span>
