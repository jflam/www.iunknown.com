                    <span>This book contained a great deal of information. It was extremely thorough in covering the many topics.  I had used 2 books to study for the Java certification exam and if I could only get one of them this would be it.  Overall it was an excellent book even though a few of questions and exercises were somewhat ambiguous and poorly worded; however, this turned out to be a minor annoyance. I think without this book I would not have passed the exam.  Also I even found it useful in every day programming practice because some of the information is conveniently organized in a way that made things easy to look up.</span>

                    <span>I was hoping for something that'd give me information about what I needed to know to pass the exam, this book does that, but also goes into the how's and whys. I would have been more useful for me to have that information separated, allowing me to look that up when needed and not get bogged down with prose. Still a good book, but heavy to get through if you're already familiar with most of the concepts.</span>

                    <span>If you are aiming at Java Programmer certification (and only in this case) do buy this book. It is an excellent resource to test and amplify your skills. It offers clarity, depth , good code examples and more than enough material to challenge your current understanding and knowledge of Java. Don't expect it to be an easy or pleasant read however. It is a lean and mean certification guide, just the meat, no bells and whistles. It does give new meaning to the word "arid" but in doing so it offers very effective help to get your beloved certificate. The review questions and mock test are also excellent. As a side note, I don't think people should need to be "certified", cheese does.</span>

                    <span>If you are studying to become a Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform 1.4 this book will help you to receive not just a passing grade but an excellent understanding of the intricacies of the Java programming language.  Mughal and Rasmussen aren't satisfied with simply giving you a minimal understanding of Java so that you can pass a test.  They are interested in helping you to understand the language at a deeper level.  After all, it is much easier to pass the certification exam when you actually understand the material rather than when you have simply memorized a lot of details.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you an example of the level of detail that the book covers.  Section 5.2 of the book covers Selection statements.  The section starts with a description of the if statement followed by an activity diagram which explains the flow of the statement.  The authors then show a simple example followed by a clear explanation of the if statement.  Then they do the same with if-else, this time using several examples.  The same level of detail follows for the switch statement, again providing clear text, with a simple activity diagram, followed by several well explained examples.  Finally, the section ends with several review questions.  What this means is that this book can serve you well even after you have passed the certification exam.  You will be hard pressed to find a better written reference.
<br />
<br />The book covers all the information you need to pass the certification exam and covers the material needed to connect all the pieces together.  The included CD has several mock exams with questions that will help you understand the type of questions that you will face on the actual exam.  If you do well on the mock exams you will do well on the real thing.  Overall, this is an excellent book for studying for the Java certification.  But it is such a good reference that you will want to keep it nearby even after you have passed the certification.

                    <span>Excruciatingly detailed explanations of all important Java language concepts and constructs. Intriguing examples in code of key Java programming principles and rules. Thorough coverage of every objective and sub-objective of the certification exam. And the best sample mock exam, in my opinion, of any of the certification texts (although I guess Whizlabs, not the authors, should get the credit for that). In short, an enormously helpful book for anyone doing serious study for Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform. I took a course in Java, then read this book through all the way, and then re-read select portions after doing practice exams (I used some mock exams from the web to supplement the one in the book), and then re-read some more. The result was the score I have reported above: I'm Sun Certified!</span>
