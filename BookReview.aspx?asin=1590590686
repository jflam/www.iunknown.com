                    <span>Very detailed and well explained topics. Tom Barnaby shows MS distributed programing in a deeply manner.<br>I think that an architecture chapter or advices about MS distributed architecture would be useful. Anyway, an excellent book.</span>

                    <span>When I first started reading this book, I thought "Oh no - 3 chapters of intro and a large appendix".  I naturally skipped over the intro and started reading what I thought was the first Real chapter. I kept finding interesting references back to an intro chapter "Introduction to .Net Remoting". I finally read this chapter and was pleasantly surprised to find a clear and comprehensive explanation of channels and contexts. The "This is .Net" intro chapter had a great explanation of versioning in .Net. So I'd recommend reading this book from the beginning - or at least start with chapter 2.<p>The rest of the book allowed me to complete a moderately size distributed project in a lot less time that I thought it would. There is also a great chapter on using transactions under Component Services. I was also able the complete my last MCAD certification test (VB XML) based mainly on what I got out of this book.<p>This book has no fluff and is packed with a lot of key concepts and practical code samples. The only downside was the brief coverage and dismissal of Web Services. The Appendix turned out to be coverage of ADO.Net written by Andrew Troelsen. I didn't read this chapter because I was already up to speed on ADO.Net. But having read a couple of Troelsen's other books, my guess is that it's pretty good.</span>

                    <span>I have been working with .Net Remoting for a couple months and this book has more detailed information in it, than I could find anywhere.  Not only did it help reinforce the fundamentals of remoting, it explores many advanced topics and gives easy to follow examples.  The approach is practical and direct even with difficult topics.  This book saved me hours of time by explaining in depth delegates and remote callbacks.  I highly suggest this book for anyone working with remoting, web services or other distributed programming topics.<p>Also, the code used in the examples can be downloaded from the book's website in C# or VB.NET.</span>
