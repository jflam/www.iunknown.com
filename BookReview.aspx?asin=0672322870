                <span id="Label1"><P><I>Sams Teach Yourself C# in 24 Hours</I> provides readers with 24 structured lessons that provide a light, but thorough introduction to C#. James Foxall moves beyond the pure syntax covered in existing books, to guide readers step-by-step through a cohesive presentation of the basics of C#. Once the basics are understood, Foxall shows the reader how to apply this knowledge to real-world Windows programming tasks using C#.  Each chapter contains exercises that reinforce the lessons learned in each chapter.  Tips, Notes, and Cautions provide additional advice from the authors on how to get up to speed and programming quickly with C#. Sidebars provide the more experienced reader with tips that will ease their migration from Visual Basic 6 and Visual C++ to C#.</P></span>

                    <span>This is a very good book if you have no previous C# experience. I decided to read this book after reading Sams Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days and I found that all the programming concepts were review. I did like this book's focus on the Visual Studio .NET IDE and Windows forms, though. It shows you some basics on using list views, tree views, etc. which Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days completely skips. If you're looking for some simple Windows form concepts or if you're looking to learn C# with no programming experience, this is a good book, but people with C# experience and some Windows forms experience can definitely skip it.</span>

                    <span>I came to C# in 24 hours with a background in programming and management of the software development process. The book is easy to read, is well organized with helpful exercises for each hour (chapter). It contains essential information about the language that is missing from the core reference works. I will keep it on my bookshelf for ready reference.<P>I asked James Foxall a few questions via email and he answered them promptly and with excellent care.</span>

                    <span>The book is excellent for beginners who have never seen an IDE before. The author uses the term C# where he should use the term "Visual Studio .NET" instead. C# is a programming language. For instance, the second chapter is titled "Navigating C#" but he really talks about navigating the IDE. I suspect a search-replace of C# to VB.NET you could convert it into a VB.NET book.<BR>(of course with a bit more than that).<P>I was looking for a book to quickly learn the LANGUAGE C#, not a study of Visual Studio .NET, which takes all of about 1 hour or less for an experienced software developer to learn. If the title were changed to "Teach Yourself Visual Studio.NET in 24 hours", I'd give it 5 stars.<P>Bottom line, if you are a C++ or Java software engineer who wants to come up to speed on C#, this is not the book for you.</span>

It was easy to understand unlike other books on programming I have read and had examples and projects that were doable by me not just those who wrote it. It did take me longer than 24 hours to finish but was worth it.</span>
