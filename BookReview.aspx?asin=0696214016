<br />..and I'm already loving it!! I've only looked through the pictures, havent' read the text yet but it is sooo inspirational that lots of great ideas popping all over in my head! This book soo worth the price. The photos are all up-dated (I own a few Better Homes and Gardens dec. book) but I haven't met any of these photos before so these are new (I bought the 8th edition)!
<br /> 
<br />I agree with one of the reviewer that these pictures mostly country/cottage and traditional designs but the style is very today, up-to-date. However there are a few modern/contemporary styles in it too (not much though)!
<br />
<br />I'm gonna start reading this book soon so we'll see about the info it contains so I'll update this review but I feel that the photos already, alone worth that $17 I paid!

                    <span>I really recommend this book, because it's easy to find your own decorating style in it. The book includes a very helpfull test in which you can discover the best decoration style for you , based on your personality (formal, sleek, etc).
<br />The photographs are very good and it contains information about colour, fabrics, ilumination and other very important issues to consider when you want to decorate a room.
<br />It has modern decorating ideas combined with good taste and common sense. Very good!</span>

                    <span>This is my decorating "bible." It obviously features the work of top designers around the country, but then it tells you what they know about how to put a room together. By explaining those decorating principles and ideas, this book has empowered me to transform first my living room and currently our bedroom. My friends keep asking me what designer I hired. My "designer" is this book, which  cost me under $25. This is a real bargain  and filled with classic yet updated style. Like the book, the rooms it  will help you create will last for years.</span>

                    <span>Some of the only decorating books worth keeping are published by Better Homes & Gardens. This one, as well as the new edition which is not being shown on Amazon.com, are excellent. These are books you should OWN, have on your shelf, and refer to. Whether you're looking for colour ideas, window treatments, where to place lamps, how hight to hang a picture, etc. these books offer what you need to understand balance, scale, and how to make a room look perfect. I would also consider giving these books away as gifts - they are very useful and the pictures are BIG which is everything. Short on text, long on visuals, is what makes a decorating book worth buying.</span>
