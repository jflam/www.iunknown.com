                <span id="Label1">The team behind <I>Professional Active Server Pages 2.0</I> has written a definitive guide for the latest version of ASP included with Windows 2000. This lengthy text offers a comprehensive look at the technology and is geared toward seasoned professionals looking to truly master this important development platform. The team of authors touch on almost every topic a working ASP coder might be interested in, including what to do when "it all goes wrong." <p> This title is divided into six sections that focus on key aspects of ASP: the basics, ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), building components for ASP, integration with BackOffice, security/performance/scalability, and reference material. This organization makes the book useful for both lengthy reads and quick daily reference. The index and set of appendices are also quite comprehensive.<p> Code snippets of judicious size and summary boxes with key information such as errors and function calls make the reading productive without being distracting. Most of the material is presented in a structured topical tutorial; however, an excellent XML newspaper case study provides a real-world perspective on XML and ASP.<p> While a number of working programmers authored this guide, the group's expertise has been well-integrated to read consistently. The team provides some error-preventing programming procedures such as formatting and indenting code, being "Explicit" about declarations, converting variables to the appropriate data types, using good variable naming conventions, encapsulating script, and more. Whether you're looking for information on utilizing components, implementing certificates, or working with Active Directory, you'll find answers in this fine work. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: ASP basics and versions, Active Server Components, ADO, XML data, components, COM/COM+, ASP Script Components, C++ component issues, ADSI and Active Directory, Message Queue Server, Collaboration Data Objects, Exchange Server integration, certificates, performance optimization, site load balancing, and ASP Object Model.</span>

                    <span>It is a very comphensive book that covers the basic of ASP 3.0 and other web technologies like XML, COM+, and ADSI, etc. I did hestitate before buying this book from the web since I was only playing with the beta version of Win2000 server. However I need to work with ASP and IIS, therefore I bought this book.<P>This book does cover lots of new things compared to Professional ASP 2.0 The new features of ASP 3.0 are briefly introduced in the chapter 1. There is a good coverage of ADO 2.5 in chpater 8. If you are familar with ASP 2.0, you can finish the first 10 chapters and can grasp the differences quickly. XML, IIS 5, active server components, COM/COM+, ASP Script Components, C++ component issues, ADSI and Active Directory, Message Queue Server, Collaboration Data Objects, Exchange Server integration, certificates, site load balancing, and ASP Object Model are introduced from chapter 11 to 27. These are heavy readings with minor typos. However these chapters worth the money. <P>I have the Beginning and Professional ASP 2.0 Wrox books and the OReilly ASP book. I like Wrox better since they use lots of examples and their teaching style is very practical. This is a must have ASP book for many web developers.</span>

                    <span>I'll agree with the many other reviews that rate this book as an extremely knowledgeable reference on ASP, perhaps the definitive reference.<P>However, there are several points that make this book somewhat unappealing from a practical perspective. <P>First, note that it was written by 15 different authors. This incorporates many different writing styles, making it unwieldy. The previous edition was written by 8 people. Do not attempt to use either book as a cover-to-cover tutorial. <P>Second, the code examples are written almost exclusively in VBScript, although the book acknowledges that Javascript (also known as JScript) would work just as effectively. From a real-world perspective, I have found that many ASP programmers prefer to use Javascript for both server-side and client-side development. <P>The use of 2 scripting languages in one application is simply impractical. VBScript persists mainly because it is a Microsoft invention, as is ASP itself. However, Javascript (or ECMA Script) has become the industry-standard scripting language for web-based applications.<P>Another issue with the code examples is that they are not line-numbered. For short examples, this is not an issue. But for larger code modules (as one would encounter in the real world), line-numbering is considered part of best practices in explaining and debugging code before it is deployed.<P>For readers with any ASP background, this book would be a useful desktop reference. Carrying it around in your briefcase may cause lower back strain.</span>

                    <span>This book covers most of topic you may need. So, you can use it as a reference on ASP3. But it is not for beginner or for studying from a ground. It is quite hard-to-read, not explained in-depth, and it made me quite ???.</span>

                    <span>Obsolete??? Hardly. As I write this review, new Web page technologies are being matured: jsp, php, chm (yech). New models are being matured: Servlets, STRUTS, .NET. Classical ASP 3.0 is still quick, fast and necessary for small to medium businesses, even enterprise-level webpages. There's no better book to learn all the standards, applications, basics, and advanced capabilities of ASP than THIS book.<P>I love Wrox. I started with their Beginning ASP 2.0 book (how I learned). This book, a bit more advanced but in the beginning level, is still all you need to get things going from single tiered applications to multi-tiered, database driven apps. It goes into COM objects and other MS Services like Index. Really a one-stop book.<P>With this book and Google you have all the reference you need.<P>Note: ASP 3.0 is in no way, shape, or form similar to ASP.net.<P>A small, tiny complaint about this book is that it can be a bit wordy...just a tad. And the index in the back could use a bit more improvement. The info's still in there.</span>
