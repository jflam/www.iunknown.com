                    <span>I am normally too lazy to write reviews of books that I have read. But this one is different. I truly wants to give credit to the author in whatever way I can. And then I realized I should go to amazon.com and write a review about it if possible. So here I am. If you read same stuff elsewhere (e.g internet articles, other popular books even Stevens ! etc) my experience is they tend to make things a little more complex then they are. Douglas, tells you things that you want to know directly and in simple easy terms. <p>And he continue to answer all relevent questions that comes to your mind while reading. This way you feel comfortable that yes you have grabbed the crux of the knowledge and feel confident about it.</span>

                    <span>This new edition expands and updates the previous one (a true classic). Several parts were rewritten to improve understanding (e.g. RIP solutions) and a lot of modern technologies are now discussed, including Mobile IP, IPsec, VPNs, IP Multicasting, Voice and Video over IP, and IP Telephony. <br>It is worth every dollar of its price.</span>

                    <span>I have been doing Internet protocol engineering for 12 years and I can say that people in the industry consider Comer Vol 1 to be the bible for Internetworking reference. The fourth edition is nearly three times as thick as my copy of the first edition. Douglas Comer keeps this book up to date and useful for modern Internet developers. If you're a student, read this book. I've gone through a lot of books that claim to be the same thing as Comer Vol 1 and have found none that really compare.</span>

                    <span>I am a senior computer science student.  My networking prof had us read this book from cover to cover.  Now I understand why.  This book delves into every aspect of networking.  And that's despite the fact that this is "just" volume one.<p>The author writes that the book is intended for upper level and masters level computer science students.  I would agree.  This reads like a book written by a technical person for technical people.  It assumes a certain level of experience with software design and computer hardware.<p>Each chapter builds on information from previous chapters.  However, you can skip around without missing too much information.  I found all the chapters got a little too detailed than what I wanted, but that's a good thing.  Better to get too much info than too little.<p>This is a good book for it's technical merit.  The only thing I can count it off on is it's readibility.  This book is better than Nytol to help you get your Zzz's.  I prefer an author who at least attempts to keep the reader interested.  But, that complaint's petty in comparison with the useful information it contains.</span>

                    <span>I recently applied for a Network Engineering position at a large International company. My technical interviewer was looking for specific fundamental knowledge of IP, TCP, Switching Protocols, IP Routing, and Network Design. <p>The interviewer, a twenty year veteran in the industry, was geniunely impressed with the almost verbatim answers I gave him. This book has enough depth to give you an edge in attaining a contemporary Networking Design or Support position (in addition to having some hands-on experience, of course). <p>To this day, the principles for my design and support problem solving skills still revolve around this reference. It is a must have for any Networking Professional (novice and advanced alike), especially when you need the irrefutable OSI Layer 2-4 knowledge to "get into" or "out of" most Networking Situations.</span>
