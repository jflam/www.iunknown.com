                <span id="Label1"><P>If you're a true Flash master--and we're betting you are--you know that the real power behind the throne in Macromedia's wildly popular Web animation software is its programming language: ActionScript 2.0. Offering a more robust programming model and better object-oriented programming support than ever before, ActionScript 2.0 allows you to take your Flash MX 2004 designs to new levels--if, that is, you know how to make full use of it. This volume, from the folks behind the software, makes sure that you do! In this highly cross-referenced dictionary, you'll find detailed descriptions of every ActionScript operator, keyword, statement, action, property, function, object, component, and method. What's more, an invaluable chart will help you locate definitions for symbolic operators or methods even when you don't know the object or component class. To top it all off, Macromedia has rounded up a posse of Flash and ActionScripting luminaries to contribute articles on a range of topics--from converting ActionScript 1.0 to ActionScript 2.0 to using design patterns in Flash.</P></span>

                    <span>First of all, I am not that much of a review writer, but feel I have to add to the reviews above. I bought this book before the reviews above were written. If only I had waited. Anyway: why is this a ripp off?<BR>1. it should have come with the software in the first place as the new help function within flash is totally unusable, and the documentation was far from complete.<BR>2. it is full of mistakes, and the only erratum is the updated helpfunction with the software.<BR>3. it was published at the time that even Macromedia knew that the documentation with their software was far from complete AND full of errors. Never could understand why they would repeat that unforgivable error in a book and dare ask money for it.<P>As a sidenote: the docs with the software are updated in the meantime, so you might as well put your printer to work if you need a printed copy. Don't waste your money on this book.<P>John</span>

                    <span>Finally a really easy to use quick resource for Action Script. O'reilly's was good but, stopped at 1.0.<BR>This is an excellent book for 25 bucks and it's actually easier to use than the Help section of Flash. Buy it before they raise the price!</span>

                    <span>This tome is basically two books mashed together. The first being a set of Flash articles while the second is THE actual Actionscript 2.0 dictionary. While seemingly through, when you actually need to use it the index will fail you and you will need to look either at the dictionary table of contents (starting on page 411) or thumb through the second half of the book. <P>Note: You won't find much information on any of the various components that come with Flash. This is a purely Actionscript 2.0 dictionary. Another area that is missing is any details concerning the professional features of Flash MX 2004 like slides and forms.<P>The two good things about this book are that it is relatively inexpensive and there are numerous examples.</span>

                    <span>While most of this book is the same material that comes with Flash in the help panel, there are also several articles in the beginning of the book. Of these articles, there were a couple that were REALLY good, changing the way I think about programming in Flash. A few of the other articles however seemed to be of less quality and not well thought out. Either way for the things I learned, it was certainly worth the cost.</span>

                    <span>Let me start off by saying that I knew before buying this book that the overwhelming majority of the material was a regurgitation of the online help information within Flash MX 2004 itself. Indeed, my main reason for buying was to have a hard copy of this information that I could plonk on my desk and refer to when necessary.<P>The biggest issue with this book is that the reference section seems not to be indexed at all, and neither do these pages have tabbed edges. In addition, the version of the documentation this is based on is full of errors and has some gaping holes that have since been fixed in the online help documentation. All these combine to make the book completely unusable as a reference.<P>Secondly, the articles are a complete waste fo time if you've done any basic reading up on the subject matter on the internet. You can find more helpful information on Flash MX 2004 and ActionScript 2.0 on the major Flash community sites, written by real community leaders that actually know what they're talking about. Admittedly I didn't buy the book for the articles, but had I done so I would have been severely disappointed.<P>At such a low price, I didn't expect a lot from this book and was prepared to forgive a few minor niggles. What I've now got is a moderately expensive door stop, and I would recommend heartily that anyone thinking about buying this book think again. If I could have given this book zero stars, I would have done, so I'm now waiting for the Moock/O'Reilly book on ActionScript 2.0 and OOP, which is what I should have done in the first place.</span>
