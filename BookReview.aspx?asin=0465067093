                <span id="Label1">With the many recent advances in technology, it seems, there has followed a diminution of quality. Electronic books have several advantages over their print counterparts, for instance. But for the time being, they're hard to use and unattractive to boot. Computers, which are supposed to make our lives easier, are commonly sources of frustration and wasted time. Movies are wondrously chock-a-block with special effects--but someone forgot the story. And so on.<p> Donald Norman, a retired professor of cognitive science, is bothered to no end by the fact that grappling with unfriendly objects now takes up so many of our hours. Over the course of several books, of which <I>The Psychology of Everyday Things</I> was the first, he has railed against bad design. He scrutinizes a range of artifacts that are supposed to make our daily living a little easier, and he finds most of them wanting. Why, he asks, does a door need instructions that say "push" or "pull"? A well-designed object, he argues, is self-explanatory. But well-designed objects are increasingly rare, for the present culture places a higher value on aesthetics than utility, even with such items as cordless screwdrivers, dresser drawers, and kitchen cabinets. In their concern for creating "art," many designers don't seem to consider what people actually <i>do</i> with things. Such disregard, Norman suggests, leads to few objects being standardized: think of all the different kinds of unsynchronized clocks that lurk in microwave ovens, VCRs, coffee makers, and the like--and of all the different kinds of batteries needed to drive them. Why, he wonders, must we reset all those clocks whenever the power goes off? Some designer somewhere, he ventures, ought to develop a master clock that communicates with all other electric clocks in a home--one that, when reset, synchronizes its slave units.<p> You don't need to be especially interested in technological matters to enjoy Norman's arguments. The book's underlying question is aimed at a global audience: will the design of everyday things improve? If this entertaining and, yes, well-designed book changes even a few minds, perhaps it will. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>This book should be a pre-requisite for all entering students in industrial design or at least a textbook for a class in human factors/ergonomics. That it is so enjoyable to read for non-designers is a plus.</span>

                    <span>In a way, this is a self-help book. But to call it that is to damn it, so instead we must term it something else. The appellation, however distasteful, fits for POET (as Norman abbreviates it, later retitled The Design of Everyday Things) goes a long way in explaining just exactly why and how we make everyday mistakes, and how we can help ourselves and others escape these problems. I believe it was Pat Cadigan who I first heard sum up this book in the memorable phrase, "I didn't fail the technology; the technology failed me." Every time I find myself pushing on the hinge side of a door to open it, or push the door when I should have pulled, I quote that phrase. It wasn't me who failed to understand how the door work--the door failed to provide me with the necessary clues to work it. User error, as Norman notes in POET, is a misnomer; many, many times it is a design error.<P>This book should be read by everyone, I think, for it deals with everybody. I know of no one who has not cursed at a computer program, or some door, or similar. But only by demanding "user centered design" can we escape the tyranny of form over function. To illustrate, take the example of file names in DOS. Yes, we have achieved the standardization of 8 character names and 3 character extensions. But this is an outdated and frustration convention. It is a holdover from CP/M days (I believe) when computers lacked the memory and storage capacity of today's computers. But until enough people demand a change, this inefficient and confusing convention will be with us. Macintosh owners, although free of this particular evil, can no doubt recall various designs that they wish to change as well. The difference is in philosophy: the Macintosh was designed first for the user, and it is only the "creeping featurism" of established programs today that threaten its user friendliness.</span>

                    <span>This book, while dated, attracted my attention as a primer for the world of human-machine interactions. It covers well some common mistakes made by designers, and offers different ways of thinking (and procedures) crafted to help those building interfaces (physical or electronic) improve the experience of th end user.<P>I'd love to see this book brought back to life in an updated, modern form; even so, the content within is highly relevant to today's computer-driven world. This, and many like it, should be required reading for anyone designing something that another human will be required to use.</span>

                    <span>This is not a book on Psychology, nor it is written just for designers. Every person who read this book will find interesting information and will recognize some own experiences trying to make some devices work, and I do not mean complex ones, but as simple as a light switch.<P>Actually, as the title reads, the book deals with "everyday things," though there are some parts that use examples like a nuclear plant or a cockpit.<P>Of course, we do not need to read this book to use such things, but you would enjoy reading it.</span>

Even a non-designer would appreciate the way this book can open your eyes to the design of all things around us, and realise the good and the bad, and even the how and why.<P>Too many designers sell out to "being different" without thinking of functionality and usability. This book helped me appreciate the beauty of the marriage of form and function, and it established the foundation of the way I approach my design.</span>
