                    <span>Very elementary, could have been written by anyone; including a priest. No "blow you away" secrets here. All common sense, with a couple of stupid tips to make sure you get arrested, such as approaching police in other countries and bribing them to find cocaine sources. Thought it would be an interesting read of an experienced trafficker, instead it was a short, "thrown together" book of common sense. Almost unreadable, don't buy it. All the 5 star reviews here are most definitely friends, or the author himself.</span>

                    <span>The first thing that struck me was how small the book was. I looked at its lack of size (152 pages) and thought I had wasted my money. How wrong I was. As noted by the other reviewers, this is truly excellent book. No Hollywood stuff here - just the truth with the deceit, need for multiple ID's, and need for thorough, thorough, thorough planning and execution. I'm not familiar with the geography of the Americas but it is not hard to follow the clear and impressive thinking of the author. I agree with one reviewers comment that if enforcement agencies aren't monitoring who is buying the book, then they should be. This is not a book I would want to get caught with because it definately read as a 'how to' manual for those serious about getting involved even if you have no intention of doing so. One benefit of it is how clear the risk of going to jail is - a risk I personally would not be prepared to take. One for the safety deposit box, I would suggest. Definately worth the read.</span>

                    <span>Hawkeye Gross in an outstanding writer who I can't get enough of. This book was a true life account of what he did post vietnam (he throws a lot of that in there too). Very informative book. Just exactly how he smuggled and everything to a T. I just wish his other books were still in print today. Hold on to this one, you never know!</span>

                    <span>Every Man, Woman, and Child should read this book. In a way it will teach you more than you should know, but overall, it teaches you the same outcome(Death, Jail, Snitching). The beginning of the book tell you that even the hardest person will snitch to reduce their sentence. Your friends, people you have know for years will turn against you to help themselves. For anyone thinking about getting into the drug game or any criminal act, this book is a crystal ball to your future. You won't waste your money. Only for mature minds!</span>

                    <span>Gosh--if someone were truly thinking of entering the drug-smuggling profession, they should buy this book, as it gives very sound advice. Personally, I'm thinking of writing a novel, and including some drug-smuggling characters. This book gave me complete information for an excellent character profile. I was shocked at some of the information included, as I feel certain chapters should have been classified information (to protect against terroists). I really liked the style in which the book was written, as well--very direct, and easy to read. A REALLY EXCELLENT book.</span>
