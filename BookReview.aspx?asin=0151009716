                <span id="Label1">At first, readers may find Ursula K. Le Guin's collection <I>Changing Planes</I> rather light, if not slight. However, as the reader continues through its sixteen stories (ten of which are original to this volume), the collection achieves considerable weight and power.<p>  A punny conceit links the stories and provides the title of <I>Changing Planes</I>. Conceived before September 11, 2001, this conceit now, unfairly, looks odd. Trapped too many times in the misery of pre-terrorist airports, Sita Dulip discovered how to change planes: not airplanes, but planes of existence. Now the people of Sita's earth travel between alternate universes.<p>  The stories in <I>Changing Planes</I> are strong expressions of Le Guin's considerable anthropological and psychological insight. However, these tales don't follow traditional plot structures or character-development methods. They read more like travelogues, or socio-anthropological articles on foreign nations or tribes. They explore exotic literary planes lying somewhere between Jorge Luis Borges's <I>ficciones</I> and Horace Miner's anthropological satire <I>Body Ritual Among the Nacirema</I>. However, unlike Miner's parody, Le Guin's wise tales are rarely satirical, though "The Royals of Hegn" sharply skewers the absurdity of royalty-worship, and "Great Joy" rightly attacks the boundless corporate criminality familiar to anyone who's read a newspaper since 2001.<p>  One of America's greatest authors, Ursula K. Le Guin has received the National Book Award, the Newberry Award, the PEN/Malamud Award, five Nebula Awards, and five Hugo Awards. <I>--Cynthia Ward</I></span>

                    <span>This book starts off with a light-hearted introduction, but quickly plunges the reader into a maze of possibilities.  It is a book to be read slowly, thinking about each plane as it is presented.  The best part of the book is it's concluding story, which is something like a metaphor for Le Guin's life to this point, a blur of possibilities, imaginings, and outcomes.  This book is highly recommended for Le Guin fans or as an introduction to her work.</span>

                    <span>Waiting in airports can be interminable tedium, OR, a passage to other planes of existence, fascinating new worlds. In fact there is a whole world of such worlds, linked by a loose-knit Interplanary Agency, with Interplanary Hotels for travelers, and Rornan's Handy Planary Guide for guidance. Such is the premise for this collection of fantastic allegorical stories.<p>Strange stories they are, too, stories of people just a little different from ourselves, people whose foibles and fallacies are just a little different from our own. Stories of people wracked by pointless ethnic conflicts that go on for centuries; people who have ruined their worlds and destroyed their ecologies; worlds in which ancient cultures and traditions are fading away. There is a quality of wistful longing in these stories, longing for a simpler, saner world that has been lost or ruined. LeGuin's beautiful writing is complemented by the inventive, Escher-like drawings of Eric Beddows.<p>Author Ursula K. LeGuin is a master story-teller. These stories are easy to read, compelling, humorous, engaging, and hard to forget. They will get you to thinking and they will haunt you. I recommend this book highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

                    <span>This is a collection of sketches based on the clever conceit that bored airplane travelers can move from tedious airports to parallel worlds (planes).  Each of the stories is a sketch of some key feature of the plane being visited.  Several of the stories have a bit of an allegorical flavor, some are mildly satirical, and others feature interesting psychological issues.  LeGuin is an extremely talented writer and several of these stories are very enjoyable and all are worth reading.  None of these stories, however, comes close to LeGuin's best work.  For readers familiar with LeGuin, this is something of a disappointment.  Readers new to LeGuin who find this book enjoyable should pursue the LeGuin's older collections of stories, particularly those written 20 to 30 years, such as Orsinian Tales or the Compass Rose.</span>

                    <span>Ursula K. Le Guin's Changing Planes was somewhat of a homecoming for me, as I've read little speculative fiction lately. I have always enjoyed her style, and this book was no exception.<p>On the darker side, the introduction bills this as a good airport book (changing planes -- get it?), and its construction as a travelogue, combined with the relatively light-weight stories, bear that out.</span>

                    <span>Ever wonder what it would be like on a world where everything was different?  Ursula LeGuin presents just a few of the possibilities in intimate detail.  These other worlds have dilemmas and ideas which we would never encounter in are own, and the experience of the complete differentness is refreshing.<p>What would it be like to have wings?  Would it be a gift or a burden?  In the world of the Fliers of Gyr, one Flier expresses his joy at flying, but also his regrets.  Once in the freedom of the air, he could not  bear to return to the grounded life, forsaking community and family.<p>What would it be like if we were all mixed together?  After a genetic disaster, people in this world contain genes of animals and plants, which manifest themselves in unexpected ways.  Take the chicken-people, who look normal but spend their time running in hyperactive circles.  It is funny but a little sad.  A conversation with a young waiter who is four percent corn reveals all this and more.<p>My only complaint ais that some of the stories are too documentary-like, though no less interesting.  By all means, read this book, and take a journey out of the ordinary.</span>
