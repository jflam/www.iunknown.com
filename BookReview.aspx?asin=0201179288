The book's experienced author, Koenig, follows up with examples and helpful advice on many of these "pitfalls." Each chapter includes exercises for contemplation with accompanying discussions at the end of the book.</span>

                    <span>This is a very interesting book. It's titled "c traps and pitfalls", yet talks all about the beauty of c. You will need some fundamental knowledge of computer systems and programming; however, you don't need to be a serious programmer to adventure this book, because while you are enjoying reading it, you are becoming one yourself.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must have and you must have read it at least once. Then again, I have read it once and will only use it as a quick reference. For more elaborate information I will look for (my) other books that will tell the same in a more fluent and up to date style (read: Expert C Programming). <br>This book shows all the pitfalls in a convenient compact volume. <br>If you are NOT a sloppy programmer you might dislike many of the more obvious examples . . then again, you might do some maintenance on "someone else's code".</span>

                    <span>If you program in C or C++, you must read this book if you want to consider yourself a superior programmer.  If you are a college student, definitely read this book. Koenig fills in a lot of gaps left by authors of  introductory books on C or C++.  Why do I mention C++?  Because C++ is far  more than just objects and classes.  The lower level implementation of  functions is still basically C programming. He includes chapters on  linkage, the preprocessor, and portability. It is a short book that is  definitely worth reading.</span>

                    <span>Along with Holub's 'The C Companion', this is one of the few programming books that I've read in 13 years of C programming that talks about real programming issues instead of simply rehashing what a for loop is.  A must  read for C programmers.</span>

                    <span>This is among the five "must have" books on the astute C programmer's bookshelf. Actually, it spends little time on the shelf since one refers to it time and time again. This slim volume packs a lot of information about those "gotchas" that still "getcha" (when you least expect it). The Introduction is "Chapter 0", your first hint that Koenig knows and respects the subject. His treatment of unscrambling complex declarations is especially good. 
<p>
Why a 9 instead of a 10? Simple. Andy: please release a new version! The ANSI/ISO standard is almost ten years old. :)</span>
