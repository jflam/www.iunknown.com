                    <span>Ok first off, lets get this out of the way, The photos alone more then make this book worth its price.  But this isn't a picture book, it is quite possibly one the most well written and to the point books on exposure out there.  The author deals with exposure, not your camera, or its features, but on capturing the right amount of light.  Regardless of the equipment your using.  This was of great use to me, as all the digital photography books out there, worry to much about the digital part and not enough about the photography part.  
<br />This book will explain to you the things you need to consider in order to achieve proper exposure and give you some quick tips and finding that all important 18% grey point.
<br />He also weighs in on the concepts of bracketing as well as the exposure rules of thumb.  In a sense slaying those sacred cows and tell you ways to get the exposure right for that particular event instead of taking bracketed shots and hoping to get a good one out of the 3.</span>

                    <span>Good book, easy to read, with a lot of suggestions about where read the exposure. Also if the book is more than 150 pages, there are a lot of big photos, everyone with a comment; instead of this I would have prefereed more photos with comment also if they would have been smaller. So, I read this book in too little time. My rate for this book is 3.5.

                    <span>  All the pictures in this book are stunning, beautiful, and have perfect exposures.  My issue with this book is that the author stresses that, in order to get a perfect exposure, one would need to find either a middle tone with a TTL spot meter, or use an incident meter to get a correct reading of the light source.  Unfortunately, not all scenes have a middle tone, nor do all photographers have or need an incident meter.
<br />  One example in the book, on page 61, is a classic snow scene.  There is no middle tone to be found in the picture, so the author uses an incident meter.  Why can't the author simply aim the built-in TTL meter at the snow, and add 2 1/2 stops to get the snow to be pure white?  In another set of pictures in pages 44 and 45, the author took exposures according to both the incident meter and the TTL meter, becuase the 2 readings did not agree.  Well, can't one just trust one meter and bracket the shots?  
<br />  Quite a few of these so called "exposure" books fall short on being flexible, straightfoward, and comprehensible.  Hence the "secrets" the authors tried to convey still remain secrets to me.
<br />  4 pages (pages 24 to 27) in John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide totally unlock the secrets of exposure.  Mr. Shaw's 5-stop tonality chart, which is somewhat based on the Zone system, allows one to use any tone for a correct exposure with the built-in TTL spot meter.  This practical knowledge, with enough practice, give us photographers confidence in our cameras and our own ability to metering, and frees us from carrying an extra incident meter to a snowy mountain or other no-middle-tone places.
<br />  Again, the pictures are truely awesome and inspiring.  It's just I did not get any feel for the 'secrets' after reading cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>Zuckerman, an educated master photographer, takes an unassuming, non-technical case-study approach to show readers how to achieve the perfect photographic exposure on film in capturing an image. As such, this book is aimed primarily at film-camera audience although the same principle applies equally to digital camera. There is no discussion on the topic of print development exposure and all brilliant and superb colour photographs used as illustrations were captured with his favorite medium-format SLR camera, a Mamiya RZ 67-II (you can check this out at http://www.mamiya.com/assets/zuckerman/RZ67). 
<br />
<br />Having explained how and when a built-in TTL (through-the-Lens) reflected light meter (by definition) in an SLR camera may fail, Zuckerman jumps straight to the important concept of a "middle tone" (mid-tone or medium gray or 18% gray) upon which such TTL light meters, and for that matter, all light meters, is based in obtaining a "normal" exposure, as opposed to a "correct" or what the author terms as "perfect" exposure.(Note: It is not a unique approach of Zuckerman, just common sense exposure based on how the meter works when factory-set once you understand how the 18% gray relates to exposure measurement!) This is followed by a judicious survey of the classic situations in which one finds difficulty in obtaining such as a correct exposure. If at all, there is a single rule-of-thumb, Zuckerman makes it clear that if you choose to meter exposure based on a "mid-tone" of a colour, everything else will fall into place (and that's Zuckerman's secret!). That is the Holy Grail one should seek as far as exposure is concerned! Getting to this even when there is little or no mid-tone is the topic of chapter 3.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, when you get an exposure reading from your camera's built-in light meter, often, depending on the lighting situation, you are only getting a "normal" exposure (based on the idea that the camera is exposing your subject at this middle-gray) instead of getting a correct exposure, which is what you want as a photographer! Hence, when you try to obtain an automatic exposure for tricky situations like black subject on a dark background (examples are a plenty in Zuckerman's book), the built-in exposure meter will fail as it tries to interpret a normal exposure of this by assuming a middle-gray. Consequently, you get an over-exposure in such situation and get a gray instead of black subject. Those situations that present metering problem are covered as individual topics in their respective chapters in this book (high contrast, backlight, indoor architecture, low light of extreme situations when correct exposure is more an art than a science, etc).
<br />
<br />While it is intuitive to illustrate the concept of "middle gray" as being a series of gray ranging from black to white, doing this within the context of colour photography presents even a challenge to the author. The author did, however, make a good attempt by illustrating the location of a "mid-tone colour" in many of his colour illustrations. However, readers (especially novice photographers) will often be left with the question of what exactly constitutes a mid-tone of a series of colours of a photographic subject. It would have been great if only Zuckerman could show his chosen "mid-tone colour" for each and everyone of his colour illustrations in this book.
<br />
<br />As a Pro, the author relies heavily on off-camera light meters (notably the Sekonic L-508) that incorporate both an incident as well as a reflected light meter in capturing almost all of the photos used in the book. Beside stating the importance and the use of incident light meter and a high-end reflected light meter (one-degree spot reading), Zuckerman does provide way in which one can perform the same precision light reading using a standard 35mm SLR on a spot-metering mode. As the spot reading angle is a function of the focal length of the lens being used, Zuckerman shows that with a telephoto lens focused on a chosen mid-tone of a subject, one can achieve the reading that rivals a precision reflected meter! 
<br />
<br />The author does not advocate the practice of bracketing an exposure or over- or under-exposure by a stop or two! Hence, there is no discussion of "zone system" exposure. Interested readers are advised to check out titles on this topic, including Les Meehan's "Creative Exposure Control" (Collin and Brown, 2001) and Bahman Farzad's "The Confused Photographer's Guide to Correct Photographic Exposure and the Simplfied Zone System" (3rd edition, 2001)
<br />
<br />While correct or perfect exposure is important, photographic composition is an equally important skill to acquire on your path to great photography. Readers are advised to check out titles on this topic, one of which, "Photos with IMPACT" (David & Charles, 2003) by Tom Mackie is well worth your effort and money.
<br />
<br />Overall, this book is both informative and accessible to photographers in general and novice in particular. It is filled with pages and pages of the author's enthusiasm for his subject of nature photography. This simple approach of identifying a photo-exposure situation and search for its mid-tone may not be shared by all photography enthusiasts, but the bottom line is: If you can capture great photos with such an approach, why not? You can always learn those technical details later. About the only caveat one has of this book is that this approach may take some degree of creativity out of your photography.</span>

                    <span>I am still finding out some new stuff there when reading it now even I have read it from cover to cover for a couple of times. The chapter about finding a middle tune area and the appendix about sun f/16 rules( well, I bet you know it very well, but the author does have his own words) are very helpful.</span>
