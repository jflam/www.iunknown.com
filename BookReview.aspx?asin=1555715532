                    <span>This book is always at arm's reach in my office. It is written in plain English, so that you don't have to be an advertising executive to put Kathy's methods to work. It takes a lot of the fear and mystery out of advertising and guides you step-by-step. Furthermore, Kathy is obviously well versed in all typres of media (TV, Radio, Outdoor, etc.) which is not always the case. This is helpful for the small business owner as he/she may not be able to afford TV but can afford Direct Mail. If you are unsure about any kind of advertising on the local level, this book is a must. You really will come away feeling confident that you can put together a successful advertising plan. I wish I had this book ten years ago when I was starting out. I would have had a working knowledge of advertising that employed common sense.</span>

                    <span>I recently finished school and was in the process of opening an agency of my own, with only my wife for a part-time evening co-worker. This book helped me side step many costly mistakes that any beginner could easily make. The detail this book provided, exploring every aspect of the advertising process, is worth its weight in gold. Excellent job.</span>

                    <span>EDIT: I'm putting my review below on hold as I've realized I've got an original version of the book- 2 prints out of date! Will read newest version and re-review. So take with a grain of salt. Ross<BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>This book is a nice easy read, and simple to work through. However, but having been in radio (marketing & promotions director, years in sales, my own small agency) since 1992, I thought her knowledge of the radio format was somewhat limited...this made me think that perhaps some of the other areas that I'm not as knowledgeable about (outdoor, direct mail) she might be limited as well. <BR>Kathy states that there are only 2 tried and true ways to buying radio, either tactical or strategic, with schedules of 5x a week or up to 24x a week. Well, these may work, (or have worked in the past), but they are fairly old methods of radio advertising. She mentions TAP and :30 commercials, things you just don't see much of anymore. <BR>She makes no mention of OES (Optimum Effective Schedules) or the importance of frequency or other methods (and better I might add) that have come along in the last few years. It's a changing medium, and methods should change also. So I'd just take the radio part as one general read on how to buy radio, certainly not the only way to buy!</span>
