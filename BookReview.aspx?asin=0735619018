                    <span>The format of the book is great. It introduces business concepts and analysis techniques by real-life example. Many of these examples were directly applicable to my business. Whereas other texts like this teach you the theory, this book gets right down to real-world applications. 
<br />
<br />I hear what the others say about the CD. They do have a point. However, I entered all the data myself. I wanted to learn the material by plugging in my own data to figure out how stuff works. I can see how this book would be frustrating to someone who would rather not have to enter the formulas and dummy data.</span>

                    <span>The idea behind this book is great.
<br />The book introduces and expands on many different 'useful' formulas and tools included within Excel.
<br />The problems at the end of each chapter allows the reader to use what was just learned in developing spreadsheets to solve realistic accounting problems.
<br />Even the 'above average' user of Excel, I believe, will learn from this book.
<br />The CD even has an electronic version of the book, so you don't have to carry the book around everywhere.
<br />The main problem: the CD STINKS !!!! It has MANY, MANY errors.
<br />From forgetting to take into account given growth rates detailed in a problem (therefore yielding incorrect answers) to just plain sloppy copying of sheets (forgetting to delete the drawings and numbers not pertinent to the current sheet).
<br />As said in a prior review, if an updated CD were to become available, with the CORRECT ANSWERS on it, this would be a definite 5 star.
<br />(This said, perhaps finding the errors on the CD could be a means of developing your spreadsheets skills):)</span>

                    <span>Usually I avoid Microsoft publications like the plague.  The world digs deep enough into its pocket to fund Bill's lifestyle as it is. However work demands have lead me into using areas of Excel I have rarely used.  I found this book to be just the one to meet my needs.  I like the way the book is organised into short chapters with lots of practical examples.  Personally it could have done without the first seven chapters; at this level the reader should know these thoroughly.  Nevertheless, there is enough meat in the rest to give me a enough grounding into becoming more proficient in the more "esoteric" areas of Excel.</span>

                    <span>It could possibly be a 5 star. It's great for those who need it to supplement knowledge obtained "on the job". I recommend it.</span>
