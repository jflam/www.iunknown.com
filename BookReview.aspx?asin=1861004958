                <span id="Label1">JavaServer Pages, together with the Java Servlet API, provide the dynamic web content presentation layer for the Java 2 Enterprise Edition. JSPs and Servlets integrate tightly to enable scalable and portable applications, and are widely supported. This book extensively covers the next generation of these technologies, JSP 1.2 and Servlets 2.3, which are nearing completion under the Java Community Process and provide major enhancements to Java's web programming model.<P> This book looks in depth at these core components of the forthcoming J2EE 1.3 platform, preparing you for building the next generation of web solutions. You'll learn about the enhancements to the JSP tag library model; the new filtering and application event facilities; how to architect web applications to ensure clean separation of presentation and logic; and the increasingly popular Jakarta Struts framework. The book also addresses using JSP with XML and XSLT; databases access with JDBC; and how JSP and Servlets fit into the overall J2EE platform alongside Enterprise JavaBeans, JavaMail, and other J2EE technologies.</span>

                    <span>Well, i bought this book with one aim: Be able to learn and actually write JSP in limited terms. Since I found a job where they wanted me to do JSP, and I was doing ASP for last 2 years. This book has even section for ASP developers on how to move to JSP. So, with this book, I was able to write jsp in a week or so. ok, Now, actually about the book: <P>a) Great code explanation provided, as usual in any WROX books<P>b) Great code examples (especially voting application and database explorer one)<P>c) Tomcat and MySQL tutorial make my life easier, so i don't have to browse their sites for help - I have everything in one place (well, not everything -- but still, better then nothing)<P>d) Yes, price is kind of high, but, they got so much in one book, so i'm pretty sure that you will be glad once you buy it<P>I'd recommend this book for people who have to move from ASP (or any other programming language) to JSP. I would not recommend it to someone who is new to programming.<P>Thanks for all authors. Great Job.</span>

                    <span>Wrox Press continues their time-honored tradional of piling as many authors into one 1200 page volume that they can in the hopes that they will end up with a definitive treatment of the subject. The authors range from seasoned professionals with real-world experience to pimple-faced hacks with nothing but a year or two of college computer science courses behind them. .... I must confess that I am not sure what I was expecting in these chapters but since JSP Tag Libraries seemed to be one of the more challenging and interesting areas of JSPs I was hoping for some more meaningful, 'meaty' content.<P>The assembly of these 18 (yes, 18!) authors wind up generating a book that essentially could have been put together with more precision and continuity if it had 15 fewer authors. It very much comes off as a rushed effort, without any tightness whatsoever. The writing style of this second edition can only be described as amateurish. This, fortunately, can be a little easier to swallow if you accept the spirit of the book (in Wrox's words 'Programmer to Programmer'). Take the text as quickly put-together material from programmers that have been through it (even if it was brief or only in school) and you should be fine. <P>Many unnecessary forward references exist throughout the text and, because of the unusually large number of authors, there is a large amount of repetition in the body of most chapters. The book's page count could also have been greatly reduced had the authors not consistently given condensed introduction to material that ends up being the subject matter for entire chapters later in the book. For example, two early chapters describe the basics of Tag Libraries, only to have them surface as the primary topic of chapters 8 - 11. <P>The code included throughout the book is variable in quality, as you might expect. The book doesn't pretend to be an academic tome of best practices or a showcase for some top-flight, brilliant programming but you end up thinking that many of the examples could have been made much more effective with more thought put into them. As with many other programming books out there, this one is definitely not without its errors. You'd hope, however, that with the 21 technical reviewers and 3 editors that worked on this book that it would have fared better than most.<P>In summary, if you take the text for what it is and skip over the segments of fluff and numerous poor code examples I think that most professional programmers new to this technology will find enough material to make the hefty price tag almost worth it (especially if you share it with others on your team!). ....</span>
