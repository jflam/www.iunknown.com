                <span id="Label1"><I>Beginning Components for ASP</I> is an intermediate title in the Wrox line of Active Server Pages guides. This volume is intended for developers comfortable with ASP who are interested in leveraging the power of component-based applications. The two key development languages for components--Visual Basic and C++--are addressed in this work.<p> Visual Basic component development is handled first with an excellent introduction to components and class development in VB. The authors then explain the interconnection of ADO, UDA, and COM in a chapter that lays the foundation for a solid understanding of how components work. From there the authors discuss big picture application design issues such as n-tier architecture. The text utilizes concise code examples and frequent headings that make the book very useful for quick reference as you hone your component skills.<p> Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) and resource management are addressed, and the authors show what you must do to make your components work with MTS. The first of two sophisticated case studies in the book--a document management system--illustrates how to work with XML with components. This example is lengthy but very informative since the authors take the time to explain each section. A second similar case study presents a fictitious movie theater application. These real-world examples, coupled with the structured tutorial content, make this guide a perfect way to get on the component bandwagon. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Components and hosting environments, VB and C++ component development, UDA, ADO, COM, MTS, scalability, resource management, directory access with ADSI, C++ components with the Active Template Library, threading, and OLE DB access with ATL.</span>

                    <span>It is really a Beginning Book although it doesn't really fit the title. Alot of folks will probably be scared away by the treatment that they put on ATL and OLEDB providers but i love it! Why? Becoz i've read Grime's Beginning ATL 3 COM and it was really painful reading but these guys made the concept seemed EASY!<P>I like their walktruhs on RDS, ADSI and MSMQ, really neat. Something for me to get started on concepts which I am new to. Their treatment on MTS seemed like they pilfered the chapter from another wrox book - Professional VB MTS which covers the topic slightly in detail.<P>Otherwise, this is truely a Beginning Book, but a caveat to VB and ASP only programmers as they will find this book too hard. Wish that Wrox come up with another book called Beginning COM ASP with ATL. Which will be really be great with the way they handled the topic.</span>

                    <span>I'm really pleased to have found a book that gives so many practical examples of creating ASP components in VB. This books covers all the the technologies like XML and MTS that ASP developers should know about, and it does it well. <P>I've read other ASP component books from other publishers (such as Developing ASP component by Shelley Powers) but none have given so many examples, or been as technically deep and clear. With this book I've got a good handle on how to write my ASP components, which I just haven't got from other books.<P>Great book, thanks guys.</span>

                    <span>I read this book and then the amazon reviews...I have no idea where the negative reviews are coming from. I had no problem getting the code to work. If you are an ASP developer looking to write components, this book has what you need. You will learn how to write your own VB and C++ components and have them connect to the backend with (or without) MTS as desired. You need to know C++ (of course) and some COM to get the most out of the C++ components section...which has a nice coverage of the various threading models. While not as theoretical as some COM books, it gives you enough COM to get your components up and running...If you are developing ASP components, this is the book.</span>

                    <span>There is a problem with some of the code examples in Chapter 7. There are some minor dicrepancy in the some of the earlier code. I went back and checked the code in 7 again and the download code will not work and the code described would have to be modified in order to work. I consider this an egregious error on the part of the publisher and authors, especially since they've had more than 2 years to correct the mistake. I did find some of the information in some of the other chapters useful, but when sections are this bad, I begin to question everything else. I also examined wrox web site and found it humourous that the only errata given for a 2 year old book is only 8 days old.</span>
