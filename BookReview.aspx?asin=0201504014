                    <span>This book is the most amazing book on algorithms I've read. The concepts are so well explained that moving to "An introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Rivest" will be very easy. <p>I come from a non-computer science background. When I started my coursework in Computer Science I was intimidated with Cormen - (although that IS THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE and a complete text!) until I found Harel. <p>Harel covers ALL the key aspects of algorithms and quite a bit of Data Structs too. He explains all the concepts in a non-mathematical, yet intellectually stimulating manner.One can literally read through the book in single day and gain insight into the most difficult topics like, unsolvable problems, hard problems, NP and NP complete problems. <p>On a side note - I pity those reviewers who returned the masterpiece and took objection to Bible quotes. Please grow up and look at what the book has to offer instead of taking objection to such insignificant embellishments</span>

                    <span>This is a book about solving problems, finding the limits of the kinds of problems we can solve, and those we will never solve, and how we solve them. It is also a book about the essential results of computer science, and will give the reader a better understanding of what computers can do, and why some problems in computer science are much harder then they appear.<p>As far as I know, this is the only book that distills the essence of computer science, and presents it in a format suitable for the average reader. This is computer science's answer to Stephen Hawkings "A Brief History of Time".</span>

                    <span>I know this may be a computing classic since one tends to find this title on reading lists, but frankly I regret having bought it. I am not troubled by the contents of the book or the way Mr Harel describes them, however, I do strongly object to the fact that he continuously bothers the reader with bible quotations that seem to be growing on every second page like a malignant cancer. This may not offend you if you are Jewish or Christian, but short of that it is an annoyance of global proportions. If I want to read the Bible I will take a copy of the Bible and read it, but if I take a book about Algorithmics I don't want to be forced to combat missionaries. I will return this book asap!</span>

                    <span>As the author says, the members of the research community of Computer<br>  Science have done their discipline  a disservice by not making any<br>  special efforts to write accessible accounts of the field, as a result<br>  of which the 'layman' still has little idea of what goes on 'under the<br>  hood', so to say.<p>  He has therefore undertaken the challenging task of presenting the basic<br>  ideas underpinning Computer Science in a way that's easy for the general<br>  reader to grasp. He sets out to present the essential notions of<br>  Algorithms and data structures, Turing machines, Finite state machines,<br>  Decidability, Computability, Complexity, NP-completeness, Correctness,<br>  Parallel algorithms, Probabilistic algorithms, and more with a minimum<br>  of mathematics and yet without sacrificing intellectual rigour - and<br>  most admirably, succeeds in doing so.<p>  David Harel is a big name in Theoretical Computer Science, one of the<br>  leading researchers, and chairman of the Applied Mathematics and<br>  Computer Science Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science.<br>  What made my mind up about reading this book were the strongly encouraging<br>  remarks on the back cover by Aho & Hopcroft, two of the foremost authors<br>  and researchers in the field, who've written some great textbooks themselves.<p>  This book presents all the basic fundamental ideas of the theory of computation,<br>  using as little maths as possible. Yet, the intellectual rigour is never<br>  compromised, which means that the reader truly gets a flavour of how a<br>  Computer Scientist thinks, and how much fun it can be.     <p>  It also shows you how certain problems cannot be solved cheaply while others<br>  cannot be solved at all (solved exactly, that is), no matter how much<br>  'computing power' you have - ie theory proves the existence of certain<br>  fundamental limits on the problems that we can hope to solve.<p>  The writing is exceptionally good - like a true master of his subject,<br>  Harel makes concepts seem easy to grasp, though you may find that later<br>  on, you realize it was quite a subtle notion that was discussed.<br>  The illustations are a great help, and occasional humour provides relief<br>  from all the thinking you'll be doing!<p>  Even though it's written for the general reader, it is also useful for<br>  programmers, systems analysts and designers, software engineers and<br>  students, since Harel cuts to the core of the concepts and offers<br>  valuable insights into the theory that they might already know.<p>  All in all, this book covers amazing ground and is a great introduction<br>  to algorithms and the theory of computation.
