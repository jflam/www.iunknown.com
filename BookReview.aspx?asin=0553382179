                    <span>I think I fall somewhere between the reviewers who love or hate this book. While I give it an unqualified thumbs up, that's not to say I like the style. I don't. I am spiky, cynical, irreligious and unsentimental. I cringe when Marla talks about "blessing the world" and "purple puddles" and her "DH". But here's the thing. This book works. <P>I am not a Stepford wife - I'm a senior executive for a national organisation and I have no family at all, no parents, siblings, partner or children - not even a pet. Because I have absolutely no time for myself and no priorities apart from work, my house was utter chaos. Thanks to Marla Cilley it is now livable and I am able to have friends over without drowning in shame and am gradually reclaiming my life away from the office. <P>This book contains practical ideas that made me completely rethink my approach to my home. I am not cleaning out of moral duty or to please someone else, but because I deserve a nice place to live. The concept that it is better to do something imperfectly than never to start completely changed my thinking. And permission not to finish - to just do 15 minutes worth and stop - has made a huge difference to my life.<P>And while I don't like the syrupy stuff, I also suspect that someone without that homespun sweetness could not or would not have written this book and offered this help. So I am just grateful, and Marla can be as religious and as honeyed as she damn well likes, because I truly appreciate what this book has helped me do, and only an idiot throws out a rare gift because the wrapping doesn't suit them - particularly when it is genuinely well meant.<P>And to the patronising cow who can't believe people don't have time to throw out old toothpaste tubes - not everyone has as much free time as you do, and not everyone has the self-esteem necessary to put their own needs first. Clearly you are lucky enough to have plenty of both time and ego. Perhaps you can now invest in some insight to match. <P>Thanks, Marla, for your generosity and common sense.</span>

                    <span>I live by myself and have never been a good housekeeper nor been organized. Flylady has helped me begin (I'm one of the slower Flybabies) simple routines that are starting to make a dent in all the STUFF I have. I use her book as a backup to the website/emails and it makes me feel like she is always with me, pulling me along and supporting me while I slowly take control of my home. She starts you out at the very beginning with "Baby Steps" as well as her mantra of "You can do anything for 15 minutes!" I am finding that through this process I am also finding strength in other areas. I hadn't realized how the atmosphere in my home has had me down emotionally. It's pretty amazing how it all ties in. She is so supportive and positive. Sounds corny, but it works for those of us who either never really learned this stuff, who just plain forgot it in all the turmoil of life, or who somehow just let our homes get out of control long ago and never got it back. There are no organizational system instructions or reccomendations, just rock solid ground support and fun and effective ways to get out from under and STAY that way!</span>

                    <span>Maybe this book isn't for everyone- but for the person who looks around a cluttered and out of control home and feels cluttered and out of control herself- answers are here!<P>Marla Cilley teaches her readers more than how to declutter and gain a cleaner home- she teaches us to care about ourselves and find joy in the lives we have chosen (and have had a hard time finding success in!) <P>This book and her website have given many women a new lease on life and housework. In the book, Marla spoke to ME, a person who needed more than how to organize closets and shelves. I really needed a starting point and a little faith in myself. <P>If you are looking for a way to get simple, heartfelt efforts to add up to peace and order, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>When I first picked up this book at the library, I wasn't sure I would find anything useful in it. I had a little clutter, but I didn't feel that it had taken over my home. And I already knew how to clean my house. Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't care for the writer's style. ("Finally Loving Yourself"? How silly!) And some of the gushing testimonials grated on my nerves.<P>But it turned out that I actually did find that much of the book was useful. Cilley's approach is all about getting into a good routine. If you plan to do a little bit each day, then you don't have to subject yourself to frantic cleaning frenzies when you are getting ready for company. Many people, like me, who are busy and easily sidetracked can benefit from this kind of advice.<P>I don't follow this approach to the letter. I don't wear shoes in the house. I don't toss out 27 items at a time; I did this at first, but I quickly ran out of stuff to toss. I've incorporated much of her advice into my routine, and it has helped me to maintain a cleaner, more peaceful and inviting home. I love the 15-minutes-at-a-time approach. It makes it so much easier to get started on something if you give yourself permission to set it aside in a short while. And that's the key for many of us -- getting started. It's not all about de-cluttering; if you don't have that much clutter, you can move on to more detailed cleaning chores that some people might overlook.<P>Oh yeah -- about Cilley's writing style. As I've said, I wasn't wild about it at first, but I eventually came around to see her as refreshingly unpretentious. As for the annoying gushing testimonials, I get it now. I can't blame these people for their enthusiasm for something that really has improved their lives.<P>Judging by some of the other reviews, I guess this book isn't for everyone. But I would recommend this book to anyone who might need a little direction when it comes to establishing routines, to anyone who doesn't know where to start, and especially to anyone who feels overwhelmed by clutter.</span>
