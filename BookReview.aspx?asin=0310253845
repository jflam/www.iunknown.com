                    <span>If you find it hard to believe that one could actually call oneself a Christian and vote Democrat,  you might find this book shocking.   Otherwise, most of this ground is pretty covered.   That doesn't make this bad reading, far from it, because Campolo and McLaren cover their ground pretty well, summing up clearly what can be complex and confusing issues.   But if you've been keeping up at all with the ongoing debates in the church and culture surrounding the issues here (homosexuality, seminary, the environment, etc.)  don't expect to have your mind changed by this book.  
<br />
<br />That said, there are a few chapters that stand out:  
<br />
<br />--The one on the Bible, which offers alternative approaches to scripture (beyond analysis.)  I want to make copies of this and give it to everyone in my small group.  
<br />
<br />--The second half of the chapter on worship, in which McLaren condemns chasing "the Feeling"  and leaving God behind.  
<br />
<br />--The last chapter, on Postmodernism.   How refreshing to hear the pomo church guru himself admit that he's growing sick of the term and its myriad meanings and mis-usages.  (oy, what a thoroughly "modern" use of alliteration that was!)  
<br />
<br />It's a pretty quick and light read, and might be one to keep on the bookshelf for the sake of lending to those who are just stepping out of the hyper-religious conservative mindset.  
<br />
<br />PS - the title is a bit misleading.  The authors never actually deal with "how the culture" has done anything.  They just address where they think mainstream middle class churchianity has missed the point.  </span>

                    <span>The title, and sub title, does not seem to align with the content. Two well known Christian philosophers review how the Church handles various issues.  In each chapter one writes an essay, and the other responds with points of his own. Most often they agree in principle, but occasionally we do get two different views. The over riding theme is how post-modernism is changing the culture and how we view an historical interpretation in light of this supposed shift.
<br />
<br />The topics include;  Theology, End Times, Social Action, Culture, Leadership, Environmentalism, Truth and several others.  The more compelling discussions are those centered on social issues.  McLaren in particular takes a rather critical view of all things conservative.  Compolo is not much more open minded.  In fact, Compolo makes some claims on the environment that he apparently read in Sierra Club brochures.  It was shocking to see how biased and inaccurate his views on the science of the environment are.
<br />
<br />They both do make some good points about the focus of the Church in being part of the world as opposed to a separate sub-culture.  While the writing is not a literary masterpiece, it is conversational and a quick read.  Overall, it is an interesting look at how two people view the changing culture and how the Church will, or rather should, respond.

                    <span>I had high hopes for this book. Knowing the authors, I thought they would take on many of the hot-button issues of our day and provocatively challenge conservative orthodoxy. Instead, they dance around almost every topic, not wanting to say or risk too much. The end result is a bunch of mush. To make matters worse, the quality of the writing is surprisingly poor. It's almost as though they were under a tight deadline and had to scrap a few rounds of edits to get it in on time. In the end, "Adventures in Missing the Point" lives up to its name. It's a lightweight book.        </span>

                    <span>this book exists as a stepping stone in the emerging church conversation. If you're looking for a one-stop-all-the-answers reference, this ain't it. By neccessity (because of its broadness) it lacks depth on any one particular subject. But that's okay. These short, dialogical chapters challenge the reader to rethink his/her beliefs in each area and provide valuable fodder for the emerging church conversation. Well worth the read, even if and perhaps because, you won't agree with it all.</span>

                    <span>Adventurous in evaluating "missing the point" is aptly the title of this book between two authors who take turns writing and then reacting to various topics which they feel Christians are missing the point.
<br />
<br />I was attracted to this work by its subtite: "How the Culture Controlled Church Neutered the Gospel".  There seems to be little real discussion based on the culture of America neutering the gospel.  Oh, the authors would argue there is much about environment and politics and modernism and so on.  But, this is where these two truly "miss the point."  The gospel is above and beyond culture, and these two are reacting from purely cultural points of view, their culturally conditioned opinions.  They and especially Compolo, react from subjective opinion and seek to minimize objective Scripture.  
<br />
<br />While astounded and delighted in several of their reactions to what's happening in broad, popular Christian circles these days: Bible has less to say about accepting Christ as Personal Savior, the sinner's prayer, and altar call; also, that worship is individual centered rather than God centered... they miss much.  Their idea of worship is unbiblical, centered on God as passive observer of humans praising, forsaking the true nature of God gifting and blessing the people sacramentally and incarnationally to be His people to the world!
<br />
<br />I enjoyed the stress on being God's people to the world on environment, etc., but the stress is way too great on these areas and not enough on why we do them --- to gain a hearing for the Gospel!  They miss the point here completely it appears.
<br />
<br />They come across as anti-seminary, and in some cases for good reasons.  However, their opinions on female ordination never once addresses the real Scriptural point: order of creation.  They further miss the point on the image of God, the righteousness that permeated the original relationship, stressing too much the dominion over creation.  Compolo can't get off the kick either of being overly for created animals, whales, chimpanzees, etc.  Man certainly is the apple of God's eye, not these of his creations, although we are to be stewards of them, but not at the sake of humans.
<br />
<br />There overall seems to be an unbibical stress on innovation in theology and application.  This is so seductive and tempting.  A corrective to much of this is the outstanding book by Nancy Pearcy "Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from It's Cultural Captivity."</span>
