                    <span>The myth of slavery derives from the powerful images of the miniseries Roots; the notion that black people were simply swept out of their African lives, degraded and sometimes killed on  the harsh way to America and then put to work on a cotton plantation without power of any sort.
<br />
<br />Ira Berlin, in this beautifully written and thoroughly researched history of the first two hundred years of American slavery, "Many Thousands Gone",  blows apart that myth.  He says that slavery had great variety, based on geographic, economic and generational factors. The first generation of slaves in America were creoles, born of white and African American parents.  They frequently lived along the sea and interacted with people of all walks of life, were traders and often spoke multiple languages.  These slaves frequently stayed with their families, knew and utilized the courts to petition for freedom, they worked with their slave-owners to grow crops and to negotiate payment for their eventual freedom.   This changed with subsequent generations who were plucked from central Africa and did not have the same experience with the white world.  While slaves in these subsequent generations lost the power to negotiate the terms of their slavery with their slaveholders, they were able to grab autonomy in other ways.  They grew and sold goods in cities, they purchased their freedom, though often at a high price.  They escaped and formed maroon armed communities.
<br />
<br />A few other factors also played a significant role in determining the virulence of slavery, specifically geography and economics.   Some crops like cotton and tobacco were  well suited to the plantation systems and in areas where those crops grew well, the slave system was particularly harsh.  History was another factor. In the form of the American Revolution it disrupted the plantation system, because the plantation owners, who were often patriots with strong beliefs in the rights of man, also owned slaves and defended their right to do so.  The loyalists took advantage of this dilemma and often had the plantation slaves fighting on the loyalist side in exchange for the promise of becoming free men.  Sometimes they even delivered on that promise. 
<br />
<br />My only criticism is that I wanted more of a narrative that would bring together the various aspects of slavery.  I was left with the feeling that American slavery was really Mississippi slavery or South Carolina slavery or New York slavery.   The legacy of slavery appears to be monolithic even if the experience of slavery was not.

                    <span>Ira Berlin's MANY THOUSANDS GONE records the first two centuries of slavery in the present day United States AFTER European settlement.  More thought-provoking and less dogmatic than Eugene Genovese's ROLL, JORDAN, ROLL, Berlin more fully makes the distinction between the various forms the system of slavery took in different regions and at different times in the period before Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin put new vigor into the old institution.<p>The book is broken down into three main parts: Societies with Slaves (or the Charter Generation), Slave Societies (or the Plantation Generation) and the Revolutionary Generation (ending in approximately 1810 to 1820).  Within each of these time frames, the book looks at the peculiar ways in which the institution of slavery developed in Virginia and the Upper South, South Carolina and the Lower South, the North and the Lower Mississippi Valley (Louisiana and Florida).  Further, each such chapter focuses on the evolution of slavery in each region within each generation.<p>The book compares indenturement (and apprenticeships) with slavery and also describes how the influx of Africans from interior Africa swamped the Atlantic Creole populace, contributing to the idea of racial superiority (of whites) and the development of ideas about miscegnation as a polluter of racial purity.  The charter generation and later "creolized" generations were more likely to be able to win or purchase freedom whereas each influx of non-creolized Africans contributed to the "Africanization" of the black populace and to harsher restrictions on slaves and other black & biracial persons. <p>The book looks at de facto property-ownership among slaves and the development of the slave economy and its importance in the greater economy. Berlin also looks at the early interactions between the races (going so far as to point out that most persons of mixed race early on came not from relations between white masters and black slaves (whether or not consensual) but between indentured or lower class whites and slaves or free blacks.  He also touches on the increasing competition between the white working class and blacks (enslaved and free) and the growth of vehement anti-black sentiments among working class whites.<p>Informative and stimulating, the book infrequently still tends to generalize such as with the implicit assumption of the general validity of the Woodson Thesis that free blacks generally tended to be more likely to own relatives - which was true (by law - see FREE BLACKS IN NORFOLK, VIRGINIA by Tommy L. Bogger) in places such as Virginia (where Carter Woodson's father James Henry Woodson hailed - see BLACK CONFEDERATES AND AFRO-YANKEES IN CIVIL WAR VIRGINIA by Ervin L. Jordan, Jr.) but was clearly not the case in places such as Louisiana and South Carolina (see THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE by Gary B. Mills, BLACK SLAVEOWNERS by Larry Kroger and BLACK MASTERS by Michael P. Johnson & James L. Roark).  Despite such expected errors in so comprehensive a work, MANY THOUSANDS GONE makes for a great read!</span>

                    <span>This book added a great deal to my knowledge of the first two centuries of slavery in North America. Berlin's primary document research is marvelous and the details that he was able to find out about slave life during this period are astounding. Berlin found out that the process of dehumanizing slaves was one that took time and varied from region to region, and he goes into specific economic and cultural factors that played the role in establishing and keeping slavery in the states.<br>Often the creation of the peculiar institution and the diversity of slave life is glossed over in textbooks. They ignore the important role that economic factors play from region to region. Berlin argues that the north did not have fewer slaves because northerners were more conscientious or less racist than southerners(as many would like to think), but because the majority of them simply could not profit as well from slave labor. <p>An excellent scholarly work that shows wide diversity in the lives of slaves durring the first two centuries of its existance.</span>

                    <span>This book is, along with Morgan's work on the Lowcountry and Eugene Genovese's entire corpus, the outstanding work in the field. Berlin organizes his material both spatially and temporally, which allows him to give a feeling for the distinctions across the decades and from place to place. Even experts in American history will learn from every page.<p>My only caveat is that, despite the enormous effort that obviously went into this book, it came out with a plethora of grammatical errors. False parallelisms, single possessives in place of plurals, and numerous other basic grammatical mistakes mar the text, so that the careful reader cannot help but be distracted from the actual topic. Alas, this certainly colors my impression of what otherwise is an outstanding piece of work; too bad. Prof. Berlin's editors at Harvard definitely dropped the ball.</span>
