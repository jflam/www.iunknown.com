                    <span>This book is definitely only for Christians.  
<br />
<br />I am a spiritual person and have a lot of appreciation for the teachings in the Bible, but Peale repeatedly insists that self-confidence cannot be acheived without faith in the Bible and practicing Christianity.  Peale didn't consider that folks of different faiths might also benefit from his positive thinking techniques.  
<br />
<br />Too bad, I was looking forward to this one.  </span>

                    <span>     This book truly has changed my life! It is so easy to become negative toward people and society. If you sincerely apply the principles taught in this book, you will become a positive, enthusiastic, empowered individual! Being a Christian, I love the fact that it rightfully points to the Bible as the ultimate source of positive thinking.
<br />     I now desire to read as many books by Mr. Peale as I can. If the daily grind of "getting by" has you down...READ THIS BOOK!  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Although I found this book a lot more overtly Christian than its title would suggest, and found it very hard to read because of the dated writing style, I could see that all self-help books written since owe a great debt to this book.
<br />
<br />As I said, the writing style of this book is quaint.  For example, I'm not sure what Dr. Peale means by the word "scientific," for he uses it in a sense that seems to have little to do with real science.  His stories use quotes from people he's met, but they all speak with his voice.  Chapters blend into each other, as they're somewhat repetitive (How to Have Constant Energy/Relax for Easy Power; Expect the Best and Get It/I Don't Believe in Defeat).
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, there is wisdom there.  What you think about your lot in life determines how you react to it, and in turn, determines your lot in life.  You can choose to be positive and tap into the power available to you (whether you believe that power comes from God or from within), or you can declare defeat and descend into a spiral of misery.
<br />
<br />So go ahead and read this book, for historical and entertainment value, but also for the wisdom in the quaintness.</span>

                    <span>That should be the title of the book.  Positive thinking?  Um, very minimal.  Oh yeh, did I mention you need to think postively?  This book refers alot to the Bible.  I don't have any problems with that, but I thought the title is pretty misleading.  If you don't convert to Christianity after reading this book, I don't know what will.  This book leans more to God for help than positive thinking.  OK, maybe postive thinking is thinking about God, but how about people not religious?  Again, not the best title.  I got fooled by the title, decided to read it anyway, and was very disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I actually bought this book at a Good Will for $1.00.  I had it on the shelf for about two weeks before i finally picked it up, having read a million 'self-help' type books in whole life with not much success, i was skeptical.  This book is AWESOME.  Following the Faith principles is changing my life.  It gives specifics steps to techniques.  There really is power in what we think and believe.  I have seen and experienced real results in the past month using these techniques and principles.  This is the best book i've ever read.  My faith is stronger than it's been in the 10 years I've been a Christian, my hope is alive, my confidence not only in God and Jesus is stronger, but my confidence in my own God given abilities is stronger and getting stronger.  In the beginning ... God spoke ... his words created all of creation ... his words were power ... we are made in his image.  The Bible says, as a man thinks, so is he.  This book teaches how to think, act and speak positively and how to call upon God's power, how to practice FAITH.  The Bible says that the 'Righteous LIVE by Faith'.  When we are full of faith, we have 'life' in us, when we have no faith, we have death.  Hopelessness, doubt, fear, create death in our members, faith, fills us with LIFE, joy, peace, assurance, confidence.  Buy this book and FOLLOW, diligently the principles and techniques outlined ... you won't be disappointed.</span>
