                    <span>I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better.)</span>

                    <span>Heard the taped version of 1001 WAYS TO REWARD EMPLOYEES,<br>written and read by Bob Nelson . . . the author says that what most<br>motivates people who work is recognition--and not just money! . . . he <br>then presents a most useful guide to rewards of every conceivable type<br>for virtually any situation . . . the ideas include the spontaneous gesture<br>of praise to formal company-wide programs and just about everything<br>in-between.<p>These ideas, in particular, made a great deal of sense to me:<p>Works who must stay late at TIME INC. get cab fare home.<p>Marion Laboratories annually takes all employees and guests to see<br>a Kansas City Royals game.<p>Chevron keeps a Treasure Chest brimming with gifts so supervisors<br>can reward employees on the spot.<p>Every Christmas, the Walt Disney Company opens Disneyland for<br>employees and families only--with executives running the park.<p>My only disappointment in the book was in the author's narration . . . he<br>lacked any real enthusiasm for the task, and this is one time that it<br>would have been much better had anybody else been the reader.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for almost 10 years, and as an HR professional, it's a requirement in my library.  I also have 1001 Ways to Energize...  Must-haves.  They both get borrowed frequently so I have to really wallpaper my name all over the books in order to get them back. Which sometimes I don't but they are cheap enough to buy again.  So easy to read, they help get the creative juices flowing... for all HR consultants and itnernal advisors as well as managers!</span>

                    <span>This book is badly in need of revision.  Many of the ideas mentioned in the book either are no longer in use due to their dollar cost, or belong to companies which blew up (or were bought out) in the dot-com bust and early 21st-century economic collapse.  As an example, Tandem Computers - and all of the six things attributed to it - no longer exist.   Not only has HP (which bought out Compaq, which had acquired Tandem) stamped out those behaviours (every last one of them!), but it has eliminated or drastically scaled back all of the rewards attributed to it in this book.  <p>Fun is out if it costs any money, and that's probably pretty common everywhere.</span>
