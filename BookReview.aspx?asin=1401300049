                <span id="Label1"><B>From the award-winning chief White House correspondent for <I>U.S. News & World Report</I> comes the definitive history of Air Force One.</B>   <P>From FDR's prop-driven Pan Am to the glimmering blue and white jumbo 747 on which George W. Bush travels, the president's plane has captured the public's awe and imagination, and is recognized around the world as a symbol of American power. In this unique book, Kenneth Walsh looks at the decisions that our last 12 presidents made on the plane; the personality traits and peccadilloes they revealed when their guard was down; and the way they each established a distinctive mood aboard that was a reflection of their times, as well as their individual personalities.   <P>Based on interviews with four living presidents, scores of past and present White House officials, and staff and crew members of Air Force One, Walsh's book reveals countless fascinating stories of life aboard the "flying White House." It also features descriptions of the food, the decor, the bedrooms, the medical clinic, and much more -- as well as remarkable photos of the planes (inside and out) and the presidents.</span>

                    <span>What if you could be a fly on the bulkhead and watch the President of the United States as he flies on Air Force One? Most of us will never have such an opportunity, so this book is a fascinating view inside the president's official jumbo jet.<P>The book starts with a very swift, journalist's sweep through Franklin Roosevelt to George Walker Bush. While Teddy Roosevelt was the first president in the air, FDR was the first to use it for presidential business including internationally. But Air Force One is really a contemporary element of the Presidency, becoming an important player in US history with the stunning image of the swearing-in of Johnson aboard the plane after the assassination of Kennedy. <P>Walsh describes everything from the food--Barbara Walters got a Spam sandwich, George H.W.Bush banned, what else, broccoli while son George likes Asian and spicy Tex-Mex. He tells you about the lavatories, souvenir notepads, who sits where (seats are assigned, and the president has a suite in the very front, including a desk and bed.) And there is other fascinating trivia--why, for example did George W. ground his father when both were flying? You'll find the answer here.<P>I once saw Air Force One on the tarmac at Boston Logan, when Clinton was at the end of his second term. It was night, we were delayed to allow Air Force One to land. Then we saw it, glistening huge and frosty-white in the glare of the runway lights. Air Force One IS impressive, and a symbol of our US leadership. This is a very fun read, and a unique insight into one aspect of the US President's life.</span>

                    <span><P>I have just finished reading Kenneth T. Walsh's newest book, "Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes". This book, I am happy to report, is as informative and articulate a reading experience as I have had in a long time. Mr. Walsh's long-time "insider" status as well as his exhaustive research and crisp, concise style of writing made this a thoroughly enjoyable read, start to finish.<P><P>The short history of aviation and it's effect on American history is truly remarkable, as Mr. Walsh reports. Over the few years it has taken for the jet age to develop, our executive branch has been relatively quick to recognize and tap the potential for extending democratic values and influence. Between FDR's first tedious and exhausting hop-scotch to Casablanca and George W. Bush's incredible split-second decision on board Air Force One the day of September 11, 2001, this book gives the reader some wonderful minute-by-minute reporting from the key people involved, right up to the presidents themselves.<P>Each of our presidents has approached the Ait Force One experience in their own unique way, thereby revealing a closer insight into their hearts and minds. This book details each, from Clinton's relatively relaxed and homey flying style, Johnson's bullying, to Nixon's brooding and self-obsessed genius. And for me personally, the detailed descriptions of each airplane's awesome power and capabilities imparted a sense of certainty and reassurance that our leadership is just as secure and in command at 35,000 feet and 700 mph as it has ever been in the White House or Camp David.<P>These airplanes and the phalanx of people who fly them have known more history than one could ever have even imagined. With this book, Mr. Walsh has brought American history buffs as well as casual readers like myself a slice of flying knowlege and experience not soon to be forgotten.</span>

                    <span>If you are expecting a hard-hitting expose about anything presidential then this is not the book for you. The author does a very good job of detailing out the Presidents from FDR that have taken flight via Air Force One or its predecessors. The book is very interesting and does a good job at what it covers. The book does not cover in any detail much about the plane except for overall basic facts. The real focus of the book is the men who road in the planes, not the planes. I find that the only issue I had with the book is that there was not enough detail of the actual plane, what the crew goes through to get it ready, the special planning for a trip and so on. Don't get me wrong, I rather enjoyed the book as it was a light easy to read book that provided some very nice stories about the Presidents who traveled in the plane.</span>

                    <span>* Kenneth Walsh's AIR FORCE ONE is a history of the aircraft<BR>of the US presidents and the events of their presidencies that<BR>took place in and around these aircraft.<P>This is not really a book for aviation enthusiasts interested<BR>in learning about the technical details of these aircraft. <BR>I believe there is another book on AIR FORCE ONE that does go<BR>into these details, but the technical descriptions here are<BR>general and informal, with the focus being mostly on portraits<BR>of and stories about presidents. <P>The discussion of the logistics of current Air Force 1 flights <BR>was, however, something of an eye-opener: the flights involve <BR>*two* Boeing 747 jumbo jets, with one flying as a backup, as <BR>well as support aircraft, for example to carry the presidential <BR>armored limousines. Imperial Ceasar could envy travel in such <BR>a grand fashion.<P>In fact, in some ways this book could be retitled THE TWELVE<BR>CEASARS (AND THEIR FLYING MACHINES) -- and by a minor <BR>coincidence there have actually been twelve flying presidents.<BR>Like THE TWELVE CEASARS itself, this is something of a chatty,<BR>celebrity-gossipy book, and as such it is entertaining if <BR>sometimes hard to take very seriously. I did find it amusing to <BR>learn that Richard Nixon was so clumsy around technology that he <BR>could barely operate an AM-FM radio. Brent Scowcroft said that <BR>Nixon could trip over a fleck of dust on the carpet.<P>This is an amusing read, though in the end it doesn't feel<BR>like much more than a glorified magazine essay. It could have<BR>been cut down considerably and not lost much, but since it's not all<BR>that long to begin with that's not much of a problem, and if you<BR>read AIR FORCE ONE with the proper expectations you will likely<BR>find it a good use of your time.</span>

                    <span>Air Force One doesn't break any new ground. There aren't any juicy revelations about our past or present presidents. Air Force One in this book provides a unique stage allowing us to briefly visit all of the "flying presidents" including their personality flaws and greatness. (or the lack thereof) It's an interesting book. You won't end up with it on your all time list of favorites but it's perfect for a summer day at the beach. Enjoyable reading.</span>
