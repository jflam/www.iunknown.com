All of the coverage has been updated to reflect the state of the art in data compression, including both new algorithms and older methods for which new uses are being found.  And the downloadable software gives you the opportunity to see firsthand how various algorithms work, to choose and implement appropriate techniques in your own applications, and to build your own algorithms.<br><br>* Fully updated to cover the most recent lossy and lossless compression techniques, including wavelets, subband coding, predictive lossless techniques, and Huffman coding variants.<br>* Explains established and emerging standards in depth: JPEG 2000, JPEG-LS, MPEG 2, Group 3 and 4 Faxes, JBIG 2, ADPCM, LPC, CELP, and MELP.<br>* Includes an new chapter providing the mathematical background required for understanding wavelets and subband coding.<br>* Via the companion Web site, provides source code that enables you to experiment with a wide range of compression techniques, along with sample data and updates on the latest developments in the compression field.</span>

                    <span>Many reviewers tried to say that this book should avoid the word "INTRODUCTION" in it's name because of it's intensive mathematics. But I'm totally disagree. Mathematics and all theoretical aspects explained in this book is just a preliminary review compare to what the researchers all around the world are doing in the data compression area. This book is really an "INTRODUCTION" book. <P>This book is very comprehensive. You'd absolutely need it if you are going to start a research in this area. If you're just wonder how data can be compressed, you can try other easy books like Peter Wayner's :"Compression Algorithms for Real Programmers". Or if you need compression as a feature in your software product, I'd suggest you not to implement it yourself. Try 3rd party library. Data Compression is the job for specialists.</span>

                    <span>While some books may cover individual compression techniques in finer detail, Sayood's book provides the best comprehensive overview of the data compression field including video, voice, images, text, music, etc. The reader gains a deep respect for the underlying mathematical basis for compression without being inundated with complex mathematics. I use this book for a senior undergrad / beginning grad student level course at the University of Delaware, and strongly recommend it to others.</span>

                    <span>Amazon claims that this is "the definitive guide". I have to agree with them because this book is the only broad grey pages introduction to data compression that I have been able to find, and it is very well written.<P>If you are only casually interested in data compression this book is not for you.<P>If you are interested in adding compression to your application and your data falls into a common category, sound, video, text ect this book is probably not for you. You should look to the open source community or buy an off the shelf product.<P>But if your data is odd or unique like say telemtry data (I'm sure there are other examples I just can't think of any) and you need to design a compression scheme for your data this book is "the only" book for you.<P>If you want to begin research into data compression and you are a newbie this book is a must have.</span>

                    <span>The book is one of the clearest I have read as a text book. Why cant everybody write like this?? There is very good flow throughout the text.<P>Only complaint is the software. It looks the software has not kept pace with the book itself. Some additional software has to be added (for Transform coding, for instance), and some references in the text book to the software are incorrect. If the accompanying software is upgraded, as it should be, I will rate this book a clear 5-star.</span>
