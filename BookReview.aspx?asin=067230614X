                    <span>Peter Norton has done a great job explaining DOS 6.22. This book is not filled with jokes or stories and does a great job explaining everything in detail. It guides you along allowing you to practice all of the commands and techniques you will learn. It is written so any beginner can understand. For anyone who wants to learn DOS or basic computer management this is a great book.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a book that provided in depth information about batch files and I found exactly what I was looking for. Peter Norton does an excellent job of explaining DOS in a simple to follow format. This is a must read for anyone involved in supporting end users, specially those who have used Windows exclusively and have very limited knowledge of DOS. Many of the concepts explained in this book are used today in different versions of Windows. It will help fill in the gaps when it comes to understanding and utilizing the command line, which is a must for any IT professional.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone who wants to learn the basics of computer management and script writing. Even if you never use any of the information about the various DOS commands and functions (although many of them apply to Windows 2000) the book is worth the purchase price for the chapters on writing batch files. Don't be fooled by the chapter titles -- while ostensibly teaching you how to write batch files this book is really providing the best overview of computer scripting I have ever found.<P>I have owned this book for around 5 years and have never found a better source for the fundamental priciples of script writing. I rarely use batch files now, but the techniques Norton describes here are completely applicable to Windows and UNIX scripting languages like Autoit, WSH, and Bash. I have recommended this book, and others by Norton, to people trying to make the transition from causual user to computer expert.</span>

                    <span>Well written, but too long. Still, Peter Norton covers all of the bases. And I mean *all* of the bases. The book is very well organized and cross-referenced. Hands-on applications in each chapter score big in my world. This book has that, too.<P>I use Windows 98 with version 7 DOS and have found the book to be helpful even here. The basics as well as advanced topics are inside and even a beginning DOS acolyte can dig in and learn something.<P>Maybe it deserves four stars, but I only reserve that for the *really* good books.<P>Anyway, congrats for P.N. A fine job.</span>
