                    <span>Invariably, we had to be bludgeoned with an onslaught of Red Sox-Yankees books after the "Greatest Comeback in Sports History." It seems like a dozen or more books have hit the shelves since The Curse was broken, but most were rushed so hurriedly to market to capitalize on demand, that almost none are anything more than time-worn retreads of stories we already knew - or worse, Red Sox fans/authors whose objectivity is questionable at best.  But Vaccaro's book was set in motion long before The Babe rolled over in his grave. It's clearly a book two years in the works, since Aaron "Bleeping" Boone's HR, and its exhaustive detail and historical sweep turn over stones even the most rabid Yanks' and Sox' fans had likely never noticed before. For fans of both teams who have a passionate appreciation for the scope of the greatest rivalry in sports, this is an absolute must-read. Forget sports; this is one of the most thorough and insightful history books I've ever read.</span>

                    <span>Author Vaccaro obviously did a careful demographic study and then sat down with his accountants and decided to cash in on the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry. He has no emotional investment in either team, just a financial one. No humor, no passion. Try reading BLOOD FEUD instead. It has both - and no pandering to the Big Apple. It is well-researched and very funny. A recent Yankee reviewer of BLOOD FEUD complained "Calling one team "divine" and the other "evil" is a joke." Well, "Duh!" Of course it's a joke and a very clever and funny one, as those who read it will quickly discover! This is a book for Red Sox, Yankee,  Mets fans - but mostly for baseball fans who love the game.</span>

                    <span>Mike Vaccaro brings to sportswriting something most of his statistical, fanatical, factoid spewing brethern forgets...baseball, at it's very core, is about the people behind the numbers. Thats what makes this book so much more interesting than all of the other Red Sox-Yankee history books. This book weaves together such a poetic colorful narrative of quotes, emotions and stories from the all the players involved right down to the dihard fan in the last row of bleacher seats. We all know how the story ends, but Vaccaro takes us on that crazy ride one more time. This time we see it and feel it from all sides.</span>

                    <span>I didn't think it was possible to learn more about the last two Red Sox-Yankees playoff series. As a lifelong Red Sox fan, I watched every out of every game, reading every newspaper story and magazine article. But with every page in this book, I learned something new about these two teams -- like Bucky Dent himself falling asleep just before Aaron Boone matched his dramatic home run with one in the 2003 Game 7. But where Vaccaro is at his best is when he mixes in the history of this rivalry. Yes, you will see numerous books on the shelves about the Red Sox and Yankees. But no, you will not see a better one than this. </span>
