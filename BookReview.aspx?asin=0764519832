                    <span>This is a very complete guide book but the "unoffical" title is a little misleading. It surely is unoffical, but its also relentlessly bland and inoffensive. <P>For example, the "Imperial Palace" hotel swimming pool is described as "beautiful." Most of us wouldn't expect to have a grey concrete parking garage right next door to a beautiful pool, right? Well the pool at the I.P. does, with no attempt to screen it from view.<P>The information in the book is accurate, in that if it says "casino X" has a health club, or a pool, or whatever, you can be sure it will. But it looks as if the lawyers have removed any critical word about anything - use it as a guide to Las Vegas, but not as a gospel.<P>A good companion book to carry along with this one is the "Time Out Guide to Las Vegas" which despite being British and rather pretentious in parts, doesn't pull its punches and offers a host of interesting and opinionated views on the city and its attractions.</span>

                    <span>I have been to Vegas only once in my life for a conference and now I am going back as a tourist I loved it so much. This book is good for either the tourist or the business traveler...very effective and detailed compared to many other Travel Guide books for Las Vegas. Very informative and insightful...It's a strong essential to have from the planning of your business trip or vacation to the time you are in Las Vegas!</span>

                    <span>I travel to Vegas occasionally for business and pleasure, and I am yet to find another guide book that captures the real story about Vegas with as much insight and naked truth as this book. No apologies here, like you'd see in some advertisement-platforms that masquerade as a guide book. I'm sure the author made more enemies than friends in the Vegas establishment by laying bare the truth about the hotels, restaurants and all sorts of Vegas business, including the "escort" business. However, that's the same reason why you should keep this book nearby whenever you're in Sin City.<P>I think the show reviews in the book alone is worth its price. The generous "Consumer Tips" provided for every show, and extensive hotel, nightclub and restaurant ratings provide super consumer value. <P>Do not reserve a room in Vegas before you read the hotels and lodging chapter (Part One). You'll be pleasantly surprised by the things you'll learn about how the "system works." <P>The gambling chapter (Part Three) is another must reading. The section titled "The Way It Is" provides important insight into the industry.<P>Save yourself unnecessary head- and heartache. Read this book before you hit The Strip.</span>

                    <span>The Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas is one of the best I've seen. It has a lot of good information, is well organized and covers many topics. If you buy only one book, this is it. However, beware that prices in LV are way up this year so call the restaurant if budget is important to you. Actual costs may be as much as 50% higher.</span>
