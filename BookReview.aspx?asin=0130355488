                    <span>This book is still the best textbook on the market. Having reviewed (officially) many of the new competitors to this book, this book is still the best at providing an excellent overview to computing security, especially for computer scientists. While I agree with another reviewer that "Hacking Exposed" is another good book, it is not a textbook and does not provide the theoretical underpinnings that this book does. The old edition (2nd) was getting dated and I was glad to see most of the material that needed updating was. In particular, the networking section was updated and sufficient for my course in computer security. Other books tend to provide a more short-term view of security, than a textbook with solid concepts. This series of editions has done a lot to create a science of security, rather than just a collection of techniques.</span>

                    <span>The book covers a lot of the computer security field. You should have some mathematical background that is not very well explained at the beginning of the book, otherwise it is very difficult to understand some of the proofs.</span>

                    <span>Security in Computing (Third Edition) can serve as an upper division undergraduate or graduate level text book. But if you're not a student, and more pragmatic than theoretical, don't let that scare you off. Each chapter is clearly written, well organized, contains a summary, list of terms used, and a brief "To Learn More" section. The book is very up to date: It includes reasonably detailed discussions on the inner workings of AES and even an introduction to quantum cryptography. All the "old standards" are covered as well, including firewalls, viruses and malware, CIA, database security, policy development, network security, trusted operating systems, security law, cryptography and more.<P>All in all, this is the best general purpose computer security book available. It belongs on the bookshelf of every practicing professional. But you won't want to leave it there - take it down when you need to work in an unfamiliar area. It will help bring you up to speed and point you towards more specialized resources. <P>Minor caution: This is not a book for security beginners, and it helps to have some background in computer architecture, networks, databases and/or administration. But if you've got that, you won't find a better book. And if you don't this book provides enough ground work for quick studies to understand new security material.</span>

                    <span>In 1989, I read the first edition of "Security in Computing" which was one of the best books in the information security field. Fourteen years later, I find the 2003 third edition even better. This is my primary textbook in a graduate course I teach. I also recommend this text to commercial students who are in my CISSP Common Body of Knowledge seminars. What I like best about this book is the index and the bibliography. Personally, I use this text as a reference to remind myself of the concise descriptions of some difficult security issues or protocols. I also recommend this book for managers to develop insights for interviewing potential candidates. The book, just like the field, is very broad and can assist you in understanding the big picture view in information security. It can help you focus on requirements in the development of a secure computing environment and develop some metrics as you define your security architecture. Having spent several decades in the information security field, I find this to be an excellent book for the classroom as well as the reference shelf of information security practitioner and manager in an enterprise environment.<P>J Holleran, CISSP<BR>Retired Technical Director<BR>National Computer Security Center</span>

                    <span>An excellent book. I highly recommend it to software engineers and other computer scientists who desire a good foundation in computer security topics. It is comprehensive, well organized, and chock full of clear, concise examples which assist the reader in understanding complex subjects. The many "real world" vignettes, many of which were fascinating to read, lent credibility and urgency to this important field of study. I would use it as the basis for an undergraduate or graduate course in this field.</span>
