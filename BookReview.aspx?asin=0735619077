                    <span>If you already know how to program in Visual C++, you will probably find this book covers new features of C++ .NET rather well, although some of the explanations are very short and terse.<P>The code is accurate and the examples are easy to load, saving you a ton of keystrokes while allowing you to concentrate on the walkthrough of how the program accomplishes it's task.<P>However, for the beginner... look elsewhere. For those that know how to code already, take a look at this:<P>Page 14: A "Hello World" program.<P>Page 15: OOP programming, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, classes and objects.<P>Page 21 begins with a "simple" example. Within that example are classes, public and private members, how to access them, pointers, indirection operators, the garbage collector, managed extensions, functions - including the unexplained Console::Write() and Console::WriteLine() functions that perform string output. <P>Woops! Almost forgot namespaces, #include directives and the "using <mscorlib.dll>". Any beginners know what a .dll file is?<P>Then we move onto page 26... Eeek!<P>And, just to make sure you beginners know you're going to be overwhelmed, here's a paragraph from page 23:<P>"Because of these performance issues, the .NET Framework also supports value types. Value types are objects created on the stack. The variable contains the object itself rather than a pointer to the object. Hence, the variable doesn't have to be dereferenced to manipulate the object, which of course improves performance. To declare a value type class, the __value keyword should be used instead of the __gc keyword. In this case, the variables would have been created on the stack. Instead of declaring pointers for this class and then creating the objects on the CLR heap by using the new operator, the objects would have been declared in the same way as the built-in C++ types and the member vairiables accessed by the dot operator rather than via the dereferencing operator."<P>Got all that? Hope so, because before you reach page 50, he'll cover declaring variables, assigning values, Arrays, Pointers, References, Constants, Enumerations, Typedefs, the String class, arithmatic operators, relational and logical operators, typecasting, the Ternary Operator, the sizeof() operator, bitwise operators, precedence and associativity.<P>Neat huh?<P>Only for experienced, proficient C++ programmers.</span>

                    <span>I have just found this book from a Closing Down Bookshop .. for only 24$ AU ... First, I am a C++ programmer who want to learn .NET (I use GCC before and never touch MFC or Visual C++ before). I think this book provide everything I need to know about how to use VS.NET and C++ itself. It is clearly explained and easy to follow.<BR>I have compare this book with several book (C++.NET book)...and I found this book is good enough. The other book about C++.NET I found usefull is Visual C++.NET by Deitell (but too expensive than this book lol)</span>

                    <span>THe purpose of this book really isn't to learn C++, but to learn managed C++ with .net. If you are brand new to C++, id' suggest getting one of the sam's 21 day books.</span>

                    <span>Some of the reviews appear to refer to a C# version of this book - don't know why, but it needs to be looked into by amazon. <P>I found this C++ book to be invlauble when navigating the new 2003 VS and associated features. It is not a how to learn C++ book and the title misleading. It s a book hoever for those who know C++ (intermediate level) but need to learn to negotiate (a) the Visual Studio interface and IDE (which has changed from 2002) and (b) get a basic grasp of .net framework, clr etc under their belt.<P>The book is very good at meeting the requirements of (a) in my opinion. It is clear and to the point about how to use the new IDE. The exmaple code is not overly sophisticated either whihc is a boon at many levels if your are a student. <P>In the matter of (b), there isa chapter explainign how COM and ActiveX have essentially been terminted in the new framework. If you don't know COM and ActiveX components, ou will get very little out of it however.<P>My main criticism of the (b) aspects of the book is that they measure up quite poorly against several other excellent MS books covering VB in .net, especially Balena. MS has had a change of heart about C++ and was considering canning it in the expectation that C# would replace it eventually. Despite this change of heart MS have not produced anywhere near the quality of their other 'VS language+framework' textbooks.<P>If you are learnign C++ nad have only Visual Studio 2003 at your disposal then this is a clear text fro gettign going in the IDE. However, if you already knwo C++ and have a grasp of the IDE then the book will give you the bones of .net framework but nowhere near quality of material found in the several other framewark texts. Nevertheless, I give it five stars because it is so clearly written and easy to follow.</span>
