                    <span>The Book summary on the back cover calls Chuck Zito a dying breed. Well, if that is the case, respectfuly, I say let that breed die. If you want to here about how tough Chuck Zito is and what a wonderful organization the Hells angels is, than this is the book for you. Chuck basicaly braggs about his encounters with celebreties and glorifies and justifies physical assualts on others. He also reveals that he has a distorted sense  of justice. I was hoping to find something substancial and edifying in this book, but was I was greatly disapointed. Although, the book reveals Chucks determination when facing adversity (a admirable quality) and you may be interested in hearing about certain details regarding his encounters with celebraties, his arogance and warped sense of justice arouse disgust. </span>

                    <span>This was a very quick read for me. I was done in a couple hours. Anybody curious about Chuck Zito or interested in the Hells Angels should read it. There's a fair amount of chest pounding, but a lot of reality, too.</span>

                    <span>No, not Sly Stallone.  Chuck Zito.  I've never been the violent type.  But I can't say I've never wanted to sock someone in the lip for mouthing off.  Let's just say that I was able to live vicariously through Chuck Zito's autobiography.  What I found to be most interesting was the level of detail associated with his stories of brutality.  Additionally, he gives a SCARY account of prison - it's no wonder HBO hired him as a consultant/actor for the hit series OZ.  WARNING: This book is not for the squeamish.  His book is graphic and often times disturbing - just the kind of reading material to keep my attention!  Now, I'm not one to read a book cover-to-cover over the course of three days.  But this was just "one of those books" I couldn't put down.  If you're interested in a first-hand account of bike gangs, violence, and prison, then this is the book for you.  I would venture to say that the most memorable part of this book was the beatdown Chuck Zito delivered to Jean-Claude VanDamm at Scores Gentleman's Club in New York City - it's classic.   Upon reading this book, I couldn't help but realize how truly "boring" my life was in the context of things.  Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in a period of about 4 days it was very interesting to say the least. The book of course starts from when he was a kid going all the way through adulthood to his role on oz and the jobs he has had between bodyguard, bouncer.  I know there was a ghost writer but i think the thing that kept it from a 5 star book for me was the constant park the car, get off the bike and punch somebodys lights out and keep going we all know that he and the angels are all tough guys no need to keep putting it in peoples faces through the whole book but I enjoyed reading it.</span>
