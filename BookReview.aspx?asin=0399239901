                    <span>After reading the whole book (somehow I think this would be an important prerequisite for rating it...see "A Reader" review)...and not seeing any "fowl" language, in the bird sense, at least... I can say this was a great hook book for middle school reluctant readers.  Without being "preachy",the whole of it had only positive messages to give our most influenced of adolescents.
<br />
<br />The main character, Troy does a great job of showing how easily we can obsess on our flaws, and let this obsession color everything we see.  Curt is a great character to show the power of music (and punk) and the innate need in all of us for friendship and family -- without needing the reader to internally save him.  My favorite character, however and undoubtedly, was the father, a good man in all senses of the word...  (And it's great to see books that show how many good families are still out there)
<br />
<br />This book made me laugh, made me cry, and made me, most especially, think.  It kept me reading (I couldn't put in down)most importantly.
<br />
<br />The only issue I could take up was the somewhat stereotypical portrayal of punk being involved with drugs... Ever hear of "Staight Edge"???
<br />
<br />Overall, though, a great book.  Definitely worth reading!</span>

                    <span>This book is pretty interesting except for the few times it loses you near the start of the book.I'm sure you've heard of,or read a lot of books with 14 year old ignorant dreams. This book isn't like those books.
<br />   This book isn't that funny;allthough, I did smudge a few snickers out from the first few chapters' sardonic sence of humour.
<br />   I'm especially happy with this book because Troy becomes a winner without dropping a few hundred pounds.
<br />   There isn't THAT much swearing in this book. I've read other books with a lot more obscene language in them than this book.
<br />Besides, I'm sure most junior high students hear swearing every day. Still, if you're gonna read, be prepared.
<br />   I liked how the characters had bad days and good days, and how their emotion came  off of that too.
<br />   This book also has a tiny bit of hidden depths to it. Like when that Ollie character said, " I think it's okay you don't get caught up in the B. S. You don't look like the kind of guy who'd get caught up in all that."(If you read the book you'll know what he's talking about. Unfortunately the book has minor thoughts like that, and not a lot of them.
<br />   As for the Kurt Cobain thing. The only place I can remember a mentioning of  him was in the acknowledgements section. This book isn't obsessed with Nirvana unlike some disturbing way- over- the- obsessed-line biographies. But hmmnnnn, I figured  the  Curt/Kurt thing from the start.
<br />   Overall I'd give this book three and a half stars. I'd think the reading age would be around late junior high to early high school. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes music,and is looking for a quick, easy(not in a demeaning way) read.
<br />   The reason I held back on the rating is because the book seemed to lack something. Maybe the book wasn't long enough. I wish the author dug a bit deeper into all of the characters, but I get the feeling the book's not supposed to be like that. I guess It's kinda nice how it revolves around two people. The way the characters cleared their thoughts and ideas up in short sentences (usually containing a swear and a helping verb) was surprisingly..........what's the word I'm looking for....entertaining. Get the book and see what you think. </span>

                    <span>I loved Fat Kid Rules The World. It was the kind of book where I wanted to find out what happened, but I didn't want the book to end. Sure, there was swearing. Sure, there was refrences to things I probably shouldn't talk about, but they all were emphasis to Troy's world. Going does, indeed, have a colorful way with words in many respects. I would recomend this book to anyone, especially musicians.</span>

                    <span>Yes! Yes! Yes! Finally there is a book that interests me in rock and a hard life. K.L. Going is going to go far with this book. Troy is a troubled fat kid with no friends. Curt is an awesome guitar player and becomes friends with Troy. Troy then learns to play the drums and they form a band(there is twice as much exciting events). This book is awesome. It is very suspenseful, exciting, and it has the talk of a teenager. Like they swear and they smoke but its all part of a real life rock band, and it is a life of a teenager. There better be a sequel. 5 STARS!!!</span>
