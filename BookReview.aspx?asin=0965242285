                    <span>Vocabulary Cartoons 290 key words presented through cartoons.  
<br />Each word contains a "link" word which is intended to serve as a mnemonic device, helping you to associate the new word to the word that you may be more familiar with.  A good deal of the "link" words rhyme with the "key" word.  To make the association even easier, the authors have provided a phrase which is easy to remember as in "We LAMENT that Joe got buried in CEMENT".  This phrase is portrayed through a cartoon, providing a visual mnemonic.
<br />
<br />Under each cartoon, you'll find three sentences with contexts where it may be appropriate to use the "key" word. These examples will also help you to develop the feel for the word, as well as to create more associations to the key word.  
<br />
<br />The authors have appropriately said that this book is "for everyone".  The words in this vocabulary book seem to be for the most part on a high-school level.</span>

                    <span>How To Double Your Vocabulary<p>Despite advertising hype, no ONE book will double your vocabulary, but reading several vocabulary-building books can double your vocabulary.  Different vocabulary-building books have different words and different explanations.  If you don't learn a word from one book, you can learn it from another book.  <p>Any vocabulary-building book will have many words, a fourth to half the book, that you already understand.  You can always skip or skim the easy-to-you words.  <p>Varied, incomplete word selection is another reason for using several books.  Some books just take words used on past-standardized tests, neglecting other words.  Other books, limit their words to words based on word roots, neglecting others.  Often authors have thrown in personal favorite words, even if others rarely use the words.  If you see a word in two or three books, it's generally a need-to-know word.  <p>Cartoon/Mnemonic vocabulary books have their fans who like the mnemonic memory aids, which are useful before tests.  If you don't like cartoons with mnemonic reminders, don't buy this book.  The main weakness of Vocabulary Cartoons is with only one word and one cartoon per page, these books may only have a few hundred words and are expensive per word.   Audio vocabulary books such as Elite Word Power, let you hearing each word pronounced correctly, helpful for improving speaking vocabulary.</span>

                    <span>At first I thought this book would help me increase my score of 650. But I soon found the book lacking in more difficult words. Words such as gainsay and mundane are words that I seem to use in my so-called coloquial language. <p>I only recommend this book to those who want to reinforce their vocabulary or have trouble recalling things under pressure.</span>
