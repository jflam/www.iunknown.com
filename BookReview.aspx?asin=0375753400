                <span id="Label1">"I started McCarver's book because I was sure he would teach me something. I finished it as Casey Stengel."--The Cincinnati Enquirer<br><br>Tim McCarver, baseball's preeminent analyst, has set down all that he knows about how the game should be played and watched. With his trademark wit and style, McCarver explains the fundamentals and proper mechanics at the level necessary for success in the major leagues. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans is a gold mine for all fans, brain surgeons or otherwise, and anyone learning how to play or coach the game. (Even major leaguers will pick up some pointers.) After the wonderful 1998 season, America's pastime has never been more popular, and with the deeper knowledge and understanding of baseball that Brain Surgeons provides, any fan will be able to watch it like a pro.</span>

                    <span>and i can't imagine why anyone would.  McCarver and his partner in crime, Joe Buck, are the most annoying sports announcers in the business.  People who like these guys either (1)have the IQ of chicken, and/or (2) hate baseball and enjoy watching these guys bring the game down.

                    <span>I learned a lot from this book. McCarver is at his best when describing the little things that go into making strategic decisions, like when to steal, when to hit and run, when to try for an extra base and so on. His insights into baserunning are particularly good. I found some of his descriptions of different types of pitches to be perplexing - what does it mean that a certain pitch "topples" (a tree can topple, but how does a round object flying through the air do that?). Overall, this is a very good book, and even long-time fans can get a lot out of it.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a big fan of Tim McCarver, the TV analyst. So when I've seen this book I didn't give it much of a glance until just recently. I leafed through a few pages and became intrigued. I read a few more and was hooked. He does a wonderful job explaining the "intricacies" of the game. McCarver takes a kind of 'scientific' approach in explaining the various parts of the game, from the preparation he goes through before a televised game, to the pre-game meetings, to the actual game itself, "working a lineup," what is involved in playing the various positions, pitcher-batter duels, and so on. He also talks about what is going on with each pitch and how everyone, batter, pitcher, catcher and all the other players react to various pitch counts.<p>Since I've read the book, I've tried to be more conscious of what goes on during a game, checking to see if I can tell what signals a first or third base coach is giving, what kind of signs a catcher is giving a pitcher, or the other various strategies going on within a game. These "games within the game" have made watching baseball more fun. I may still at times get aggravated with McCarver's analysis during a game, but this book has made me a more knowledgeable fan.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book thinking I knew everything there is to know about the game of baseball, boy was I wrong!  I have learned so much from this book, I feel that if I told George Steinbrenner  that I read Tim McCarvers Baseball For Brain Surgeans and Other Fans, that he would hire me on the spot as manager and fire Torre. This book is that good. This book is also fun to read. You would't be able to enjoy this book if you do not know about baseball already, because it gets a little complex sometimes. So go out and get this book if you like baseball and want to learn more about how the game is played</span>
