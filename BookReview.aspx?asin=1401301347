                <span id="Label1"><b>On the heels of George Carlin's #1 <i>New York  Times </i>bestseller <i>Napalm & Silly Putty</i> comes <i>When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?</i> -- infused with Carlin's trademark irreverent humor and biting cultural  observations.</b>  <P>Here we go again . . . George Carlin's hilarious <i>When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?</i> offers his cutting-edge opinions and observational humor on everything from evasive euphemistic language to politicians to the media to dead people. Nothing and no one is safe!  <P>Despite the current climate of political correctness, Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics:  <P>--<b>Carlin on the media:</b> The media comprises equal parts business, politics, advertising, public relations, and show business. Nice combination. Enough bull for Texas to open a chain of branch offices.<br> --<b>Carlin on the battle of the sexes:</b> Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid.<br> --<b>Carlin on hygiene:</b> When did they pass a law that says the people who make my sandwich have to be wearing gloves? I'm not comfortable with this. I don't want glove residue all over my food; it's not sanitary. Who knows where these gloves have been?<br> --<b>Carlin on evasive language:</b> Just to demonstrate how far using euphemisms in language has gone, some psychologists are now actually referring to ugly people as those with "severe appearance deficits." Hey, Doctor. How's that for "denial"?<br> --<b>Carlin on politics:</b> No self-respecting politician would ever admit to working in the government. They prefer to think of themselves "serving the nation." To help visualize the service they provide the country, you may wish to picture the things that take place on a stud farm.  <P>The thinking person's comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin puts voice to issues that capture the modern imagination. For instance, why are there Ten Commandments? Are UFOs real? What will the future really be like? This brand-new collection tackles all that and more.  <P>In <i>When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?</i> Carlin's razor-sharp observations demolish everyday values and leave you laughing out loud -- delivering exactly what his countless fans have been waiting for.</span>

                    <span>I love Carlin's humor, but it does not translate well in print. Some of the passages in this book are hilarious, but then there are just as many bizarre bits that seem to exist just to fill space. One bit is about an uncle telling his nephew to go to sleep while reminding the boy about previous acts of violence the uncle has committed in the boy's presence. This isn't satire, nor is it humor in any way. It's just foolish. Carlin is a comedic genius, one of the few truly great minds that expose the underbelly of every aspect of America, but parts of this book read like the man has taken a serious blow to the head. I gave this book three stars because Carlin's usual hilarious barbs about American life are always worth the price of admission. However, I couldn't finish reading the book, due to the alarming amount of pabulum the reader is forced to wade through to get to the good parts.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The reaction to this book on the part of many reviewers only proves George Carlin's point:  That we as a society have become too sensitive, intolerant, and politically correct.  Yes, much of this book is stinging, biting--even morbid--but Carlin's wit and wonderful writing ability thoroughly entertain through the pages of WHEN WILL JESUS BRING THE PORK CHOPS?
<br />
<br />Here we have Carlin at his absolute curmudgeonly, disrespectful best.  Nothing--and I mean nothing--is sacred in this book, as Carlin launches attacks, observations, and rants over everything from the government, to religion, to politics and politicians, to entertainment, to our diet, our lifestyles, our collective insecurity as a culture--you name it.  And most of it is funny, some of it distasteful. . .and then some of it so off-the-wall I was wondering if the author had lapsed into another state of consciousness (and not from this world).
<br />
<br />By far my most enjoyable portions of the book had to do with Carlin's discussion of all the endless euphemisms invented to take the bluntness out of life and make us all feel better about ourselves.  For instance, we no longer have "poor people," we have the "economically disadvantaged."  How nice.  A nursing home is now an "assisted living center."  Even funeral homes have become "death-care centers."  Over and over, Carlin points out the countless euphemisms we have adopted to sanitize and plunder our language--and it's funny and sad at the same time.
<br />
<br />But relax, my friends.  This is all satire.  Carlin doesn't mean this stuff.  Or does he?
<br />--D. Mikels</span>

                    <span>Carlin is like a xxx version of Seinfeld. The observations are just as astute yet tend to have more swears and references to body parts. He couldn't be any funnier. This book is similar to his previous "Brain Droppings" in that he goes on rant after rant about what's wrong with the world. And be damned if he isn't on the mark 99/100 times. This book is primarily with the politically correct euphemisms that our culture is plagued with. They are not old they are elderly. They are not stewardesses, they are flight attendants. It is not a fart it is a spontaneous expulsion of unnecessary methane surplus... And so forth. Basically showing that political correctness always involves saying more words than are necessary to convey the point - Perhaps that is why politicians are so Politically correct? If you hate the new "softer" more caring world we live in this book is for you. There are Jabs at the Right and the Left (More at the Right) but Carlin is equally poignant when it comes to addressing how ridiculous America has become.
<br />Buy this book and enjoy Carlin's take on "a rose by any other name..."

                    <span>A surprizingly tiresome and unfunny book that is far more annoying and irritating than it is amusing or thought provoking from someone I regard as one of the great comedians and satirists of our time. Don't misunderstand me, I like George Carlin, always have and still do. But the only reason this saw the light of day is because the author happens to be famous. If this was written by an unknown no publisher in the world would have released it. If you don't believe me, or any of the other negative reviews here, do yourself a favor. Go to a book store and browse through this waste of paper and see if there is anything, anything at all that makes you smile or stop and think.
<br />I am someone who reads constantly and I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read. And no, I am not a right wing religious nut.</span>

                    <span>If you are a fan of George Carlin, you will not be dissapointed with his latest effort. While it contains material that you might have heard in various stand-up specials, much of it I had yet to come across. Even the recycled stuff was amusing to see in print. While many are offended by his frank approach to everyday situations, it is exactly what makes him so damn funny. He says all the things that humans may think, but would never have the guts to say. Half the book will make you giggle, half will make you think, but all of it is entertaining and is highly recommended to those of you who get his brand of black/cynical humor. I had two problems with the book: 1. it's huge leading (space between lines) stretches the text over many more pages than was necessary. And 2. it left me wondering: When WILL Jesus bring the pork chops? </span>
