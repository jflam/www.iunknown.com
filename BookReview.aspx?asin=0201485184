                <span id="Label1">Written for those C/C++ developers who want to deepen their programming knowledge, <I>Essential C++</I> provides a short, effective tutorial to some of the most important features of the C++ language, including lessons on generic programming and templates.<p> Compression is the key in this admirably concise text. <p>The author explains C++ from the very beginning with basic syntax and language features and always uses some of the best features of today's Standard C++. Perhaps the best thing here is the integration of "generic programming" (meaning the STL library of reusable templates and algorithms for data collections like vectors, linked lists, and maps, which are built into any current C++ compiler). <p> By focusing on these key features, this tutorial demonstrates C++ in an up-to-the-minute style. (These "advanced" features can help simplify C++ programming from the very beginning.) This tutorial moves quickly, and by the end of the book, the author covers the basics of successful object-oriented design with C++ classes, generic programming, templates, and exception handling. Short examples are the rule here, and each chapter includes exercises for self-study (with solutions provided at the end of the book).<p> C++ is a very rich and very complicated programming language. <I>Essential C++</I> cuts to the chase and gives the working programmer a tour of the latest and greatest language features in a compact format. As a quick-start guide to today's C++, this title complements the author's much more massive tutorial, <I>C++ Primer</I>. For anyone who knows a little C/C++ and wants to learn more, especially the newest features of Standard C++, this book certainly deserves a closer look. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: C++ fundamentals, data types and arrays, pointers, flow control, functions, generic programming and STL, generic algorithms, classes, constructors and destructors, polymorphism and inheritance, abstract classes, runtime type identification, templates and template functions, exception handling.</span>

                    <span>Finally we have a short, concise introduction to C++. As Stan himself mentioned, it follows the "Learning Perl" approach. Thus this book is not meant to be an exhaustive treatise of the language, but should give a working programmer a chance to start using this complex language. It takes the Perl approach in saying: use as much as you feel comfortable with to start, and as your knowledge progresses expend on your technique. I have seen some complains about number of errors in this book. For an errata please go to http://www.develop.com/hp/slip/Errata_1st.pdf. Also http://www.develop.com/hp/slip/windows.zip contains the source code for this book. In short (literally) we have a great book, which does a great job introducing C++ and at the same time, it is small enough to be carried around. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>With the 2 authoritative textbooks of C++ are ~1200 pages and ~1100 pages (the one by Lippman and Stroustrup, respectively), it's scary and discouraging for anyone who thinks of starting to learn C++. Moreover, as a professional developer who want some quick start to refresh my somewhat rusted memory of the language, I found it hard to flip over the 2 thick textbooks mentioned above.<P>I went through "Essential C++" and in a short time, refreshed and considated key concepts of the language. For example, the chapter about exception handling gave me a quick and sufficient overview about concepts and syntax. Then when I read the book by Stroustrup, I caught up quicker and easier.<P>However, this book will not serve as the one and only book in a professional or student's bookshelf. One will need one or both of the textbooks mentioned above to have more involving discussion.<P>As long as we don't intend to use the book as a quick and dirty "Teach yourself C++ in 7 days", the book serves it purpose as a concise priming and refreshing text.</span>

                    <span>As another reviewer mentioned, Lippman's _Essential C++_ is influenced by the approach taken in _Learning Perl_ (Schwartz). <P>_Essential C++_ isn't quite a slow, measured introduction to C++ that gradually ramps up from step zero. Instead, this book is most useful for someone who already has moderate to good experience in another OOP language such as Java. Lippman starts laying on the essentials of C++ right away: a (very) quick overview of C/C++ syntax, templates, introductory file I/O, pointer math, iterators, STL containers...<P>I started reading _Essential C++_ as an experienced C programmer who'd been doing Java for the past few years and needed a intro/refresher to C++, and I found this book to be very useful in learning the patterns in C++ that correspond to OO mechanisms in Java. (I'm a Java hack used to the Collection API, so the chapter on STL containers quite adequately answered the "what do I do for a HashMap?" question that popped up.)<P>This certainly isn't a comprehensive C++ reference, and novices to programming are most likely not well served by this book, but I think _Essential C++_ is a great way for the experienced OOPer (but maybe not C++ guru) to dive in at the middling depth part of the C++ pool and start picking up the important idioms of the language in a short number of pages.<P>Concise but in-depth. Thirty four bucks well-spent.</span>

                    <span>This isn't greatest book to *learn* C++. I bought it largely on the strength of the other reviews and my experiences coding successfully in other languages but (e.g., perl, python, java, php, shell scripts, etc.). My experience with this book (even in comparison to other books I'e browsed on C/C++), it that it is written to be useful more for someone who already knows C++ or is a dedicated C programmer and wants to pick up C++. <P>A great author usually writes in such a way as to not be misunderstood, but I found myself hae to reread passages frequently to answer questions which went unaddressed. Some typos were also evident, even in critical places--e.g., when he introduces references and relates them to pointers (page 46). At other times he'll introduce concepts without much expalanation at all. For example, the keyword extern shows up in the sample answer to problem 2.1 without being inroduced yet. The eventual discussion of extern on 64 is only useful if you already know what it means. He also likes to inject new concepts or syntax in the main text and footnote them with comments like "I'm certainly not going to explain this guy!" on page 33, referring you instead to some other book if you happen to have it nearby. Maybe this won't appear in subsequent editions. If you already have significant C/C++ experience, then you can esily oerlook these matters; but, if you are just trying to learn C++ (especially without a dedicated C background), then the compact nature of this exposition will be a two-edged sword.<P>That said, I did like the sample problems and answers. I wasn't a big fan of the subject matter for the running example (a game based on sequences), but it serves as a framework for exposition. If you already know C/C++ but want to brush up on you techniques, then this may be a good purchase. Otherwise, keep looking.</span>

                    <span>This book touches on important topics of C++. If you are a savvy C++ user and use it all the time, you won't get a whole lot out of it, but you can certainly use it as a refresher - a very quick refresher. If you are new to C++ or you have not used it in a while, this book will be very useful you as it is packed with lots of info.</span>
