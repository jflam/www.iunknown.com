                <span id="Label1">This beautifully written book offers instruction and inspiration to those who want to integrate altars into their daily lives. Author Denise Linn (<I>Sacred Space</I>, <I>Quest</I>, <I>Sacred Legacies</I>) helps readers become more conscious of what they are already unconsciously doing: creating altars in the kitchen corners, on shelves, and in other everyday spaces in their homes. "The urge to create sacred spaces is so deep in the human psyche that, even when there is no formalized intent to make an altar, we often create them subconsciously by the way we gather our photos on a piano, or by the way we carefully arrange objects on a desk or around a computer," Linn writes. <p> Linn suggests how to create altars with specific events or agendas in mind (i.e., holiday, vacation, or birthday altars filled with symbols of hope for the coming year). She also offers ideas for creating altars that honor new relationships, births, deaths, and other rites of passage. Exquisite color photographs make this a stunning resource for your home and spirit. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>I agree with Denise Linn's approach to the topics of altars and sacred space. I learned some things from this book, and it gave me some issues to think through in my own life. But I was disappointed with the book at the same time. I didn't enjoy the pictures, and was left with a hungry feeling at the end. I've read many books about altars, and this is the best one so far, but isn't the gem I had expected (wanted) it to be.</span>

                    <span>I've looked at every book I could get my hands on about the subject of Altars, and Denise Linn's book on the topic is, in my opinion, the best. Many of the other books have way too much text, but Denise Linn's book on Altars has lots of great pictures and just the right amount of descriptive text. She also has wonderful suggestions on various types of altar objects (with pictures), where to find different altar objects, imaginative altar layouts, etc. This is a *must have* book, and unfortunately, I'm sad to see that it is currently out of print. So if you can find a used one, grab it ! ! You won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I have arranged various collected objects on a shelf for some time now and did not realize that this was actually an alter! This book has helped me reorganize my beloved and sacred objects into my very personal little space with the appropriate intent. Thank you to Ms. Linn for this wonderful book. I'm so happy that I purchased my copy last year as it is now out of print (which I don't understand since it was only published in 1999). If you can get your hands on a copy please cherish it.</span>

                    <span>If you practise Amerindian spirituality, Buddhism, Christianity, etc as your spiritual path; you wil find ways to set up an altar in your home.<P>My only minor nitpick is that in the Medicine Wheel layouts on pages 56-61. Ms Linn places the elements in the wrong directions IMHO.</span>

                    <span>This book just hit me at the right place and time. My entire life has been in transition for the past two years and I continue to watch and wait for my new direction to emerge. <P>Denise Linn has given me a tool to concretize the important events and processes that are SIGNS for me to follow along the way.<P>Her altars are a wonderfully conrete way to live intentionally and consciously.<P>In these times of great personal and global spiritual change, it is good to have personal signposts to divine the journey. <P>I have shared the book with friends who think equally high of it for similar reasons.<P>It provides the opportunity for joyful reflection on the great and small events which may otherwise pass by without their due respect.</span>
