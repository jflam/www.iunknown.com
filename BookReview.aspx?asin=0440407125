                <span id="Label1">Guess what -- Gary Paulsen was being kind to Brian. In <i>Guts</i>, Gary tells the real stories behind the Brian books, the stories of the adventures that inspired him to write Brian Robeson's story: working as an emergency volunteer; the death that inspired the pilot's death in <i>Hatchet</i>; plane crashes he has seen and near-misses of his own. He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, or how he met the moose with a sense of humor, and the moose who made it personal. There's a handy chapter on "Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition." Recipes included. Readers may wonder how Gary Paulsen survived to write all of his books -- well, it took guts.<br><br><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></span>

                    <span>Reviewer: The book about Gary Paulsen 's life and the true topries behind Hatchet. What ever had happened in Gary Paulsen's life that was full of interesting and dangerous things all went into one book called "Hatchet". Gary Paulsen has been through some tough times throughout his life, such as being in two plane crashes and being attacked by moose. He got coaught in a wind storm in the middle of winter on a lake in Alaska. He talks about his worse moose attacks as being in canoe and paddling down a river. What happened was a moose came up from the water, stepped on the canoe and flipped him right over. Another exciting attack to read about is when he was dog-sledding down a trail and a moose nearly killed him. Gary Paulsen in his book "Guts" tells ordinary people like us how to make food from grub that you can fin in the wilderness. He also talks about his hunting days and how he lives for hunting. He says "hunting is one of the biggest thrills in my life", That's all he ever used to do. Gary Paulsen also talked about how he was very hunrgy at points in his life where he would shoot red squirrels, rabbits, and deer. He would eat thier brains, hearts, and everything else except for the intestines. He would sometimes find dead grouse, rabbits, and deer lying against a tree frozen to death. He also found a man's body that had frozen to death. He said " it looked like he was cross country skiing, broke his leg and couldn't do anything or get help. The man ended up freezing to death. In the last chapter of the book, he talked about "the joys of cooking". Such as how to cook fish or meat stew, plank food, spit cooking, pit cooking, and hot water. All these can be useful to you if you ever find yourself out in the wilderness trying to survive by yourself.<P>What makes this so interesting and fun to read is how well its written. This book is great because it's very detailed. You can't put it down as you always want to know what's going to happen next. It also talks about you not so everyday kind of person. Gary Paulsen is very interesting, smart, and a talented person who tells a fantastic story about his life's adventures. There are exciting adventures in this book that people will never have the opportunity to experience. It's very interesting to hear about his life.<P>The one thing that doesn't really work about this book is IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH! I would be happier if it was longer because it was such a good book to read as well as fun to read.<P>The overall opinion is that this is a great novel that should be recommened to everyone who loves the outdoors or anyone who likes to hear or read about an interesting life. The reason this book is as good is because of how it keeps you wondering what's going to happen next or what was the out come of what had happened to him.</span>

                    <span>Anthony NeaceBook Review Final Draft <BR>1-30-026B<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Guts: The True Story Behind  Delacorte Press, 2001, 148 PP,... Hatchet and the Brian Books.ISBN: 0-385-32650-5<BR>Gary Paulsen<BR>BOOK REVIEW<P>Ever been attacked by a deer, or a moose? Well, Gary Paulsen has, and in Guts, Gary Paulsen talks about how he got the idea for Hatchet and the Brian Books. He tells about how he has spent a good portion of his life roughing it out in the woods and in the snow-covered regions of Alaska.<BR>Also in guts, there are many violent or not so violent scenarios that the author has experienced that played a role in the books. For example, one of them might be moose attacks.<BR>I though Gary Paulsen's experiences in the book were very interesting, how it inspired a major part of the story and all. I enjoyed reading this book; the stories in it were very interesting. The areas of the stories were mostly in woods, parks, or lowly populated areas. <BR>One story in guts tells how Gary Paulsen witnessed a child being killed by a deer. A 4-year-old child was giving a deer a piece of candy. His mother asked him to hold the candy away from the dear for a minute to get a good picture. This angered the deer, and he stomped his hoofs into the boy's chest. The impact of the attack was great; the child was killed in an instant. Everyone around looked at the deer, now in an angry rage. Not too far away, there was a sign that said do not feed the deer.<BR>I highly recommend this book for people 10 and up, who are interested in stories involving the woods, attacks, and even cooking methods.<BR> I rate this book a 9 out of 10. It has interesting stories, and he explains why these helped him in the making of the Brian books.<BR>Other books Gary Paulson has written include Alida's Song, the beet fields, and the boy who owned the school, the foxman, dogsong, and many others...</span>

                    <span>Garry Paulsen s book Guts is an excellent book and it is the book I have been reading. You are sure to like this book if you like adventurous and informational stories.<BR>This book reminds me of Hatchet and Stone Fox. It reminds me of Hatchet because Garry Paulsen got stuck in the woods like Brian did. It is somewhat like Stone Fox because in Stone Fox they have sled dog races. In Guts Garry has sled dogs, but he doesn't race.<BR>In Guts Garry is always in the wilderness.<BR>If you haven't read this book I personally recommend it. <P> By: Jacob Hartle</span>

                    <span>Ever since Gary Paulsen was young, he has had a lot of experiences with nature, ranging from crashing in a plane, to bringing home a deer easily twice the size of himself. He has had a love for nature, as well as a respect for nature. He learned at a fairly young age the ways of the woods. He learned how to read his surroundings, how to sneak up on animals, etc. All of his past experiences, such as cooking with primitive tools and eating eyeballs and guts, were valuable life lessons. All of these things he incorporated into Hatchet and all of the "Brian" books (The River, Brian's Winter, and Brian's Return). Guts is a book that tells all of these past accounts in great detail. It also explains the significance of them, and what lessons he learned from them. It then tells the reader what part of the experiences were embodied into the "Brian" books.<P> I greatly enjoyed this novel because it is a true story about true events that happened in Gary Paulsen's life. Before I read Guts, I had no idea that Hatchet or any of the "Brian" books were factual or were based on actual experiences. It is interesting how the novel gives readers tips and recipes (such as how to make a birch-bark pot using birch-bark and pine pitch, and how to make water boil in the birch-bark pot using heated bits of granite) that Paulsen has used in his adventures. I especially like how he describes the events, making you feel like you are right there with him. I completely enjoy Paulsen's style of writing. I hope this novel gives you a deeper, more through understanding of the novel Hatchet and all of the rest of the "Brain books", just as it did me.</span>
