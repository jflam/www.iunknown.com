                    <span>When  Lil Wayne proclaimed he needed a hoodrat chick in one of his songs a few years ago, he was rapping about Unique, Nina, and Anyeh.  These names represent the titles of the three stories in this anthology.  I commend authors Nikki Turner, Chunichi and Roy Glenn for their candid depiction of life in the ghetto fabulous streets.  These stories are a new soap opera ala urban style. Revenge is the major theme throughout all three tales.
<br />
<br />The coarse and cool style of the authors is reminiscent of Donald Goines, the king of gangster tales from the hood.  These new authors spin dramatic violent gritty glimpses of how drugs, sex, greed, and crime are as common as week day rush hour for the gainfully employed citizens.
<br />
<br />Despite the brutal acquaintances and constant struggle to survive Virginia's hoods, the girls find time to love their men. You will need to read each story to discover whether their men are worthy of love; or even if the girls are capable of committing and loving beyond lust and gold digging.
<br />
<br />I found each tale to be fast-paced, disturbing, and absorbing enough to digest the entire book within a day.
<br />The authors blend together in a hip- hop- rhythm- writing style which flows together  like a good concert.  Each  writer's voice  has the same beat, giving the reader a comfort zone between stories, almost as if one writer had penned all three treats.  
<br />
<br />These talented three have marked their territory in the urban genre and I look forward to reading more from them. I must point out that Roy Glenn's Nina, ended by paving the way for a complete novel in which to finish her drama. The tales of Anyeh and Unique are complete, but of course the authors could always do readers a favor and pen more escapades involving these characters or their crew.

                    <span>I had been seeing this book for a while and finally decided to purchase it. It is broken down into three short stories with an "extra" shorter story by publisher and author Carl Weber. Nikki Turners 'Unique'is the first and best out of the three. Unique was definitely a charactar that could have had her own book. Roy Glenn was next on the scene with 'Nina'. This story was okay, but did not hold much weight coming after Nikki's story. Finally we have Chunichi's 'Anyeh'. I like the premise of the story, however it was not executed strongly enough. I have heard great things about her full length novel 'A Gangta's Girl', and intend to read that sometime in the near future. Carl Weber treated readers to a very short erotic story at the end of the book. I am not used to reading that kind of story from Carl and it sort of shocked me in a way - it was very 'Zane-like'. I am looking forward to reading his newly released 'The Preachers Son'.</span>

                    <span>Girls From Da Hood welcomed me into the lives of Unique, Nina, and Anyeh. Each author created vivid images with the stroke of their pens that helped me see, as well as hear their stories. All three are talented writers, however, I want to give a standing ovation to Roy Glenn for a job well done on his walk on the female wild side. Roy... you've got a fan for life!</span>
