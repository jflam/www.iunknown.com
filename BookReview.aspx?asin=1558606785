                    <span>Three points:
<br />
<br />1. Anyone that buys this book with the understanding that they will learn how to project manage should not be in Project Management. One of the best is "The Portable MBA in Project Management" by Eric Verzuh.
<br />
<br />2. I can't really add more to the many reviews below giving high ratings to this book. However, I will suggest this. Even if after reading the reviews listed below, you still find yourself not sure if this book is worth it, then "look inside the book" and the table of contents. If that doesn't sell you, then I think you're in the wrong industry. 
<br />
<br />3. This book is a must have for any project manager of commercial web development who wants to survive in a most competitive industry.</span>

                    <span>It has been about four years since this book's last edition came out, and it continues to top the list of Web Project Management references, and with reason for it. Its proven methodology provides a solid framework that you can relate to once and again, with confidence and permanently reminding of potential pitfalls and obstacles. In short, Friedlein's book provides the closest thing to a recipe for success with managing web projects: of course, you can always put in a little too much salt yourself, can't you? ;)</span>

                    <span>Intro<br>"There is no one book that is best for every person. There couldn't be one. People are too different in the way they learn, in what they already know, in what they need, in what they want, and in what kind of effort they are willing to make." Bjarne Stroustrup (The creator of the C++ programming language.)<br>I always try to remember this whenever I have to judge a writing effort. <br>Whom is this book for?<br>This book is for anybody interested in managing a web project or being part of a well managed one. (Need to be more specific read my conclusion?)<br>What does this Book offer?<br>The book seems to offer tips more than any thing else, some guidelines about the roles of personals in a web team, a "Web project method", and a case study. <br>The part regarding web teams seems to be good and gives a lot of insight.<br>The case study is full of tips.<br>The method, (Here where my good feeling change) a high level view, full with tips but no real details, never the less seems to be good.<br>What I liked?<br>This book is very well written, tips every where (even in the acknowledgments), the graphics are nice, and is good for the right people.<br>What I didn't?<br>If you didn't, go read the Stroustrup quote I wrote in order not to miss understand me, the book didn't help me a lot, I m a web developer searching for an all around web process to follow in my projects, and this book simply doesn't offer. The writers seem to ignore that there are software systems behind those web sites. More details wouldn't have harmed.<br>Conclusion<br>I feel that the most people that would benefit reading this book are already practicing web project managers.</span>

                    <span>I could not be more impressed!  My dog-eared, highlighted, underlined copy of this awesome roadmap to managing major web projects goes everywhere with me.  The downloadable project plan from the author's website served as a good starting point for me to build a very usable project management outline.  My level of experience in both project management and web development is mid level, and the book has given me the tools to manage through a fortune500 website relaunch, as well as food for thought on how to optimize all components of my site.  It's not a technical book, it's a very detailed guide for project managers to manage launching a site, from planning to content development to technical specifications to launch.  It's ideal for business (read marketing) sponsors who have been agitating for a redesign for years who suddenly get their budget minus the project manager to keep their heads above water.  Definitely recommend for when you're tossed into that situation!</span>
