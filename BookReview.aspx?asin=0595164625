                <span id="Label1">Every grandfather has a tale and this is the tale of Georg Frick, a German sniper for the German Army during World War II. Georg Frick is an old man now, but in 1937 the German Army drafted him.</p>   <p><I><b>Grandfather&#8217;s Tale</b></I> is the story of Georg&#8217;s transformation from reluctant new soldier into a master sniper. Georg fought in dozens of battles in several countries, including Poland, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Crete, Italy and Germany. After proving himself to be an exceptional sniper, he joined a special team of German paratroopers. This group of expert soldiers was parachuted into Eben Emael, the strongest single fortress in the world!</p>   <p>Georg's story is one of adventure and survival under extreme circumstances, including the brutal Soviet winter, and the final battle, the Battle of Berlin. Join Georg as he recounts his harrowing experiences to his grandson, in hopes that he may learn the lessons of war, and not repeat them.</p>   <p><I><b>Grandfather's Tale</b></I> is an action-packed journey through the entirety of the Word War II. German weapons, tactics and strategy on a platoon level are explained with meticulous detail. Several battles, including the Battle of the Bulge and the Invasion of Crete are told from a German perspective.</p>  <p>"Erenberger's story is fast-paced, his descriptions of the conditions a sniper must undergo through in each engagement were unforgettable...This book is strongly recommended for all who want to know what 'the big war' was all about in the eyes of a German sniper."&#8212;Capt. M.R. Doehrmann, USMC</p></span>

                    <span>If you want to see what the war was like for a front line soldier on the German side, read this book. It begins in the near future, when the main character is an old man. He hasn't ever told anyone what happened to him during the war. When his grandson finds a box of German medals in an old cigar box up in the attic, he decides to tell him the story. <BR>From here, the book goes to 1937. Jeorg, the main character is conscripted into the German army. Details of training, swearing allegience to Hitler, the equipment he is issued, etc. are given in great detail. <BR>After that the story goes to the invasions of Poland, Western Europe, Crete, and the Soviet Union. When Germany goes on the defensive, the main character fights in Italy, France, and finally (a very climactic) the battle of Berlin.</span>

                    <span>I have to admit that when I recently purchased this book from Amazon I did not realize it was a historical novel! Nevertheless, this did not detract from a wonderful story of a young Germans'odyssey through the whole length of WW II. Actually, it begins in Oregon in present day with the aging German telling his personal war story to his grandson - something he has told no one in over 50 years since the war ended. Jeorg, the main character, is conscripted into the Wehrmacht in 1937 and due to his marksmanship is trained as a sniper. We then follow Jeorg through the occupation of the Sudetenland,and then to the invasion of Poland. Descriptions of combat actions are excellent as Jeorg gains prowess as a sniper with many kills and many from long, long range. Advanced sniper techniques are discussed at length. He next joins the Fallschirmjaeger and is involved in the daring capture of the Belgian fortress Eben Emael. From there, he jumps into Crete during its' aerial invasion, the description of action here shows a lot of research by the author. The slow, downhill slide begins from here with Jeorg being involved in the Eastern campaign for 2 years, then Anzio, the west, and finally the Battle of Berlin. As you can deduce, Jeorgs' journey through the war covers nearly every major action of Nazi Germany. A word on that : Jeorg is not as a bloodthirsty, brutal Nazi, but rather as a patriotic young German doing what his country has asked of him. Historically, there are a few minor inaccuracies, but nothing that detracts from the action filled story. The author goes to great pains to describe the equipment used by the soldiers and the tactics used by them at mainly the platoon or squad level. Though it is a work of fiction, I think it compares well to recent memoirs published by common landsers. The book is very entertaining and is a must read for persons interested in this genre. Somewhat ironically, with the advancing age of WW II veterans, soon this is all we will have left to illustrate this cataclymic era in history.</span>

                    <span>I'd just like to say that this book is not only educational but it's also very entertaining. The closest thing I can liken it to is the book Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard. Both books are fast paced and filled with action. There is also a lot of information about weapons and their use during the conflict.</span>

                    <span>This is a book which not only shows the war from a completely new perspective, but it also dispels many of the myths about the war. These include the Polish Army, which is depicted in nearly every history book as a bunch of cavalry-charging fools, as a modern army which had tanks, artillery, and aircraft. That is much closer to reality than waves of horse-riding soldiers being mowed down in waves of machinegun fire, which is how they are normally depicted. Another myth shattered in this book is that the Russian winter was chiefly responsible for stopping the Germans in their tracks. It seems that rain played just as large, if not larger a role, as German tanks were bogged down in the mud for two months during their crucial push to Moscow. <BR>Finally, and most importantly, is the revolutionary point of view that the typical German soldier was not a monster but...a conscript who had no choice in whether they fought whatsoever. The main character, who is named Georg, starts as a baker, and eventually becomes a super-soldier. Yes he does rack up an incredible number of kills, but I have heard of German snipers being killed toward the end of the war who had over 500 kills recoreded in their personal books (and most of them only recorded important kills, such as enemy snipers and officers. Their actual kill counts were probably much much higher than that.). The entire thing is so believable that you feel like you're right there, rolling along with the blitzkrieg. It is an amazing experience which I highly recommend.</span>
