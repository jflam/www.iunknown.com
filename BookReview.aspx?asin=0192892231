                    <span>The Foundations of Buddhism presents an introduction to Buddhism as it really is, as seen through the eyes of millions of its Asian followers, and not the cleaned-up atheistic Buddhism of latter-day "Western" converts.  One reviewer thought that this book was a bad introduction to Buddhism simply because the author repeated the ancient Buddhist story of the Hindu gods paying homage to the Buddha at his birth! This merely reflects a largely "Western" bias.  Belief in the existence of gods is not anathema to the so-called "real" or "original" teachings of the Buddha.  Even Theravada Buddhism, the branch of Buddhism that is regarded as adhering most closely to the Buddha's original teachings, do not disclaim the existence of the Hindu gods.  According to the Pali scriptures, the Buddha himself simply regarded them as irrelevant to mankind's salvation.  Gods, like us, are caught in the web of samsara.  They may occupy an exalted place in the current scheme of things, but they too will ultimately die (admittedly after a very long time) and be reborn (possibly on a lower plane of existence based on the law of karma, in accordance with their previous conduct), and die and be reborn, again and again.  Thus, it is useless for mankind to blindly worship the gods in hopes of attaining salvation.  Salvation in the form of Nirvana can only come from within - through our own renunciation of worldly desires.  That is the main Buddhist message - Buddhism is simply not an atheistic philosophy that dismisses the existence of gods or other spiritual beings, contrary to what some "Westerners" seem to imply.  In Mahayana Buddhism and to an even greater extent in Vajrayana Buddhism, spiritual beings of all sorts occupy virtually all spheres of existence.  Buddhism is anything but atheistic.  Just ask any Buddhist living in Asia.</span>

                    <span>Having studied Buddhism privately and academically for over 20 years I usually consider introductory works not worth the bother. When I saw the outraged comments from the one-star reviewer below, however, I thought that this could be an interesting work. As another stated, most presentations of Buddhism that are made for Westerners are usually filtered to some extent, particularly older ones that are taking the Buddhism-is-the-secular-religion-for-us-grown-up-Westerners routine. Unlike Mr. Martin, I own and have bothered to read many of the early Buddhist writings, and they are chock full of the kind of things he claims are not part of Buddhism. The author of this book takes it all on the chin and doesn't let it faze him a bit. He's more interested in telling about both the story and teachings of Buddhism as they really were and, at core, still are, rather than keeping Western devotees comfortable. <p>And what an introduction! Take all those 5 star reviews seriously. I was repeatedly impressed with the clarity of prose and vision Gethin demonstrates while explaining even some of the most difficult to grasp Buddhist philosophical concepts. Things that it took two hours for some of my teachers to communicate to the point that students actually understood are brilliantly exposited with delightful comprehension in just a few pages. It takes a real grasp of the field to pull this off, and Gethin does it over and over. Illuminating charts, penetrating text, and, thank goodness, a topical bibliography to mine for years...what more could you want? If you want to read a book that will leave you with a solid understanding of core, foundational, Buddhist concepts, instead of a fluffy semi-New Age ransacking of the tradition to pamper Western assumptions about the self and the cosmos, look no further. As soon as this is submitted, I am sending an email to the professor at the Buddhist college I attend to look at this work for inclusion in the texts for our introductory survey course. Peter Harvey's and Walpola Rahula's introductory works are both on the schedule already, along with a third that will go unnamed, which Gethin simply stomps into the dirt for value. "The Foundations of Buddhism" clearly belongs in such stellar company and hopefully this Fall will be benefiting students alongside them.</span>

                    <span>This book describes Buddhism, not as many Westerners assume it to be, but as it really was prior to the modern era.Most of us learn about Buddhism through Westernized versions which conceal those aspects not in accord with our own cultures dominant beliefs. Buddhists did believe in gods, thought it was not obligatory. The idea of an atheistic Buddhism is a Western construction. Much of what is written about Buddhism in English is designed to appeal to the lazy and so leaves out the philosohical parts which are extremely challenging but well worth the effort to understand.<br>This is not exactly an introduction because it includes the difficult parts but it is a way to learn actual Buddhism, not the pop forms introduced by Watts, Suzuki, Trungpa and many others. If you want to really know what Buddhism is about, read this book.The secton on Abhidharma, the central philosophy of Buddhism, is the best I have read.</span>

                    <span>This autor is writing about some other religion. Its the only explanation. Not one thing he says in the first 20 pages is factually correct. I stopped reading shortly after he says "The Gods gathered on the day the Buddha achieved enlightenment as if they knew something important was going to happen". All I could think was, "what gods?", because there are no gods in Buddhism. The very idea of a God or Gods goes against everything the Buddha ever taught.<p>The writing is dreadful. The author goes on and on giving dates as facts, only to turn around 2 sentences later and explain how those facts are disputed and probably wrong. He spent at least 5 pages talking about events 1500 years before Buddhism that had absolutely nothing to do with Buddhism itself.<p>I skimmed ahead and saw page after page after page listing date after date as if any of it was relevant, regardless of the Buddhas teaching about the poison arrow. If you know the Buddhas teaching of the poison arrow you will know what I mean. Those dates are irrelevant at best. The fact that there is no proof they are accurate is dangerous.<p>Do not buy this book. Buy "What the Buddha Taught" by Walpola Rahula. It's generally considered the standard introduction to Buddhism in the west.</span>

                    <span>My bookshelf of interesting Buddhist books is getting somewhat larger these days! <p>I have always found ISBN 0802130313, "What The Buddha Taught," by Walpola Sri Rahula, to be a reliable guide, along with "Handbook for Mankind," by Buddhadhasa.<p>I happily add this book to the shelf, perhaps with pride of place.  This is (for me) the first book about Buddhism which gives a satisfactory answer to the question I have always had about the doctrine of "anatta" (no-self), that is:<p>"If the self does not exist, then what gets reincarnated?"<p>The answer, and I may botch this so you should read the book, is basically that "anatta" denies the unchanging self, and reserves silence on the probably ill-formed question, "Does the self exist?"  Anatta also discourages people from worrying excessively about self-concepts.<p>But if you are a grown-up, and ask yourself if you are the "same you" as when you were three years old, you will find a link of dependent arising between that three-year-old self and your current self.  Actions and volitions which you have habitually done link the old self to the new one, and it is this link of dependent arising which functions during reincarnation.  The newly born self will not be the same as the old one, but it will be linked by this chain.<p>I'm not personally sold on the idea of reincarnation, but I do like to see these issues worked out in a satisfactory manner.<p>Highest recommendation.</span>
