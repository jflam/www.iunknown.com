                    <span>I have read 4 books on home networking and this is a great book. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone setting up a home network. It's got it all and written in a style that's educational, practical, and not all theory. You will be able to set up your home LAN in no time with this book. I also recommned the "Home Networking Survival Guide" by David Strom as a companion (not a substitute) to this book. Wolf has written a great book here among all that I have read on the subject.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because my roommate and I wanted to share an cable modem connection. I've tinkered with computers for quite some time, but was a little intimidated about networking. This book had very detailed info on how to set up a home network in Windows (I connected an XP and 98 machine), including IP address configuration, file and printer sharing info, as well as understanding how NAT and DHCP works. <P>For anyone who wants good step by step on setting up a home network, this is a solid book. Also had info on how to insert NIC cards, cabling etc. Overall, very good book, five stars.</span>

                    <span>If you have to pay someone to change your printer's ink cartridge, then this book is for you. Seriously. For someone like my dad for whom a computer is a nasty genie barely restrained by the lamp, then this book is perfect.<P>If you have any systems experience AT ALL, then you'll want something more advanced. This book is too long on banter and too short on technical information for my needs, which aren't great; I'm not buying this book because I want to earn an MCSE.<P>Still, I'll give Mr. Wolf four stars for writing something my dad could comprehend!</span>

                    <span>The best book I have seen for home networking. I've looked through a few (mainly borrowed from friends), and none had really gone far enough on broadband, Internet sharing and wireless networking (Wi-Fi and Home RF). This book has a chapter for each, and also goes in depth on Windows XP networking (as well as some of the older OS's). Also chapters on internet security, digital audio sharing, and other stuff. Don't waste your time with the other books on home networking.</span>
