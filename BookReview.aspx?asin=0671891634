                    <span>I have not read Peter Lynch's first book but read this one.  It's a great story of how Lynch turned Magellan into the largest mutual fund of that time.  Some of the stories of now great companies are also very interesting.  The problem is that I bought this book so I could "beat the street".  Well if I do it like Peter I will pick up the phone tommorrow on my lunch break and call the CFO of Intel to see how cash flow has been this quarter...or perhaps fly out to California next week to visit the Controller of some company to see if they are complying with SOX.  These things are great for the fund managers but not a small investor like myself.  Essentially the summary of what I got from this book is:  Buy stocks of good companies that analysts are not looking at or that everybody else is selling.  A good company will always come back around.  It was a great story though !!  Always remember: get this book at the library like I did and save your money for a share of Home Depot.</span>

                    <span>Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares").</span>

                    <span>I am very new at the investing game, and pretty much know what your average couch potato does...
<br />I found this book to be very interesting and easy to read.  Peter Lynch seems very down to earth and humorous and his tips are pretty basic and easy to follow. 
<br />Considering the topic (which I assumed would put me to sleep like the History Channel!) I was quite surprised when I found I couldn't put it down.  
<br />I would recommend it to anyone w/ a basic interest in investing.</span>

                    <span>I wrote this review in the hope that you'll avoid the mistake I made.
<br />
<br />I bought (and read) in reverse chronological order the first two books Mr. Peter Lynch wrote, "One Up On Wall Street" and "Beating The Street". I got "Beating The Street" before "One Up" because I have been misled by a favourable review of this book made by a well-known financial internet site (maybe they make money out of every book they help to sell?). 
<br />
<br />Imagine you have written an excellent book and you have sold one million copies of it. What would you do after that? Would your publisher push you to write another one? Wouldn't you write again to try and repeat the success?
<br />I think this is what happened to Mr. Lynch. He wrote "One Up On Wall Street", which is an excellent book indeed (I published a few weeks ago a review of this book, where I explain why I warmly recommend it) and he sold over one million copies of it.
<br />"Beating The Street" is, I presume, an attempt to profit from the success of the first book.
<br />Problem is, "One Up" is a masterpiece: it explains very well Mr. Lynch's proven investing philosophy and methods. If so, what else to publish in a later book?
<br />
<br />While "One Up" is a book that explains and recommends strategies, i.e. tells how to successfully pick winning stocks, "Beating The Street" is actually a book that picks stocks for you.
<br />Remember, this book has been published in 1993. I believe it is easy to understand that, after so many years, the then cheaply valued companies recommended by Mr. Lynch may be fairly valued, overvalued, no longer in business, or taken private by now.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, "Beating The Street" is now a poor and completely out of date book.
<br />
<br />Here's an excerpt (from page 206 - ISBN 0-671-89163-4):
<br />"I talked to Glacier (Bancorp) the day after Christmas. I'd come into my office in Boston wearing plaid pants and a sweatshirt. The building was empty except for me and the security guard.
<br />(...) whoever answered the phone at Glacier Bancorp in Kalispell told me they were having a retirement party for one of the officers, but they'd inform chairman Charles Mercord that I called. They must have dragged him out of the party, because a few minutes later Mercord called me back.
<br />Asking a president or a CEO about a company's earnings is a ticklish proposition. You're not going to get anywhere by blurting out, 'What are you going to earn next year?' First you have to establish rapport. We chatted about the mountains.(...)
<br />My only worry was that Glacier may have overpaid for its acquisition, a topic I approached obliquely. 'I assume you had to pay over book value for this,' I said, inviting Glacier's president to admit the worst. But no, Glacier hadn't overpaid.
<br />(...) I never hang up on a source without asking: what other companies do you most admire? (...) I've found many good stocks this way."
<br />
<br />Well, apart that the well-known SEC-enforced "Regulation Full Disclosure" (Reg FD - not existent at the time Mr. Lynch wrote his book) now forbids analysts to talk privately about business matters with companies' officials, I'm not sure any of you would be able to pick up the telephone and have a nice conversation the day after Christmas with any CEOs, wouldn't you?
<br />I estimated that, if every buyer of those one million copies "One Up" sold were to call Glacier Bancorp, the CEO would have to spend over nine years talking to the telephone (one million 5-minutes calls, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year...).
<br />
<br />Save your money and get "One Up On Wall Street" instead.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the "must read" books for anyone wanting to invest well, and gets 5 stars for that reason only.  It is by and about Lynch and his legendary carreer @ Fidelity's Magellan Fund, and the period Lynch knocked the cover off the ball hitting home run after home run for a long string of years. 
<br /> 
<br />How did he do it?  Well, several other reviews point out the difficulty of extracting Lynch's secret formula, and they rightly describe the lack of formulaic presentation.  If there was a fabulous book on Lynch instead of this autobiographical one, I might put it on the "must read" list instead.  There is not (yet, maybe Lowenstein will grace us with one?).  However, too many fail in investing by looking for instant-coffee recipies that any boob can implement from the couch.  If it was that simple, everyone would be rich.  Success takes work and in-depth understanding of some, probably simple, strategies that ordinary investors can learn.  In fact, investors who focus on fundamentals of the sort described by Lynch, & stay tuned out of the frenetic trading centers' "action," are likely to increase chances of success.  The real beauty of Lynch's book is the myriad of different strategies, one or a few of which each of us can learn and implement as our investing "sweet spot."
<br />
<br />Lynch covers a series of investment decisions in some detail.  The detail is not uniform from company to company, position to position, making comparison of his formula difficult between investments.  And he does not summarize his formula anywhere in the book.  This oversight (which may be intentional to more quickly drop the instant-coffee addicts) leaves it up to the reader to digest the material and extract the essential focus of the master.  I suggest a relaxed, 3 part method to do the extraction:
<br />1) read the whole book (its easy reading), then set it down for a week or so.
<br />2) read it a second time, pencil or highlighter in hand, and mark where you spot formulaic focus you can implement.
<br />3) read it again in 6 months or a year, and repeat #2.  This time around, with the aging of the first 2 readings, you will be surprised at how the formulae stand out.  You will "see" more of what Lynch describes, and take your understanding of the master's strategic vision to a new and satisfying level.  Not all examples will give the same level of insight to the master's strategies, so don't strain to make Lynch's magic stand out on every page.  It is really only about what you can see & replicate.  Even one good trick, well understood, will be worth the effort for your invesment results.  If you can find 2 or 3 good tricks, like I did, you are on your way to richer success.
<br />
<br />I have read this book at least 5 times (so far), and I get a firmer understanding of Lynch's myriad strategies each time.  As a master of the game, and with a mountainous pile of cash demanding a high yield, Lynch needed many strategies to keep out-distancing all the averages.  He did just that.  Although a cookbook would be easier to put into use, it probably wouldn't work as well, as it wouldn't require depth of understanding.  Patience is the key to implementing this important work.
<br />
<br />Beating the Street stands among others on the "must-read" list:
<br />~ The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham (ignore the mathematical formula, but savor the stuff on perspective & margin of safety; another book that should be re-read periodically),
<br />~ Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, Phil Fisher (ditto on the re-reading),
<br />~ Conservative Investors Sleep Well, also by Fisher; out of print so watch here on Amazon for a clean used copy,
<br />~ Buffett, the Making of an American Capitalist, Roger Lowenstein
<br />~ The essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America, Buffett & Cunningham (great compendium of Buffett's own analysis of corporate governance, accounting and other issues investors need to watch),
<br />~ When Genius Failed, the Rise & Fall of Long Term Capital Management, Roger Lowenstein.  This is the sort of post-mortem on investing mistakes that every investor needs to guard against, and all the more important because it was a cadre of smart guys who lost their butts,
<br />~ academic papers of Terrance Odean & Brad Barber, finance professors @ UC Berkeley & UC Davis, respectively, see their websites for links to papers about investor mistakes to avoid.
<br />Good Luck on the Street!</span>
