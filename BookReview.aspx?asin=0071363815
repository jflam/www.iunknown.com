                    <span>I really liked this book.  I thought the diagrams were well displayed.  I learned so much from reading this book.  Experience in the networking field will help you understand 3G networks.  This book has a lot of terminology.  This book has a lot of usefull diagrams.  Also this book has a lot of pictures.  A picture is worth a 1000 words.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn 3G wireless networks.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book gives an excellent overview at the 10,000 foot level of all the related technologies.  It's perfect for someone in either a Technical Manager or a Senior Manager role to understand the basic vibe of what these technologies are and how they work without getting bogged down into too much "bits and bytes" level detail.<p>I found the book to be a bit lacking on some dimensioning and planning details and methodologies though.<p>Overall, it's a good book to reference with.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very comprehensive tool for learning any aspect of wireless systems. It is an excellent reference source for vendors, operators, consultants, and anyone who is involved in the business and technology of today's wireless networks.</span>

                    <span>Its a pretty good book for those who are new to wireless and even those who'd like to learn more.  It covers 1G, 2G, 2.5G and 3G wireless networks and various air interfaces used and/or are proposed for these networks.  It gets over the ambiguities of various 3GPP releases and clearly describes each release (99, 2000-4, and 2000-5) and their associated network reference model.  There is also plenty of good description on various 2G radio access standards (AMPS, TMDA, CDMA, GSM, WCDMA, CDMA2000) and their associated network reference models. While it doesn't have in-depth coverage of any particular wireless topic, it attempts to give a broad overview on everything wireless and provides plenty of references for readers to follow up.</span>
