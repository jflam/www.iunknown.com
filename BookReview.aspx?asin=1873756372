                    <span>The author has wisely involved a number of other very experienced adventure travel riders in what has come to be regarded as perhaps the best of the very few books on the subject of international/adventure riding.  There are some faults, though, to which many similar travel guides are heir.  One is that circumstances change, and that what may have been correct or useful 3 or 4 years ago when the research or experience was current, are no longer valid. To address this, there is mention of websites which tend to stay more current than the once-written-now-obsolete paper books.   In general there is a good technical comparison of the relative values and utility of certain features and brand models, but there is also a detactable bias against some models which ironically are among the most commonly and successfully employed in international adventure riding. If your interests lie in the territory covered by this book, then by all means obtain a copy, bearing in mind that a great deal of independent research and thought is also in order. Think of this guide, and many others like it, as simply a point of departure for further study. If I had relied upon it as my principal data source before departing the US for Argentina on a motorcycle, I would have been woefully underprepared and misinformed.  </span>

                    <span>Very informative. 
<br />A must read for any motorcycle fan.
<br />
<br />Should have an appendix of interesting GPS waypoints that should not be missed.
<br />Anyway, this book is an excelent guide for adventure.

                    <span>Planning a trip around the world, or "just" down to Costa Rica. Then you'll want this excellent compendium chock-full of info on prepping, planning, and executing a two-wheel journey. Pack it in your panniers with Ted Simon's "Jupiter's Travels" and Chris Baker's "Mi Moto Fidel: Motorcycling Through Castro's Cuba." <p>"Mi Moto Fidel" is my favorite travelog about motorcycle adventures. This fascinating and sometimes hilarious, sometimes hair-raising story of a 7,000-mile journey justifiably won both the 2002 ?Travel Book of the Year? and the North American Travel Journalist Association?s Awards of Excellence ?Grand Prize.?</span>

                    <span>If you are even thinking about taking an extended trip by motorcycle, you MUST have this book.  It will become your Bible.  Great tips, details on bikes, equipment, trip planning, paperwork, do's and dont's, etc. + good travel stories.<p>This book is geared toward offroad travel and travel trough continents.  If you are riding from LA to Chicago than forget about this book.  If you are planning/dreaming of a trip to South America, Asia or other foreign place then buy it right now.<p>If you were not planning a trip before, you will after reading this.</span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of good pointers, especially if you have never travelled on a motorcycle before.  I have done quite a bit of traveling and was looking for help in foreign motorcycle travel.  I live in the USA and will be travelling south of the border so this book didn't offer much help.  It would be helpful if you were in Europe and planning to travel around Europe or into Africa by motorcycle.  For New Worlders, however, this book is quite lacking.  There are better books out there for travelling in Central and South America.</span>
