                    <span>Ms. Cohen's book fills a niche- there aren't many clearly written books available that include experiential exercises for parents struggling with this difficult issue. Raise Your Child's Social IQ provides parents with practical tools and provides a means for them to partner with their children. Thank you!</span>

                    <span>As a Grandparent of eight grandchildren, I have read Cathi Cohen's book with great interest and have recommended it to the parents of our grandchildren. It is a simple building block approach to acquiring social skills and self confidence in children who are struggling to be accepted and do not know why they they are meeting with failure. It is extremely beneficial to the parents who may be challenged in trying to help their youngsters meet with success. I only wish I had it available when I needed it.</span>

                    <span>Raise Your Child's Social IQ is a "must have in your back pocket" therapeutic cookbook for working with children presenting with social skill deficits. We use it regularly in our pediatric group psychological practice. You will find the book to be well-organized and logical in its presentation. Importantly, its easy for parents to understand and use along with your child's clinician in developing targeted treatment goals and implementing them in the child's daily life. Our typical approach is for the parents to use one of our copies for their work with the child at home. Together, clinician and parent(s) make a formiable therapeutic team. If you have or treat children with social skill problems and you don't have this book you have missed the boat on an excellent resource.</span>

                    <span>I am the mother of two very different children. This book contains logical and understandable guidelines that can be used for both of my children. While reading through the examples, I found myself saying "Yes, that's just like my daughter/son" and "that may not work with my daughter but would work with my son". The chapters are well written and easy to understand. Ms. Cohen has combined her experiences as a therapist and the reality of being a mother and placed them in a very valuable tool for parents. Thank you Ms. Cohen..</span>

                    <span>As the Practice Administrator for a group of pediatricians, this book is highly recommended to many of our patient's parents whose children are experiencing social skills issues. As one reads the extraordinarily well-conceived anecdotes describing specific problems/circumstances/behaviors, parents have told us that it is validating to them to have someone describe a situation that appears "just like my child" and wonderful to have a "tools book" that enables the parent(s) to proactively work with their child to overcome their child's social "obstacles" with the end result being an increase in self-esteem. The format of the book is very easy to understand and truly illustrates the concept of "building blocks" providing both parent and child with an effective and proactive guide to implementing a program that will assisst a parent in increasing their child's people skills.</span>
