                    <span>This is an extremely thorough, well-written book that covers web services from the ground up. Not tied to any one company's philosophy or implementation of web services standards, this book approaches the subject at a high level yet full of detail. Unlike most technical books, this books reads like a novel. I give it my highest recommendation for those of you that want to understand the underlying web services standards and framework.</span>

                    <span>I have been functioning in this web services world for the past one plus years. I go through various articles, engaged in real time web services projects etc. This book provides the reader all the in-sight into web services. Web Services is a buzzing word around the software world as a next generation of distributing computing. This well organized book covers all the realistic topics starts with what are web services, need and different business models including B2B, B2C scenarios. It also states how web services are different and advantageous from present technologies and the core web services technologies (XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI) the building blocks of web services. It discuss in detail about the implementation of web services in both .NET and Java. <BR>Absolutely, Web Services transfigure the software world, but it has yet to ripe out to use it in enterprise systems. Still web services are maturing. At present, web services are excellent for plain message transaction from one program/application to other. That is Web Services can be used in non-critical applications where security, reliability are not significant. One of the major concerns, we take notice of in Web Services is security. If there's one thing that has slowed the widespread acceptance and implementation of Web Services, it's their lack of security standards, reliability issues and Transaction Processing etc.<BR>I take pleasure in reading the Web services Security chapter. It explores all the security issues such as Basic security issues, SSL, XML Signature, XML Encryption, XKMS, SAML, XACML and WS-Security in a comprehensive manner. Appendices contain VisualBasic.NET and Java Live-code implementation of web services based applications. <P>Microsoft and IBM have produced a road map outlining the additional Web Services security specifications along with WS-security. This book explained Microsoft's GXA, a series of specifications, which address the various problems faced by the web services in depth along with .NET MyServices, and Mappoint.NET. The two things, I enjoy very much in this book are the employing of abundant case studies and the vast Internet and Web Resources. All the case studies provide the reader a realistic knowledge. The chapters of this book walk around a wide range of recommended reading lists. All these resources help one for further reading. <P>Written for IT managers, software developers and business professionals alike, this guide explains the business and technology of Web services.<P>"This Outstanding book arrived at the exact period, which provides all the details about the Web Services in Comprehensive, realistic and practical manner."</span>
