                    <span>John Fielder is one of the best photographers of this age.  Perhaps not as commonly know as a Tom Till or a Larry Ulrich, he centers the majority of his work in the backcountry of Colorado where he's hiked virtually every inch of terrain.<p>This is one of the most beautiful books on photography that I own and his images taught me more than his words.  He has some of the more typical landscape scenes that could be done by most competent professionals.  But where Fielder stands out the most are the pictures that truly look like a complex model of math and art.  He blends perfectly the elements of his trade.  Photography is as much a technical craft as it is an art.  To be great, you need both.  Fielder is a virtual Bach of photography where he punctuates his gorgeous style with obvious control of technique.<p>What sets him apart from most other photographers is his style.  Most of his images are not typical and clearly make use of simplicity, beautiful lines, hazy afternoons.  He doesn't rely on perfect buttermilk clouds to paint a photograph for him.  He uses the soft folds of a hill on a cloudy day or the sheer layers of a clear sunrise on a beach to make his pictures.  He doesn't need much to turn his world in a vivid piece of artwork captured precisely on his large format.<p>His writing style is very much like his photographs.  Simple and concise.  Though at times, I did wish he would explain some concepts a bit more in depth.  Mostly though, he uses his images as an example of what to do or what not to do.<p>He writes how he learned photography by taking pictures and then comparing them to the best (Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter).  His own photographs have set a precedent, a standard beyond many landscape photographers could even dream.  Take his advice and study the greats to develop an eye for the craft.  The technical aspect requires some learning but to be great like Fielder, follow in his footsteps until your own style emerges.<p>I also enjoyed his accounts of a day in the life of a landscape photographer.  To find those beautiful, untouched places, you have to be tough and be able to hike miles at altitude.  It's always great to have a personal touch to an educational book.  Nothing could be more mundane than a purely technical photography book especially when we all know that photographers are fairly opinionated and outspoken. <p>If you want a strictly technical book, invest in National Geographic's field guide.  But if you are looking for inspiration, for a chance to study a master in his prime, look to Fielder.  He will teach you in his images, in the subtle language of art and make the text on the page virtually unecessary.</span>

                    <span>This is a book that explains basic concepts of landscape photography -- rhythm, proportion, etc. -- in ways that will allow you to easily understand and use those concepts. You get clearly explained information about different types of cameras, filters, lighting, etc. and how they affect the outcome. This author capably explains the principle AND illustrates that principle with his own work, so whether you learn best from a tutorial or a definition, this book will help you. It is laid out in such a way that it is easy and pleasant to read, and the author uses plain language.  It includes some useful charts and diagrams. This book seems aimed somewhat more at beginners than advanced photographers. I've been shooting a while though and found my understanding of some concepts explained by his work. His photos may not be the best I've ever seen but they ARE quite good, certainly beyond the range of most beginners and adequate for illustrating the concepts. I collect Galen Rowell's books due to a great respect for who he was -- both in terms of his wilderness ethic and his phenomenal photographs -- but, as another reviewer mentions, his books are not nearly as easy to learn from. This author concentrates on teaching but includes enough of his own experience to make for an interesting and instructive read.</span>

                    <span>In comparison to Galen Rowell's books, the content is better organized and it is quite a good reference book for landscape photography.<br>If you have read any of Galen's books, you'll know that you literally have to mine for the relevant info in the midst of his philosophies and the accounts of his stories.<br>This one is closer to the idea of a how-to book and quite similar to John Shaw's style.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased this book on the advice from a fellow photographer that critiqued my work as an amatuer photographer.  He said that this book helped him personally in his photography.  I'm half way down with this book and find Fielder unappreciative of his ability.  I agree that he is a good photographer, but the way he explains his photos is annoying.  On a decent photo he will go into detail about the composition and how you eye flows across the picture.  Sorry, but some of the photos he describes are not as good as he thinks.  If you are looking for a "how-to" book, don't pick this one.  Try John Shaw's Nature photography and you will get your moneies worth.</span>

                    <span>It's always bothered me that another reviewer found fault with John's book, but I found none.  John explains everything you need to know to become a great photographer.  I was starting this career with little skill and the book dramatically improved every aspect of my work and I think it shows.  All my photos were taken using the principles from his book--and I'm still reading it years after I bought it.  I won't let anyone even borrow it since I refer to it so much.  Incredible photos and insights!  I can't afford his live seminars, but his book has gotten me a long way!</span>
