                    <span>I question the security background of any of those who read this book and gave it a good review. The author's approach security leaves huge gaps and what is covered is written in a simplistic form... probably because the author only understands a small amount of the topic she is writing about.<P>I question the author's own ability to secure an environment, and she should probably not be teaching others.</span>

                    <span>I am a CSS student with the College of North Atlantic, St.John's <BR>, Newfoundland. I think that Jan Tudor has put together the "manual" for security within the buisness structure. I am amazed at the debt and scope of this book as there is no stone unturned and information technology people would be at a loss not to read and understand just how security or the lack of it can make or break a buisness, large or small.A true work of art, thanks Jan.</span>

                    <span>This was a great reference to start an Information Security Architecture project. There are many guidelines, procedures and forms that take the guess work out of the administration of such a project. The book is great at keeping you on track with your security objectives. I have found that it is so easy with such large projects to lose sight of the objectives. Security is not only technical assessments of the network and operating components but also a combination of management and administration of personnel, policies and procedures and continuous application of pressure to meeting the security requirements of an organization. This book provides excellent value for the price.</span>

                    <span>I have worked with Jan with our security project & the company I work for has really benefited from the knowledge and expertise from Jan's book. In addition, we have used the structure she illustrates in "Information Security Architecture" for implementing our company's Security Project and it is well underway due to Jan's helpful contribution. I recommend this to anyone who will be working to lay the groundwork for Security purposes. This is a valuable piece of information - Great work Jan!</span>

                    <span>There is so much involved in implementing security effectively throughout an organization. Without detailed experience it is easy to get lost in the midst of it all. Jan Tudor's book provides an organized thought process to the tasks at hand when implementing security in an integrated approach. This book provides a good combination of management, administration and technical implementations to security. The checklists, templates and forms eliminate the need to start an ISA project from scratch. This book is highly recommended and practical if you are going to take on such a project.</span>
