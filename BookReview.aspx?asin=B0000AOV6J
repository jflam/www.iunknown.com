                    <span>This movie is pure goofy fun.  Great footage of surfers doing their thing in some of earth's most beautiful places.  The humor is so goofy and cheesy that you can't help laughing and cheering your way through the movie.  On a winter's night after playing all day in the snow, O'Connell and Weaver are the perfect guides to endless summer fun......</span>

                    <span>This is a great surfing film that shows the lives of surfers, both what they do and who they are. I highly recommend this flick for anyone who has ever surfed or thought about riding a wave. Once again Bruce Brown has out done himself. </span>

                    <span>This film is the epitome of surf films. Bruce Brown is the standard in  which anyone who makes a surf film should be measured to. Great Cinematogrophy, great camera angles, great sufers to make the main charachters. Robert "wingnut" Weaver, and Pat O'connel are a perfect pair to make someone want to go out, and brave the treacherous ocean for that rush of adrenaline, joy, and most of all an ear to ear smile. This film is just plain fun to watch over, and over. From Costa Rica, to Cloud Break, Surfing with Laird and the Boys, this is a must for any surf enthusiasts, and anyone that likes to laugh, listen to great music, and see beautiful images of aquamarine. Now for my one and only gripe about this DVD...WHERE THE HELL IS THE WIDESCREEN VERSION???????? WHERE THE HELL IS THE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND??? This DVD looks like it was printed by 12 year olds! These reasons were the only reasons I rated this DVD a 4 star venture. Had it been in Widescreen and 5.1 I would have rated it 10 stars!!!! The first thing you may notice when you purchase this DVD is it looks like a bootleg copy. The cover looks like your friend Jimmy made it on his home Pc. Pretty much a poor effort in post production here Monterey. You guys suck! Wheres Artisan when you need them???  Artisan PLEASE pick this up and make a widescreen version!!!!! Step Into Liquid is how a surfing film DVD should be released!!!! Kudos to Artisan!!!(Monterey take some tips)</span>
