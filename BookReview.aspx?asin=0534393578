If you need the solution's manual for Edition 5, order Dan Clegg's Student Solutions Manual for James Stewart's (Multivariable) Calculus (Thomson Publishing, 2003).</span>

                    <span>I thought the text wasn't too bad, but considering the material until about chapter 17 was quite easy, that is really not saying much. The book didn't give appropriate examples of all the different special cases of line and surface integrals, which made 17.3-17.7 quite difficult; I had to learn surface integrals elsewhere. This book wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't recommend it.</span>

                    <span>the chapter on vector calculus was confusing and the examples were ridiculous in that they didn't fully teach the concepts. if you want a real calculus book, try Anton. half of our class used Anton's Calculus to learn the material since the chapters are in the same order pretty much.</span>

                    <span>I don't spend $200.00 to "think it through" or to "think ahead several chapters."

                    <span>This book does a pretty terrible job of explaining anything. It seems to gloss over the theory very quickly, maybe assuming we already know it (in which case we would have no need for the book)!<p>It has a few examples, which are decent in that they illustrate the ideas but they are not enough in number nor in variety. While doing the problems in the book whenever I get stuck I often find that the book is of no help in helping me understand, either because the examples are too specific or more often than not because there is no explanation at all.<p>This book has a lot of great problems that I guess promote understanding (as someone else has mentioned), but it does nothing to help you solve them, and that's the major flaw of the book which is why I simply cannot give it more than 2 stars.</span>
