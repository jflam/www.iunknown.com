                <span id="Label1"> The purpose of this book is to help you learn how to manage your money to derive the maximum benefit from what you earn.  Mixing investment instruments and capital markets with the theoretical detail on evaluating investments and opportunities to satisfy risk-return objectives along with how investment practice and theory is influenced by globalization leaves readers with the mindset on investments to serve them well. The material is intended to be rigorous and empirical yet not overly quantitative.  We continue with unparalleled international coverage, newly rewritten and reorganized derivatives material to be more intuitive and clearer, three additional chapters on derivatives pricing for those who want more detail, rewritten material on multifactor models of risk and return, and new CFA problems for more practice on computations concerning investment decisions. To manage money and investments, one needs to learn about investment alternatives and develop a way of analyzing and thinking about investments that will be of benefit and allow a foundation as new tools and investment opportunities become available.  Reilly/Brown provide the best foundation, used extensively by professionals, organizations, and schools across the country.  A great source for those with both a theoretical and practical need for investment expertise. </span>

                    <span>I would have given Reilly's book a five (5) star if its explanation had been slightly simpler and there were key check figures / solutions for chapter exercises & problems at the back. The coverage on most topics in both "Investment" and "Portfolio" parts has been written in much depth supported by research from various well-known journals. I have 3 editions of this same book (1989, 1997 and 2001 - the one just before this edition) and each time Reilly has improved & updated it a great deal. This is the ONLY textbook which really examines the subject of PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT in detail (especially on bond & derivatives) unlike other texts which merely "introduce" the subject after covering the Investment Analysis part in some depth. Eventhough it is meant for those who have some knowledge of finance or basic investment, its comprehensiveness makes it a great reader for those who want to know more about the subject e.g advanced undergraduate in business. Excellent text for those pursuing MBA in Finance or CFA professional qualification but will require some asssitance in getting the problem figures checked. Overall, a fantastic piece of work; unfortunately not meant for self-study...</span>

                    <span>Whether encountered through an MBA equity analysis course or the CFA program, Investment Analysis will be an indispensable reference book for investment analysts, fund managers, and finance professionals for years to come. Although it is not an introductory finance text, it covers most of the basics. The book also delves on esoterica about derivatives, value investing, hydrid securities, and hedging. All in all, Investment Analysis is a good textbook that will be appreciated by academics, professionals and students alike.</span>

                    <span>As an introduction to traditional finance, this is a very good book. Most recent financial innovations that got a company like Enron into trouble are not covered, however. In addition, other off-balance sheet products that are financings or are fungible with bonds aren't covered. For instance, total return swaps and the exploding credit derivatives market are ignored, and that is a shortcoming in a book on portfolio theory and the capital markets. <P>Credit derivatives and total return swaps are used to round out and diversiry both equity and bond portfolios. Tavakoli has written an excellent book on these products: "Credit Derivatives" (Second Edition).</span>
