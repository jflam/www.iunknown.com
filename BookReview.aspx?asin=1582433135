                    <span>In answer to readers' questions about how Caroline Knapp died, she was diagnosed with advanced-stage lung cancer in the spring of 2001 and died shortly thereafter. During the final weeks of her life, she married her longtime companion whom she talks about in her writings, and left Lucille in his loving care.</span>

                    <span>(...)Knapp's willingness to thoroughly examine herself and her demons-- drinking, anorexia-- has provided many of us with a precious resource and lifeline in dealing with our own troubles. Her insights on her relationship with her parents, and her close bond to her dog, provide the reader with thoughtful reflections on the nature of human connections.</span>

                    <span>anything about HOW she died? I love this book and wish I had known her. Have found many references to her date of death but no mention of how. Anyone know? Thanks. Feel a bond as my middle name is Lucile...but I'm a cat person.</span>

                    <span>I love Caroline Knapp. I have read all of her books, including Drinking: A Love Story, despite not having any problems with alcohol. <BR>These essays are insightful, poignant, and they wonderfully express emotions that everyone can connect with. Caroline Knapp wrote with humor and seemed to invest her whole soul into all of her writing. <BR>I disagree with the reviewer who said that some of the lighter essays were out of place, each essay provided a broader look of the author and allowed me the connection of humor as well as other connecting on more serious levels. <BR>I especially liked Lucille vs Stumpy, Letter to Zoe and Speaking out for shyness.<BR>I believe that anyone who enjoys good writing, reflective thinking and has a sense of humor will enjoy these essays.</span>
