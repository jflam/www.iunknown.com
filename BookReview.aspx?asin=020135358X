                <span id="Label1">One of the best things about <I>Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web</I> is the seamless way the author incorporates terminology into her explanations. Elizabeth Castro, author of <I>HTML 4 for the World Wide Web</I>, understands the intermediate user: someone who would be bored by a beginner's guide, but isn't ready to step up to heavy-hitting programming texts either.<p> In <I>Perl and CGI</I>, she explains basic concepts--such as the difference between a compiled and an interpreted script--within the text, so there's no need to keep flipping back to the glossary. Readers should be familiar with HTML and comfortable with technical explanations, diagrams, and general vocabulary.<p> Anyone trying to get a grasp on something as complex and powerful as Perl will appreciate Castro's relatively straightforward technique. For example, in the first chapter, Castro explains some basic Perl concepts sensibly: that the <I>$</I> stands for the <I>s</I> in <I>scalar</I>; the <I>@</I> sign stands for the <I>a</I> in <I>array</I>; and that the <I>%</I> that labels a hash or associative array indicates two circles on each side of the slash as parts of a pair. This granular, logical way of building Perl knowledge will get new Perl users started. More experienced users will want to use this book as a workbook and refresher. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I></span>

                    <span>Clearly not in the same class as the HTML book. It's O.K. but will surely disappoint if you expect the same level of excellence.<P>It's not the numerous small errors mentioned by other reviewers (no worse than other computer books). It's the essential missing material that should have been in the book, which the author promised to post on the companion web sites but never did (precedence table, ASCII chart, index, etc. etc. etc.).<P>By the way, if the companion website at cookwood.com is an example of what people can learn from the HTML book--FORGET IT! Very boring, and the message board takes forever to come up on the screen. <P>Don't count on anything from the author, she's busy counting royalties somewhere in Spain--she's posted to the web site ONE time in the last THREE months.<P>There ARE a few useful tips in the book (mostly non-Perl items such as cookies, UNIX essentials, resources, etc.), so just buy the book (or skim it over a hot cup at Barnes and Noble), make a note of these items, and get a "visual" overview of Perl and CGI. Then return the book and buy "Learning Perl" by Randal Schwartz and Tom Christiansen.</span>

                    <span>I have read several other books in an attempt to learn Perl, but they were either too technical or too boring to even hold my interest. This book is the polar opposite. It is the first Perl manual I've read that actually explains Perl line by line, in a language that even an old dog novice like myself can understand. Instead of filling the pages with line after line of obscure Perl code without the slightest hint of explanation, the code here is explained beautifully. My questions were answered almost before they came to mind. That is why this book was so effective. <P>I was writing simple cgi's even before finishing the book. This afternoon, I wrote a cgi that takes input from a lengthy form, prints a confirmation/thank you html page to let the user know that their input was received, sends the parsed and formatted form data via email to the receiving party, and generates an include file that automatically updates an online html log that everyone in the company can see and track. Two weeks ago I couldn't have possibly done this. Honestly, I wouldn't even have known where to start. <P>No, this is not a complete Perl training manual, nor is it meant to be. But if you need to use Perl/CGI on the web to process forms and information, there is no better book on the market. I use it everyday and highly recommend it to everyone.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for the intermediate to well-seasoned HTML coder who is looking to explore server-side scripting. Experience with regular programming helps to pick up the language even more quickly, although it is certainly not necessary. Having been introduced to the many uses of Perl/CGI after installing and using several scripts like those on the CGI Resource Index (http://www.cgi-resources.com), I was well aware of the practicality of what I was learning (after reading to chapter 3, I began writing Perl with a purpose, using the book only as a reference). I'm now very comfortable with the language, and have moved on to more advanced projects (and, consequently, more advanced resources). I HIGHLY recommend this book, as well as others in the Visual Quickstart series (especially those written by Elizabeth Castro).</span>

                    <span>The book purports to be a visual quickstart guide. However, you will need a microscope to view the examples; which after close examination, you will find to be the same examples you can get for free on-line. The extensive use of deprecated code is more than just annoying, especially the code that was deprecated prior to publishing. The publishers should have caught that. Get the O'Reilly book instead: the one with the mouse on the cover.</span>

                    <span>Work in Windows or Mac? Want to find out how to do something with Perl and CGI on your computer under Windows or Mac? Excellent starter reference book. Ms. Castro tells you where to get the free programs you must have to do Perl and CGI on your own desktop before you try publishing on the Web.<P>Once you've gone through this book you'll need more (I've bought from Amazon: CGI Programming 101 {Jacqueline Hamilton} and Learning Perl {Schwartz and Phoenix}) but Castro's book will enable you to get set up, become familiar with Perl and CGI basics, and be ready to move on.</span>
