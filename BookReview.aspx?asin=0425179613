                    <span>Before reading this book i felt as though Lance Armstrong was an amazing man-overcoming cancer, wining the tour de france 6 times. As i began the book i still symapthised for him, but as i read further it came apparent to me at how conceited mr amrstong is. Anytime he lost it was alywas to "the best in the world" and "he had given his absolute best and there was nothing he could do". It seems as tohught he cant admit his faults. With all his talk aobut his wife and how amazing she was, why did he divorce her? Lance armstrong, while achieving great things, is exactly like many other sports stars- slefish and way too self-involved</span>

                    <span>Armstrong's story is something you would expect to see in a fiction tale...the fact that he lived through all of it in real life is a true inspiration.  "It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life" is very well-written and, just like Armstrong likes to live his life, very fast-paced and intense.  Even if you are not an athlete or a cancer patient, I highly recommend this book because its story has the power to motivate and inspire anyone to truly live life and be the best person that they can be.</span>

                    <span>Lance Armstrong's book tells us of his inspiring journey back  to life. He tells us of his strength of character and determination to live in a somewhat conceited way. His fight is definitely admirable. However, modesty is not the only thing missing in the book. Being a cancer patient and Tour de France winner is not an excuse for shoddy writing. I'm only seventeen and I found one grammar mistake after another throughout the book. "Criterium" is not a word that an English dictionary recognizes. Perhaps it is a cycling term that Armstrong did not find necessary to clarify for those of us who are not familiar with the lingo. Perhaps he meant "criterion." However, either way, by not explaining it to us Armstrong indirectly meant his book to be read by ardent fans of cycling. Surely this isn't the best marketing ploy to use? 
<br />Don't get me wrong, I think Armstrong is a truly great man who has seen too many hardships in his life, even if he does come across as someone who's head is so inflated that his treasured maillot jaune wouldn't be able to get over his head. I understand that his childhood was turbulent and he had to prove himself over and over again to the world. I admire his mother because I know that if I were in his situation, my mother would stand by me the same way. It couldn't have been easy for her to raise him as a single mother in the midst of Southern-belle-manners. His story truly is "the stuff of legends," as Independent eloquently puts it. I completely empathize with him. However, he isn't the only person in the world to have gone through cancer and come out triumphant. Armstrong comes across as someone who looks at himself as God. Even his pseudo-modest moments come across as forced. As an objective critic who is analyzing the writing, and not the story, I have to say that I've seen much better. His editor overlooked some major errors. 
<br />What also struck me was Lance's garbage about his wife. Had I not known about his divorce, I would have believed him to be a completely devoted husband and father. He gushes about Kristin and how she "is a stud" over and over in the book. Where did Sheryl come in, then? This bit of knowledge makes the book seem even more fake. It makes me wonder, were any of the sentiments he expressed true? Did he just make them up to seem like a victim who mustered the strength to ressurect himself from cancer? His battle is inspiring. But are all his sentiments true? Even if they aren't, the fictitious sentiments, at least, are inspiring.
<br />I remember my first thought when I finished the book. "You disgust me." And that still stands.</span>

                    <span>Very few people will ever see the extreme lows and highs that Lance Armstrong has faced.  Few fictional stories will ever be as unlikely as this true story.  This book will remind you of what it is possible for a human being to accomplish.  
<br />
<br />As a cyclist and long-time fan of Lance Armstrong, I found it interesting that I finished the book with even more respect for his accomplishments, but feeling like I wouldn't actually enjoy the man if I were to meet him.  I see it as a credit to the writing and to Armstrong's openness in the book that I responded this way. (By the way, I fully acknowledge that he's well beyond needing to care one bit about what I think of him.)
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This great little reminder sits on my shelf to jog my perspective whenever a "pity party" sets in. This iron-man's focus and determination is awesome. I only hope that he takes time to enjoy other, smaller, things in his life.  </span>
