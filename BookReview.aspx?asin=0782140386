                    <span>I have finished reading this book for a long time, but I still use it with the task at my office. Now I design my database application using VB.NET as the interface. Whether this book guide in overall concept but the explaination style is very good and easy to uderstand. I recommend this book for the other people who want to learn VB.NET from the beginner should try to use this book.</span>

                    <span>I have been programming since IBM produced the 7090/7094, with the first symbolic assembler/compiler.  I have not completely adapted to object oriented programming yet (but am commited to modular, well-documented code that avoids arbitrary assumptions that prevent smooth future growth).<p>The first time I got one of Harold Davis' books, I was impressed: "Finally, a book for programmers that is really accessible!"  I was tired of voluminous books of "how to"s that did not provide a good conceptual structure.  (Some of us need that to help the memory, and sense of mastery.)<p>He writes in an easy-to understand style in which the basic concepts are included along with the clear and straightforward "how to"s.  It is clearly a book suitable for beginners and for experienced, moderately advanced, programmers at the same time.  (Something I formerly did not believe was possible.)  As one reads and occassionally rereads the material, it becomes evident that the content is really quite dense.  One can read simply, follow the instructions - that are clear and easy to follow - and, if a deeper understanding is desired, then go back and re-read the material, more slowly.  It is all there.<p>In this latest book, he has brought this style to a very fine level.  I was intending to "retire" with Visual Studio 6.  After, reading the first few chapters of this book, I am eager to take his "journey" into VB .net.</span>

                    <span>First and foremost, let me say that this is a **GREAT** book! I don't know who that guy (or gal) is that blasted this book on November 24th, but I'd bet that s/he hasn't even read it and obviously doesn't understand the target audience--people like me who want to learn how to program using VB.Net. This book is one of the clearest books about VB.Net that I have found. I own 3 other VB.Net books and I wish I had found this one first.</span>

                    <span>This book is both a waste of time and a waste of money. Why? <p>1. The book tries to be too many things to too many people, and fails miserably on all accounts. If you're new to programming, "nondeterministic finalizers" are introduced on page 6. If you're an experienced object-oriented programmer, OOP isn't introduced until Chapter 15. If you're a VB6 programmer, I couldn't find a clear attempt by the author to demonstrate the differences between 6 and .NET.<p>2. In my understanding, the most important update to VB.NET is its uptake of object-oriented programming principles. The back cover of the book says that the author also wrote "Visual Basic 6 Visual Quickstart." I have not read that book, but would not be surprised if its contents were similar to this new book. The author has basically ignored all of the important updates to VB.NET, and has provided a tutorial for VB6. If you're a new programmer, this book will teach you the wrong things right from the start. If you're an experienced programmer, you'll be frustrated by the mickey-mouse approach which doesn't make use of your prior knowledge. <p>3. Chapters 16-20 (the last 5 in the book), which "introduce" ADO.NET and working with XML, among other things, are pretty obvious page-fillers. If you're looking for pages 90% filled with screenshots, this is your place to find them. Appendices A - E are also page-fillers. Appendix A tells you how to use the VB Help System. If you need help using help, what are you doing programming?<p>4. The author expressly states that his favorite update in VB.NET is the ability to use windows of any shape. That about sums this book up.<p>Let me restate - this book misses just about every target audience I can think of.</span>

                    <span>I bought Harold Davis's "Visual Basic 6: Visual QuickStart Guide" because I've always wanted to learn to program. And I did! Now that VB .NET is here, I've been at a loss as to how to proceed. Thank goodness, Mr. Davis has written a book about this latest (and greatest!) version of VB. This book has everything I've been needing to get going with tips on migrating my programs and what's new or just changed from the previous version. I really don't understand the one star review from "The Geek" down below. He's comparing this book which is for novices and intermediate programmers with books for experts. Sounds like apples and oranges to me. If you're looking for a great book to get you started with VB .NET, then buy this book!</span>
