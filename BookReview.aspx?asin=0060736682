                <span id="Label1">It's one thing to review a book by pounding out a few hundred words of criticism but it's quite another to review a book by writing an entirely new book. That's what Dick Morris, former advisor to President Bill Clinton, has done in <I>Rewriting History</I>, an energetic response to Hillary Clinton's <I>Living History</I>. Mrs. Clinton, Morris warns, is on a direct path to the White House due to a lack of Democratic alternatives and a leftward trend in the nation; therefore America must evaluate who she really is and not just what her memoir says. Morris's book is actually remarkably similar to the slew of attack books published about recent presidents but with the crucial difference that Hillary is at the very least four years away from the Oval Office. So Morris's criticisms of her, though backed up by a 20-year relationship with the Clintons, are rarely more than speculative, worrying about what she might do and asking ominous questions that are inherently unanswerable. Hillary Clinton, in Morris's view, is a much more insecure, disingenuous, and calculating creature than "Hillary," the palatable political product that won election to the Senate in 2000 and she's also an inferior politician to her husband. But as a political operative who has worked for both conservatives and liberals, Morris's indictments of Clinton evolve into a grudging respect as he demonstrates her considerable political resolve. All the same, he refutes many passages in her book with his own accounts of what transpired and indicts her integrity and behavior dating back to Bill Clinton's early career in Arkansas. Going forward, he says, she must decide whether to rely on her behind-the-scenes political acumen or embrace actual convictions. Often, Morris puts Clinton in no-win situations. For instance, while First Lady, she decides to get a dog, a decision that Morris infers is entirely politically motivated despite Clinton saying that it was because daughter Chelsea had moved out. Thus, if she had "admitted" her motivation was political, it would be an admission of cynicism and manipulation, but if she protests that her motives were simpler, Morris would have us believe that she's just lying. Nowhere is it allowed that the woman may have just wanted a dog. <I>Rewriting History</I>, co-written by Morris's wife Eileen McGann, offers a pleasing blend of Washington (and some Little Rock) gossip along with its political strategizing and is more valuable as insider scoop than presidential road map. Fans of Hillary Clinton will find little to alter their view and those who oppose her will find plenty of talking points for all the years of future debates that Hillary Clinton will surely inspire. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I'm assuming that what Clinton wrote in 'Living History' is entirely contrary to what Morris wrote in 'Rewriting History'.  So, I chose only to read this one and take into account that her version would be the exact opposite of what he wrote.  I hope dearly that she's not elected in 2008 or any other year and (God help us is if she is) that she's completely through a hormone-driven emotional menopause if she is.  Having said that, this book is written with so much animosity.  I wish Morris had just stuck to reporting the facts with a little less melodrama.</span>

                    <span>That is the question that Dick answers at the end of the book, and it is a good one.
<br />
<br />Dick Morris knows about the political life of the Clinton's more than any man (or woman) alive, having been employed Bill's advisor for much of the past 25 years.  He point by point goes through Hillary's history and assess both her assets and the things that sould give anyone to think twice before voting for her as President.
<br />
<br />As evidence by prior "reviews", there are dye-in-the-wool Democrats who will go apoplectic any time they see someone say anything the slightest bit critical of a Democrat.  However, if you truly look at this book, this is not a 100% "hack-job" by a partisan Republican.  He heaps a considerable amount of criticism on Republicans in this book.  However, Hillary has a history that is disturbing.  Of course, any attempt at showing balance (either in the book world or cable news) is automatically attacked as right-wing.  This is assuredly a sympton of decades of media dominance (but that is a topic addressed in other books.)
<br />
<br />Anyone who is considering voting for her in 2008 (I will vote absentee and I will NOT vote for Hillary) MUST read this book first.  If you don't and vote for her, all I can say is that if she wins, you may well come to regret it within four years.</span>

                    <span>She's got more brass than the Pentagon.  I actually read her book "Living History" and laughed all the way through.  Okay, Hillary - if you say so *lmao*
<br />
<br />Now we get the truth.  And it's even plausible!  Everything Dick Morris writes about our Hil either sounds like her or we got to actually watch her do these things through the magic of the media.  Be honest - you guffawed right along with me when Hillary would describe some sweet domestic scene, with her playing the dutiful housewife.  We knew better when she was trying to dish it out and now Dick Morris gives us the details.
<br />
<br />And who would know better than Bill Clinton's chief strategist?  Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, Morris has no ax to grind.  Intellectually, we know that.  He made a lot of money getting Bill elected Governor, then President.  Why cut off the gravy train when Hil's getting ready to make her big move?  There's more to be gained by him selling his services to her to get her elected than he probably made off this book.
<br />
<br />Others have said that there was some falling out between Morris and the Clintons, and that's why he's coming out with these slam books.  And they're right - Morris got in the doghouse because he refused to lie under oath in his Grand Jury testimony.

                    <span>Dick Morris worked with the Clintons for over 20 years.  Yes he was a political consultant and worked for both sides of the fence, so to speak, but he did actually like the Clintons.  I feel it even comes out in this book as he tries to give Hillary Clinton some advice about the HILLARY brand name that she has created.
<br />
<br />I think he is dead-on in his analysis based on the events during the after the Clinton White House years.  From his position he obviously has some insights that WE, the general public, do not have.
<br />
<br />Sure politicians are still politicians and always trying skew what they say but Hillary (and Bill) have taken that "art" to a whole new level and it is clear in this book why some of their problems became so big and public and how they could have handled them better.  I think it is also clear that as a populace, we do NOT want HILLARY for President.
<br />
<br />Read the book all the way through and with and open mind!!</span>
