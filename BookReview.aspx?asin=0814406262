                    <span>I am currently an MBA student at Columbia Business School and I picked up this book while taking an M&A class. I found that Rick puts great color around the entire management buyout process, from start to finish. I think this book should be recommended b-school reading for private equity and M&A classes because it is easy to read yet provides a wealth of information not typically found in textbooks about the subtleties of M&A.</span>

                    <span>Rickertsen presents a comprehensive overview of a management buyout. Before you buy the book, you should know that he is talking about larger companies, and he is talking about fairly senior executives buying them. (One of his examples of a successful buyout manager is Roger Ballou who ran the travel part of American Express.)If you are looking for a company with $5 million in revenues, you may find valuable information here, but you will likely find other books, targeting a smaller company, more appropriate.</span>

                    <span>Rickersten presents a wonderful guide on the financial and legal aspects of the leverage buyout process. Any young person interested in M & A or Private Equity should keep this book in his or her desk. The book provides the reader with sample contracts and capital structure, which would be easy for anyone to grasp. Pick it up, its a great reference</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. It is written well, has good humor, and I believe that the majority of what is said is the proper way to approach acquisitions. But with that said, I question whether this book is even realistic. I found the concepts very idealistic at times, and from my personal experiences in M&A, not realistic. All of the deals that I have been involved with are driven 100% off of egos, and subsequently become irrational. This was not due to my own influences, but to the human nature of the people usually in the position to even make an acquisition. If there is a company/fund out there that approaches acquisitions as rationally and professionally as Rick Rickertsen suggest, please drop me a line, I would love to do great work for you.</span>
