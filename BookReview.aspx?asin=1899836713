                    <span>Using her emotional intelligence the author has written a book which clearly and simply describes what the applications are, of various NLP models in the life coaching context and what life coaching is, how to set up a practice, some guidelines of conduct for a life coach, etc. And the book includes the index and the biography, essential from a serious readers point of view. 
<br />You would be a fool to consider a 250-page book will give you all the answers, and that just reading a book would make you a life coach - practical experience is essential. However, this book is easy to read and apply and will be a big step on the learning ladder of life coaching. I found it an inspiring and motivational book which gave me the confidence to consider life coaching as a career.  Rather than the often stuffy self absorbed books which give the reader a feeling of inadequacy.  I highly recommend this book if you are just starting out or doing research into life coaching.

                    <span>I have read quite a few books on coaching and then I came across this one. It told me EXACTLY what I needed to know. It is full of practical advice and is down to earth with no hype. I would recommend this book to anyone that is thinking seriously about starting a career in Life Coaching. </span>

                    <span>The Life Coaching Handbook is an essential part of my coaching library.  It is so refreshing to finally read a book that is written from a practical standpoint.  Curly takes you beyond the theory of Life Coaching and gives you a totally practical blue print to kick start your coaching business.  The integration of practical marketing strategies and the benefit of the authors own experience make this a compelling read.  Curly Martin has written a first class book about a very rewarding profression.  The author is passionate about coaching and her own experience shines through.  </span>

                    <span>not a very well written book, chapter 2 talks about setting up your business - ah hello we just started talking about life coaching. But all you need to set up your business in the first place is a pen, paper were you can record details and a phone...
<br />come this is a very basic book.
<br />Many of the ideas in the book are not well explained. I suppose as a very basic book it might be alright but it's a rather grand title for such a basic book</span>
