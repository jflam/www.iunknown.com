                    <span>I bought a couple of books about Dreamweaver and I want to thank you for creating one that even a beginner could follow. The other books I bought were way over my head and I found myself lost before I even got started. I guess if I get more advanced I may appreciate some of the other books, but as someone who is new to Web design, I want to thank you for helping me get started. I couldn't have done it without you.</span>

                    <span>Having only once created a webpage on FrontPage, I thought I was a bit ahead of the game. Still, I decided to look into a how-to book for dummies like myself. 
<br />Fortunately, I had also purchased the Dreamweaver bible. If you want to do more with your site than just pictures with text and tables... then this is a great book. 
<br />I found myself having to look at the Dreamweaver Bible to make my site better. 
<br />As for content presentation, I would have preferred if they include Cascade Style Sheets with the inital introduction to HTML. The flow would have been much better. 
<br />This book does a bad job covering &#60;META&#62; and Keywords. 
<br />So, yes, it's ok for the PLAIN basic of all basics. I recommend it merely for the fact that it introduces you Dreamweaver Menu Items and helps you get around the workspace. But it is not the only book you will need- unless you're just interested in creating a little site with little pictures of your little puppy. Even then, the authors do not cover on  getting your website on search engines and finding it once it is up there.

                    <span>The first 75% of the book deals with plain HTML, forms and other buttons and takes one from 0 to 5 on a scale to 1000.  A lot of space wasted on mechanical clicking around the interface.  Explain the menus and options and how to use them and don't need to walk through each one as if I've never seen a mouse.  Now, if all you want in a web site is a bunch of words, links and pictures, all you need is MS Word and then Save as HTML.  So, I imagine the fun part is when you have a database, to make the site smart... The database examples have missing steps and built in assumptions, no clue as to what could go wrong, etc.  Needless to say, I spent many hours searching the net to fill the missing spaces left by this book.  To my surprise, I found Macromedia's ONLINE UltraDev help a much better resource, with better explanations and a lot more graphics.  Thanks Jannine, but no thanks!</span>

                    <span>Dreamweaver is a great program for building a full website. I have as many as 40 pages spun off one template, and about 80% of all my website pages are template pages. It's a real timesaver. Dreamweaver makes using templates for similar webpages easy. Unfortunately, Macromedia's documentation is often dry and a little tedious to try and understand. Fortunately, we have How To books we can count on to make things easier. This book by Warner and Gardner is the best I could find in the bookstore, and I think you'll find it very useful as I did.</span>

                    <span>Here's a little secret: HTML is easy. A good, useable, expandable Web site, though, that's a lot harder, and Dreamweaver is the tool that every professional Web developer I know uses; it's the Mack truck of Web editors. Susannah Gardner and Janine Warner should get a medal for writing a Dummies book for this mega-program, and for doing such a good job with it, that medal ought to be gold.  In a mere 390 pages, they cover: Defining and planning Web sites, streamlining your work with templates and library items, working with images, HTML tables, frames, layers, DHTML, JavaScript "behaviors" (as Dreamweaver calls them), integrating with other Macromedia programs like Flash and Fireworks, using forms, and integrating dynamic (i.e. database driven) content. Whew! I recommend the book for anyone who is new to the program, and wants to start out leaning the basics and go all the way to the most advanced uses.  However, if you're already an expert Web developer and need more depth on a particular area of Web development, you may want to pick up a different book specific to the task you're trying to do (database integration, for example).  What this book does is give you a complete VIP tour of the program, and explain what every part of it can be used for. It's a great first book.  Oh, one more thing: The 2004 version of Dreamweaver has a few new changes, including: it handles MS Office importing better, and though it's not yet perfect, it's much better at handling CSS now; if that's important to you, you should upgrade, and get this book.</span>
