                    <span>I was hoping to find ideas to help us in renovating our son's room.  Unfortunately, most ideas in this book would require a tremendous amount of capital investment and certainly are out of reach for many people.
<br />
<br />However, we were able to grasp some ideas which we'll try to tailor down to our middle class standards.</span>

                    <span>The book is generally well layed out.  Don't expect any plans, you are expected to develop your own ideas and it should help you accomplish this.  Overall, the title says it all.</span>

                    <span>This book has many creative ideas. But, they are mostly ideas that would require major remodeling, would be impossible, or would only be helpful when designing your blue prints. There are decorating ideas, but overall, this book is geared more toward the architect. An example is an in-the-wall loft, and another is a split level bedroom. Also, the rooms are rarely your average square bedroom but instead have very creative floor plans. SO- the book is creative and attractive, but not very useful. </span>

                    <span>This book is packed with wonderful ideas for kid-friendly rooms, and includes lots of large, colorful photographs.  "Idea Book" is an appropriate title - no instructions are given.  However, unless you are a professional builder or architect, or are willing to refinance your mortgage to pay for a professional, most of these ideas will remain ideas.  Some of the painting ideas and color schemes could be useful for someone who is on a budget and is looking for a change.</span>

                    <span>This book is loaded with great ideas that enable parents to utilize every inch of space in their homes. A child's room is a multi-use dwelling used for sleeping, playing, reading, studying and sometimes meals. This book understands this and provides the readers with great ideas and how to for the child's room, attic, space under stairs and even outdoors. I found the ideas practical, safe and pleasing to the eye.The writing was crisp and visual. A great primer for the family with the older home or newly constructed. I have given this book as a gift to pediatricians,friends and family. ENJOY</span>
