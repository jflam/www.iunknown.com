                    <span>Course management is often overlooked by amateurs, so this book could bring this to light. However, I would much rather have had Butch walk with real players, asking them how they would play the shot, then him suggesting to them how they SHOULD play the shot. <P>I don't think the scores his imaginary players shot are very realistic either. As someone who can relate to the "A" player, even 8 handicaps can hit some VERY bad shots. Their 8 handicap is usually a display of ability to recover from bad shots, and a better shortgame than the average player. But for an 8 to shoot a 76 on the hall of fame course that he designed is pretty far fetched. That's only +4, and probably about 5 shots better than the player's handicap. For the player to do that, the odds are VERY low (see USGA website for info on odds for a player to shoot a certain score).<P>That said, I do think his decision making is something everybody needs to learn. I DO think he loose credibility when he suggests to one player to plumb bob to get the line of a putt, though! I can't believe Harmon actually believes in plumb-bobbing!</span>

                    <span>In this volume, you are taken through 18 holes selected form courses across the US. Some are wildly famous, like the 12th at Augusta National, others are more likely to be known by long-time golf fans. The field is made up of 3 "types" of golfers, all ametures: a low, mid, and high handicapper. The rounds are played out, seeming from the imagination of the author, who has no doubt seen people play these or similar holes in precicely the fashion he describes. He offers advice, which the players choose to heed or ignore, either to their benifit or disaster.<P>The book, once read, shows itself to being a collection of common and a few not so common faults that different levels of golfers are prone to make. They are made easier to read and study through the format of a round at a variety of courses in several situations (windy, wet, calm, etc.).<P>Where the color photos of the courses and illustrations of how the ball progressed across the holes makes the book visually appealing, and where it does offer a great deal in terms of instruction and practical playing advice, it would have helped to have illustrations or photos of what people did wrong with their swings, etc., at times. Remebering how to do it the right way and not thinking about what went wrong is probably the right attitude to have entry level players follow, but if this book was meant for more advanced players as well, it leaves a bit to be desired.<P>Another unfortunate impression the book leaves is the idea that there is only one way for each person to play a particular hole, and that way is the one the author suggests. This book being his world, I suppose this is to be expected. However, a few more options per hole would have made for more interesting reading.</span>

                    <span>Harmon takes eighteen of golf's best holes and then proceeds to play them from the reference point of the mind of three levels of player --- A shot a 76, B a 84 and C a 89. He replays their shots and gives suggestions on what they might have did differently.<P>Only way likely most of us will play these holes. Excellent advice given by one of the best. This with Watson's "Strategic Golf" are the two best in this neglected category.</span>

                    <span>When I first started golfing I didn't realize how important course management was. I was really just interested in hitting the ball far and straight. And to be honest, that is what a beginner should concentrate on. But after hitting that first plateau, this book was really a breakthrough. Not only does it teach you how to manage a course to lower your score, it adds a very intriguing dynamic to the game itself. It is much like watching a football game without knowing the rules and strategies - laborious and dull. But once you know the rules and the intricate strategies developed to acheive your best score, you are infinitely more pleased with what you see.<P>Though I love that we get a guided tour of America's most storied golf holes, the fact that Harmon read my mind half of the time is what impressed me most. He lays out three separate strategies for three different levels of players. It is astonishing how he contrasts the different thought patterns of the lower v. higher handicappers. There are times where he makes high handicappers feel like idiots, but if you want to get better, hearing the truth about your game is the best way. I recommend this book very highly for all those tired of "reading" golf books with nothing but pictures and tips in them. While Butch does give a few tips, it is his golf mentality that is so fresh. And while the book is graphically impeccable, it isn't overcrowded with a bunch of confusing graphics and diagrams. Not your run-of-the-mill golf instruction book.</span>
