                <span id="Label1">The filmed version of <I>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</I>, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his schoolmates Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. Writer Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus keep the spooks in check, making this a true family film, and with its resourceful hero wide-eyed and ready, one can't wait for Harry's return. <p>  First sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and <I>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</I> passes with flying colors. Harry's second year at Hogwarts involves a darker, more malevolent tale (parents with younger children beware), beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets. House elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation (by director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves), and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart. At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams's score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation, however, as does the late Richard Harris in his final screen appearance as Professor Albus Dumbledore. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels. <p>  Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on <I>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</I>, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success of <I>Y Tu Mam&#225; Tambi&#233;n</I>, director Alfonso Cuar&#243;n proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry and his third-year classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination, <I>The Prisoner of Azkaban</I> is a Potter-movie classic. (Ages 8 and older)</span>

                    <span>When I heard about the first Harry Potter film I tried for so long to avoid it, I don't know why I did but I thought that it was just another irratating kids movie but this time with british actors then I thought great this was probably going to be a mess. It wasn't untill a friend of mine forced me to watch it and when I did I was blown away by how fantastic the movie was, I just had to buy the dvd along with the sequal at the time which was even better. Now I have not read the books because I'm not that intrested but what I think is great about these films is that there not just for kids but adults can also enjoy or any person of any age and the young actors who played Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) could have been better but they do improve during the sequal Chamber of secrets, here is a small summary of all three films:-
<br />
<br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the film that introduces us to the world of Harry Potter who is dropped of at his Uncles house when he was an infant since both his parents were killed by what seems like an evil wizard but when he grows up at the age of 10 I think I don't remember he soon discovers that he has some magic powers and then realises that he's not an ordinary kid. Then Hagrid played by Robbie Coltrane who is my favorite character in the Harry Potter films takes Harry away from his awful relatives and introduces him to his new school Hogwarts magical school of wizadry. The director Chris Columbus did a great job with bringing this great story to life with amazing special effects and great sets, it also has great brittish actors like Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman as proffesor Snape.
<br />
<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was better than the first because Harry gets to do alot more like magic spells and stuff like that and Kenneth Branagh was hilarious as the celebrity wizard who turns out to be a coward, I also liked Lucius Malfoy as Harry's nemesis was great. Harry this time has to solve a murder mystery that has happened years ago and he gets to battle some giant spiders and snakes.
<br />
<br />Harry Potter and the prisnor of Azkaban is a more darker film than the previous two films. Harry's life might be in danger as Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman has broken out of prison and he is after Harry Potter. Harry soon practices some new magic tricks with the defense against the dark arts teacher? or something like that. Emma Watson this time has a bigger role as Hermione uses a special magic trick that can send her back in time just a few days to help Harry. The actors are a bit older and seem to be more comfortable with there roles not because I think that they were bad its just that they seem to have improved, overall I think that the films were all great and all three have become my favorite films of all time, thats all I have to say because I don't want to sound like a Harry Potter nerd.</span>

                    <span>I truly love the Harry Potter series.  My wife and I devoured the first five books and we take a day off from work to see the movies on opening day.  For Christmas, my wife got me the "First 3 years" DVD box set.  As we were watching each movie, but especially the third, we kept getting the feeling that something was missing.  At first I thought I was losing my mind, but, from some clues in the Prisoner of Azkaban, we figured out that certain scenes- some particularly pivotal- have been left off the box set.  Never mind the cardboard vs. plastic casing, leaving scenes out from the theatrical run is the antithesis of a DVD release where, allegedly, more scenes should be added.  
<br />
<br />The omitted scenes I know for certain are:
<br />
<br />1. Sir Nicholas's party.  In the DVD, there is a scene of ghostly knights charging through The Great Hall, but with no follow-up scene(s) to explain this action.  What should come next, which was part of the theatrical release but was deleted for this box set, was a scene showing the knights entering Sir Nicholas's death-day party.  Then, there are more scenes of Harry, Ron, and Hermione at the party, the only "mortals" to attend.  They are baffled by some of the strange food and depressed by the atmosphere, so they decide to leave.  Sir Nicholas thanks them personally for coming on their way out.  I can distinctly see in my mind's eye John Cleese making some kind of feeble toast and then later on dejectedly bidding farwell to the Hogwarts kids. 
<br />
<br />2. There are some black and white flashback scenes of Harry's parents (at least his dad, from what I recall) poking fun at an obviously loner-type Snape, during their days as students at Hogwarts.  This scene explains much of the animosity Snape has for Harry.  At least one other main character (Sirius Black, I think, or maybe Lupin) appears in these flashback scenes.  Again, I vividly remember the black and white look of these scenes, and the students (Harry's parents, etc.) sitting beneath a  tree.  These scenes are so crucial!  Why would the filmmakers omit them?!
<br />
<br />I'm really disappointed in the choice to omit these scenes.  While the Sir Nicholas scenes aren't integral to the plot, it doesn't make sense to leave them off the DVD box set.  And certainly, cutting the flashback scenes of Harry's parents on the DVD box set is just inexcusable, particularly considering the extra freedoms available with DVD releases.  
<br />
<br />What were they thinking?
<br />
<br />Has anyone else noticed this?  Please let me know in your review.  Thanks so much.</span>

                    <span>I understand that the box set happens to have two cardboard cases( years 1 and 2) and one plastic case (year 3).  
<br />
<br />My question is if it's the "WIDESCREEN" set why is year three the "fullscreen" version?  Was it mispackaged?  Has anyone else encountered this problem?
