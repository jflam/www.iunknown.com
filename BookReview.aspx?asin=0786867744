                    <span>I pull this book off the shelf so often that I'm thinking of naming it and teaching it to fetch.  As an acting teacher, I not only find the games energizing and useful for my students, but I value the advice and suggestions.  It really helps with the side-coaching, with reviving the essential spirit of the work that got all of us into this.  As a mostly human being, I sometimes let this book jump up onto my lap simply for the giggles.  These are people who not only know what they're talking about, but who write with great wit about wit.  Hey . . . this book may be the solution to that pesky old form vs. function debate.  This is a really, really good book that continually inspires.</span>

                    <span>In a world where the corporate climate is becoming more and more concerned about don'ts, than dos, more worried about what can't be said, than what can, this delightful book is the perfect reminder of the power of play.  I love the messege.  Let's get out of our heads and have some fun.  Then let's see how that fun effects our work product.<p>The authors give us inspiring examples of humor in the workplace, and a series of excerises to loosen up even the most button downed office.  They manage to give sound advice while keeping tongues firmly in cheek.  I found it an easy read, perfect for the airplane.  <p>This is a great beginner's book for Improv in the workplace.  Now,I would love to see a more in-depth work from this joyful team.  Improvise This! has whet my appetite.</span>

                    <span>As a public speaker and trainer, no matter how well prepared I am for an engagement, I encounter situations, audiences and questions that can catch me off guard. This book offers concrete tools, suggestions and examples of how to handle these types of situations using various improvisational techniques. <p>It is also a witty, fun and playful reminder to trust our instincts and tap into the natural creativity that we are born with. A definite must have on your book shelf!</span>

                    <span>I talk and act for a living (yep, I'm in a sort-of sales position), so I wasn't as excited about this book after reading it as I thought I'd be. Some good exercises that are included just didn't strike me as too much different that a day working with a people with varying knowledge, maturity, and educational levels. <p>Maybe I got [pulled] into the idea that (1) I like improv comedy, and (2) I'm always interested in some self-improvement. But I get to laugh and learn everyday just by showing up at the office at 8:00 a.m.<p>If you are in a serious, stuffy workplace that could use some fun and constructive play, this book might be more enjoyable than it was for me.</span>

                    <span>The authors have attempted to teach what most of us having reached adulthood and in the corporate world has forgotten - spontaneity, play and having fun. Some of the playshops would form a good basis for team building. <p>Forms an interesting read but did not break new ground. You might learn more from talking to playschool teachers who are in touch with the masters of spontaneity, play and having fun every day - young children!</span>
