                <span id="Label1">Britain's leading veterinary journalist and cat expert shares her advice and experience with cat owners on both sides of the Atlantic, as she describes how to bond with a pet feline. Claire Bessant begins by explaining how cats function as cats, describing their likes, their dislikes, and their instinctive behavior. Armed with this knowledge, cat owners facing behavior problems can determine why a problem exists and decide how to solve it. A most fascinating topic that Claire Bessant explores in detail is her method of entering a cat's world through its senses&#151;sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste, and that indefinable feline sixth sense. Readers will also find information on cat vocal and body language, feline traits determined by genetics, ways of measuring feline intelligence, training techniques, and much more. The book's final 50-page chapter is an A-to-Z compendium of cat behavior problems and their solutions. This must-read volume for cat lovers includes an eight-page insert of beautiful full-color photos.</span>

                    <span>At the beginning of this book, the author attempts to get us to understand from a cat's perspective on what it must be like to live with humans by comparing cats to Eskimos who suddenly move to the jungle. I nearly couldn't read any further. It is a distracting and unappetizing comparison with which Native people may be all too familiar.<P>Throughout the book, the author seems to go on and on about the relative popularity of dogs to cats. She includes far too much about dogs and their behavior characterstics in relation to people. If this were a book about cats and dogs that might have been appropriate. However, in this book, it was simply another distraction. <P>There are a few interesting things, but overall doesn't cover any new ground that Desmond Morris hasn't already covered.</span>

                    <span>I looked all over this book and nowhere does it state what kind of credentials this author has. I find it very uncomfortable to read a book offering advice when you can't even find out what makes the mysterious author such an expert.<P>Although some of the facts in this book are interesting, there's little real life practical information you can use to better understand and train your cat. The author just seems to be stating facts abaout cats that can easily be found in other books. <P>I was greatly disappointed because I was looking for a book that could actually be used as an aid in training my cat. This one just seems to a poor attempt at trying to cash in on the Horse Whisperer title and technique.</span>

                    <span>Claire Bessant, a British expert on cats, tells us that the intelligence of cats ranks up there with dolphins and primates. I agree. If a cat resides in your home, you learn quickly that communication with the cat is a two-way street. You communicate with the cat via words that the cat quickly picks up, and the cat communicates with you by sound and body language that sometimes takes a poor human considerable time to understand. That is why we need a book such as this one by Claire Bessant. Usually, while you are trying unsuccessfully to train the cat, that calculating cat is busily training you for maximum cat security and comfort. Bessant explains the basis for cat behavior and shows how body language aids vocal sounds in telling you what the cat wants to tell you. Her background information goes a long way toward helping you communicate with and understand a highly intelligent creature. I found this well-written book to be informative and entertaining.</span>
