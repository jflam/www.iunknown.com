                    <span>This is a great little book, and possibly the best overview available of the long and fascinating history of this region. There are Pueblo villages encountered by Coronado in the 16th century that are still inhabited today, and Simmons skillfully portrays the interactions over the centuries of these and the other cultures that have mingled in this harsh region. Those readers who are inspired to study this subject in more detail (and that will probably include most who read Simmons' book!) may then want to delve into a longer classic such as Paul Horgan's "Great River."</span>

                    <span>I loved reading this book. It presented the highlights of the rich history of the southwest from the Spanish colonization to the recent decades in a essay-like tone that is very readable. The story itself is exotic and very compelling,as anyone who has lived in or vistited the area should know. I imagine that Mr. Simmons is the "dean" of New Mexico history. His knowledge of the broad sweep of centuries of history, comprising numerous diverse cultures, is impressive. More impressive is his ability to convey his personal feeling for the subject matter. A reader can tell by his personal epilogue about camping in the New Mexico desert that Mr. Simmons loves working in the shadows of the Conquistadors, the Pueblos, Navajos and American mountainmen and pioneers. This book brings the history alive. I am on the hunt for other books about southwest history, and for books by Marc Simmons.</span>
