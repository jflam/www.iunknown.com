                    <span>This book walked me through the process of completely transforming my life. It is full of useful exercises that really really work. If you're unhappy with your life, don't run blindly to the next thing. Take the time, do the work, and figure out what it is your really desire, in order to find true happiness. I went from a point in my life where I was unhappy with my career, relationship, home, location, and general quality of life. Over the process of a year and a half, I now have my dream job in an incredibly beautiful location along with wonderful home, relationship, and lifestyle. If you believe you can do it and that you deserve nothing but the best, you CAN make it happen. So do it!</span>

                    <span>The chapter on "defining" and "expanding" beliefs is worth the price of admission.  So many people I work with as a coach have such definite beliefs about who they are, how they need to do things, and whether they can or can't accomplish something.  Fortgang shows us how to move through those limiting mindsets and create new, more expansive thinking that is filled with hope and possibility.  The simple act of changing one entrenched belief about something can, and will, create incredible break-through results.</span>

                    <span>"Living Your Best Life" is a practical guide on discovering what you want while presenting the skills it will take to get it. The foundation of the book is the belief that each person has their own innate wisdom that can be used as a resource. Once you have tapped into that resource, a change in attitute and perspective can help you create the life your wise self desires.<p>I purchased this book as an informational companion to my role as a coaching client. As someone in the midst of many personal and professional decisions, I found the client success examples illustrating each idea to be energizing and inspiring. Fortgang's perspective is a breath of fresh air in a world that tells you to push for your goals. Fortgang supports allowing your innate wisdom to pull you toward your passion and purpose.<p>"Living Your Best Life" is not about making lists, or even making plans. It is about knowing what you really want in life, instead of what you think you can have. It is about being who you are so you can do what you are meant to do in order to live your best life.</span>

                    <span>LBF second book, "Living your best life" is definitely lights away from her first. I can feel a different person, someone who grew together with the coaching profession. With her three way strategy - the reckoning, the doing and the being - all of us can create the circumstances in our lives to invite good luck. It is by attraction that we get delicious results, not by hard work.<p>Laura Berman Fortgang proves once again that she is a magnificent coach, a unique professional. Follow the techniques in her book and things will start to "happen". You will be surprised.<p>By Thei Zervaki<br>author of Globalize, Localize, Translate</span>
