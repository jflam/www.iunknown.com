                <span id="Label1">You might want to digest this book slowly, a few pages at a time. Although Zen teacher Steve Hagen has a knack for putting the philosophy of Buddhism in a "plain and simple" package, it may take a while to sink in. There is so much there. Seeing reality, realizing the wisdom of the self, breaking free of dualistic thinking--this is pretty heady stuff. Thankfully, Hagen passes it along in the form of examples from life, psychological tidbits, and stories from Buddhist teachers past and present. And when it clicks in, it can be life-transforming. Hagen explains this shift in outlook and how the fundamental way we look at the world affects everything we do. As an outline, Hagen follows the basic teachings of the Buddha, and we see that, rather than dogmatic truths, they are reminders for us as we reconsider the life we have taken for granted for so long. As it turns out, Buddhism is life, plain and simple. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I originally picked this book up because I wanted to be more present and adept in my day-to-day high-stress negotiational interactions with other people. I had this instinct that zen Buddhism held the answer I was looking for, and I was right.
<br />
<br />The best part is that Mr. Hagen starts this book off just right: no cultural trappings, no endless terminology, just the original teachings. 
<br />
<br />I came to this book looking for a zen primer. Something to point the mindset out to me, refine it, and let me on my merry way. I can say without a doubt that this book has been successful. 
<br />
<br />I don't envision myself necessarily heading down to my local center for meditation, but I have been engaging in the practice of just seeing in my day-to-day life. 
<br />
<br />Most of the time now, for anywhere from a moment to many minutes, I am awake. I may drift away from that or be slammed away by some thought, worry or whatever, but I find myself correcting with high frequency. This is a great place to be in, because I realize that many of my stresses and difficulties in social interactions were coming from mental pheonmena and other stuff that was NOT of the "here and now." 
<br />
<br />When I do come back to being fully in this very moment, to just seeing, to thus (as Mr. Hagen describes it), there is nothing but capability for me. My mind is un-dammed, free to pull out it's best answers, most correct actions, it's instant knowledge, etc. The important thing to note, though, is that it is a major removal, not an addition. It's not like a bunch of new parts are added to me. It's that all of my capabilities are untied. 
<br />
<br />It's a removal of barriers to functioning at or near your full potential. And it's acheived by just seeing, as described in the book. There is certainly something to this.
<br />
<br />To just see is exactly what I was wanting to do, I just needed that finger to point me to the moon and especially to refine my understanding of what is and what is not the right way (see the book for all the right way stuff from the eightfold path).
<br />
<br />I am very pleased with my purchase. 
<br />
<br />I also purchased some Charlotte Joko Beck books (Everyday Zen and Nothing Special), but they seem rambly and less profound to me. Everyday Zen is excerpted from talks with students (?) who seemed to already be at least somewhat initiated. It has been more wrapped up in cultural concerns and lingo, and I have only been able to nod in agreement after having read Buddhism Plain and Simple. Otherwise, I probably would have cast the Beck books aside.
<br />
<br />OK, back to my second-to-second practice of just being present in this very moment and seeing. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, Mr. Hagen, for the fine instruction.</span>

                    <span>Get this book. I mean, buy it this moment. This book explained some very difficult concepts in some very easy ways. Even if you even have a clear understanding of these concepts you'll enjoy this book, as it will give you a better way to communicate these ideas to others. 
<br />
<br />I should mention I have given this book to friends and they have had trouble with it. I think 3 out of 5 people can't use this as a Buddhist primer. However, if you've got a C of better in a community college philosophy class, you should do fine with this it. I'd give it a shot, no matter what you think your ability to understand is. As something contained in this book may really speak to you, and serve to help unravel even more.

                    <span>I read this book when it first came out and since that time have recommended to many friends who expressed an interest in Buddhism. Even as a Buddhist, some of the books that come out seem incredibly complex, and I have trouble figuring out what they're trying to say. (And, let's face it, one of the beauties of Buddhism is its simplicity.) This book clarifies the important parts of the religion/philosophy in an easy to understand way while never being condescending.</span>

                    <span>This is a good introduction to Buddhism. It gently explains how suffering is rooted in ignorance ("not seeing" as Hagen likes to say). But the author doesn't stress enough that practicing daily meditation is necessary to produce a real change. Without daily practice, the ideas in this book remain merely that -- ideas.</span>

                    <span>This was one of my first few books on buddhism and I thought it was an incredible study. It's not the type of book that you read it once and move on; it's study material. You read it once, you read it twice and you read it thrice. I found myself reading a chapter and thinking about it for days. Then I would go back and re-read it and think some more. The way that it's presented was in my opinion, very clear, conscice and precise.<p>He allows you to discover for yourself the art of seeing. First, you can't learn compassion from a book, first you see then you practice compasion like out of unwilled intention. You won't learn this is a book. Those who are reviewing this book saying that it missed "this" and "that" missed the whole point. The beauty of this book is that Steve allows you to see it for yourself. He doesn't serve it on a silver plater (no fast food enlightenment here - sorry folks) but he makes you work for what he points at - uninterested minds recoil now. I'm under the impression that he knows that if he tries to describe the "process" too much, conception comes in and ego's assimilation fragments the idea and then the windows are all fogged up.<p>He did an incredible clever job of sublety pointing to directions that lead to the path - it's a raft. He even describes that it's impossible for you to get truth from a book, you have to see it for yourself; that's why he keeps saying "see", learn to "see," just "see," etc; It's a reminder. You must do the work yourself - no one will do it for you.<p>This book surely helped me start to see the path. Hopefully it will help you too.</span>
