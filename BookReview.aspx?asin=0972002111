                    <span>Since I started my own company in 2001, I have purchased and reviewed more books on marketing than you can put on a six foot bookcase.  The really bad ones I've thankfully SOLD BACK on Amazon.  But you couldn't give me enough money to sell Steven Van Yoder's amazing book!  Steven, who runs his own company, knows the value of niche and clearly states the importance of branding without sounding cute, contrived or gimicky.  His approach is that of a tried and true professional who speaks from experience.  His background in journalism makes him an expert on media relations and his approach to making yourself famous in your own indsutry truly works. I should know--I hired this man to help grow my own company, Creative Visions Consulting, and everything he's done has PAID OFF!  If you want practical advice you can immediately apply to your business, THIS is the book!  But be warned--these are not OVERNIGHT SPLASHES that create success--what Van Yoder offers is a SYSTEMATIC WAY to build your business through CONSISTENT and QUALITY exposure, something most marketing gurus or "niche experts" never want to tell you until you've forked over your money!  So....get clicking and get this book--you'll be glad you did!</span>

                    <span>Steven Van Yoder's book is tied along with Robert Bly's "Become A Recognized Authority In Your Field - In 60 Days Or Less" as one of the two best books available on personal branding.  In addition to these two books, I'd also like to point you toward C.J. Hayden's wonderful "Get Clients Now."  Any of these books is ideal for service professionals trying to build a brand and a reputation.  Consultants, in particular, will benefit from studying these three books.  Highly recommended.</span>
