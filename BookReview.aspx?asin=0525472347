                <span id="Label1">Sex, drugs, and rock & roll... a common high-school fantasy, right? In  British author Sarra Manning's debut novel <I>Guitar Girl</I>, this  oft-trumpeted triple-temptation proves to be terribly trying for a  budding pop star. Molly Montgomery and her friends Tara and Jane live  largely unnoticed until they form a fledgling girl band that will "be  part of the new girl revolution." Fragile-yet-feisty Molly writes songs  about Hello Kitty and boy crushes because that's the stuff of her world--a childhood closely guarded by her "crunchy granola," rule-oriented  parents she dramatically deems "power-crazed fascists." But when her  band is joined by a couple of older boys and attracts the attention of a  fancy manager, "The Hormones" start racing--big gigs, an American tour,  the whole bit. During her wild ride to stardom, Molly gets her first  kisses from both a boy and a girl, gets drunk for the first time (but  not the last), and loses her virginity and her sense of self, too. Any  teenager who romanticizes celebrity will get a good dose of the reality  of drug overdoses, morning-after pills, legal battles, exploitation,  humiliation, and exhaustion with <I>Guitar Girl</I>...still, Manning  manages to communicate the rush of wowing an audience and the joy and  power of music through the often bittersweet, often bitingly funny voice  of Molly. For a variation on the same theme, investigate Rachel Cohn's  <I>Pop Princess</I>.  (Ages 13 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>At first i was intrigued by this book. I spotted the cover and read the inside flap. "Okay," i thought, "It's about a guitar playing girl who's making it big. I play guitar, she plays guitar, i think i can relate. Should be pretty good." <BR>When i started reading it i really enjoyed it, it was well written with believeable characters. The reason it only got four, instead of five stars? It was kind of a rip off of the Sex Pistols' history. I had read ROTTEN by John Lydon (johnny rotten) a few months earlier and the similarities were uncanny. The drug thing with molly's friend (sid vicious,) the fact they had a very possesive manager (malcom), and a stylist that freaked if Molly wasn't wearing the right thing (vivinne). And there are more that i could tell but that would give away the ending to the book. So i find it to be a modern-day girl version of the Sex Pistols that's no where near as hard hitting as the real thing.<BR>I'd recommend this book to pre-teens interested in the music life, and when they hit the age of around 15 or 16 buy them ROTTEN for the full on, real story.</span>

                    <span>I don't know if I love or hate this book. I'm 11, and it might be better for a 13-15 year old to read it.<P>Molly gets drunk twice. She has sex. She cusses. Her friend Jane takes off her shirt at a party and is taking pills and constantly having sex. Their manager, Paul, kisses Molly and threatens to kill her. Molly and Dean are always sleeping together.<P>But it all offers a message.<P>Overall, I think it was good, but it would have been better if I'd have waited till I was older.</span>

                    <span> It was an awesome book. Molly became a virtual hero of mine. I fell in love with the characters and couldn&#146;t put the book down because I had to see what happened next. I got attached to it then when I was finished I was all bummed out. The ending was so sad and moving that I cried. Yeah, don&#146;t laugh.  Sometimes it was angsty, sometimes it was fluffy, and sometimes it was sad. I wanted it to go on, like a sequel, but in the end I just read it over about nine times. This was a book that was FUN to read! </span>

                    <span>Ok, I read a lot of books, but this is one of the very, very best. Guitar Girl is a fabulous book about a teen girl named Molly Montgomery, who with her two friends Jane and Tara, decide to start a band. They're just okay, maybe even a little worse, but then along comes Dean, who pushes Molly's buttons ever so much, but he promises super stardom if he and his friend T can join. They do, and the band gets signed to a record label and they are as big as everyone knows teen pop can get. But it aint all fun and games because Molly has to deal with a power abusing manager, the fact that Dean and her hate eachother (or maybe they're just pretending because they have the hots for eachother), and the effect that being in the spotlight can have on the young and famous. I loved this book sooooo much, and if you are looking for a read that builds up to a great climax, and then leaves you numb with the after effects, you have found it. I honest to god cried. I dont cry for anything, not books, movies or funerals. Get it and you wont be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>I thought the book was awsome! it showed the downside to stardom. it showed taht real people can become famous also. i definately think that it would make a great movie! and if the author or some producer or WHATEVER i think you should consider the idea of making the abolutley amazing, couldnt put it down, book guitar girl into a movie. oh yeah, it also inspired me to pick up my guitar again. :-)</span>
