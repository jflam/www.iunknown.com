                    <span>I truly enjoyed this story. But I love everything by Francis Ray.
<br />The surprise love story between Camille and Gordon was soooo beautiful. Zach and Madison almost had me in tears in the end. But hey was it only me or did anyone else think that Zach and Wes were lovers in the beginning?  You don't know what you will do until you find yourself in the situation. Never say Never!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is wonderful.  Finally a writer who starts a book with a introduction that is a page turner from start to finish.  Madiosn thought she lived the perfect life until slowly she has to face the reality of her life as her "so perfcet life" turns into a whirlwind of events that she either has to accept or hide from and struggle to survive all the challengs put in her way.  I am waiting her next book, Someone To Love Me.</span>

                    <span>I knew I had to have this book as soon as I read a review in a magazine. The late night trip to the book store was worth it. This book surprised me, angered me, and made me cry a little bit, too. Franis Ray is a superb writer who gives Black readers what we want; she's mainstream but she doens't sacrifice substance in her novels. The characters in this book have real emotions that I could get next too; the burgeoning love affair between 'mother' and child was great. Not too many women would be able to handle a situation like that.<p>If I'm being vague, it's because you need to read the book. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Okay I read all the reviews, okay not all the reviews but a few to see that everyone pretty much liked this book. Now my review may not be up to everyones liken but that what makes amazon so greatYou can say how you feel. I have to keep telling my self that it's a book, however books can reflect true life. The book was interesting and a quick read. I didn't like that here you are a woman in the 03 and you didn't think that your husband would sleep with someone else? You marry a man you know how he was raised but then you think that you are not going to have any issue with him? You are so self absorbed that you can't see that others around you are hurting? I don't get that,,,sorry. Like I said that book was good. however, I am just a little bit to pessimitic I guess. Then the baby,and the uncle, This man is too good. I mean it as a negative I mean like Wow, he was a really good man. the baby was cute. I like the unlikly love affair between the boss and the social worker they need their own story. It was a good read.</span>

                    <span>This was a fast paced read. How many of you could raise your husband's infant after his death as well as the death of his mistress. Not only raise the child but then to deal with all of the secrets that come out. This was a very realistic and honest read. Pick this one up well worth the money.</span>
