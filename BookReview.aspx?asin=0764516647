                <span id="Label1">In the 1840s, William Henry Fox Talbot combined light, paper, a few chemicals, and a wooden box to produce a photographic print, laying the foundation for modern film photography. Over the years, that process was refined, and people discovered the joy of photography. Now, more than 160 years after Talbot's innovation, photography has entered a new age, with the arrival of the digital camera and a new and exciting way to think about photography. In fact, digital photography has spawned an entirely new art form.    <p>    With a digital camera, a computer, and some photo-editing software, you can explore the unlimited creative opportunities of digital photography. Just think&#160;&#8211;&#160;no more film, no more film development costs, no more limitations of working only with what's there. With digital photography, you have almost instant access to your photos, and with photo-editing software, you can easily clean up your photos and add special effects that used to be nearly impossible for the amateur photographer to achieve.    <p>    <i>Digital Photography For Dummies, 4th Edition,</i> is your introduction to the world of digital photography, whether you're a beginner taking your first shot or an experienced photographer looking to try a new medium. In this newly revised edition, you'll discover the following topics and more:     <ul>     <li>Explore the different kinds of equipment&#160;&#8211;&#160;from cameras and computers to photo-editing software     <li>Understand the science behind digital photography, including resolution, aperture, shutter speeds, and f-stops     <li>Compose great shots, including how to light your subject     <li>Solve common photographic dilemmas&#160;&#8211;&#160;such as capturing a moving target and dealing with unfriendly lighting     <li>Edit your photos by sharpening them, removing red eye, and cropping them     <li>Display your photos in a variety of ways&#160;&#8211;&#160;on CD, on the Web, or in slide shows     <li>Top Ten lists on ways to improve your digital images, great ways to use your photos, and online resources all digital photographers should know about     </ul>    <p>    <i>Digital Photography For Dummies, 4th Edition,</i> also comes with a CD that includes trial versions of popular photo-editing software, as well as some original photos taken by the author that you can use to experiment with.     </span>

                    <span>Basic digital photography can be learned from this book. But there are too many pages of fluff and filler.  More space is devoted to the value of using a tripod than making the most of basic camera functions.  <p>Book devotes alot of space to using Photoshop Elements for editing. Valuable if you happen to buy that product.  Product sample is included on CD.  But book is VERY unclear on how to use the components of PE.  Far from step-by-step.  Big gaps are left in the explanations and it is rarely possible to follow an editing process from beginning to end.<p>Can't recommend this book. Not a credit to Dummies.</span>

                    <span>I have never read the any of the "Dummies" books...I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this particular "Dummy" book. Digital Photography for Dummies contains just about anything you need to know about the world of digital cameras: storing images, transferring images, printing etc. and a bunch of (well marked) trivia you'll never use but you'll be glad you read....<p>It seems digital cameras and taking photos with aforementioned equipment isn't quite enough to fill an entire book. To skirt the lack of material afforded by concentrating solely on the taking a good picture and being done with the whole mess Digital Photography for Dummies includes plenty of pages spent on various digital image-editing programs. This may seem odd to those of you who are used to the way some traditional photography books read (many focus on getting the picture right the first time) but once you accept the benefits of going digital the inclusion of methods to manipulate the image is necessary. As Julie Adair King notes: you can make a pretty average picture into a pretty good picture if you spend a little time with a decent image-editing program. Don't believe Julie Adair King? That's okay Digital Photography for Dummies is packaged with a compact disc that contains a bevy of useful software including a Photoshop Elements demo so you can actually see for yourself just how powerful digital photography can be.<p>One of the better features of Digital Photography for Dummies is the photo examples found throughout. Julie Adair King's visual examples are the best use of figures I have ever run across. Every point Julie Adair King makes with a figure is very well made...Digital Photography for Dummies also includes something that I once thought I would never see in a twenty-five dollar digital photography book: Color Plates. Jammed right into the middle of Digital Photography for Dummies are sixteen pages of color plates. These pages are particularly informative and you're not going to get close to Digital Photography for Dummies's level of instruction with a book that is entirely grayscale.<p>Still, Digital Photography for Dummies has some miscues and errors. I'll focus on one: Apparently Photographers are ignorant to the standards of science...on the whole the book is very good. The inclusion of color plates is outstanding and Julie Adair King's touch with the visuals is remarkable. Go to your local bookstore and toss any books without color plates in favor of this one...</span>

If you are new to this field like I am, disgregard the prior negative review.  She does a very good job in explaining digital cameras and how they work.  The included softward is outstanding and worth the price of the book alone. I read the book from cover to cover and can recommend it wholeheartedly.</span>
