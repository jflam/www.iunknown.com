                <span id="Label1">Can computers change what you think and do? Can they motivate you to stop smoking, persuade you to buy insurance, or convince you to join the Army? <br><br>"Yes, they can," says Dr. B.J. Fogg, director of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University. Fogg has coined the phrase "Captology"(an acronym for computers as persuasive technologies) to capture the domain of research, design, and applications of persuasive computers.In this thought-provoking book, based on nine years of research in captology, Dr. Fogg reveals how Web sites, software applications, and mobile devices can be used to change people's attitudes and behavior. Technology designers, marketers, researchers, consumersanyone who wants to leverage or simply understand the persuasive power of interactive technologywill appreciate the compelling insights and illuminating examples found inside. <br><br>Persuasive technology can be controversialand it should be. Who will wield this power of digital influence? And to what end? Now is the time to survey the issues and explore the principles of persuasive technology, and B.J. Fogg has written this book to be your guide.<br><br>* Filled with key term definitions in persuasive computing<br>*Provides frameworks for understanding this domain<br>*Describes real examples of persuasive technologies</span>

                    <span>Through my professional interactions in the Silicon Valley, I'd heard of BJ Fogg's Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford, but had always immediately associated negative or unethical implications with the term "persuasive technology." This book opened my eyes in a delightful way to the positive current and future applications of this science. For anyone who interacts with computer technology, whether from a design perspective or as a user, this book provides a thorough understanding of how interactive computing systems can change our attitudes and behaviors. <P>Although based in research and academia, the book is not overly academic, but takes advantage of a somewhat textbook style of organization to make the concepts clear and easy to grasp. Illustrations, references, highlighted definitions, and bulleted summaries reinforce the concepts or give a quick shorthand depending on how you prefer to read the book. Fogg peppers the text with excellent real-world and hypothetical examples. I found the hypothetical examples most intriguing and suspect (or at least hope) that we'll see many of them become reality in the not too distant future.<P>As a marketer not unfamiliar with the concept of persuasion, I found the chapter on Web Credibility in particular a valuable source of guidance on how to better design web sites and build trust into the experience. As a consumer, I was fascinated by the possibilities for persuasive mobile technologies - especially the idea that the most successful motivating mobile technologies will be those that best serve the personal goals of the user, rather than intrude into our lives and betray the trust we will eventually need to place in them. <P>In writing this book, clearly Fogg was not only attempting to educate us about this new field of study, but also to persuade us that the future of interactive computing technology can have some very positive outcomes if we understand and respect the humans on both ends of the equation. I believe he succeeded.</span>

                    <span>Think you are in control of your life? Think again! Persuasive Technology is an ?eye-popping? look at how we are being influenced everyday by devices and computers. The use of technology for persuasion in the future will expand beyond mere advertising, marketing and sales. Your success in the future is dependent on understanding how captology works and how you are or can be manipulated. Awareness and education are the first step towards embracing new technologies and using them to your advantage. You could sign up and study at the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford to learn more, or you could read the book!<P>Dr. Fogg clears the ?fog? and mystique around captology and persuasion by interactive devices. He offers frequent thought-provoking examples of captology in everyday life. In Persuasive Technology you learn how persuasive technologies are already influencing you, and how you can use your new found knowledge to your advantage.<P>What is captology? In the book you will learn that ?captology focuses on the design, research and analysis of interactive computing products created for the purpose of changing people?s attitudes or behavior.?<P>As you will learn, persuasion has always been with us. Governments have long been known to attempt to influence their citizens. Some years ago, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) had a series entitled ?Films of Persuasion?. The show examined how the government produced movies aimed at changing citizens? attitudes and allowing the government new power. What is different today? Interactivity! With interactive persuasion, persuaders now ?adjust their influence tactics as the situation evolves?.<P>The book is easy to read and ?human engineered? for easy use and optimal retention. Each chapter is complete with references for further study and notes for clarification. Key points are visually summarized in tables in the chapters. All in all a well thought out format and presentation.<P>The first five chapters cover the groundwork needed to understand captology. Later chapters discuss credibility and ethics. The book concludes with a glance to the future of this emerging field.<P>Persuasive Technology gives you the resources for understanding how you are or can be persuaded by technology. It also provides skills for reseaching, designing and using captology.<P>B.J. Fogg has given us the golden keys to the future. Whether you are a businessperson, or student?or just plain curious, you will gain insight and power. As Spiderman once said, ?with power comes great responsibility?. Use you new knowledge to your advantage, but be gentle dear reader. After completing the book you will find that you have a great new power ? knowledge of captology.</span>

                    <span>An excellent introduction to CAPTology, the study of Computers As Persuasive Technologies. Fogg takes us through the core principles (42 in all) of using computers as persuasive agents, and the research he and others have done which underpins those principles. In the process he provides a fascinating look at cutting-edge and potential future applications of computer and mobile technologies (such as location-linked reminder systems) that could enhance our lives. However, he does not dismiss the darker uses of the technology and the very real ethical issues it raises. Towards the end of the book, he argues that studying computer-human persuasion can provide new insights into human-human persuasion, and the crossover in many of the principles discussed is readily apparent. I took away from this book a new awareness of how systems used in my organisation could be enhanced to make things better for our customers, as well as a deeper understanding of persuasion in general. I would also recommend "The Media Equation", which discusses some of the same issues as well as similar issues related to television.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Fogg makes several critical points that are essential to improving the US healthcare system, particularly in the area of preventative disease:<P>Computers offer an advantage over traditional persuasive media because they are interactive.<BR>As a tool, computers can be persuasive by making target behavior easier to do.<BR>Leading a user through a process aids in persuasion.<BR>Persuasive technologies often perform calculations or measurements that motivate.<BR>As a medium, a computer will be persuasive if it allows users to explore cause-and-effect relationships.<BR>Computing technologies that help people rehearse a behavior can be persuasive.<BR>Persuasive technologies can provide users with vicarious experiences that motivate them to change their behavior.<BR>By rewarding people with positive feedback, computers act as persuaders.<BR>Persuasive technologies often model a target behavior or attitude.<BR>Computers that create a relationship with the user and provide social support are effective persuaders.</span>

                    <span>If you've ever wondered how technology is subtly and shaping how we think and work, this is the book for you. Years of scholarly research at Stanford has allowed BJ Fogg to use the foundations of rhetoric to show how web and other 21st century techologies affect how we make choices, sometimes subconsciously, and can be used to shape quite deliberately our expectations about the choices we make. Probably too much of an overview for the engineer, IT, psychology or advertising professional, the book is nonetheless a very thorough treatment of the subject for any of them, and for the general reader, with lots of well-researched citations for those who want to know more. Good layout and design, with attractive visuals and illustrations throughout bring the subject to life and reinforce the solid and provocative points Fogg is making. Arthur C. Clark once said "the best technology is like magic" and BJ Fogg tells us how the magic of technology is influencing the choices we make. For anyone working on e-business, or wanting to understand why the website is working (or not), or giving orders to your web designers, this is the book to have.</span>
