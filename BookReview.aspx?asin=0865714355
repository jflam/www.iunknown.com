                    <span>Jo Nelson presents a profound, yet simple method to help teachers, administrators, students and others effectively think, learn and work together.<p>The book opens with this quote from John Ralston Saul:  Thinking, questioning, and imagining are the tools of human consciousness, the things that make us different from animals or machines.  These are the tools of initiative; the initiative responsible individuals need in order to participate and to construct their lives.<p>The book proceeds to offer a process in which we can begin to use these tools of human consciousness.  The text identifies five functions of the method which have the potential to: ·	extend thinking and learning capacity.  ·	make learning meaningful.  ·	make communication in groups effective.  ·	help prevent and solve problems.  ·	strengthen the effectiveness of evaluation. <p>The focused conversation method uses questions at four levels:  1.  The Objective Level- questions dealing with data and sensory observation.  2.  The Reflective Level - questions related to personal reactions and associations.  3.  The Interpretive Level - questions about meaning, significance, and implications.  4.  The Decisional Level - questions concerned with resolution. <p>Canada's Institute of Cultural Affairs refined the focused conversation method as part of its Technology of Participation, which leads people through certain phases of reflection, enabling them to process their experiences as a group. A leader/facilitator asks a series of questions to elicit responses that take a group from the "surface of a topic to a topic to its depth implications for their life and work."<p>The book is divided into three main sections: theory, application, and examples of focused conversations. The book presents over 100 examples of planned focused conversations that address: ·	Making learning meaningful  ·	Making communication effective in groups  ·	Preventing and solving problems  ·	Creative applications <p>There are examples of the method for use in the classroom, with parents and the community, teachers and staff. <p>This method has a great potential for use in the education profession.</span>
