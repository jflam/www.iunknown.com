                <span id="Label1">When you consider that old-fashioned tearjerkers are an endangered species in Hollywood, a movie like <I>The Notebook</I> can be embraced without apology. Yes, it's syrupy sweet and clogged with clich&eacute;s, and one can only marvel at the irony of Nick Cassavetes directing a weeper that his late father John--whose own films were devoid of saccharine sentiment--would have sneered at. Still, this touchingly impassioned and great-looking adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks novel has much to recommend, including appealing young costars (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) and appealing old costars (James Garner and Gena Rowlands, the director's mother) playing the same loving couple in (respectively) early 1940s and present-day North Carolina. He was poor, she was rich, and you can guess the rest; decades later, he's unabashedly devoted, and she's drifting into the memory-loss of senile dementia. How their love endured is the story preserved in the titular notebook that he reads to her in their twilight years. The movie's open to ridicule, but as a delicate tearjerker it works just fine. <I>Message in a Bottle</I> and <I>A Walk to Remember</I> were also based on Sparks novels, suggesting a triple-feature that hopeless romantics will cherish. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>When I read a book and/or see a movie that inspires me, I want to become a better person.  Everyone should be so lucky to have a person love them just a fraction of the time this story tells.  This is the best love story I have ever seen.  It inspired me to look at my life and remind myself how very lucky I am, as well.  </span>

                    <span>This is updated version of that ole love story most all of us love and endures.  Here, though is added the modern dilemma of Alzheimers, and its pain, but its defeatedness by a vibrant, mature love.
<br />
<br />The acting here is superb from the young Noah and Allie to in my mind the excellent performance by Garner and Rowlands.  
<br />
<br />The cinematography is excellent, around vintage low-country mansions and towns of Charleston coastline.  The opening scenes are superb work and the soundtrack is adequate.
<br />
<br />This is lighthearted movement of the developing story between two young lovers from across opposing sides of the tracks and their struggle through parents, war and new found loves.
<br />
<br />Won't divulge any of this excellent Sparks written work.  Will definitely now take this volume off the wife's shelves to read and compare with the movie version.

                    <span>I gave this movie 5 stars. It is the first movie that actually made me cry! 
<br />First, it takes place in a nursing home. Noah is reading the notebook to his wife, Allie. Allie has a deisease where she forgets things, and even forgets people.
<br />In the beginning, it takes place in the 1940's in North Carolina. There is a rich girl named Allie, and a boy poor named Noah. In the beginning, Noah really likes Allie, but Allie dosen't really like him. Noah asks her on a date by hanging on a bar at the ferris wheel at the carnival. Allie says no, but Noah is about to slip, so she says yes. They go on a date and dance in the streets. Allie's parents do not like Noah, and want her to date someone who is rich. They are still in love. When it is time for Allie to move out of her summer home, Noah writes a letter to her everyday of the year, for one year. Her mother hides the letter from Allie, because she dosen't like Noah. Allie dosen't know that he even sent her letters. As time goes on, Noah buys a old house that Allie said she would love to have. Though he has not seen her in a while, he makes the house the way Allie would like it, even the blue shutters she wanted. In the meantime, Allie is getting married to a very rich man named Lon. On (Or near) her wedding day, she sees an atricle about Noah in the newspaper, and a photo of his home. She wanted to see Noah, so she goes back to North Carolina to see him. They end up falling in love again.
<br /> All I will tell you is that the ending is a bit of a suprise, and VEERRRRRRRYYYYY sad!
<br /> I would suggest this movie for anyone about 12 and up. I am 11, though. There is some breif nudity, some cursing and lots of making out.</span>

                    <span>I love the film. It was very inspiring, romantic and also somewhat poignant film. I have read the book and it made me cry. Very few people are capable of loving that way. Sadly, there are very few of them. I highly recommend the film for the romantics. </span>

                    <span>I have never seen a girl cry more than I did watching this movie!! She cried seemingly through the entire thing.... It was a great love story, tragic and happy all wrapped into one.
<br />
<br />Drop the macho trip, enjoy the movie... your lady friend will appreciate the sentiment.</span>
