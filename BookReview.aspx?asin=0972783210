                    <span>I have read just about every trading, stock scandal, biography type book and this was probably the worst book I've ever read.  
<br />
<br />As far as Kessler as a writer, he is decent.  The stories were told nicely but the content is what disturbs me.  This was the first book I've read of this type concerning analysts.  I am very familar with analysts and how they work and have done some analyst work myself.  This book justifies to me why analyst are the most worthless people on wall street and how investment banking has ruined the true, real analysts similar to how Kessler described himself in the early years.
<br />
<br />Now to the stories.  Lets just say that analyst are no traders and shouldn't even be hanging out with them.  Kessler's "wild" tales sound more like a frat house than a Wall Street war room.  $4000 dinner?  Big deal.  Almost got into a fight?  Whew, that was a close one Andy.  What disturbes me the most is how he never talks numbers.  So and so did this deal and so and so got paid for this.  How much?  Why should I be excited that you donated 6 months of your life and earned 200K airline miles if you're not going to tell me how much you and/or your associates earned?  Most of the deals he participates in he doesn't see a dime from.  What the hell?  So you devote your time and life to kiss butt in anticipation of getting a bone.  The only good thing he did is get out and go to the buy-side of the business.  Kessler spends countless chapters relating stories of traders and other Wall Street bankers that were busted and thrown in jail for this and that, but he tells them in passing as if he read them in the Wall Street Journal instead of getting the inside scoop.  
<br />
<br />Perhaps the worst story of Kessler's is his supposed encounter with the infamous Nick Leeson of Barings Bank in a Hong Kong bar.  He claims he will never know if it was Nick but it couldn've been.  Great.  So he could've encountered an infamous trader who did way more wild stuff than him but he is not sure it was the right guy.  Let me help you out.  It was not Nick Leeson.  First of all Nick Leeson never traded bonds as you claim the man was a bond trader.  Secondly, the encounter took place in 1990 and even if he had been trading bonds, Leeson was not trading in Asia until the early to mid 90s.  Great story by the way.
<br />
<br />Basically this book illegitimizes the analyst business and proves to me how boring and worthless those people are.  I would advise to read this book only if you are interested in falling asleep.  </span>

                    <span>The author, an ex-analyst of Morgan Stanley, talked of his personal encounters with some of the fallen angels of Wall Street (Mary Meeker is still there), the change in the role of analysts from research/brokerage support to investment banking/IPO tool that effectively broke the firewall/Long Wall between the two functions within the same company at investors' expense, and the interference of regulatory bodies that did more harm than good. 
<br />
<br />To me, this is the second most interesting book of its kind, after Fiasco and better than Liar's Poker. It wont help your trading or investment, if you already know the uselessness (or how intoxicating in the author's term) of "recommendations" of those analysts who are paid in proportion to the qty and quality of suckers. The many bits and pieces are so interesting. If you wanna read for fun, this must be it. 
<br />
<br />p.s. In case the term "Morgan Stanley" still means something to you, listen to Barton Biggs only, and neglect all else, especially Bryon Wien and Mary Meeker, in the author's opinion. </span>

                    <span>"Wall Street Meat" is an irreverent tale, larded with expletives and sophomoric humor.  And yet, I liked it - perhaps because it's such an amusing corrective to the myth that Wall Street is a buttoned-down place where everyone comports themselves like effete investment bankers.  On the contrary, Kessler's Wall Street is like a frat party where the beer never stops flowing.  And having proven skills is certainly not a prerequisite for entry into its clubby atmosphere.  
<br />
<br />Kessler seems a bit off-key when defending old chums Jack Grubman and Frank Quottrone - leaving me with the impression that Wall Street's blas√© attitude towards the investing public may have infected him as well.  To be sure, there is probably some truth to his criticisms of IPO lockups and other instances of regulatory overreach.
<br />
<br />I look forward to reading the sequel, "Running Money".</span>

                    <span>Having taken a company public in 1995, surviving several liquidity crises (common for advanced medical technology companies trying to negotiate the FDA with innovative therapies), then getting crunched in the `Mother of All Liquidity Crises' in 2001, I found Andy Kessler's book a great read. He accurately captures the personalities, the behaviors, and the ethos of Wall Street from 1990 to the bust. The most unfortunate thing about this period, which Kessler does not mention, is that some great innovations and good young companies had their fates sealed by those who were (mis)guided by greed and fame. All of us were the losers as this was not a zero sum game. 
<br />
<br />I urge Kessler to write again, this time on the subject of hedge funds and short positions. While hedge funds and short positions can serve a positive purpose in correcting stocks that are overpriced, they can also be a real challenge for young, fragile companies. Short positions are taken with the HOPE that the value of the company will decline significantly. Today, as in the late 90's, some of those with short positions will do whatever it takes to drive a stock price down, including the spreading of lies. Young companies need to focus on execution. They do not have the time nor resources to fend off the swirl of lies that go hand in hand with large short positions. There is no transparency here as with other investment instruments. As such, there is room for plenty of mischief. 
<br />
<br />This is a must read for any development stage CEO or CFO. For those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. Despite the attempts by Spitzer and others, the pattern of the late 90's will again emerge, albeit in a different form.

                    <span>Andy Kessler's "Wall Street Meat" is a breeze of a read: an often funny (sometimes hilarious) series of anecdotes that combine to provide an insightful, critical look at the workings of Wall Street and the technology capital markets of the 1990s.<p>Kessler recounts his days on Wall Street, starting as fresh-scrubbed engineer who stumbles onto the Street almost by accident, to his departure and subsequent career investing in and writing about technology from Silicon Valley.  He had the good fortune to learn the ropes from an old school traditionalist, which allowed him both to be successful in the old fashioned sense (achieving a top analyst ranking, as determined by clients) and to understand the transition that happened in the 1990s, as analysts became more involved in investment banking and, in many cases, lost their bearings in the telecom/Internet boom and bust markets (Jack Grubman being the penultimate example).<p>What makes Kessler's book so powerful is that he calls it as he sees it, from his objective, fundamentally grounded insider's viewpoint.  He's made enough money, he's happy in his career, and he cares deeply about the future of Wall Street, so he's not out to perform character assassination; he truly wants to point out what went wrong (and does so in a very entertaining fashion) and make suggestions for reform.  He doesn't put much weight in additional regulations and prosecutions, believing that reputation is a more effective mechanism for ensuring proper behavior over the long term.  Rather, Kessler pushes structural economic reforms such as a "synthetic Goldman Sachs" in which stock research could be performed by truly independent, stand-alone entities (TheStreet.com isn't there yet, according to Kessler), and ending IPO lockups, to eliminate the huge post-IPO pops that happened during the boom and which led to such a frenzy of deal making.  The Dutch auction method for allocating and pricing IPO shares, which Google is using during its upcoming IPO, could also eliminate this problem.<p>WSM is a must read for Wall Streeters, and people involved in the financing of technology companies.  Individual investors (especially tech stock investors) would benefit greatly from reading WSM, to learn Kessler's cautionary tale of how the Street really worked during the boom, and what perversions remain.</span>
