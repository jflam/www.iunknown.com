                    <span>The title pretty much sums it up. This book was...superb and it doesn't sugarcoat, either. What shocked me most was the chart on page 70 of this book showing minimum wages in other countries (4 cents an hour in Burma!!!!) versus some figures of the head honchos of the corporate world (Walmart's Walton family, according to this, is worth 67.5 billion). It will definitely make you look at the brand names in a different way. I know for sure I will not buy anything from Victoria's secret anymore, nor will I set foot in Walmart anymore unless I'm absolutely desperate for something I don't think I can get anywhere else. So be smart, pick up this book, learn a thing or two, and fight this corporate crap. You'll be much happier you did.</span>

                    <span>A fascinating, well-made, beautifully-printed gem of a book! Stuffed with color photos, eye-catching graphics, and the kind of quotes and data that makes you think, "Ooh, I gotta paperclip this page!" I'd like to buy a copy for many other people, if I knew they'd read it.<p>Unfortunately, the only criticism I have is also fairly severe: the sub-title is "How to make conscious choices to change the world." Sorry to say, but the book never really goes very far into that aspect. There's meticulous detail on the nature and origins of globalization, social injustice, environmental crises, and human rights, but actual guidance to make a difference is fairly slim. <p>That's too bad, too, because the book excels in its ability to outrage the reader and convert you to the agreement that "this stuff really matters! It's more important than I thought!", and yet I find myself dissatisfied with the few suggested answers against the many overpowering wrongs. It's not "an action guide," but rather a fascinating and invaluable textbook.</span>

                    <span>Wonderful book.I strongly agree with the comments from one of the reader regarding information/media activism. We have to move from thinking and talking to real action. As a young activist, I would love to be coached ( like so many others ). We need a system where we could share, get support and empowerment. We learn by action not by information. Sometimes I feel kind of upset, because I feel that people that have the power, network and interest in global issue are doing this for their own ego. Bono from U2 is doing a good effort but why is he not spending his money to help young leaders ? We should invest in those people that will have a tremendous impact localy and abroad. Why not using technology to create a powerful leverage. A place where people like me could get support, coaching in my project ?<br>It was a great book to read, but I felt more discouraged than emporwered...</span>

                    <span>Congratulations on your fabulous new book. It is a masterpiece!<br>I applaud this work, its connectedness and passion.<br>Most of all I admire its courage to say, so clearly, what needs to be said.<br>It's truth  resonates with me.<br>I noticed with great interest that mentioned (page 140) was the gap between the military budget and the trickle that goes towards preventing wars.<br>As you probably know, globally, we spend $780 billion every year on the military.<p>`Transform the Military' suggest that we convert just 1/3 of that amount each year to fix the following problems.<p>*Eliminate Starvation and Malnutrition                         *Provide Shelter<br>*Provide Health Care and AIDS Control                        *Stabilise Population<br>*Prevent Soil  Erosion                                                      *Eliminate Illiteracy<br>*Provide CleanWater                                                      *Clear Land mines<br>*Disarm Nuclear Weapons                                 <br>*Address the Refugee Problem<br>*Support Democracy                                                     *Halt Deforestation<br>*Address Global Warming        <br>*Prevent Acid Rain<br>*Ozone                                                           *Retire Developing Nations debt.<br>While ever we direct money towards the military we are saying that conflict resolution can only be achieved by military means and we all know that is not the case.<p>We wish to write war out of future history and we believe that `Transform the Military' is the way to make it reality. We are asking  that capital,  personnel  and expertise as well as 1/3 of the budget be redirected towards human and environmental needs. Anita I am grateful for what you contribute to the world. <br>Well Done!!!<br>Yours in Peace<br>Faith Charity</span>

                    <span>Ms. Roddick has managed to put together some important issues, outstanding commentators, and good information design in one place with this book.  I read it through from cover-to-cover (I seldom do this) and found myself both enlightened and inspired. I recommend it highly.</span>
