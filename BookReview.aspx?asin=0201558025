                    <span>I want to start saying that this is a book designed for Engineers, not for Mathematicians. It focuses on the tecniques, not on the arguments. This is not a book about combinatorics, it is a wide raging introduction (it lacks on definitions, and his proofs are a lot far away from mathematical ones). The Enegineers can use this book as a good reference. The Mathematicians can improve their lateral thinking, for them (well: us) it is book about problem-solving strategies.
<br />I will never use this book as a textbook for a graduate/undergraduate course, it can be helpful if used with another book about combinatorics: when you study a combinatorial object, you can read from this book the techniques it involves.
<br />The exercises are extremely exciting, when I read this book I spent a lot of time about its exercises (proportion read:solve = 1:3), and they led me to interesting results.

                    </div>
                    <span>Why I got this book: 
<br />It's a great feeling to know how computers work, when I decided that I want to make a career and a life out of computers, as its truly a passion for me, I delved deeper, discovering the true beauty in the Science part of Computer Science, so I decided to get Donald Knuth' "The Art of Computer Programming" - to describe that seminal, huge work, it's like biting more than you can chew while trying to drink from a fire hose, moreover, the technical and mathematical prerequisites for the work are sometimes too demanding, they require a huge amount of experience with discrete mathematics, although I had some lectures and read some books, none came close "Concrete Mathematics", it covers, from ground up (though with a dangerously steep learning curve) a lot of discrete mathematics topics, it is by far the most extensive work I've read about Sums and really teaches the algorithmic problem solving thinking skill the authors preach so much about, with small amusing comments written by actual students of this course, a comfortable format, and very good writing skills, you can feel these guys are great professors who enjoy this material and are passionate about teaching it.
<br />
<br />Recommended, though some better, less steep, introductionary text books are probably out there.
<br />
<br />Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Basically, I like this textbook. The material is interesting, the way the authors presented the material is inspiring, and they provided a lot of jokes to make even studying for exams not that boring. But there is one big problem which made me decided to rate this book only 3 stars instead of 5 stars: the authors like to use non-standard notations. For example: m\n means "m>0 and n=mk for some integer k". One of the worst thing in scientific world is writing things others cannot read, and the authors did this by introducing many strange notations. These things makes the good work sometimes almost unreadable. This is not computer systems in which we use "cp" for the copy command and "cd" for change directory command.<p>What a pity the authors did that. This textbook will be perfect without those strange notations....</span>

                    <span>This statement from a previous review:<br>"Very bright high school students have gotten through this text with little difficulty"<br>I dare you to present Hypergeometric functions in front of a highschool student... Most graduate students would be challenged with that!<p>This text is neither beautiful or elegant, and the little cutesy notes in the margins are distracting and childish.<br>(they are more memorable than the actual text)<p>Once the simplistic Towers of Hanoi and Josephus problem are presented, the authors totally ignore any problem solving and just blast into pure mathematical manipulations that are uninitiated.  Why bother with a trivial example at first, and no examples for the remaining most difficult concepts? <p>Throughout the text are statements like "Some sequences of numbers arise so often that we give them special names" <br>Oh really?  Where and why do they occur?  <br>What about the sequences that do not occur frequently? The authors see no need to explain this.  (Knuth: check out my expensive 3 book series, and dig for a few months)<p>And statements in the middle of chapters like:<p>"We now come to the most important idea in the whole book: generating functions."<br>Oh really?  Why are they so important? (this is never explained) If so, why doesn't it have its own chapter, instead of being buried in a chapter on binomial coefficients without a lead-up?<p>Find a closed form for:<br>f[n] = f[n-f[n-1]] + f[n-f[n-2]]; where f[n] = n/2<br>(You could memorize and learn all the math in this book, and it would never help to solve this. It handily skirts the tough fundamental questions about math.)<p>I've never read a more fragmented presentation than this book, for important concepts.<p>You get the distinct impression of little kids "tee hee, look at the cool manipulations I can do, and you cant...see how smart I am??"....Knuth is laughing all the way to the bank.</span>
