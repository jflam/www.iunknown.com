                    <span>While I don't agree with the author in that this is the only book I'll ever need, it is one of the book that I can't do without. This book was extremely useful when I was starting my own business; it really guided me in the right direction. Without this book and Guerilla PR Wired by Michael Levine, I would probably be only dreaming of my own business instead of actually owning one.</span>

                    <span>This is a very comprehensive (and big!) book. It covers all the basic steps you need to know about starting and running a business, from business forms to accounting to buying insurance to employee issues to purchasing. No one subject is covered in great depth, of course, but reading the book gives you a VERY GOOD IDEA of what kind of work you're getting yourself into when you run a new, small business. <P>Not every chapter will be worthwhile (I pretty much skipped the chapter on how to select office equipment) but most chapters are worth a quick look, and many were worth in depth review. Of all the "basic overview" type books about starting and running a small business that I've plunked down money for, this one is the best, HANDS DOWN!</span>
