He takes examples of good work and explains why it's good, as well as poor work and points out the deficiencies in a way this is both entertaining and enlightening. I don't agree with all of his opinions, but I very much enjoyed the book nonetheless.</span>

                    <span>As a college journalism minor, I found a lot of information in this book.
<br />
<br />When the author makes the case for using "said" to attribute quotes, it does make writing the quotes into the story much easier. However, I don't like using the same word over and over again, but that's a personal thing. I do like how it makes it easier to decide how to give credit for a quote though, less guess work on the part of the writer.
<br />
<br />The "Mixed Metaphor" section of the book was great for evaluating my personal writing.
<br />
<br />The examples in the book are pretty good articles. I really liked "Churubusco's All Round Nice Guy". I read the story and thought that it was a little reminiscent of Anna Quindlan's style of writing, especially in her piece "Homeless".
<br />
<br />Had I not needed this book for my journalism class, I most likely would not have bought it. However, I think that it is a good resource for those who write.</span>

                    <span>"The Associated Press Guide to News Writing" makes more points in 136 pages than do most writing books four times the size. One would expect no less from a master news editor like Rene Chappon. The formula Cappon follows is to write a very brief explanation of a problem; an example of the problem; a sentence dissecting the example; a rewriting of the problem sentence; and a summary of the topic. The result is almost always memorable. Consider this typical section on The Elegant Variation (capitalized words below are italicized in the original):<p>***<br>Writers who believe that the repetition of plain words within shouting distance of each other is crude take off on synonym safaris.... It's all the more grotesque as there are few true synonyms and the author may introduce misfits:<p>"The mayor's task force was asked to meet with the owners of the STRUCTURES, discuss whether they wanted their BUILDINGS preserved, and recommend ways to adapt older EDIFICES to new use."<p>STRUCTURES could be anything and EDIFICES is too grandiose; the story concerns commercial and apartment buildings. If the author didn't want to repeat BUILDINGS, a pronoun was the way out:<p>"...to meet with the owners of the buildings, discuss whether they wanted THEM preserved, and recommend ways to adapt the older ones to new uses."<p>The same craving for daintiness will convert elephants to PACHYDERMS, dogs to CANINES, cats to FELINES, tigers to STRIPED PREDATORS and cars to VEHICLES. Petroleum becomes BLACK GOLD, snow becomes WHITE POWDER (a justly forgotten poet once called it "God's dandruff"), a banana turns into THE ELONGATED YELLOW FRUIT.<br>***<p>The benefit of this style is that Cappon's admonitions pop up unasked whenever we commit one of the sins he identifies. I find that "elongated yellow fruit" frequently superimposes itself on my more tortured prose.</span>

                    <span>AP Guide to Newswriting would have to be the most informative and thorough book on newswriting I have come across. It is clear and concise and deserves a prominent position on every journalists bookshelf. With the excellent price tag why hesitate? <br>Now, if only I could get all newswriters' to follow Cappon's example. Thanks Cappon for keeping it short and sweet!</span>

                    <span>I barely received my copy, and the <br>advice/help on being a better writer<br>is pretty good. One thing that stands <br>out in the book is the issue of vulgarity,<br>and that is simply a no when it comes<br>to writing journalism. The other areas<br>are well explained, and i tell any one <br>who is reading this small paragraph, get it,<br>it is worth it! It will definitely help you<br>get more creative with your writing, this is <br>like the bloom's taxonomy of writing.</span>
