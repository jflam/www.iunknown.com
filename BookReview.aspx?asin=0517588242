                    <span>Mr Haviza should stick to the comic books. Not only does this book provide recipes comparable to starbucks, it gives insight on how to tweak starbucks a little to bring out even more boldness. So Mr Haviza, just read the book again.  This time without Abby sitting on top of you in all of her glory, although that is a pretty sight i might add</span>

                    <span>Mathew Tekulsky has set forth clear information and instructions for the begiining barista.  He offers decent tips for making a good cup (Use fresh water, the importance of the proper grind, don't boil the water, and clean your equipment regularly).  He explains clearly the various methods for brewing (drip, French press, vacuum method, the percolator etc.)  And, of course, he has info about making espresso properly.<p>Most of the book consists of recipes, and I appreciated knowing the difference between, for example, the Cappuccino and the Cappuccino Royale (the Royale is a Cappuccino topped with whipped cream, and often with almond, rum, brandy, mint, or vanilla extract).<p>If you're a beginner, it's useful to have this information all in one place, but I must say that most of this is readily available on the Internet.  And, you don't need this book if you have some coffee-brewing experience.</span>

                    <span>Maybe I didn't read int the information enough prior to purchasing this book, but I found it to be very basic.  More like a text book than a recipe book.  Lots of history and background information, and slim on the recipes.  Most of this information you can easily find on the internet.  I was looking for a guide to make what you might buy and Starbucks, and though a couple might be here I think it is a far cry from how they actually do it.  This book was published in 1993 maybe things have evolved since then.</span>

                    <span>This is a relativly simple book for those who want to impress their friends with a tasty coffee.  However if you are a true espresso fan you may be dissapointed, I find the book has more of a candy appeal than true coffee expressions.</span>

                    <span>As I am French, I enjoy a good cup of cafe au lait. But if you are looking to broaden your horizons, this is the book to own! A coffee lover's heaven, there are lots of great recipes that will be sure to please. Very handy for  parties, afternoon gathering or just for yourself. Absolutely wonderful!</span>
