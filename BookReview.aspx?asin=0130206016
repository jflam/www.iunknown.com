                <span id="Label1">The third edition of <I>Unix System Administration Handbook</I> stands  as a fantastic Unix book, perhaps one that's destined for legend. It's arguably  the best general Unix book around. Don't delay in getting it, and don't spend  too much time flinching at the price; it's worth it. If you work with Unix--in  any of its flavors--you'll use this book, and frequently.<p>  How, then, to begin the song of praises for the book? Let's start with its  comprehensiveness. The authors--a whole passel of them, but miraculously  consistent in style--deal with every subject that's central to the Unix  universe. Their diligence extends even to detailed coverage of subjects (like  the Domain Name System (DNS)) that many authorial squads omit. System  administrators need to understand it all--it's good to see everything covered in  one book. Of course, you still will need more focused texts for really  complicated situations, but the coverage here will carry you a long way.<p>  Although you probably will want to read this book cover to cover eventually, you  might first look at the index, which typically will guide you to a couple of  sections. First, an overview of the subject that interests you will explain what  the service or feature is meant to do, what it isn't meant to do, and how (in  fairly general terms) it does its job. You'll find four sections--one each on  the relevant configuration facts of the four emphasized Unix variants. These  sections aren't presented as explicit sequences of steps (which invariably leave  the reader asking, "But, what if... " anyway), but as narratives that are  interspersed with commands and configuration file listings. The approach works  well, and it's made even better by the syntax summaries and conceptual diagrams  that pop up now and then. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Administration of Unix systems, with specific reference  to Solaris 2.7, HP-UX 11.00, Red Hat Linux 6.2, and FreeBSD 3.4. Administration  is a broad subject, and the authors touch on most of its aspects, including user  and file operations (basic and advanced), hardware configuration, and kernel  tweaking. Networking coverage includes basic connectivity, routing, server  software, DNS, and security.</span>

                    <span>Well, when i started my unix administration and networking studies i,ve got two books "Unix for programmers and users" and "Unix system administration handbook". First time i opened this book i was scared! Wow! 'It's too heavy for me, better i start with "Unix for programmers ..." Wrong! Learning thousends of commands and shell scripting without understanding how the unix systems works is completly useless! "Unix system administration" handbook gives you almost everything you need to build your own unix administartion baseground! It seems to be hard at the beginning but it's worth your pain! It was much easer for me to keep understading scripting and commands when i read this book! And now working on meny different kinds of unix OS and networks i am still comming back to the source. Why almost, beacause i was missing some deeper chapters about nis or nis+ and tcp/ip networking (i mean routing, subneting adn so on...), but anyway i've got my roots grounded and i keep growing! And now i know what i am looking for!</span>

                    <span>I first bought this book in 1995, 2nd edition, and it enabled me to succeed at my new job writing software to generate CGI scripts to administer embedded unix boxes. I just had to spend 2 hrs a night for 3 months to read and learn whats in this book. This is no overnight read, but once you've learned what's inside, you are a GOD of system adminstration. There is no equivalent O'Reilly series book - by comparison, all the O'Reilly books are watered down 3x and subsets of this book.<P>The chapter that introduces the Internet is the best I've ever seen, over my 20 years career writing IP software. The information on how to manage disk drives is excellent. I bought the 3rd edition and gave my 2nd edition to the most promising syst admin at my previous employer. This book was recommended to me by the past president of Berkeley Software Design, Inc. as the best one available. This person is also past president and current executive chairman of SAGE - the systems administrator's guild.<P>If there is a tragic flaw in this book, it's probably that its weak on reference on where to go for even more information. Otherwise, this is _the_ _encyclopedia_ of systems administration.</span>

                    <span>This is the best Unix book I have ever read. As soon as I opened the cover, I could not put it down. This book is very in depth. I have read several Unix/Linux books and none come close to this one.<P>If you are an admin or becomming one, or if you want to go beyond being a simple user and know WHY and HOW things work in the *nix environment, then I highly recommend this book.<P>It is expensive, but well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>Buying this book new is a bit pricey. I bought a used copy and it was worth every penny. If you can't find it used, then spend the full price to buy it new. I can't imagine administering my FreeBSD server without this book. I had tried a couple other books that weren't nearly has useful as this one.</span>

                    <span>As an occasional Unix system administrator, I find that this is the book that I turn to the most. It is also quite readable and can be read front-to-back. However, Unix administration is a large enough topic that you should also get Essential System Administration by Aeleen Frisch (O'Reilly). There are some areas that this book covers more thoroughly, and some where Essential System Administration has the advantage. So get both.</span>
