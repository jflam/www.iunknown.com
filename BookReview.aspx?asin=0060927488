                    <span>I first came upon this Audio book about 8 years ago, and have yet to find an Audio book that reaches as deep into you as this one does. A Return to Love is a great Book, but it is a truly incredible Audio book! The tone of her voice, and the way it's spoken is so PERFECT, that you hear every word, and feel she is talking directly to "YOU"! I have listened to 100's of Audio books over the years, and STILL have not found anything close to this one. Deepak, Millman, Lucado, Dyers, Bach and as much as I hate to say it, even Mariannes other audios don't hold the magic this one does. If someone has found an audio that gets as deep into your soul as this one does, PLEASE write me and let me know what it is. <BR> If you have not listened to this audio book yet, and are looking for some spiritual enlightenment, you have no idea what your missing out on here! Buy the Tape, even if you have read the book!!! Time and time again, I have gone back and listened to this tape, and it never loses a bit of the magic I felt the first time I heard it. This Audio will remind you of so much you have forgotten through the years. The best Audio book I have EVER, EVER listened too! <BR> I have given these Tapes out many, many times as gifts to friends and got many people to listen to them, and I have yet to come across anyone that is not entirely blown away and touched deeply by them. This is an Audio Book you will listen to AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. ~~~~~ "MARIANNE, PLEASE DO AN UNABRIDGED VERSION OF THIS AUDIO BOOK!!!!"</span>

                    <span>Where do I even begin with this review? This book has entirely changed my life, my perspective, my attitude, my feelings about myself and others, I could go on and on. This is something that I cannot stop talking about. Anyone who is lost, confused about religion, who feels poorly about themselves or others, depressed, or just doesn't feel like life is much "fun" anymore.....read this book! I can't even tell you what a load it takes off and how wonderful it is to learn that God LOVES you, is not out to punish you, and only has your happiness in mind. I can suddenly walk into a room and feel GREAT about myself knowing that I am a BEAUTIFUL, wonderful child of God. It is the most amazing thing I have ever felt! From this book I have learned what life is about, and what it's not about. After reading it, I bought an additional 10 copies and hand them out to anyone who seems interested. My hope is that everyone can find this love that Maryanne teaches so that they may be as incredibly happy with themselves and their lives as I am today!<P>Thank you so much Maryanne, for changing my life!</span>

                    <span>A book called "A Course In Miracles" is unique in it's degree of wisdom.But, people sometimes experience it as an affront to their current belief system.Though it's authors have great wisdom, they didn't master 'people skills'.The book can leave some wondering "This isn't a cult thing, is it?".Because, the 'high and lofty' ideals can feel "too good to be true".That's where "A Return To Love" comes in.Marianne Williamson brings these high and lofty ideals 'down to earth'.<BR>In ACIM, the 'personality/individuality/emotion' element is nowhere near as well represented as the 'spirit/God' element is.But when your 'personal/individual/emotional' side is included equally well, the void and alienation feeling disappears.Though this book isn't perfect in this respect, it is still far less intimidating than ACIM.Which is not to say that ACIM ideals intend for our individual self to be left out.No, it's merely a communication gap that the authors haven't quite yet accounted for.M.Williamson is a mediator between ACIM ideals and a majority population.Only a minority of people could go 'straight to' ACIM.Because of "A Return To Love", many people who initially felt ACIM to be in competition with their own wisdom, will now feel less threatened.Williamson is moreso a 'people person' whose book is a beneficial option/addition to "A Course In Miracles".The best offering of "A Return To Love" though, is its approach to 'positive thinking'.(Though its not always 'refered' to, it does underlay the book).<BR>"Positive thinking" really is neither 'positive' nor 'negative'.It is 'truthful' thinking.(Williamson shows her faith in this fact via her sombre expression on the cover photo).She is well aware that 'love' equally accompanies our sad emotions as it does our happy ones.She does away with the 'sentimental' definition of peace and harmony, replacing it with a permanently helpful 'unconditional' definition.<BR>In closing: This author brings a very lofty and intellectual piece of work down to earth, making it easier to relate to.Though not perfect, it does aim wiser than many self-help books.</span>

                    <span>Praise to this book! I was just not expecting to have it change my life! I walked into the bookstore looking for something to help me with my ocassional destructive behavior and prayed to be led to the right one. I picked this edition up, sat on the floor, and was totally taken aback with just the introduction! I devoured the book in a short time and have decided to take a second run at a much slower pace. This book helped me to put "my purpose" and my self destructive behavior in a much clearer light. My husbands tells me he has definately seen a change in my personality. I know I've changed - I feel it - I feel wonderful!</span>

                    <span>Marianne Williamson is a New Ager who has found a way of capitalizing on troubled people by distorting the Bible using the book, "A Course in Miracles" as her guide to leading them to enlightenment. As an out of work actress her philosphy first appealed to the Hollywood Wackos and by word of mouth spread to the mainstream of society. Too bad Amazon doesn't have -0- star ratings. Don't waste your money on the gobbledegook.</span>
