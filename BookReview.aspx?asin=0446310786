                <span id="Label1"><I>"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out."</I><p>  Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression, <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up. <p>   Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from <I>Dracula</I> and plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind "when you really see them." By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often. <I>--Alix Wilber</I> </span>

                    <span>As if anyone needs to be told how brilliant this story is. I just had to put a word of honour in. 
<br />  With a brilliantly dramatic, funny and at times creepy plot, Harper Lee gave the world one of the most fantastic books ever written.
<br />  And its no wonder that with over 30, 000, 000 million copies of this book sold worldwide that she never wrote another novel!</span>

                    <span>I just read this novel for the first time, and I wish I hadn't waited so long to have read it. I wish I hadn't lived so much of my life without it in my mind, informing how I look at others and what I think my place in the world is, because I think this book does change how one sees good and its role in the lives of those hurt by the cruelty of humanity. 
<br /> 
<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the story of young Scout, who starts the book out remembering her life at the age of 6. Her brother, Jem, is 10, and their summer neighbor, Dill, is 7 ("I'm little but I'm old," he says.) (Interestingly, the character of Dill is based on Truman Capote, whom Harper Lee knew as a child.) Their father, Atticus Finch is an attorney, and their mother, who died when Scout was 2, figures not at all in the story. The family has a black maid, Calpurnia. Various neighbors are also mentioned: Miss Rachel, Dill's aunt; Miss Maudie; Miss Stephanie; Mrs. Dubose; and, of course, the Radley family, in the spooky house the children had to pass on their way to school. The novel begins with Dill's first summer in Maycomb, the small Alabama town that is the setting for this novel. Dill, Jem and Scout fixate on getting "Boo" Radley to come out of his house. Boo is a mysterious man, about whom the neighbors trade stories and with whom the children like to scare themselves. Atticus takes a dim view of the children using Boo and his life for various entertainments and chides them whenever he finds them engaged in one of their attempts to catch a glimpse of him. 
<br /> 
<br />The summer ends and Dill goes back to his family and the Finch children go to school, Scout for the first time. Her teacher discovers that Scout can read and tells her that her father's been teaching her all wrong and that she is not allowed to read at home any more with Atticus. Scout also gets in trouble the first day of school for standing up and explaining to the teacher why Walter Cunningham cannot accept a quarter from the teacher to go have lunch in town (he didn't bring lunch with him). Scout explains that Walter can't borrow a quarter because "he's a Cunningham." When that is insufficient information for the teacher, Scout says, "The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back--no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but they get along on it. ... You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any stovewood" (which is how they paid Atticus Finch for some legal work he had done for them). Miss Caroline smacks Scout's hand with a ruler; Scout tries to fight Walter in the schoolyard, and then Jem invites him home for lunch. Later Atticus promises Scout that even though she must attend school, he will still read with her every night. And so we get the tone of the father-daughter relationship, practical, loving, guidance and, more than anything, acceptance of Scout for who she is. Atticus also shows over the course of the novel the need to live up to the love his children have for him in his professional and personal life.
<br /> 
<br />Soon Atticus is engaged in a legal case that engenders criticism in the town. He has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus's "mistake" is that he actually means to defend the man. Scout and Jem hear criticism from their friends, but Atticus instructs them never to fight over it with other children, to hold their heads up high. He tells Scout that he could never tell her to do anything again if he walked away from this responsibility. The children watch the trial and the outcome, and the reader sees that like Boo Radley, Tom Robinson is one of the people hurt by the cold world and the evil that exists in humanity. Atticus strives to help his children understand and not be brought low by such cruelty like the hermit Boo and the convicted Tom. 
<br /> 
<br />Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand.
<br /> 
<br />I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town. Even when Ewell spits in his face, he maintains his dignity and seems to believe that Ewell needed to make the threat to carry on his life in Maycomb. Atticus is a kind of Christ figure of the Maycomb community. The children's neighbor Miss Maudie says nearly as much to their aunt, "Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It's that simple." -- this even while others are vilifying him for the work he did for Tom Robinson.
<br /> 
<br />As Scout grows, her capacity to to understand grows, too, and her fascination with Boo Radley changes into a kind of longing to meet this man, who never goes outside and has no friends. She wants to meet him and say "hey" to him and ask him how his day is. Her capability to love and be kind is growing, and she wants to share it.
<br /> 
<br />The ending of the book is the apotheosis of Scout's growing capability to live, understand and treat others with dignity, and we also see the ongoing example of Atticus to do right, along with other townspeople who want to protect the weakest and smallest among them. It is truly one of the most moving chapters I've read in my life. (I tear up just thinking about it!)
<br /> 
<br />The novel itself is charmingly written, the voice is of an older Scout who maintains her independence and zeal for life, but who understands more than the 6-year-old Scout did at the beginning of the narrative. The story flows smoothly, and the plot is engaging. If you haven't read this, you need to.

                    <span>This book teaches everyone a timeless lesson. It also teaches a lesson in friendship and excepting people the way they are. This book is set in the 1930's in a small town called Maycomb. The whole book seems to be centered around making the town recluse Boo Radley come out of his house, but don't let this cover up the real reason behind the book. When Scout's dad ,Atticus (a lawyer), defends a negroe in  court against a white man the town deals with one of the neverending problems in this world: prejudice. Not only do the towns people start being mean to Scout and her family but Scout's older brother Jem starts to grow older and has no time for his little sister. Scout begins to have a difficulty understanding everything that goes on. This book is a timeless classic and is a wonderful read for teens and adults alike.  </span>

                    <span>To Kill A Mockingbird is an interesting and exciting tale about a small town in the 1930's that is faced with one of the many problems of that time:prejudice against african americans. When Scout's father Atticus (a lawyer)agrees to defend a negroe in court against a white man, Scout's world is turned upside down. Not only that but people in the town start threatening Atticus and his family. Scout's older brother Jem is also changing and it becomes difficult for Scout to understand what's going on. When an unlikely friend saves Scout and Jem's lives Scout realizes that people aren't always what they seem. I give this  exciting and touching book two thumbs up.  </span>

<br />To Kill A Mockingbird is a powerful masterpiece at it's best. This classic tale was brought to life by Harper Lee in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961, and later became an Academy Award-Winning film. There are over 15 million copies in print with translations in forty languages. The story takes place in Alabama during the Depression, in the early 1900's. It is about a young girl, her brother Jem, and their lawyer father Atticus, who must teach his children the value of every human being, regardless of race. It is a life lesson that is taught not only to the characters in this book, but the reader as well. Harper Lee does a marvelous job allowing the reader to actually live the hatred, love, suspense and determination of this family to stand up for what they believe in. It is a test for them because in the days that To Kill A Mockingbird takes place, race issues were just coming to life, and the true lesson was yet to be learned.

<br />The storyline is about a young girl, Scout, who is at the age of curiosity. She wants to learn about everything, and looks to her older brother Jem to help her learn the ways of life. It is about a father that is forced to raise his children alone, after losing his wife. Through many hardships, this family learns about respect, love, personal growth, and most importantly they learn life lessons. "You never really know a man till you walk a mile in his shoes", says Atticus, who is defending an innocent black man, who is being charged for the rape of a white girl. In the end the real truth comes out, to no avail. The story is also about friendship, found in Dill, a boy that brings excitement to these two young characters. The three quickly become friends and they explore, play, learn, and love one another. 
<br />
<br />The story is based on Scout Finch, Jem, Dill, Atticus Finch, and many others who bring this book to life. The Radleys, who live next door to the Finches, are a strange and curious family to say the least. Through determination, they all quickly learn the Radleys aren't as strange as they would appear. There is Aunt Alexandra, who is very much against everything that Atticus believes in, she moves in with her brother and tempers flare. The neighbor, Miss Stephanie Crawford nurtures the children and aides them in ways only a woman can, since they lack a mother figure. Culprina, the black housemaid who has been helping Atticus raise his children, also guides this family into a world of understanding. Through all the characters, you find a perfect puzzle, that without just one piece, it would crumble. 
<br />
<br />The meaning of this book really touches on all the problems that are still very real in this world today. It is a true life lesson for the reader, young and old alike. I don't believe anyone can read this classic and not walk away with something truly special....Love For All.
