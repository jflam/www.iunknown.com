                    <span>This book is definitely a must have to compliment the text book. It explains the odd problems of the text in a good amount of detail. It was very helpful in getting me through the course.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for any student using the text book.  I thought this was a hard-as-nails course and this solutions manual was a lifesaver.  For some of those truly outlandishly difficult questions (granted they must be odd for this manual) this book will go over them.  Sometimes not to the degree of thoroughness as some might like but it gets the job done.</span>

                    <span>The other reviewer was obviously talking about "Discrete Math and Its Applications," which is the actual text book. This book is the student solutions guide for that text. So don't buy this book thinking that it is a text book, because this book was only meant to suppliment the text.<p>I found that this guide was a must have companion to "Discrete Math and Its Applications." It has the worked out solutions to many of the exercises in the text, which is very helpful. All-in-all, a definite must-have suppliment to the text.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good introduction textbook to discrete mathematics. I like it very much. You can learn a lot of the basic concepts such as number theory, mathematical deduction rules, combinotorics, graph theory,  asmptotic analysis of a simple algorithm, etc. The best thing about this  book is that it is written in such a way that everything is so clearly  stated that it can be well understood. Tons of examples provided along with  the concepts introduced are quite helpful. The problems at the end of each  chapter are a lot of fun to play with. It is a refreshing exprience for the  reader.<p>It is not recommended for more advanced level students.</span>
