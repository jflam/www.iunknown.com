                    <span>I do problems in these books like some people do crossword puzzles. This particular book has such a perfect flow, it's almost like a machine. I loved it. I can't imagine anyone already familiar with pre-algebra material not being able to learn all of basic algebra by using this book.

                    <span>This book has many great things inside of it, including step by step examples, however, not every topic is covered.  For example, systems of linear equations isn't discussed inside of this title.  Normal Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 classes use Linear Systems.  The further you go in math, the more you use these systems.  Without an understanding of them, you cannot solve certain problems.<p>Even though things like these are missing, it still helps those who need help with the basic algebra problems.  Example, fractions, decimals, and other things.  It can help in more advanced topics, such as quadratics.  I highly suggest this book to those who want a better understanding of pre-algebra or early-year algebra.  You can get a great understanding of variables, and more advanced things, however, nothing too advanced is covered.<p>If you are in Algebra 2, and you understand Algebra 1, do not purchase this book because it will not be useful to you.</span>

                    <span>For someone who has is not, and never has been good with algerbra, this book is the perfect tool.  I used this book to help me pass a college algebra course recently. In fact, I got an A in the course.  I would have failed it horribly had I not had this book to use as a reference from time to time.  So, if you are going back to school, or about to take algebra courses for the first time, I seriously recommend this book. The material in this book is not as difficult as a college course would be, but all the basic concepts are explained along with tons and tons of examples to work out.  <p>The strength of the book is in its simplicity.  Every chapter takes a very small step towards forward from previous material.  It goes slow enough, and there are enough examples, that all the basic concepts are actually easy to understand and quickly learned.</span>

                    <span>Some parents whose math skills are fresh, such as those in the sciences or engineering, may feel frustrated with the mediocre math instruction in their child's school. My daughter is a quick study with math, and not stimulated enough at school. I use this book for its wide variety of problems. I don't really care that the solutions are there; it is just wonderful to have someone else who has already created all the problems --- including word problems of many different flavors. The book is nicely laid out in bite-sized chunks (good for 20 minutes worth of work after dinner), so you can just work through a batch of problems to drill one technique into your memory. This is a part of my family time with my 12-year old daughter, and this book (with a few others) has moved her way way ahead.</span>

                    <span>Overall, the book is very good - easy to read, good examples, lots of helpful problems, and multiple choice review tests at the end of each chapter.  I'm using the book for review; I took algebra about 30 years ago and am going back to school this Fall.  <p>My one not-so-minor complaint is the number of obvious mistakes in the problems/solutions.  With better review/editing, they wouldn't be there.</span>
