A family summer on Cape Cod should help banish those thoughts; instead, they seep in everywhere. </p> <p> And this year Martha's routine at her beloved grandmother's beachside house is complicated by the Manning boys.

                    <span>When Martha hears the tragic news about the death of Olive, a shy girl in her class, she is astonished to discover Olive's unspoken wish to be her best friend. As Martha is haunted by the friendship she never had, her family plans their annual summer vacation to visit Martha's strong and intelligent grandmother, Godbee. <BR>This is one book for kids where the adult characters are just as complex and interesting as the children are. Godbee and Martha's mother and father have conflicts and issues that play out in the margins of Martha's narration. This perspective makes the family very realistically drawn. <BR>Martha and her brother hang out with the neighbor boys, and Martha develops her first crush. While the plot seems to lose direction after he betrays her by videotaping their poignant first kiss (the Olive thing really never goes anywhere), Henkes still keeps readers compelled with his detailed evocation of Martha's inner emotional life, the family's love for each other, and her relationship with Godbee. <BR>Don't read this book for the plot, read it for the memories and feelings it will evoke of summer vacation, first crushes (and first heartbreak) and the bittersweet first awareness of how short life is.</span>

                    <span>Olive's Ocean is a great book about a girl named named Martha who has a complicated life. After Olive, a girl in Martha's class, dies in an accident, Martha feels somewhat guilty. In Olive's last journal entry she hoped for three things: she wanted to become a writer, she hoped that one day she could go to an ocean, and she wanted to become friends with Martha. Now Martha is trying to fulfill Olive's dreams for herself, and Olive. <BR>This book has won the Newbery Honor and captures the hearts and minds of girls ten-fifteen who also cherished the book Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech.<BR>Kevin Henkes is a great fiction author who writes books for all ages. His writing is award winning from Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse to Olive's Ocean.</span>

                    <span>Author - Daniel Handler. Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography.<BR> <BR>Publisher - HarperCollins, 2002<P>Short Summary - A page-turner of a detective story, the book attempts to solve multiple mysteries, not the least of which could be, "Who is the author of this book, and can the author be trusted?" The reader becomes the spy, who follows clues found in various narrative threads. The result is a scrapbook-like top-secret file of artifacts for examination. As a fusion of genre, perplexing evidence crouches in familiar formats recognizable as pieces of letters, sheet music, theatrical scripts, photo-journalism, newspapers, secret codes, treasure maps, booklists, obituaries and revised diary manuscripts. In the end, the reader is left with unanswered questions, such as: "Is there anything a concerned citizen can do if he or she wants to help the Beaudelaires?" Both the hope of resolution and the burden of proof pass to the reader, upon joining this peculiar spy ring brotherhood. Initiates inherit a set of crucial tools of discovery and the passwords, "The world is quiet here." Join at your own risk. 212 pages<P>Brief Evaluation - "What can be hidden in a book?" Here's a book intended to stretch every reader's ability to find out. Junior High School-aged readers will be challenged, as a willingness to venture beyond oneself produces a much deeper sense of satisfaction in this reading experience. The results of any call for "thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down" on this book remains thoroughly dependent on the reader's level of literature appreciation. Recommendations using VOYA evaluation codes: 5 for Quality/ 2 for popularity. A superior book for younger readers with an interest in knowing more about literature and literary pursuits. An enjoyable, helpful book for readers learning to improve critical literacy skills.<P>Read Aloud Pages - ix - xvi, and discuss the reversible cover<BR>Literary Principle - allusion<P></span>

Knock on wood. :)(Why would someone write a review about a book before they read it)<BR>Martha Boyle has just strangely recieved a journal entry from a deceased classmates journal. The girl, named Olive, proclaims Martha "the nicest girl in class" (kinda unrealistic, since they had never formally met. While her family ( a mother, father baby sister, and teenage brother) have their yearly visit to Cape Cod, where her "godbee" lives, she finds herself thinking about Olive, forming a strong relationship with Godbee, and realizing that boys can be complete pigs at times.<BR>Read Olive's Ocean if you can relate to really DEEP people, who write unlike any REAL (...).</span>

                    <span>The premise of the story is very thoughtful. Kids do have to deal the death of a classmate sometimes. Martha's relationship with her grandmother is very special and Henkes writes very lovingly of their affection for each other. There are lots of intermediate and jr. high readers who love "growing-up-angst" stories. I think girls 4th grade and up would identify with Martha. It definitely has a place in an elementary library though it is important to remember the medal on the cover does not mean it is a match for all readers nor all age groups . Younger readers would not appreciate the issues Martha faces. The "language" referred to in other reviews is very mild. My main quibble with this book is that it is just [so] serious... <P>My guess is Henkes likes to go in a completely different direction from his picture books when he writes novels.</span>
