                <span id="Label1">Threesomes are hard, everyone says, but since kindergarten, Vanessa, Winnie, and Zoe&mdash;the End-of-the-Alphabet Club&mdash;have done everything together: sleepovers, trips to the library, games at recess. Yet now, as the world of ballet enters their lives, Winnie fears she will lose her two best friends.  Simply told and illustrated with heartfelt, spirited drawings, this early chapter book explores the mysteries and joys of friendship.</span>

                    <span>Winnie ROCKS! She's a sensitive, thoughtful girl, with a wonderful dad (single fathers take note!). She's also a bit of a klutz, just as I was at her age (still am today, despite the dance lessons). This satisfyingly sized 'gift edition' (slightly smaller than your average hardcover for middle readers -- it could almost fit in a coat pocket) is a perfect fit for that tricky 7-9 year old age. Perfectly suited to this transitional reader, there's quite a bit of art, and the wonderful illustrations often interrupt the text on the page as they often do in picture books.</span>

                    <span>I would not hesitate to give this book to any little girl. The reading level reaches that tricky 2nd-3rd grade group, while the storytelling is sophisticated,engaging, and as graceful as any pirouette! Though I haven't been in the third grade myself in about a quarter century, I still found myself looking forward to finding out what happens next in this true-to-life story about friendship and staying true to yourself. The lovely line illustrations by Alissa Imre Geis are perfectly suited to the text and really add to the delight of the book. Readers who enjoy Beverly Cleary, Johanna Hurwitz and Eleanor Estes will find a friend in Winnie, and will look forward, as I do, to whatever comes next from these new talents in children's literature.</span>

                    <span>Elementary school is a time of making and breaking best friends. Winnie and her two best friends are put to a test when ballet classes are offered for third graders in their school, and Winnie doesn't want to dance, though her friends do. This easy-to-read novel honestly shows the ups and downs of friendship, without being sappy or bitter. Readers will also find that being yourself is more important than following the crowd, and true friends will support you no matter what.</span>
