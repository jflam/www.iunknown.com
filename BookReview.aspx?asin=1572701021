                    <span>Not only is this a great book for professionals  who do a lot of public speaking, but it is also great for those of us who only rarely have the opportunity to speak or give presentations. <p>The level of nervousness is  much higher for those who do not consistently practice speaking, so they  need a lot of practical advice that they can put into practice immediately,  and they also need only that advice that has already been proven to work  well.  This book provides both.  <p>I discovered this book before my last  presentation and my delivery was immediately improved by using the  practical tips Mr. jeary provided in the book.  If you need to improve and  you need it in a hurry, you need this book.</span>

                    <span>As a professional trainer for a major U.S. web site design software tool company, I fly all over the country teaching our nation's teachers about our tools. <p>I wanted to improve my presentation / speaking skills and  happened to come across Mr. Jery's book. <p>It was just the thing I needed.  Why do I rate it outstanding? Because I have put many of Tony's ideas into  practise, and they work! <p>There is so much good advice in the book (love  the stuff about having a "conversation" with the attendees, not  lecturing them) here that I am now going to pass it along to many of my  assocaites I work with. <p>I am so impressed with the book, I'd like to now  sign up for one of his seminars! <p>Tony, if you read this, were do I sign  up! <p>Good job!<p>Yours,<p>Richard</span>
