                <span id="Label1">With his new book <I>Trilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution</I>, Richard Fortey confirms his status as one of the best communicators of science around today. His hugely enjoyable previous book, <I>Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth</I>, was shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc science book prize, but <I>Trilobite!</I> is sure to receive even greater acclaim. Whereas <I>Life</I> took the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--<I>Trilobite!</I> sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.<p>  Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author. A delightful read. <I>--Chris Lavers, Amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>This is a remarkable book that will introduce you to the process of science and a fascinating aspect of the emergence of life. Trilobites are among the best fossils for children to get to know because they are very distinct (the tri lobed shells) and very different from anything currently living (the horseshoe crab on American Atlantic beaches is comparable in unique appearance and attracts children with similar fascination).<P>For those who want a better system of American science education, Fortey gives some powerful hints. Consider his language: "The fever of discovery was upon me.... I found a trilobite...the textbook came alive...this was my first discovery of the animals that would change my life (p.18)." He continues, "I knew, by some principle which I could not articulate, that the wider end was the head of the animal. And of course upon the head there were the eyes. Despite the unfamiliar conformation of the fossil I knew that eyes must always belong on heads. So despite the exoticism of the fossil there was already a common bond between me and the trilobite - we both had our heads screwed on the right way."(p.19) <P>Again and again Fortey reminds us that scientists grow from discovery, mystery, romance, intrigue, while the memorization comes later. He reminds us that there is an enormous amount we still do not know and in the process introduces us to a world we have never considered: "I want to invest the trilobite with all the glamour of the dinosaur and twice its endurance. I want you to see the world through the eyes of trilobites, to help you make a journey back through hundreds of millions of years...this will be an unabashedly trilobite-centric view of the world,"(p.19).<P>For anyone who wants to take a few hours to think different thoughts, to consider how brief our history has been and how successful other organisms have been, to contemplate the various catastrophic extinctions and their dramatic impact on life, to ask about life beyond the rush hour traffic and the monthly report, Fortey's work is a little gem of an introduction to a fascinating part of the world. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book from the point of view of the elucidation of the life of 300 million years of trilobites as well as the view of the discovery process in science. Fortey gives a lucid account, that is funny also, of his involvement in his life work on trilobites. He describes the details of the structure of these invertebrates and how they evolved over time. Their remarkable diversity of structure allows them to be used for the elucidation of the evolutionary process as well as the construction of maps of the early world, which Fortey explains in charming detail. In the focus on the trilobite there is less said about the simultaneous evolution of the predators of the trilobites, such as the toothed fishes, and the eventual extinction of the trilobites. This is a great gift book for the young biological scientist and for the old ones also who love the process of discovery.</span>

                    <span>To my surprise Richard Fortey's Trilobite! turned out to be a rich and insightful book. Not many books have been written on this subject. If you are interested in paleontology and the trilobites then let me assure you that you will not be disappointed in this work. At first glance this subject may seem dry and uninteresting to some but Fortey who is a senior paleontologist and a curator at the Natural History Museum in London manages to curve out an entertaining plot that flows smoothly throughout. In Trilobite! you will treated to 16 pages of black-and-white (Color photos of fossils tell nothing of animal's realistic coloration, therefore, it is possible that Fortey decided to present them in this style. Perhaps, BW photos offer more detail) photos of fossilized trilobites, 40 illustrations including charts, maps and timelines. Fortey pays special attention to structure and function of trilobite's legs, eyes, shells, antennae and provides information on their habitat, climate of those periods, and feeding styles of the animals. What this book may be lacking is a set of color photos of virtual live trilobites.<P>I was delighted to finally learn in detail what Burgess Shale and Cambrian Explosion really were. Fortey wrote up a lucid history of science behind excavations and classifications of trilobites and scientists who worked and were involved in propelling this field.<P>Also, Fortey can definitely make his reader laugh from time to time. I was not distracted by his memories and other stories that he included in the work. He can give a good idea of what feels like to be a scientist.<P>All in all, this is a good presentation of the world of trilobites. It is a shame that so few books were written about the animals that endured approximately 300,000,000 years of existence on Earth. As Fortey puts it, we only survived ½ % of time of their dominion so far. I believe that richer works can be produced but for now we are left to enjoy this little gem.</span>

                    <span>Fortey's writing talent is capable and captivating. Whether describing the cliffs of Cornwall or his journeys in search of fossils, he keeps your attention in thrall. He is even able to lead us into the realm of arcane terminology. In an early section in this book we are carefully introduced to the physical structure of long-extinct creatures. With graceful descriptions, he demonstrates how to painlessly add eight new words to our personal lexicons. He has much to tell us and he relates his story and his science with evocative skill. The exclamation mark of the title certainly reflects his enthusiasm for the topic. With his ability to communicate that zeal, it becomes infectious.<P>Trilobites, he continually reminds us, lasted far longer than the dinosaurs - nearly 300 million years, compared to the saurians' 120 million. Their persistence, Fortey explains, is due to their adaptability. They were so efficient at finding and filling ecological niches they are sometimes referred to as "the beetles of the Paleozoic". Fortey shows how various species inhabited deep oceans, shallow seas or glided through the mid-depths of the seas. The only niche left uninvaded, Fortey ponders ruefully, was fresh water streams and lakes. Had they done so, he muses, they might have persisted to modern times. Whether that step might have precluded our evolution, Fortey sets aside for others to consider.<P>We learn the anatomy of these lost arthropods, how the structure of the legs was discovered, how they grow from minuscule diatomic forms to more than lobster-sized. The most engaging aspect of trilobites was the variety and form of the eyes. Unlike the squishy, liquid-filled sensitive orbs we carry, trilobites "learned" enough chemistry to form eyes of calcite crystals. These are arranged in a wide variety of patterns and structures, reflecting the animals' diversity. Some lacked them altogether, having never developed vision, or losing it as successive generations migrated to the stygian depths. <P>Fortey has traveled the globe in search of these mysterious creatures. From misty Newfoundland through snake infested Queensland to an Arabian site infested with scorpions. He insists the risks are ignored when a new fossil emerges from the rocks. You feel that every new find should have a champagne celebration to accompany it. Fortey, however, is content with beer - sometimes just a bit of cool water suffices. Every page of this book dispels the mistaken image of the unfeeling, austere, white-coated academic. His contribution to the science is inestimable - he's named 150 species. Yet those accomplishments pale against his love for the science and the creatures he studies.<P>In explaining the diversity of his treasured trilobites, Fortey takes us through the mechanics of plate tectonics. Geology is the science that birthed paleontology, and the two sciences have been intimately entwined for generations. In explaining why different types of trilobites evolved, Fortey traces the movements of continents over the millennia. East Coast Newfoundlanders may be pleased to read how their part of the island was once joined to the European continent to later merge with the western segment. The key to discovering this phenomenon was, of course, trilobite species differences. This kind of information Fortey offers within a framework of why these lost life forms are important for an understanding of who we are in nature. A fine addition to any bookshelf.

                    <span>I almost returned this book to the library after the disappointing first chapter. That would have been a mistake. Fortey's prose tend to ramble (the book just uses too many words to say what it has to say) but the content makes the prose (which, in fairness, often were entertaining) well worth wading through. I had the advantage of a keen ambient interest in the critters going into the book but Fortey's command of the key discoveries and their implications is outstanding and his passion for trilobites is contagious. The book could use about twice the figures, but has included over 25 including some very instructive ones. On the whole a worthwhile read.</span>
