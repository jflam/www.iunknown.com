                <span id="Label1">It is a well-known fact that most software projects fail. Drawing important lessons from failure is the goal of Bitter Java, a systematic account of common server-side Java programming mistakes, their causes and solutions.  This book covers antipatterns for base Java and J2EE concepts such as Servlets, JSPs, EJBs, enterprise connection models, and scalability. It illustrates common pitfalls of Java programming through code examples and then presents re-factored code and explains why the new solutions are safe.  <P>Written in an engaging style, this book begins each chapter with an extreme sports adventure gone wrong, and cunningly weaves the moral of the story into the discussion of Java development problems. Bitter Java begins with an overview of antipatterns and lays the foundation for server-side Java development. The author quickly builds momentum with a set of core server-side antipatterns for servlets and JSPs. He uses a bulletin board example to discuss common mistakes in basic server-side design, and iteratively refactors it until he reaches good design. By reusing this example, the author guides the reader through increasingly complex antipatterns of caching, database connections and EJBs. High-level discussions of programming hygiene and performance tuning, complete with related antipatterns, help to round out the coverage.  <P>The intermediate developer is the intended reader of this book but developers at all levels will gain insight from the discussions of basic design patterns for Java JSP programming, round tripping, the perils of ignoring caching and connection pooling. More advanced topics such as performance tuning, EJB and XML are also included. </span>

                    <span>While reading this book, I kept referring colleages past and present to information within as questions about "how should I..." popped up. It's an excellent set of reminders about lessons learned, and old lessons applied to current technology.<P>The content is very accessible to the intermediate programmer and budding architect, and the examples of implementations with problems followed by refactored improvements highly valuable. It's much better to learn learn from mistakes without making them all yourself, as the book points out.<P>The chapter on memory management under Java was a refreshing treat. Coming from a C++ background where resources are a major concern, I've heard many Java programmers use garbage collection in Java as a reason not to worry about resources. The book addressed how garbage collection worked in the past as well as current algorithms, and pointed out ways resources can be leaked quite easily. Awareness of a potential problem is one of the best tools a developer has, and the antipatterns addressed in this book will be ones I revisit when starting new projects. It's essentially defensive driving for developers, but fun to read!<P>Some sections concered areas I've only read about thus far, and it was interesting to see some problems in implementations based largely on following available "how to" guides. The list of suggested follow up reading will keep me busy for quite a while.</span>

                    <span>This book is all about learning lessons from common Java server-side development failures. It is aimed at intermediate java developers that have a basic understanding of design patterns.<P>Bitter Java is all about applications and examples of antipatterns and refactoring. It is about finding a problem and then going through the various solutions (continuous improvement).<P>We found the relationship between the first two examples ("Magic Pushbutton" and "Magic Servlet") very interesting. The author has a good method of explaining the problems to new Java developers. The first solution included the command and MVC design pattern.<BR>It is refreshing to read a book that comments on techniques included from Jakarta Struts.<P>Problems addressed in this book include:<BR>·	Monolithic Servlets and JSPs<BR>·	Caching dynamic content<BR>·	Memory leaks<BR>·	Database connection overuse<BR>·	XML misuse<BR>·	EJB Round-tripping<BR>·	Entity bean misuse<BR>·	Lack of coding standard <BR>·	Performance tuning<P>This is one of those books that you will want to read from beginning to end. We found the many personal stories before each key topic very enjoyable to read. Web page references are used throughout the text (mostly from IBM's web site). This book is packed with useful design tips and techniques for the serious Java server-side developer. Go and buy this book because you will want to read it many times.</span>

                    <span>This book is well written but I was expected something more advanced. If you have been a real J2EE developer for at least a year, you would probably have run across some if not most of the problems already. You also would have worked around them using solutions from other Java books you have.<P>This is a good book for new developers. They should be able to recognize problems early on after reading this book.</span>
