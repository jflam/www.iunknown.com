                    <span>I almost hesitate to write this review, as many of my fellow readers have already made excellent observations in theirs. But here is my two cents: Gilquist's book is ultimately neither a good introduction to Orthodox theology nor a convincing argument for following him on his journey East. There are three primary reasons I say this: (1.) his group's use of highly selective criteria in judging which was the "true church;" (2.) lack of response to or even mention of counter-arguments by Catholics and Protestants; and (3.)a somewhat "holier-than-thou" attitude which pervades the book.<P>To explain the first weakness: There were many characteristics of the 1st century church which are not commonly found today: congregations meeting in homes, public halls or synagogues; the pooling of financial resources for division by the Apostles; the widespread occurence of miraculous signs, inc. mass healings (could any of his beloved metropolitans, whom he claims inherited their thrones from the likes of Peter and Paul, approach a crippled man and say "rise up and walk"?); an intense missionary zeal which is traditionally absent in Orthodoxy; a cross-cultural "melting pot" experience which contrasts sharply with Orthodoxy's nationalism and occasional xenophobia. Why were these not considered as signs of the true church, rather than the forms of government and worship? <P>Secondly, Gilquist fails to answer Catholic claims that they are the true church, and the Orthodox bodies the schismatics. He also does not address the Protestant contention that the term "Church" refers to an invisible and wholely spiritual body, not an organization.<P>Lastly, Gilquist comes across as condescending and a trifle arrogant in addressing Christians of other bodies. I have met many, many wonderful Protestants and Catholics who work without pay to heal the sick, feed the hungry, comfort the despairing, and in every way follow the example of Christ - I would love to see him explain to them how their churches and traditions are "deficient." <P>All in all, I cannot recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Gillquist's book Becoming Orthodox is a story about his own pilgrimage to Orthodoxy. A former Campus Crusade for Christ leader, graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary and Wheaton Graduate School,Gillquist describes the ups and downs of his spiritual journey and what ultimately led him and several of his friends in Campus Crusade to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Of significance is the way in which he clearly elucidates in a non-threatening manner faith/doctrinal issues with which Prostestants often find themselves at odds. His experience also shows that lack of racial ties within the Greek Orthodox Faith can be a strong deterant for the "outsider" wanting in.</span>

                    <span>As interest in the history of Christianity and ancient forms of worship and practice continues to grow, books like this will become more popular. This book tells the story of Fr. Peter Gilquist and some of his close friends as they struggled to find their way into the historic and apostolic Church, and eventually became Orthodox Christians. Although the book is quite polemical at times and doesn't state things as politely or cordially as it should, I believe it's strong points far outweigh it's weak points. First, the author gives his life story and his journey of faith. From growing up Lutheran, to eventually becoming a Baptist, and then starting his own unique orthodox church, Fr. Gilquist has definitely been around the denominational block and speaks from experience. Then the author describes the unique journey he and his friends embarked on as they sought to find the Apostles Church and researched the issue from many possible angles. <P>The other sections of this book then deal with the struggles of these men to find their way into the Orthodox Church. From their rejection by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and the subsequent dismay, to their acceptance by the Patriarchate of Antioch and their entrance into the Church, the entire journey is discussed. Also, the book contains a few chapters that deal with particular points of doctrine and practice that these individuals struggled with such as veneration of the Theotokos and the idea of referring to priest's as Father. Both issues are discussed and dealt with from Scripture and I believe the author does a decent job of answering objections. <P>The reason I gave this book 4 stars was because it was polemical at times. There were a few instances where the author was a bit tougher on Protestantism than he should have been. Also, Gilquist seems to say many negative things about the Catholic Church and not very many positive things. I know he and his friends reached the conclusion that the Bishop of Rome was wrong, but he should realize that many individuals in his shoes have reached the opposite conclusion and he could have been more ecumenical in his tone. Overall, these deficencies do not detract from the overall quality of the book and I think this a book that anyone interested in Orthodoxy or ancient Christianity should read.</span>

                    <span>Peter Gillquist charts the journey that so many of us have been on. What makes their story particularly amazing is that they didn't start from Orthodoxy. In complete ignorance, these Campus Crusaders began to study and to search. When they discovered Orthodoxy, in typical Protestant fashion they set up their own Evangelical Orthodox Church. The remainder of the book chronicles their journey through theological and ecclesial waters, their attempts to overcome protestant proclivities against certain practices and their search for union with an Orthodox fellowship. What makes their story amazing is that they started from *nothing* but church history and the Bible. This journey is reflected in my own. I intend to buy copies for my family who cannot understand how I could become Orthodox. I expect it would be helpful for Protestants who have visceral reactions against any suggestion that one particular church might actually come close to embodying the "New Testament Church."</span>

                    <span>This books purports to be the story of the journey of a group of disillusioned Protestants to the "true" church, but in reality is an excellent example of how naricissism can blind a person to their own faults. <P>Gilquist starts out by wondering why the conversions he solicits while working for Campus Crusade for Christ don't "stick." His solution: of course it wasn't anything he did wrong, so it must be Protestantism as a whole. After a carefully structured "search for truth," he and a group of fellow malcontents find the answer: the ancient Orthodox Church.<P>Now this is where the narcissistic angle really comes into play. You would think that Gilquist and the others would have fallen down at the feet of the local Orthodox bishop and sought conversion. But no; instead they create their own "Orthodox" church, where they can immediately become leaders, without having to first be mere laymen. Then they insist that the other Orthodox bodies accept them. Eventually their nagging gets them recognized by one church, and they celebrate by filling the temples of the Holy Spirit with poisonous cigar smoke.<P>The story would be much more convincing if Gilquist had entered the Orthodox church on its terms, rather than demanding that it meet his. Does this say something about the man's true character? Does it perhaps indicate why his proselytizing efforts with Campus Crusade were less than successful? Me thinks so.
