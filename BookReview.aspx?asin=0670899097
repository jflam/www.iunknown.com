                <span id="Label1">History, literature, love, and religion come together in this graceful biography of the world's most revered and influential poet. R.W.B. Lewis, who won a Pulitzer Prize for <I>Edith Wharton</I>, displays the same intelligent understanding here of the complex interplay of inner and outer forces that shape an artist. His lucid account of political and literary conflict in 13th-century Florence (subject of another Lewis book, <I>The City of Florence</I>) illuminates the context in which Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) came of age, fell in love with the unattainable Beatrice Portinari, forged the "sweet new style" that transformed Italian literature, and embroiled himself in factional disputes he would angrily renounce after his exile from Florence in 1302. Lewis makes palpable the intellectual and imaginative energy that fired Dante to write an influential political treatise (<I>De Monarchia</I>), a powerful argument for literature written in the common tongue (<I>De Vulgari Eloquentia</I>), and of course his twin tributes to Beatrice: one of the most eloquent love poems ever written (<I>La Vita Nuova</I>) and that supreme chronicle of the human spiritual quest, <I>Divine Comedy</I>. The author notes autobiographical elements in all Dante's works without trivializing their creative majesty, and if the poet's personality is somewhat muffled across the distance of eight centuries, his artistic presence still "sparkles and sings and smiles like one of the spirits in Paradise." Drawing cogently (and with generous acknowledgment) on previous scholarship, this volume worthily fulfills its mission as an entry in the excellent Penguin Lives series of short biographies for the general reader. <I>--Wendy Smith</I> </span>

                    <span>The Peguin Lives series thrives on its clever and sometimes surprising pairings of subjects and writers, often non-specialists with a more personal take on the life. Giving Dante to a Yale English professor isn't the most inspired choice, though Lewis's expertise is mainly American lit. The book shows the marks of several pleasant vacations in Tuscany, with brief pen portraits of the various sites and geographical features that shaped Dante's world providing most of the color in an otherwise dry march through the facts of his life. Lewis often circles back to people or scenes described earlier in the work, which is either a tribute to Dante's own narrative style or a sign of slack editing. If you don't know something about Dante already, this isn't the book to convince you he's one of the world's great writers, or to help explain why. But for a quick tourist map of a complex place and time, it's a short, effective read.</span>

                    <span>Prior to this biography on Dante, R. W. B. Lewis had established himself as one of the leading authorities on Edith Wharton and had also written a book about Florence.  Although he is not widely acknowledged as a Dante scholar, this brief volume is testimony to his obvious love for Florence's greatest poet.  Unlike many brief biographies of great literary figures, this is a remarkably balanced account of Dante's life and career.  Given the strictures on what can be covered in a small number of pages, other biographers of other writers often focus on an individual's life to the near exclusion of all else, or on the greater cultural context of their work, or on a discussion of the writings, ignoring the writer's world and life.  Lewis strikes a marvelous balance between explaining the historical-especially the political-context for Dante's life, in detailing the significant biographical moments that informed his career (including most of what we know about his limited encounters with Beatrice), and the development of his art.  Lewis's skill in refusing to neglect any significant aspect of Dante's life and work is laudable.
<br />
<br />Lewis's narrative progresses chronologically on a number of parallel levels.  He reverts on several occasions to Dante's genealogy, on the political situation in Florence in the conflict between the Ghibellines (who favored the claims of the Holy Roman Emperor in Europe) and the Guelphs (who favored the Pope and later split into the Black and White Guelphs, Dante being associated with the latter), Dante's platonic adoration of Beatrice, the development of Dante's poetry, Dante's role in the government of Florence, his eventual banishment from Florence, and the composition and content of his COMEDY.  I was especially encouraged by the number of theological figures who were crucial to Dante and essential for understanding the theological structure of the COMEDY.
<br />
<br />I do have a couple of minor criticisms.  One is that Lewis isn't always as sharp in his exposition as he clearly is capable of being.  There are also some curiosities, such as his comments near the end identifying Robert Penn Warren as "the most complete man of letters of our time," a good if not great writer whom I believe will be largely forgotten in as little as twenty-five years (one wonders if Warren and Lewis were close friends).  There is an annotated biography, but most of the secondary works Lewis discusses are either out of print or not readily available, while many key contemporary texts dealing with Dante are omitted, such as Freccero's THE POETICS OF CONVERSION.  And how could any discussion of translations omit Singleton's, which is easily one of the highpoints of Dante scholarship in the past half century?  Two other small complaints:  no index and no chronology of Dante's life.  My own feeling is that there is never justification for not including an index in an academic book; the omission sharply reduces the book's usability.  Even in a short biography a chronology is useful, allowing one to make rapid comparisons between the various events in a writer's life and their work.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, for most readers of Dante in English, this brief biography will serve as a superb introduction to both Dante's life and his work.</span>

                    <span>This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. My only regret is that even an abbreviated index is not provided. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.<p>When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<p>On Dante's masterpiece: "The Commedia, to which the adjective Divina was affixed two centuries afterward, is, all things considered, the greatest single poem ever written; and in one perspective, as has been said, it is autobiographical: the journey of a man to find himself and make himself after having been cruelly mistreated in his homeland. It is also a rhythmic exploration of the entire cultural world Dante had inherited: classical, pre-Christian, Christian, medieval, Tuscan, and emphatically Florentine. And it is the long poetic tribute to Beatrice Portinari which Dante promised, at the end of the Vita Nuova." (pages 12 and 13)<p>On Dante's response to Beatrice's death: He "did more than write an occasional poem of memorial grief; he put together the work to which he gave the title La Vita Nuova di Dante Alighieri. It was essentially an act of compilation, probably begun in 1293 and finished two years later. Dante drew up[ a narrative account of his relationship with Beatrice Portinari, from his first sight of her at the May Day party in 1274 to her death sixteen years later, sprinkling through it the poems -- canzones, sonnets, a ballad -- written to enshrine each successive moment." (page 59)<p>On progression in the Paradiso: In it, "Dante ascends; he does not climb, as in the Purgatorio, but, as he is constantly remarking, is propelled upward with the speed of an arrow. He is swept up through the lower planets -- the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn; into the Fixed Stars; then upwards to the Primum Mobile, when come all distinctions of space and time, of 'where' and 'when,' through itself beyond space and time; to the Empyrean, the actual and eternal dwelling-place of the Three-in-One God, of the angels and the saints, of the community of the blessed." (page 170)<p>In the concluding portion of his biography, Lewis briefly but eloquently suggests the ubiquitous and energizing presence of Dante in English and American literature, notably in the works of Shelley, Byron, Robert Browning, Rossetti, Emerson, Pound, Eliot, and Warren. According to Lewis, that presence "sparkles and sings and smiles like one of the spirits in Paradise." The same can be said of Lewis' writing style which, in combination with his erudition, enables the modern reader to gain a greater appreciation of someone who lived more than 600 years ago but whose Comedy is as contemporary as tomorrow's sunrise. <p>As is also true of the other volumes in the "Penguin Lives" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by R.W.B. Lewis. He also includes a brief but sufficient "Bibliographical Notes" section for those who wish to learn more about Dante. I hope these brief excerpts encourage those who read this review to read Lewis' biography. It is indeed a brilliant achievement.</span>

                    <span>In order to understand Dante, one must be familiar with the times he lived in & his life, not only his writing.  This book starts by telling you about Italian society he was born into, relevant history of the Guelphs & Ghibellines & Italy.  This book also tells us a lot about Dante's personal circumstances & life.  Much of the book, toward the 2nd half, gives a sort of synposis of parts of the Inferno, Purgatorio, & Paradiso.  That part of the book I enjoy less.  It's interesting, but there's very little organisation to it, & I wish more of the book were about Dante's life.  I do anyway, though, want people to read this book to get to know Dante's life, times, & writing.</span>

                    <span>If you look for a fully rounded biography, then you should not look for it here but in a more expansive work. Mr. Lewis' book comes in two parts. One is the physical life of Dante, the other his major works "Vita Nuova" and "Divina Commedia". Neither one of the two parts is entirely satisfying.<p>The author describes Dante's upbrining in Florence, his political activities there and subsequent banishment for life. Dante spent the better part of his life in exile. He travelled from city to city asnd from benefactor to benefactor. But, more often than not, these travels are not fleshed out to give us a clearer picture of the poet's actual life. Interesting is his celebrated yearning for Beatrice, although he struck her from his life rather quickly after she died in 1290 (Dante was then 25 years old). His political activity in Florence, including participation in some battles, is covered thoroughly, and so are the murderous fights between the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. The author also shows us in excellent detail the influence of the papacy and of some of the foreign powers.<p>The second half of the book is about the "Divina Commedia". Mr. Lewis takes us through every circle of hell, names names and, at times, the deeds that got them there. There are no other explanations besides short descriptions of the circles. It seems that all the nice folks Dante had an axe to grind with wound up in hell. The author does not give us a clue. As it is, it has little bearing on the actual life of the poet.<p>If you want to read this book, be wide awake and attentive. The writing is so dry, the pages smoke when you rub them together. But I can see how it can be frustrating, or even confusing, for an author who knows so much about Dante to set it down in 200 pages.</span>
