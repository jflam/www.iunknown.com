                <span id="Label1">Developers using code generation are producing higher quality code faster than their hand-coding counterparts. And, they enjoy other advantages like maintainability, consistency and abstraction. Using the new CG methods they can make a change in one place, avoiding multiple synchronized changes you must make by hand.  <P><I>Code Generation in Action</I> shows you the techniques of building and using programs to write other programs. It shows how to avoid repetition and error to produce consistent, high quality code, and how to maintain it more easily. It demonstrates code generators for user interfaces, database access, remote procedure access, and much more.  <P><I>Code Generation in Action</I> is an A-to-Z guide covering building, buying, deploying and using code generators. If you are a software engineer-whether beginner or advanced-eager to become the "ideas person," the mover-and-shaker on your development team, you should learn CG techniques.

                    <span>This is the first book I found that looked worth purchasing on the topic of Code Generation.  I live and breathe in the Java World, and this particular subject is increasingly interesting when designing complex applications for long-term scalability and maintainablility.
<br />
<br />The author presents this subject cleanly from very simple beginnings to more complex solutions that really made me rethink the subject and left me with a much clearer idea about how to proceed in the future. I am now looking very hard at Ruby! It's by my desk now until I can get it memorized!</span>

                    <span>I have been doing language parsing and generation in C for several years: English, French, Japanese, Chinese, Korean.  Still, I hoped to learn something new from CGIA for Java.  I was disappointed.  I think the book misdirects the reader away from more effective solutions into less productive paths.
<br />
<br />The book suffers from two problems.  (1) the regular expression technology proposed is inappropriate (2) the exercises provided are not rich enough to be useful.
<br />
<br />I have no objection to scripting languages.  I have happily used bash, gawk, python/Jpython and php.  I avoided perl because I was struck by its lack of readability and writability.  Ruby is no better and no worse than many scripting languages, but the documentation and error messages leave very much to be desired.  CGIA offers almost nothing in the way of real help with the language.  It took me some time to figure out how to install the libraries properly and debugging was a nightmare!  Ruby's regular expression language is yet another variation in the regex language Babel.  This is not something I would foist on developers in my organization.  Especially when there are much better alternatives.
<br />
<br />For years I have been using lex (flex actually) in C for code generation and human language processing.  (I have never had much use for YACC/Bison.)  When I switched to Java, I found an excellent flex equivalent called JFlex (http://jflex.de/).  
<br />JFlex.jar is around 240K. The regular expression language for JFlex is extremely close to that of lex and gawk.  It is much more readable and modular than that of ruby, perl, etc.  Your Java programmers and maintainers need not learn a new language or download/install/configure an additional 28 MB of libraries.  Even better, they can use JFlex in runtime production code, since it produces compiled FSA's which are orders of magnitude faster than an interpreted regex processor like ruby.
<br />
<br />Additionally, you can get with lex/flex/JFlex full grammars for C++ and Java, not the superficial variable reader that came with CGIA.  And the debugging mode, while not perfect, is quite usable.  (There are commercial visual tools for debugging flex grammars, if you need and can afford them.)
<br />
<br />From the code point of view, I found nothing usable in CGIA.   In my judgment most of the examples were more suited to the classroom than to work, and the solutions presented were often not competitive with alternatives.  On the theory/fundamentals side the book does not contribute much to the the understanding of language parsing or generation issues.  
<br />
<br />The arguments for using code generation are cogent.  But if you want to use a more useful, popular, constantly evolving (but equally poorly documented) code generation system, go for XDoclet.
<br />
<br />My recommendation:  skip CGIA.  Spend your time and money learning flex/JFlex for parsing and XDoclet for generating and you will be much better off.  If you want theory, sink your teeth into something like the "Dragon" classic (Aho & Ullman).</span>

                    <span>I had already written a few code generators when I saw this book and was hoping to find some insights into improving and extending what I had already done. The introduction gives a really nice overview of the designs patterns you can use.  But this book is not about programming and the author assume you have the skills to implement the program you want to meta-program already. 
<br />
<br />The author illustrates his approach using a language I had never heard of before, Ruby, which is an OO scripting language that is quite compact and powerful and included is some basic tutorial info in the appendices to help you follow the examples. Overall a good book that I am glad I own and have read. I get the feeling I am going to go back to it many times.

                    <span>There are things I like about this book, and the topic is certainly timely, but this falls down the same rabbit hole many books do: the examples are just paltry and do not add up to a book-length treatment. <p>Little is done to convince the reader that the code generation option in each case was the best solution. For instance, in the case of SQL statements, there are countless other options. What makes this approach superior? One gets the feeling that the answer is the author just needed another example to paper his undertaking with.<p>Some of the sections are downright preposterous in their brevity. There's a section on generating Swing dialog boxes. It contains almost nothing but a silly diagram that looks like a data flow.<p>A good book on this subject would have used a real object oriented language to implement the generators, and would have showed the abundant design patterns that would apply to this problem (Builder, Bridge, etc.). One imagines that there could be many reuse opportunities in the generation framework. Code generation in some of the proto-MDA tools (like Eclipse's EMF, for instance) or the JET project show a lot more promise.</span>
