                    <span>This book is the most detailed explained book I ever read. It teaches you how to have the correct posture (Which is very very important if you want to learn tai chi!), the very basic tought of chi, and also it DOES have explanation how to breath. He didn't write how to breath in every single movement that he explained, but he did in the beginning of the book or/and in the attachment of old manuskript tranlations.<br> Once again it's a very good book for a serious tai chi student, but you have to get use of the way chinese people think to understand some of the contains.</span>

                    <span>The introductory chapters in which Huang explains the development of Tai Chi and relevant physiological concepts are the best I have yet read and I would recommend them to any English speaker starting to learn Tai Chi.  As  with most attempts to describe how to do the form I found the detailed  explanation of how to do Huang's short version of the Wu style form of  little practical value; although to be fair I only read parts of it out of  general curiosity as I practice Wu style in Hong Kong with the Wu family.  Although the introductory paragraphs brought out the fact that Tai Chi is  primarily a martial art I felt that once the book began to discuss the form  this was forgotten. I have found that the greatest insights into the form  often arise when one learns their martial application.</span>

                    <span>This book is absolutely delightful, from its discussion of the theory behind the art to its amazingly in-depth tracing of its history.  For the past year and a half, I have been searching for something to heal my  Chronic pain disorder that effects my upper body, and has effected my  classical guitar-playing and musicianship more than I like. Well, a few  months ago I picked up the Sophia Delza book at my library and began  studying from that, but I wasn't completely satisfied with discussion of  forms and postures, so I decided to buy a book, and after an exhausting  search I finally came away with this book which not only seemed to  satisfied my requirements, but left me with an excellent feeling. I was  most attracted to the fact that he was using the Tai Chi as a healing  approach and that he had been practicing for upwards of 50 years.  Well,  let me just say that everyday I feel better, and my pain is constantly  receding, I have a whole new outlook on life, and the calmness I have  learned has helped me to develop my musicianship. I appreciate Master  Huang's approach of allowing the reader to bring his own things to the  practice such as relaxation methods, and at first I was perturbed that he  didn't offer breathing methods on each of the postures, but it is inferred  that one cannot learn the breathing for all movements unless they have  learned the postures perfectly. Actually, one may notice, however, that he  does describe in a brief passage what movements exhaling and inhaling  require. This book is a beautiful description and application of the  technique that will be helpful to anyone.</span>

                    <span>In clear photographs explicated by easily followed instructions, Alfred Huang's book makes it possible to learn this tai chi form on your own.  If you're already familiar with any style of tai chi, your progress will be  rapid, as you'll already understand subtleties of weight shifting,  breathing and alignment that are nearly impossible to fully convey in cold  print.  Whatever your background, the effort is worth it.  This version of  the Wu style instills a soft, buoyant energy; you can feel your body being  healed and strengthened as you run through the movements.  There are  relatively few books around on this style.   Although a little weak on  illustrating certain transitions, COMPLETE TAI CHI is one of the best, and  Huang's teaching is saturated with authenticity.  He knows his stuff and  teaches it beautifully.</span>
