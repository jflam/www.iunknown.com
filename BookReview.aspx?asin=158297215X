                    <span>Jim Zuckerman's book provides a great coverage of all the steps involved with becoming a professional photographer. You'll learn what gear you need, potential markets and needs, presentation, etc. The book gives you a lot of ideas on how to get started as a pro. However, the book does have two drawbacks that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.<P>- It's very negative on digital, which I find suprising given the book's publication date. The reasons given for why film is better than digital are silly, in my opinion; stories include pictures mysteriously disappearing from cards and cards being corrupt. My advice: buy good gear and practice with it before you shoot it for real. I've used a DSLR for 6 months. I spent the money to buy a good camera body and a professional card, and it has worked well for me in conditions ranging from 80F to -20F, from high to low moisture. Digital is no different than film: practice, make sure everything works, learn your gear's limits... then use it.<P>- The book doesn't explain the photographs. One of the things I like in other photography books (including others by Jim Zuckerman) is that pictures have captions telling you the camera body, the lens, the film, the exposure length, the f stop, and so on. Sadly, this book doesn't share that information.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great resource for those people who are interested in selling their own photos. It is well written and researched by a professional photographer who writes from his own personal experience. The advice he gives is straight-forward and honest, and he even will share a few "don'ts". I recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of turning professional themselves.</span>
