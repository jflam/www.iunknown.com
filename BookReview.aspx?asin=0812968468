                <span id="Label1">During the past ten years, few issues have mattered more to America&#8217;s vital interests or to the shape of the twenty-first century than Russia&#8217;s fate. To cheer the fall of a bankrupt totalitarian regime is one thing; to build on its ruins a stable democratic state is quite another. The challenge of helping to steer post-Soviet Russia-with its thousands of nuclear weapons and seething ethnic tensions-between the Scylla of a communist restoration and the Charybdis of anarchy fell to the former governor of a poor, landlocked Southern state who had won national election by focusing on domestic issues. No one could have predicted that by the end of Bill Clinton&#8217;s second term he would meet with his Kremlin counterparts more often than had all of his predecessors from Harry Truman to George Bush combined, or that his presidency and his legacy would be so determined by his need to be his own Russia hand.<br><br>With Bill Clinton at every step was Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state whose expertise was the former Soviet Union. Talbott was Clinton&#8217;s old friend, one of his most trusted advisers, a frequent envoy on the most sensitive of diplomatic missions and, as this book shows, a sharp-eyed observer. <b>The Russia Hand </b>is without question among the most candid, intimate and illuminating foreign-policy memoirs ever written in the long history of such books. It offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of policymaking and diplomacy alike. With the scope of nearly a decade, it reveals the hidden play of personalities and the closed-door meetings that shaped the most crucial events of our time, from NATO expansion, missile defense and the Balkan wars to coping with Russia&#8217;s near-meltdown in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. The book is dominated by two gifted, charismatic and flawed men, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, who quickly formed one of the most intense and consequential bonds in the annals of statecraft. It also sheds new light on Vladimir Putin, as well as the altered landscape after September 11, 2001.<br><br><b>The Russia Hand</b> is the first great memoir about war and peace in the post-cold war world.</span>

                    <span>Strobe Talbott's The Russia Hand is a comprehensive insider account of US relations with an emerging democratic Russian after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The book is also an explicit record of how diplomacy actually works. <P>I highly recommend this book for an insight and review of American FP in the 1990s.Talbott provides insights into the particulars of the many negotiations and personal bonds (or channels) that transpired between these two former foes. Talbott explores the numerous problems that divided the US and the new Russian Republic in the 1990s; including NATO enlargement, national missile defense, adapting to capitalism and democracy, wars of the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo. <P>This book makes great reading. Not only is it a definitive political text - it's funny! Through a motley cast of characters (Bill Clinton, Yeltsin, various negotiators) and the events that they survived Talbott gives a diplomatic thriller an air of high comedy. At times Talbott's depiction Boris Yeltsin borders on caricature.<P>To sum it all up, I am positive that anyone interested in Foreign Policy, IR, history, or even an unfortunate student looking for a subject for a book review will highly enjoy The Russia Hand. This book is a necessary read for those who wish to understand how the high-stakes game of diplomacy works in practice. And the account is delievered by one of the major players - Strobe Talbott.</span>

                    <span>I actually read this book to be able to write this review, having happened upon this page while surfing the net. Being an avid reader of anything on Russia, I had seen the book several times on the shelf at my local bookstore, but had passed it by, for no particular reason other than not being a fan of the previous administration. I am glad I did read it though, Talbott is both a serious student of Russia and former policy maker from the US side of the negotiating table. His long time friendship with Clinton, and his previous career as a journalist provide an intimate view into the workings of the administration, and some front row observations of the tumultuous Russian post-Soviet period. Most interestingly, he gives a personal perspective and look into the minds and souls of the principle protagonists of the story--Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton.<P>I cannot out-wonk the wonks, but I will give my own homegrown analysis of the period. Undoubltedly, the difficult transition would have been full of pitfalls no matter whose watch it was on. To me, the tragedy of the US's policy was not that it perhaps failed to provide adequate answers or help in the admittedly enormous problem of the transfer from a command economy to a market based one, as Talbott muses at one point in his analysis. The principal problem was to recapture the Russian soul, which had lain dormant in the materialistic totalitarian state. While the US can only do so much to get the Russians to "eat their spinach" as Talbott puts it, we can and must do everything we can to foster freedom of conscience, of the dignity of the human person, and human rights, in its deepest sense. In this post 9-11 world of election mishaps and corporate malfeasance, maybe we could use a dish or two of the green stuff ourselves.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book almost 6 months ago, so i cannot cite any specific passages from the book, but i do feel this book was well written and was very very intresting. It is better than what some of the reviewers rated it. I liked how the book was cronologically arranged, it took you through the clinton years as if you were there almost with Strobes. The only down fall i can think of is the list of names that continued to come up. I almost broke down to making some notes so i would remmber who was who. There are so many clinton bashing books out there, it is always good to read the opposite view point.</span>

                    <span>Contrary to several other reviewers on this site who are rather critical, I found this a very useful and insightful book. The fact that it hardly deals with the rise of the oligarchs and other important Russian domestic items is in my view not relevant as this is a book mainly on Russian-US relations in the 1990s. Talbott writes lucid prose and is often entertaining. One gets a good impression of the endless diplomatic wheeling and dealing behind the scenes with the Russians. Talbott gives a very interesting account of his direct relationship with the Russian official Yuri Mamedov, who served as his personal contact at the Russian foreign ministry. The wounded pride of the Russians, basically due to the collapse of the old Soviet empire, was so great that all kinds of irritations about Yugoslavia and Kosovo, NATO enlargement and other issues were basically inevitable, Talbott suggests between the lines. Amazing that things went so well between Russia and the US in this period of great difficulty for Yeltsin on the Russian domestic front. Boris Yeltsin comes through as an unpredictable politician with a drinking problem which was much bigger apparently than I suspected from reading other written accounts of the 1990s. During summits with the Russians, Clinton and his team were always counting the number of drinks Yeltsin gulped down and were often trying in vain to keep the hard liquor out of reach of the Russian president. When the summit was on American soil, that is. In Russia they didn't have this possibility, of course. Talbott writes with a great knowledge of Russian history and a love of the country, but is in no way uncritical of the mess Yeltsin and his team often made in the realm of foreign policy as well. Witness the unexpected transfer of Russian troops from Bosnia to Pristina at the end of the Kosovo crisis in 1999, which as Talbott pictures it, was a clear example of messy and irresponsible Russian decision making. Still, Talbott rightly suggests that Yeltsin as president was definitely preferable to a communist fossil like Zyuganov.</span>

                    <span>I have gotten nothing out of reading this book. I am currently a student interested in diplomatic relations having some experience working in the White House and expected a down and dirty book about behind the scenes presidential diplomacy. I read nothing of the sort. <P>This book bounces from issue to issue, following events as far as dates rather than consolidating the efforts of the president and Talbot into subject by subject chapters.<P>I was also lost with names. He floods the reader with Russian names, mentioning there titles once or twice in the entire piece. This makes for very hard reading when trying to make sense of the various Vladmirs.<P>Nothing can be truly learned from the book and would be much better suited to a Tom Clancy reader who is not expecting a plot.</span>
