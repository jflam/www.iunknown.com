                    <span>If you are not a swimmer already, you will want to be after completing this book.  If you are a swimmer, then you will be thankful that someone has captured the essence of what those elite athletes at the other end of the pool do while you slog it out at 5 AM in the morning.
<br />
<br />Mullen does an unbelievable job capturing the unrelenting workouts, the devastating highs, the excruciating lows, and reality of what happens when you stick your neck out there to pursue a dream.  
<br />
<br />Finally, as a competitive swimmer, Mullen is able to capture the awesomeness of these Olympians and at the same time showing that these people are indeed mere mortals.  Most of the Olympians that I have seen train and have had the opportunity are much like Tom Wilkens: hard working, determined people who love their sport and are very approachable.  </span>

                    <span>This book was so inspiring to me.I have been a swimmer my whole life, and this book truely show the challenges and the hurttles that swimmer have to face. I think that they are true rolemodels, they had a dream of going to the Olympics and they chased that dream never giving up. They acheived the dream of olympic glory.This book beautifully showed the relasionship between the swimmers and there coach, and how together they achevied there dream.</span>

                    <span>I hate Chicken Soup for the Soul books.  I'm not interested in reading a book that makes you feel warm and musy for three seconds and then allows you to live your life the same way thereafter.  So normally, I won't read an "inspirational" book.  But this book was amazing!  First of all, it didn't just talk about who we would expect, like Moses or Krayzelburg.  This just went into detail about one swim club, and shared the stories of the top swimmers from there, even though they weren't all gold medalists.  Further, you got to see all sides of their story.  How they got into swimming, what the press thought of them, how they interacted with each other, how they did at other meets.  The whole book is so interesting, and you will laugh and you will cry.  Most importantly you will stay up until 4AM all week until you finish it because this is not a book you can easily put down!</span>
