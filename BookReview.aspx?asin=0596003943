                <span id="Label1"><i>Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++</i> is an important new resource for developers serious about writing secure code. It contains a wealth of solutions to problems faced by those who care about the security of their applications. It covers a wide range of topics, including safe initialization, access control, input validation, symmetric and public key cryptography, cryptographic hashes and MACs, authentication and key exchange, PKI, random numbers, and anti-tampering. The rich set of code samples provided in the book's more than 200 recipes will help programmers secure the C and C++ programs they write for both Unix&reg;  (including Linux&reg;) and Windows&reg; environments.   The book's web site supplements the book by providing a place to post new recipes, including those written in additional languages like Perl, Java, and Python. Monthly prizes will reward the best recipes submitted by readers. The <i>Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++</i> is destined to become an essential part of any developer's library, a code companion developers will turn to again and again as they seek to protect their systems from attackers and reduce the risks they face in today's dangerous world.</span>

Chapter 12 on Anti-Tampering was a really enjoyable read, though probably a futile task.</span>

                    <span>This well-written book covers a lot of topics that I have not read in other books. <p>Its strengths include:<p>--Good coverage of cryptography programming<br>--Task-oriented solutions to specific programming problems<br>--Easy to navigate "cookbook" style ("with recipes" as the authors call them)<p>However, some areas of improvement might be:<p>--Could use more coverage of important subjects (buffer overflows, etc.)<br>--spends a lot of space on narrower examples (like explaining certain APIs that are documented well online)<br>--Sometimes jumps into material without much background explanation (which was confusing for me)<p>It is probably not the first book you should read on the subject. This is more of a recipe guide that is useful if you get stuck on coding a particular topic that happens to be covered. The authors have done a good job of explaining what coverage they do and don't include.</span>

                    <span>To be truthful, I bought this book because the "gang" I hang out with is mentioned in the Acknowledgments section of the book.  That was the ONLY reason when I sent money to Amazon.Com and purchased it for the dusty collection on my bookshelf.<p>But, when I got it and chuckled over the Acknowledgements section, I started to mindlessly flip through the book.  Mindless page flipping soon turned to semi-conscious scanning.  Semi-conscious scanning soon turned to serious reading.  I find myself reading the book more and more, jumping back and forth between sections I find interesting and useful.<p>As a Windows C++ programmer for in-house tools, I do not dwell much on secure programming concepts.  Yes, this is very, very bad way to program, so those of you reading this review should not try it at home.  This book has shown the errors of my ways, revealed security issues that I have overlooked by accident or on purpose and gave concepts and examples that I can apply in my projects.<p>This book is one reference that I will be going back over and over again.  The authors and editors have done a wonderful job to make the reading flow nice and easy.  It is also very well laid out by stating the problem you may encounter, followed by a solution and then detailed discussion section with code samples.<p>For any C/C++ programmer making software to be used by more than one person, this reference book is a must.<p>You can still read the Acknowledgments and marvel at my name on there, of course.</span>

                    <span>This book is an asset to anyone whose profession requires them to write code. In this day and age code must be designed and written from the beginning with security in mind. The code contained in this book solve real problems that occur everyday in the programming world. I would go so far as to say the code in this book outlines particularly good practices that could be applied to other languages with relative ease as well. So whether you currently program C or C++, on Windows or *nixs, I believe you can get a lot out of this book. I recommend it highly and suggest you place it right next to your copy of Applied Cryptography. ;)</span>
