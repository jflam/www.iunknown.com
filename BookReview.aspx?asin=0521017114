                <span id="Label1">Philippe Bourgois's ethnographic study of social marginalization in inner-city America, won critical acclaim when it was first published in 1995. For the first time, an anthropologist had managed to gain the trust and long-term friendship of street-level drug dealers in one of the roughest ghetto neighborhoods--East Harlem. This new edition adds a prologue describing the major dynamics that have altered life on the streets of East Harlem in the seven years since the first edition. In a new epilogue Bourgois brings up to date the stories of the people--Primo, Caesat, Luis, Tony, Candy--who readers come to know in this remarkable window onto the world of the inner city drug trade.    Philippe Bourgois is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He has conducted fieldwork in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). He is writing a book on homeless heroin addicts in San Francisco.  1/e hb ISBN (1996) 0-521-43518-8  1/e pb ISBN (1996) 0-521-57460-9</span>

                    <span>Buy this book ! Want to live on crack street for a couple of days? I have been to crack street and back. This book brings you right into El Barrio. Philippe the author moves into Harlem to study the crack culture. In reading his book, I felt as if I have met these people on the street before. The story is very sad - but oh so true.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read at exploring the tensions and struggles with living among, working with, and writing about poor, inner-city minorities. The book is relevant to, and I believe would be helpful to, social workers, educators, ethnographers/researchers, policy makers, and more. The author does an EXCELLENT job at making clear that there are not easy answers. In ways, of course, the people in the book are victims of poverty, of disenfranchisement, of racism.... But, as other reviewers have pointed out, they are also often violent people who take part in such awful acts as gang rape. How does that come together? As people who work in or write about such communities (or make laws that apply to those who live there) how can we understand these contradictions? What role can we play in that? What responsibility to the privileged of the US have to those who are severely underprivileged?<BR>This book explores both the technical aspects of the underground economy, specifically crack, as well as the moral and ethical questions that surround it.<BR>I did find that the book has shortcomings-- as other reviewers have expressed, I'm not sure how comfortable I was with some of the "takes" Bourgois has on some of the people and situations in the book. However, I believe that there is no perfect book out there, especially on such a difficult and complex topic, and that over all the book is very important in exploring and addressing the issues that surround inner-city life and, in particular, the drug trade.</span>

                    <span>I found this book disturbing because the Author loses any chance of being objective. Instead of writing in a more realistic manner he chooses to glorify gang life. he compromises the information because before long he is caaught up in trying to fit into this particular group. The authors objective when writing this type of an anthropological look at this group is to try to live among this group and observe their way of life. I think most people are aware that poverty has a way of making people lose all hope for any future outside the barrio. This is not to say that it"s impossible but looking at it realistically one has to know that it extremely difficult, and that few are able to make it out to a "normal life". I expected more from this book. I think the author had a chance to observe in a objective manner, without allowing personal feelings to get in the way. Somehow the author was unable to this.</span>

                    <span>In the spirit of Bourgois, let me introduce myself. I'm a suburban white woman with a background in history. I was assigned to read this book for an "Aspects of Deviance" Sociology class. Bourgois' approach to his research makes a lot of sense to me since I was taught (as a would-be historian) to take into account all backgrounds and prejudices of the author, the reader, and the characters (if applicable). Perhaps something that makes the read so easy is that the author so willingly points out his own thoughts and biases. This is not to say that our job as readers becomes only to sit back and enjoy the story, but it makes it easier to filter through the author's analyses in order to modify the conclusion for yourself. Importantly, he liberally uses transcriptions of actual dialogues with the East Harlem crack dealers whom he befriends over three-plus years. Having that kind of access to the source of his research is invaluable in judging the situation for yourself.<P>As for the content, I can think of no better way for me to get a glimpse into that kind of life and neighborhood. One of the only other books that comes close is an autobiography by Nathan McCall called Makes Me Wanna Holler. This book covers his experience going from a gang member in the 1970's to "goin' legit" as a journalist and often revisiting the demons of his past. <P>Because the author discusses the idea of objectivity and various definitions of it, I want to mention one movie for anyone interested in better understanding how biases affect otherwise factual accounts. Courage Under Fire is a good example of understanding how various views, motives, and biases color different people's accounts. As much as we would like it, we can never practically obtain the kind of completely unbiased, third-person view of a situation as we are given at the end of the movie, but, with practice, you can come close. This is not to say that you should be completely detached from what you read or see, but that you don't have to get bogged down in the views of others.</span>

                    <span>This book is not meant to be objective or positivist in any way. In that respect, Bourgois wrote an incisive, true to life account of life in East Harlem during the beginnings of the crack epidemic. Criticizing the author for not being objective misses the point--this is meant to be an ethnography that does not attempt to eliminate personal influence, but to account for it and analyze its meaning. If Bourgois were trying at all to be objective, he would not have included his own conversation in the book.</span>
