                <span id="Label1">This is a well-written, well-researched, entertaining account of the creation of the United States'  Declaration of Independence as well as an analysis of how the declaration has been enshrined as something  of a sacred document (a place it did not always hold). Pauline Maier, a history professor at MIT, will no  doubt surprise many readers with detective work demonstrating that Jefferson's Declaration of  Independence was actually preceded by many local declarations, which have been generally overlooked by  historians but which were published throughout the colonies and were well known in their day.  <i>American Scripture</i> holds many surprises as it details Jefferson's drafting of the document, the  editing process, and the varying regard with which the Declaration of Independence has been held in the  past two centuries. </span>

                    <span>I teach a class on American civics and history, and if only this book had written for middle-schoolers (i.e. a bit shorter, since I only have a week to teach the material, review and test). It has excellent research and sources, and it (usually) captures the chaos, excitement and some of the danger of the time. It's a little long, probably by about two chapters. Aside from that, it's an excellent resource. It has made its way, I know, onto two university history and poli-sci department reading lists in North Carolina and Virginia, and I've heard that it's required reading in a few other places. It's a good read, a good telling of a fascinating story. For history buffs and students, this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>Presented here is an indepth look at the behind the scenes struggles that went into the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.  At times, the book is a bit dry, but then, how exactly does one impart excitement and suspense into Congressional debate?  The book reads in somewhat of a textbook fashion, but is abundant with well researched findings and tidbits of little known information.  Maier takes the reader on a microscopic look at the behind the scenes process of this famous drafting.<p>Maier meticulously gives credit to the proper recipients and dispels many myths along the way. Each new chapter is a story in and of itself.  Maier prefaces each chapter with a brief narrative, then follows with a logical and well laid out progression of points and events. For example, in the opening narrative of Chapter 1, Maier introduces some of the prominent Delegates of the Continental Congress and the events of Lexington and Concord.  This is followed by a more indepth account of how the Congress addressed the problems facing our young nation and the early events of the war. Sub-chapter 2 then delves into the debates between `independence' and `compromise'.  Sub-chapter 3 introduces Thomas Paine's Common Sense, and its effect on the Congress. Sub-chapter 4 examines the opposition to forming a republic and also looks at the official grievances against the King.  The chapter concludes with sub-chapter 5 taking a look at the final decision of independence and how that decision came to be.  <p>This book is not so much a look at the Declaration itself, but rather, how it came into being.  If you want to learn more about the Declaration itself, pick up The Declaration of Independence by Carl Becker.  If you hold Thomas Jefferson just short of godlike status, you may not care much for this book, but you will learn from it.  <p>Perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of this book is the wealth of information provided in the Appendices and Bibliography. Here you will find a few examples of local resolutions on independence as well as the Congressional editing of the original submission. When you look through the Bibliography, be prepared to find several other books you will want to add to your `must read' list.</span>

                    <span>The Declaration of Independence holds a revered and honored place in our national lexicon of important American historical documents. But what makes a document that is well over two hundred years old command such respect. Pauline Maier sets out to tell the story of the Declaration of Independence, from the circumstances to surrounding its writing, to the documents that influenced its text, to how the Declaration came to be held in such high esteem. Maier begins her story on the eve of the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and tells the story of how the Congress was moved toward independence by June and July 1776. She explains how Jefferson came to be the author of the Declaration and what documents influenced his writing. She also places the Declaration within the broader context of other "declarations of independence" being made by individual states during this time period. After Jefferson had completed his text, Maier illustrates the changes that both the draft committee and the Congress as a whole made to the document. Her final chapter deals with how American attitudes toward the Declaration changed between 1776 and the Civil War concluding with how Abraham Lincoln changed the Declaration into a living, breathing historical document.<p>Maier's account of the Declaration of Independence is extremely well researched and well written. Maier has obviously done a lot of research - especially into the area of the "declarations" attached to the state constitutions begin written at the time. This was an angle of research that I had not seen before and it was interesting to see how the Declaration of Independence was both alike and different from the others. Maier's account is very readable and her writing is easy to follow.<p>If you are looking for a readable, one-volume account of the story of the Declaration of Independence then look no forward. I would recommend this book to both students who have some background on the subject as well as the average person looking for some more information about their nation's history.</span>

                    <span>MIT historian Pauline Maier has written a richly documented and highly informative analysis of a document which is widely regarded as the symbolic expression of the birth of American nationhood -- the Declaration of Independence. This book shatters well established myths regarding the nature and authorship of this key document in the history of the United States, and cautions readers against the misrepresentations of this history in contemporary texts and monuments.<p>A major thrust of the book is its analysis and comparison of  "declarations of independence" adopted by various localities and states among the American colonies prior to the adoption of the July 4 1776 document by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. The author documents the popular origins of the American Revolution and its roots in older English traditions of bringing royal regimes to an end. Noting that at least ninety, possibly more, such local "declarations" were adopted by various communities in colonial America, during 1775 and 1776, with several examples reproduced in an appendix, the author points to similarities in drafting with English documents which had sought to explain and justify why Englishmen brought the rule by various English kings to an end on five occasions between 1327 and 1485, and then twice again in the seventeenth century. Paradoxically, it was this English tradition of declarations which inspired the drafting of similar declarations among the American colonies as they grew disenchanted with not only British Parliament, but also King George III, and even the British people. This common lineage of documentary traditiion from Britain fostering a sense of unity and bolster the common resolve for independence among the North American colonies which previously had little connection with each other than through the mother country across the Atlantic. <p>But the author also underscores the "peculiar American twist" in these documents adopted by local communities, especially as she seeks to answer "why ordinary people in towns and counties were involved at all in deciding the fate of the British Empire." She notes that English history lacked a tradition of efforts to win broad-based support for change of regime, which the Continental Congress felt was needed. Nowhere in America did there exist an institution like Parliament in Britain which could claim to speak for the "whole community."  Individual states and communities differed in how they came to adopt instructions on Independence which eventually guided voting in the Continental Congress. "On the high end of the scale were the votes of Massachusetts town meetings and of James City County, Virginia, where a majority of resident freeholders signed the instructions on Independence; on the other were places like Talbot County, Maryland, whose instructions came from a group that openly described itself as 'part of the freemen of the said County.' Some instructions were the work of elected committees that felt free to speak for its constituents."<p>The other major thrust of the book is on Jeffersonï¿½s exact role in drafting and contributing to the final document adopted in Philadelphia. The author meticulously examines these points based on her interpretation of available evidence. Later in the book, she demonstrates how  Jefferson's words were misrepresented in the Jefferson Memorial built in Washington DC by additions and omissions which fail to correctly ascribe authorship to others such as Richard Henry Lee or which avoid the references to overthrowing government. Why the author emphasizes these points becomes clear when she asserts that the Declaration of Independence was "an avowal of revolution"  whose vitality "rests upon the readiness of the people and their leaders to discuss its implications and to make the crooked ways straight, not in the mummified paper curiosities lying in state at the Archives." This epilogue brings us back full circle to the introduction of the book in which the author is implicitly contemptuous of what she documents as a disproportionately costly and tedious attempt to preserve the original document.<p>Pauline Maier suggests that her account of the Declaration of Independence puts her somewhat at odds with other historians and takes issues with what she considers to be a number of well established myths and views. She affirms vigorous "dissent from any suggestion that Jefferson was alone responsible" for this document. Furthermore, by seeking to document the impact of "the grubby world of eighteenth century American politics" in shaping this document, she also distances her position from other academics  whom she views as being "more comfortable in the transatlantic world of ideas" and who place much more weight in the treatises of European writers as an influence on the Declaration of Independence. The author asserts that "as a statement of political philosophy, the Declaration was therefore purposely unexceptional in 1776" -- based on her careful documentation of the rich philosophical traditions and literary lineage which were its antecedents. She unabashedly reminds readers that she once nominated Thomas Jefferson the "most overrated person in American history", adding the following: "It does strike me as odd, however, that historians' obsession with Jefferson continues unabated at a time when studying the history of  'great white men' has become unfashionable in the profession."<p>The book presents other interesting historical insights into this period, outside of its two main thrusts described above. The British technique of "divide and conquer" which would become well tried and tested elsewhere in the growing Empire, including India, was also applied in the American colonies, as evident in a purportedly conciliatory proposal made by British Minister Lord North in response to one of the spirited appeals written by Thomas Jefferson to the British King in 1774. Under Lord North's proposal, the British Parliament would desist from taxing any American colony which raised sufficient permanent funds for its own defense and support of civil government. According to Pauline Maier, American colonists "saw the proposal as an attempt to divide the colonies without conceding that Parliament had no right to tax Americans." <p>On the whole, whatever your political persuasion and interpretation of the Declaration of Independence, you are likely to find this a lively book with well argued and documented historical analysis. The appendices and bibliography are also an important resource for the serious reader of American history.</span>

                    <span>Maier's award winning book on the drafting of the Declaration of Independence is an important work that every history teacher in America should read.  Maier clarifies for the world that the Declaration of Independence was not only the inspiration for our American Democracy but the product of it.<p>What I found most fascinating was that the Declaration was not the pure work of one man (Jefferson), but a truly collaborative document that drew heavily from the ideas and documents that were emerging from the towns and hamlets within the colonies at that time.  <p>The book teaches the valuable lesson that citizens should not be mere consumers of our democracy, but the creators of it.  In the end, Maier proves that the Declaration is not so much a divinely inspired work, but more of a precursor of what has become the product of a free people, the great American experiment that is the United States.</span>
