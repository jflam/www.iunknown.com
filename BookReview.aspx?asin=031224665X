                    <span>For anyone who imbibes coffee on a ritualistic basis, and worships their coffee-pot, Kenneth David's book is your bible.  Originally written in 1976 (I have the 1979 third printing which I found for $1 used!), and apparently now on its fifth printing, "Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing and Enjoying" has become quite popular.  Previous reviewers have commented on its being slightly out of date, and one even complained about the brown ink print on tan paper!  First off, with regards to modern equipment such as high quality grinders and coffee makers, and some information on where to buy coffee, David's guide may be in need of updating (I can't tell you what's in the newer editions).  However, none of the important information in the book will ever be obsolete, and in any event, you can satisfy all your modern coffee equipment needs right here on Amazon.com -how convenient!  Secondly, I have to say that the brown ink on off-white paper is ideally suited for the topic and quite pleasing to the eye.  Since the 1970's gourmet coffee has swept the USA, and every shopping mall, city, and town has at least two or three gourmet coffee shops nearby (often within the same block), and so finding good quality coffee shouldn't be a problem at all.  For mail order or retail outlets, I highly recommend Peets Coffee - www.peets.com - which in my opinion is by far the best gourmet coffee available on the market.  <p>Coffee culture is timeless and I think you'll be pleased with the quality of information contained in this book.  Each chapter is a "how to" guide on such subjects as the history, purchasing, tasting, roasting, grinding, brewing, serving, and growing of coffee.  There is also a section about caffeine, and if you're looking for more in-depth reading about coffee as a "drug", than I suggest finding a copy of Dale Pendell's incredible poetical discourse on "Stimulating Plants, Potions & Herbcraft" entitled, "Pharmako/Dynamis" (Mercury House, 2002).  For general reference, or historical curiosity, "Coffee" is both delightful and useful to have laying out on your coffee table, its soon to be tattered and stained pages faithfully awaiting your next coffee ceremony.</span>

                    <span>Coffee is a brown beautiful color.Ink is black set to a white back ground in books for a very good reason.If I had known the printing in this book was a light brown color that is hard to read I would not have wasted my time or money.This may be a very good book but I will never know.Keep the color in the coffee and your hands off the ink.I have the fifth edition.</span>

                    <span>Through his three books and informative website (...), Ken Davids is a leading expert on coffees of the world. He is also the green bean guru to home coffee roasters everywhere and it is primarily for them this book was designed. For anyone exploring the many pleasures of roasting their own beans, Davids is the only comprehensive guide available, which makes it particularly maddening that the book hasn't been updated in five years. When Davids wrote the book in 1996, home coffee roasting was beginning its rebirth. Today, the sorts of inexpensive, easy-to-use home roasters he long for in the book are finally available but not covered. A quick update could correct information on roaster availability (it's easier than you think, and easier than he says), and sources for unroasted beans (some of his are out of date, and some good ones aren't noted at all). Still, if you want to get started with home roasting, this remains the best book to own. And if you just love coffee, it's a fine second or third book to put on the shelf. But if you love coffee enough to buy a book about it, you really should explore roasting your own beans -- the flavors and fun of it are incomparable.</span>

                    <span>COFFEE :  A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying.  Fifth Edition.  By Kenneth Davids.   279 pp.  New York : St. Martin's Griffin,<br>2001.  ISBN 0-312-24665-X (pbk).<p>This is a book for those who, after years of slurping what all too often passes for 'coffee,' and what far too many establishments continue to pretend is 'coffee,' have been blessed by a coffee epiphany.  It is for those, in other words, who have finally realized what a sensuous, ravishing, and complete experience a perfect cup of _real_ coffee is, and who would like to learn how to duplicate that experience at will in the comfort of their own home.  Brewing up a cup of coffee may seem to most of us to be a relatively simple matter, but what we quickly learn from this book is that, far from being simple, selecting the right type, form, and state of coffee and correctly employing the methods that will produce that perfect cup demand real knowledge and skill; we learn, in short, that a true understanding of coffee opens up an area of connoisseurship every bit as big, or even bigger, than that of wine itself.<p>Davids' book is truly comprehensive.  Besides giving us a fairly detailed history of coffee, from its origins in Arabia (or Ethiopia) through to its latest manifestation in the flavored espressos of the modern mall, the book includes chapters on Buying It, Tasting It, Roasting It, Grinding It, Brewing It, and Serving It.  Detailed information is given on the special qualities and characteristics of all coffees of the many regions of the world which produce it (Guatemala; Honduras; Costa Rica; Jamaica; Puerto Rico; Haiti; Colombia; Peru; Brazil; Yemen; Ethiopia; Kenya; Uganda; India; Sumatra; Java; New Guinea; Hawaii, etc.), and on the merits and demerits of the many different methods of brewing and the best utensils for each of them (Open-Pot; French Press or Plunger; Drip Brewing (both with and without filters); Flip-Drip or Neapolitan Macchinetta; Pumping Percolator (now passe and the best way to ruin coffee); Filter-Drip, automatic and otherwise; Concentrate; Middle Eastern or Turkish; Soluble or Instant, etc.).  There is also a very full discussion of espresso and just why it produces the ultimate cup.<p>If you are anything like me you'll quickly realize that you have been doing many things wrong and will be seized with the urge, not only to start using better coffee, but also to start brewing it properly.  Although acquiring your very own roasting machine or espresso machine may be a little too ambitious for most of us, you may decide that bringing your coffee at least one stage closer to perfection by buying a grinder and grinding the beans yourself is probably a good idea.  If you do so decide, Davids will inform you just why a manual is preferable to an electric grinder (it generates less of the heat that disperses the volatile substances that give flavor to coffee), and where you can buy a good grinder if one isn't locally available.  His book, besides containing much else (coffee chemistry, maps, photographs, coffee glossary, etc.), concludes with a list of companies which sell a wide range of the best coffees and coffee paraphernalia and equipment.<p>There are few perfect pleasures in life.  Davids is to be thanked for teaching us how not to spoil one of them.</span>

                    <span>This book is a perfect choice for those of us interested in all things coffee - from roasting to buying to grinding to growing and lots in-between. Kenneth Davids's book is informative, honest, and humorous.  Includes places to purchase coffee and coffee supplies, an extensive coffee  glossary, helpful illustrations and tables, and so much more. A great book.</span>
