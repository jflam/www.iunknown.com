                <span id="Label1"><P>So you're finally ready to find out what all the fuss is about! Whether you're switching from a Windows system or upgrading from an older Mac OS, this task-based guide represents the surest way to go from 0 to 60 in no time flat with Apple's much anticipated Mac OS X Panther--more mature, powerfully enhanced, and with an improved GUI that will knock your socks off! In this thoroughly revised volume--which includes an expanded iApps section and new chapters on networking (including AirPort networking), security, Unix, Classic Environment, and System Preferences--you'll find the task-based, step-by-step instructions that have become the hallmark of Peachpit's enormously popular Visual QuickStart series. Veteran author Maria Langer uses plenty of visual aids and clear, concise instructions to step you through the process of installing and configuring the new OS before moving on to explore its many capabilities and bundled apps. Tips, tricks, and sage advice round out the package.</P></span>

                    <span>The series of books to which this one belongs is "Visual Quick Start guides." Not the sister "Visual Quick Pro Guides." So those above trashing this book should have hit themselves in the face with the book in order to see what is right on the cover.<P>This book is intended for those who need an introduction, not those on their third book or seeking power skills.<P>I have used "visual quick start guides" to gain beginner level usage of many different programs, including my move from MS to Mac. I find the format is consistent, targeted at the beginner and is exactly as the series title implies,"Quick Start." <P>These books are best at providing a vocabulary to discuss the software at hand. Which makes the thicker, harder to digest books easier to read. You can complete this book in a couple of weeks and be a competent user of Mac OS X panther, nothing more. It will introduce you to each feature and how it is used. Most of each page is dedicated to an image depicting the feature at hand with explanation, pointers and tips in text. It moves fast and the language is simple.<P>If you already are familiar with the Mac OS then another book may be better suited to your needs.</span>

                    <span>Another in the VQSG series from Peach Pit Press, this book is a good general reference, but NOT the kind of thing that you cuddle up with in front of the fireplace. It serves best as a "how-do-I-do-this?" kind of book. At well over 600 pages, there aren't too many questions that you could have about Panther that aren't answered by this book. It limits itself to an audience of basic to intermediate users, but I really think that even advanced users would have questions that could be answered in here.<P>Now, having said all that, as someone who considers himself an advanced user, I'll admit to you that I haven't used this book that much myself. I think I read through the section on Applescript once and referenced the UNIX Basics a couple of times. It's not that it's bad, quite the contrary, but it would probably serve someone else a little better than me.</span>

                    <span>The 'Book Level' labeling on this book says it is for 'beginning' & 'intermediate' but I doubt anyone who has used OS X before will be satisfied with what this has to offer. I switched form 10.2 to 10.3 and was not using a book to supplement what Apple provided with 10.2. I thought this would help me get more out of 10.3 and OS X in general. It was one of the first out so I bought it before much else was available. Clearly a mistake on my part and am now looking for something that does more than tell me how to go through a dialog box. I am probably an 'intermediate' level user at best. Someone new to Macs or computers may find it helpful. A wide range of topics is covered but little is added to onscreen instructions or what Apple presents under 'Help.'</span>

                    <span>Maria has done it again, but better! This new book about Mac OS X has over 600 pages of step-by-step instructions, complete with illustrations. it covers just about every feature of Panther in a way that anyone can understand and follow. I have two previous editions of this book and this version is better than both of them because it has lots more coverage and information. Maria continues to be my favorite author. Thanks!</span>

                    <span>This is my 3rd OS X book by Marie Langer and will be my last. Marie has written several book on OS X. The only one that was decent was OS 10.1 Advanced. This book is almost the same as the other two, but this time of course, the subject is Panther. Some of the chapters are almost repeats of her other Visual QS books for X, for example, the Unix chapter. If you want to get some Unix knowledge get a Unix book. Please Marie get a clue. This book was hastily thrown together and it shows. Marie writes to the total neophyte, although, the book is marketed up to intermediate level. I would have bought the David Pogue Panther edition, but it was not out yet. I should have waited. If you are a neophyte and need some help, I suggest going to library and trying to find an OS X book if you really need one. Advanced users will not find one item of interest here and in defense is not aimed at them. I will give you one more example of this book's missteps. If you want to know about Samba, don't buy this book because Marie does not mention it. That's hard to believe she can write a book on OS X and leave that out. It is one of the nicest features in OS X and most handy for sharing files with Windows & Unix machines. <P>After having the book for a few more weeks, I have changed the rating from a 2 start to a 1 star. I cannot believe that anyone would rate this book higher than a 3 start and that would be stretching it big-time. However, opinions are like butts and no one thinks theirs stinks. If you look closely at those that have rated the book higher it should raise some red flags. For example, the woman that is in the book gave it 5 starts. That's a hoot.</span>
