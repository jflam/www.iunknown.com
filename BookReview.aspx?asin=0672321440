                <span id="Label1"><HTML><P>The first book on the market intended as an introduction to WMI, with the goal of developing the reader's ability to write scripts independently.  The book includes a large number of "ready to use" scripts, which can be implemented  as they appear and customized with few changes.  Through easy to read presentations of programming concepts and examples, the reader becomes familiar with XML standards.  Each Script simplifies daily administrative tasks or allows for substituting third party programs for in-house ones.<P>The scripts included in the repository start with the most basic ones; the complexity of the scripts increases dramatically toward the end of the book to satisfy the needs of readers with more advanced skills and requirements.</HTML></span>

                    <span>I just came from "samspublishing.com" and noticed so many complaints about their being no "code samples." Well you all can just pop over to samspublishing.com and then use "Marcin Policht" in the search box to find this book. Once you are at this book's page you can see a link for "Related Materials" and it is there that you will find a small download "code.zip" to apease those who need the code samples.<P>I put a 5 star rating here only to offset those that said they would give it a 5 if it had the coding samples. I have not read this book and was concerned about the negative remarks. I don't need the code samples, but found it difficult to not mention that they are indeed available for download.</span>

                    <span>If you are a system administrator, like I am, you will appreciate sample VBScript-based scripts presented in this book. This is what has been missing from any Microsoft WMI documentation (including their Software Development Kit). And finally the publisher (SAMS) decided to post the source code on their web site.</span>

                    <span>This book is very timely, extremely accurate, and in complete touch with the latest management technologies offered on Windows computers. Marcin does a great job relating each topic and the scripts run flawlessly. BIG TIP (but thoroughly logical): Make sure you have the latest versions of both WMI and Windows Script Host/VB Script installed on your computer when playing with the scripts. ... </span>

                    <span>Overall, the book is okay. The content is definitely beginner to intermediate as advertised but reasonably thorough. My main problems with this book relate to the errors and really lousy formatting of the example code. Sams should have followed the usual convention of using a monospaced font for code examples because it would have made the book infinitely easier to read. ... The most interesting code examples are just too long to waste time manually typing. Very disappointing... </span>

                    <span>This book has all of the information you will need to use WMI in your environment. <P>There are books out there that just give you an introduction, but this one cuts into the daily useage and gives you hands on information.<P>I highly recommend it.</span>
