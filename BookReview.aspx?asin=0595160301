                    <span>I ordered "Summer Madness" a couple of weeks ago and read it the night it hit the doorstep.  As a former player who won an NCAA championship with the Texas Longhorns (for which she was named MVP) and a WNBA title with  perennial champions, the Houston Comets, Harris writes from personal experience with the greats of the game.  As a sports commentator, Harris is an entertaining writer with unvarnished opinions (which she gleefully shares) on the WNBA and its big-name players.<p>Which team was so cheap it rationed sweat socks?  Would you like to know a little more about the enigmatic four-time Championship MVP Cynthia Cooper?  Be warned that "Summer Madness" is more akin to a Fran Harris autobiography than an objective examination of the league, but that lends the book a straightforward charm.  An entertaining mix of thoughtful essay, personal memoir and dishy gossip, "Summer Madness" is a must-read for anyone who follows the WNBA.<p>There is a photo section, an enlightening forward written by WNBA star Tina Thompson, and plenty of stuff not already published in Harris' columns.  There also are several laugh-out-loud passages (don't read it in your cubicle at work) and a very touching remembrance of Kim Perrott, Harris' Houston Comet teammate.</span>

                    <span>Well worth the shipping wait! If you enjoy Fran's straight-forward, witty columns then you will love this book. It was insightful and entertaining. Part autobiography, part documentary, and part commentary. A WNBA book like this was long overdue. I've recommended it to all the women's basketball fans I know.</span>
