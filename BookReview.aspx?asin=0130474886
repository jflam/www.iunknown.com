                    <span>My company division has just started doing business in China. I didn't know where to start and found this book to be a common sense guide to business.<P>What I got out of your book was that -- treating people with respect (no matter the difference) is important to being successful and common business sense is common business sense no matter where you do business.</span>

                    <span>As a resident of the fifth largest economy in the world--California, I found Mr. John Chan's book, China Streetsmart to be truly enlightening. The People's Republic of China (PRC) will soon pass California and will join the ranks of the Global Five.<P>Mr. Chan writes in a way, even an actor like Arnold Schwartzneggar could get a handle on the main strategies of doing business in the PRC.<P>One truly hopes that Mr. Schwartzneggar will take Mr. Chan's advice and encourage California's businesses to increase trade and invest in the PRC. Mr. Chan's "Deciding the Best Plan of Action" could assist the new governor's tenure in the State of California.<P>Should one zig or zag in doing business in China? Mr. Chan has clearly outlined the art of the possible from planning your negotiation, determining your partner, calculating risk and reaping the rewards in today's China.<P>This guide is a must for well seasoned business executives and to those who are just getting started in beginning a venture into<BR>the Chinese marketplace. As Mr. Chan points out in his book, the Chinese saying "where there is danger, there is opportunity" still holds true today. Hopefully, Mr. Schwartzneggar will seize the investment opportunities in China and join Mr. Chan in the real world with this well written Chinese business guide.</span>

                    <span>A 2001 Jossey-Bass book by Vijay Govindarajan and Anil Gupta titled The Quest for Global Dominance introduced a new MNC lingo, global mindset.Although appearing novel compared with the framework developed around another more widely used term, transnational corporation, brought up a decade earlier by Sumantra and Goshal in Managing Across Borders, global mindset in Govindarajan and Gupta's book is merely differentiated conceptually from the diffused and parochial mindsets. There is little practical guide as to how an MNC or its managers may develop a global mindset.<P>The Six China Streetsmart Action Steps provide ready-to-use recipe for developing a winning China mindset. Moreover, they should appeal to managers of any globalizing business as a universal approach to developing a global mindset. Personally I resonnate the most with the chapters on the six action steps. They are full of practical insights, and stimulate my reflection upon my own understanding of the Chinese and Western cultures and their possible interactions. I also like the case study, can't stop fantasizing making a box-office hit similar to the movie Gun Ho. In addition, I am impressed by author's ability to summarize a whole gammit of most relevant and pressing issues on investing in China in a nutshell of the last 50 or so pages, a real practical primer for managers in a hurry.<P>I do suspect the views and conclusions in the book biased towards expats,because I feel like guessing a couple alternative views on behalf of some of the Chinese JV managers as well as MNC headquarters staff whom I have encountered. It is also because I don't resist the temptation to put the research methods cap on myself and start to think about focus groups.<P>Of the six actions steps I prefer steps 2, 3 and 4 to the other steps for the unique insights and a more elevated discussion on the rationales beyond annecdotes. For example, geographic difference and difference in stage of development are why flexibility and adaptability are in need but not over-standardization. There are areas where the argument could have been made stronger. For example, the management consistency argument could have been strengthened by linking it to guanxi development, being thorough, and the essence of tacit learning process in an ambiguous business environment. Building respect, trust the Chinese way could have been elaborated further for the benefits of the expats. Relatively I got least out of the earlier chapters on guanxi, language and listening, except for the practical guide on local dialects and use of professional translators. While the author makes it quite clear what guanxi is not, the Confucian-based definition of what guanxi is keeps it distant from the reality of institutional arrangement in China, i.e. guanxi cannot be discussed fruitfully outside the nexus of multiple stakeholders whose interests need to be balanced when a bilateral guanxi is engaged or utilized. I find Mr. Lu a fascinating node of the guanxi nexus that hangs over the Portola Packaging case.</span>

                    <span>Working in a joint venture between a Chinese company and a Canadian company, I can relate to much of the advice John provides in China Streetsmart. I only wish my Canadian company had this resource before establishing our JV 3 years ago. It would have made for a much smoother process on both sides.<P>John clearly knows his stuff and combines a great blend of concepts, stories, examples, practical advice and insight into Chinese culture. John's approach is pragmatic and invaluable to anyone considering establishing a business in China or any foreign market.</span>

                    <span>After reading China Streetsmart I now have a stronger sense of how to take my North American business to China. It's important to me that the author not give me theory rather something that I can really use. John's unique combination of western background coupled with years of experience on the "front lines" of doing business in China make him an unparalleled authority on how to truly be effective and profitable for anyone that is looking to do business in China. John has taken his personal experiences and to that added stories, both successful and unsuccessful, from other high-level executives to truly give the reader a realistic view of what works and what doesn't work in China and more importantly, why. I really liked the color charts and statistics throughout. I believe this is a must-have resource for anyone looking to start a business in China or enhance an existing China-based business!</span>
