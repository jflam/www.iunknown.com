                    <span>Wow, what a great book. I really don't know what everybody else is talking about, but I thought that this book was great. So great, that in fact, I am now reading it for the 3rd time. I read it once for pleasure, and once in school. I really like history, and maybe that is why I like it so much. I feel that it definetly transports me back to that time, and that region. I live in Philly, and the book takes place not all that far from there. I think that it would be fun to be able to be somebody like True Son. While slightly depressing at times, like when you realize that this was something that ACTUALLY happened to real people, and the tragedy of it all. That somebody has a family that they don't even care about, and that they never really knew them, and their family loves for them. Well, I won't tell you the ending, but it is pretty tragic. All in all, a great book, one of my all time favorites! Well, I am going to go read it now.</span>

                    <span>Awful, just awful. Richter has gone to an all time low. Not only did the book fail to excite me just once, but it put me in a bad mood. The book is sad without any joy to balence that. I feel sorry for anyone who has to read this book, but for those of you who who are not required, do not waist your time or money on this piece of garbage.</span>

                    <span>I was supposed to read this book and write an alternate ending for school! It's one of the worst stories ever!I hated the figurative language! ( Like the wind is my brother-in-law) It was boring and weird. But, at the end it did make me cry because I felt bad for John/ True Son. Don't read this book unless you like wasting time!</span>

                    <span>Probably one the most boring and meaningless stories I have ever read. It's just a childish fight between Indians and White Men that in the end proves nothing. If you wanna hear about Indians scalping white men and white men hunting down and shooting Indians, then for sure, read this book. Its about a white boy who was kidnapped by Indians when he was a baby and then raised by those Indians. Then he is forced to return to live with his white family and hates them, thus resulting in scalping, hate, depression. Those are usually things that make a book good, but in this case, they tear it down and kill it.</span>
