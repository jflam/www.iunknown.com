                    <span>Antigone takes place right after sophocles, Oedipus at Colonos.  The play takes off right after a war in thebes where the two princes Eteokles and Poloneices have fought and killed each other over a war for the throne.  For those who dont know any backround for this war, Poloneicies and Eteokles had struck up a deal that every year they would trade off the throne, one ruling than the other, but Eteokles dod not want to give up the throne agter his one year so Poloneices, gathered up an army and attacked to gain, what was actually rightfully his.  To move on, Antigone is saddened from the fact that her uncle Kreon, refuses to bury Ploneices, which is an act against the gods; her agrument being that even the opposing forces of an emeny's armyies are giving burial rights, but not her brother.  Antigone, the tragic hero in this play buried polonieces against the orders of Kreon an is caught.  Never backing down that what she did was right, Antigone carries with her the respect of the people and her fiance Haimon, whom is Kreon's son.  Not wanting a conflict between the people and him, kreon secretly has antigone sealed away in a tome, buried alive so to say.  But after finally listenine to the prophet Teiresias' words, Kreon makes his final mistake by burying Polonieces first, then going to safe antigone whom had all ready hanged herslef and was only just in time to see his own son, Haimon, out of grief, stab himself.

<br />Antigone is one of the best greek tragdedian plays i have ever read.  I bought this edition to read in a college class and found it to be one of the best translations i have ever come across.  It is very easy to read and understand plus there are notes in the back to help you better understand what is going on in the pkay if you ever get confused.  If you like antigone or have a hard time understanding it, buy this edition.  I gaurantee you will not have any trouble understanding it.</span>

                    <span>This is a great, tragic play.  It's not too hard to read, and it's pretty short (!), so you could read it in a day probably.  This play will have you questioning what you would do in both Antigone's and Creon's situations, so you know it's pretty good.  And the important question: who's the tragic hero?!?  I'm still deciding</span>

                    <span>Sophocles' Antigone is a wonderful work - a dramatic and riveting play with a superb cast of characters.  It is easy to understand, intersting, and fun to read.  I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I think Antigone the play by Sophocles is important for people to read today.  This play is beneficial to the modern day reader because it shows affection, love, and loyalty and what happens when these go wrong.  These emotions and traits were very important to Sophocles.  Antigone the title character of the story is only one of the main characters.  The play centers around her and her extended family.  Creon, the evil king, is also Antigone's uncle, (and Great Uncle, this is a very entangled family) he has ordered that one of Antigone's two brothers is not be buried because he betrayed his City State (ie Country) because he went to the neighboring city state and fought for the enemy.  Ultimately being killed by his brother during a battle and by wounding the other brother sufficiently that they both ended up dead.  These were just the first deaths in the family.  The evil uncle ends up killing most of the family.  The family members show how dysfunctional a family can be both in the ancient world and we can relate this to life today.  In today's world having an appreciation for the affection, love and loyalty shown in the play "Antigone" by the sisters is a good lesson for reader's today.  Finally, an understanding of the importance of having good family relationships to prevent dysfunctionality along with an understanding of duty to Country can a benefit to the modern reader.</span>

                    <span>Antigone Critique:<br>Reading Antigone had a positive approach for me because it has a lot of morals and principles in it. Which you can learn from and apply to you in everything you do.  At first I thought that it was going to horrible, especially when you just start off because how they write it, is awkward at first. But when you start to examine and go deeper into what they may be trying to say then you can really learn and evaluate on what there point may be or what they may wanting to get across to you..<br>	I believe that Sophocles' main purpose to write this play was because in his day having a woman even as the name of his play was a big thing, so the play did emphasize on the role and leadership that a woman held. And part of the issue in the book was that Antigone was going against the customs and normal behavior of a woman, which did not please Creon.  Also I believe that maybe Sophocles was trying to get a message across to evaluate your priorities and to stand up for what you believe in.  He also may be trying to prove that "Hubris" -which is pride- can cause you to be blind. The fact that maybe the gods did want the brother to be buried or that Antigone's motive could have been right in what she did which was to honor her brother.<br>	I personally have learned that when you are disagreeing that you should try to put aside your pride and think of the reason or situation that the other person is in. To put your pride away and give it up to God, to totally surrender your will to Him and not rely on yourself to get the things YOU want done but to act in His will.<br>	I would definitely recommend this book. I think that it has an awesome point to it and values in it, but you just have to try and look for them. It is a little hard to follow sometimes, but keep it up and maybe you'll enjoy it too.</span>
