                <span id="Label1">The plans of Adolf Hitler and the German Nazis to create a Nordic "master race" are often looked upon as a horrific but fairly isolated effort. Less notice has historically been given to the American eugenics movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although their methods were less violent, the methodology and rationale  which the American eugenicists employed, as catalogued in Edwin Black's <I>Against the Weak</I>, were chilling nonetheless and, in fact, influential in the mindset of Hitler himself. Funded and supported by several well-known wealthy donors, including the Rockefeller and Carnegie families and Alexander Graham Bell, the eugenicists believed that the physically impaired and "feeble-minded" should be subject to forced sterilization in order to create a stronger species and incur less social spending. These "defective" humans generally ended up being poorer folks who were sometimes categorized as such after shockingly arbitrary or capricious means ! such as failing a quiz related to pop culture by not knowing where the Pierce Arrow was manufactured. The list of groups and agencies conducting eugenics research was long, from the U.S. Army and the Departments of Labor and Agriculture to organizations with names like the "American Breeders Association." Black's detailed research into the history of the American eugenics movement is admirably extensive, but it is in the association between the beliefs of some members of the American aristocracy and Hitler that the book becomes most chilling. Black goes on to trace the evolution of eugenic thinking as it evolves into what is now called genetics. And while modern thinkers have thankfully discarded the pseudo-science of eugenics, such controversial modern issues as human cloning make one wonder how our own era will be remembered a hundred years hence. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>Maybe if this was the first book I had read on eugenics, I would have liked it better. There is no doubt that Black did his research...but much of this information had been given in a few books I prefer, including Daniel Kevles "In the Name of Eugenics," and in "The Mismeasure of Man" by Stephen Jay Gould. Part of what bothered me about Black's book is the title. As someone who is deaf and works in the bioethics/disability community, I was not crazy about perpetuating the idea that those of us with differences are 'weak'. I know that is what they thought back in the early 1900s, and they used much more derogatory terms like feeble-minded and idiots! But the word 'weak' is not one I want conveyed to others who read these books. It's great to have authors write with concern about eugenics raising it's ugly head again...even if they have no disability. However, there are many of us with differences who are working on our own to prevent another medical holocaust here...please do not perpetuate the image that those of us with disabilities need protection from the world. We will kick our own ass thank you!<p>The book was very repetitive of information I had garnered else where. Black provides very little new information in this huge, heavy tome. I think Black is trying to say that the U.S. needs to look at itself first, instead of getting on Germany's case about the Holocausts...because the U.S. provided the groundwork for the Nazis eradication programs of the disabled as well as the Jews and the Gypsies. <p>Black's writing in this book lacks passion. This is what gripped me in Gould's and Kevles' books...is they felt very strongly about statistics being used to label and denigrate people, and about our country's own holocausts. When writing a paper, social commentators need dispassion; in writing a book, passion should underline the stand the author takes. I don't see that here. <p>Black writes well...his book on "The Transfer Agreement" is spell-binding. This particular book lacks the emotion and yes, even the opinions, that drove that book. <p>Karen Sadler,<br>Science Education,<br>University of Pittsburgh</span>

                    <span>Edwin Black's War Against The Weak: Eugenics And America's Campaign To Create A Master Race is the story of eugenics and the American campaign to create a master race and is an exceptional history and offers insightful ethical considerations of the American eugenics movement. Chapters trace the roots of the movement to 1904, when a small group of scientists launched a new race-based concept, funded by American corporate institutes and foundations. Eugenics was even sanctioned by the Supreme Court and resulted in racist laws in over 27 states. This eye-opening social history belongs on the shelves of any college-level collection of American social issues and history.</span>

                    <span>...and have to say it was a GREAT READ! I'm going to keep this short, simple, and to the point; give this book a shot. I feel I've gained a very unique perspective of WWII and it's relationship to the US.<p>I was walking out of Barnes and Nobles only a week ago as my eyes grazed over the cover of the book on a shelf. Out of curiousity, I picked it up and was immediately engrossed by the first few pages. I venture to say any American would be, too. Edwin Black provides a clear, comprehensible history of not only eugenics, but the formation of modern genetics. You will uncover a largely untold piece of American history, as unbelievable and shocking as it may be. My friends wouldn't believe me when I shared the contents of this book with them; so I challenged them to read it. I finished it in under a week and am passing my copy along to them...I'm also taking the time to write this on Amazon...the book is that good.</span>

                    <span>Edwin Black should have a great sense of satisfaction, as reviewers unanimously express shock, outrage, horror and disgust at this book's revelations of America's complicity in the pseudoscience behind the Master Race and the Final Solution.   Had some of the great philanthropic institutions and social engineers of the time had their way, America would have tried to keep up with the Nazi's!<br>	Our knowledge of the past may prevent us from repeating our mistakes, but unfortunately, this tome, with its academic aura of footnotes and references, serves primarily to solidify the perception that ALL things linked to Nazism must be summarily rejected.  Barely beneath the "factual reporting" surface of this book seethes a swirling hatred of the Third Reich's creators and supporters.  It makes for gripping reading and allows the author to foster a sense of foul conspiracy and sinister plot in the reader's mind.  Entertainment trumps scholarship.<br>	I have no problem with entertainment, as long as the masquerade serves to deliver some grains of truth.  What I do take issue with is the abandonment of scholarship in the book's eye to the future.  Yes, there were horrors; yes, we went astray; but to think that we can permanently reject EVERYTHING associated with eugenics is to bury our heads in the sand.  Sooner or later, we will be forced to deal with physical and biological facts that will not go away-our resources are not boundless; our genes, the foundations of our specie's existence, are physically frail and in constant need of assessment and selection; our current infatuation with the sanctity of the individual must eventually be balanced by an increased sense of each individual's responsibility to our society.  War Against the Weak, while obliquely referencing these issues, ultimately contributes to their perpetuation because Mr. Black fails to suggest that some aspects of eugenics should be retrieved from the dustbin of history.<br>	Common wisdom teaches that noble ends do not justify ignoble means.  But noble goals are not made despicable when pursued by foul means.  It is the means that were misguided, not the goal.  To think that we will somehow survive and prosper without doing our genetic housekeeping is pure folly.</span>

                    <span>This book is a fascinating account of the eugenics movement that flourished in the United States during the first third of the twentieth century. With the help of an international team of researchers the author details the movement's history: creation of the Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island; the leadership of poultry researcher Charles Davenport; extensive Harriman, Rockefeller, and Carnegie funding; state laws legalizing compulsory sterilization; widespread acceptance by college presidents, clergymen, mental health workers, school principals, and leading progressive thinkers such as Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, and Woodrow Wilson; its validation by the United States Supreme Court in 1927 when it voted 8 to 1 to uphold the constitutionality of Virginia's eugenic sterilization law; and much, much more. <p>The book's most dramatic and controversial conclusion is that the American eugenics movement fueled the triumph of Nazism in Germany and thereby helped bring on the Holocaust. As Black writes in his Introduction, "the scientific rationales that drove killer doctors at Auschwitz were first concocted on Long Island at the Carnegie Institution's eugenic enterprise at Cold Spring Harbor." To his credit he provides a great deal of evidence to make his contention plausible, if not totally convincing. <p>The extremes to which the Nazis took their eugenics--euthansia killings of "unfit" Germans and the extermination of Jews, Gypsies, and others--gave eugenics a bad name from which it never recovered. This important book sheds much needed light on one of the darkest and most bizarre chapters of American history.<p>Charles Patterson, Ph.D., author of ETERNAL TREBLINKA: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust</span>
