                    <span>As an interior designer of 18 years I have seen design trends or "looks" come and go. And I must openly admit that in my early years I assisted many clients in scrambling after and capturing the style-du-jour, often at considerable financial expense and always at great spiritual expense (to us both). Because, you see, outward style is the manifestation of who and what we are on a spiritual level. In other words our personal style is Spirit in a physical form. So adopting a "look" or another's style simply because it is fashionable will always leave us feeling inwardly betrayed. My book "House of Belief" is an effort to help us find our inner motivations for the outward expression of our creativity at home. If you want to find and consciously express your own creative spirit in uplifting ways in your home, this book is for you. <P>However, if you want a book on creating this or that style look elsewhere; or if you want an approach to material stuff devoid of its conscious meaning and intent--that which is "look oriented" this book is not for you. If you do find you want meaning associated with the decorating of your home, then read on. <P>Heart and soul--those warm--and often emotional abstractions which we long to express find a material language inside a house of belief. A house of belief serves as a visual affirmation of all that we are and aspire to be. Every creative action we take becomes a ritual which perpetuates our belief in our own self-worth and creativity. Some might tag this concept "new" but it is truly an age old approach. As old as stained glass windows, hand-crafted furniture, and personally sewn curtains and clothing. When we make it ourselves, we believe in ourselves. We have evidence of our values and dreams for life and of our skills, talents, and potentials. A house of belief is our evidence; that which lifts us up and motivates us to the fulfillment of all we have ever hoped to achieve.<P>Is this possible? Can decorating really be a catalyst for far-reaching personal empowerment and growth in our lives? Sounds as absurd as the concept that "laughing can help to heal you" did at one time; but we now know that positive thoughts and feeling greatly contribute to our physical health. A house of belief surrounds us with positive reminders of our own creative spirit which keep us in a place of well being. See this evidenced in the stories and homes illustrated within House of Belief. And remember: this book is not for the spiritually squeamish or those yet celebrating the rift between body and soul.</span>

                    <span>Our homes should be reflections of our beliefs and who we really are rather than collections of mass-marketed, trendy items. Having our beliefs around us incorporated in to our interiors: personal mottoes on walls, embroidered into pillows, or painted onto chairs; portraits of those who inspire us; handmade quilts, pottery, or oil paintings--these are all the things that affirm who we are and who we want to be. If we see our beliefs and dreams in front of us on a daily basis, it is easier to manifest them.<P>This book demonstrates how we all have the tools to build our own houses of belief. It does not require special talent for interior design, just a strong desire to express our individuality and to make our homes havens that uplift our hearts and minds.</span>

                    <span>I love this book! The photos are exquisite and the writing exceeds anything else you will find on the subject of decorating. This book goes far beyond coffeetable status--it is inspiring all the way around; from the exercises and hands-on decorating rituals to the stories of healing through creativity.<BR>Be prepared to look at decorating in a new way--I have, as a professional designer I am rethinking my work. Thank-you Kelee Katillac.</span>

                    <span>I saw Kelee Katillac on the Carolyn Myss Show on Oprah's Oxygen Network. I was blown away by her personal story of healing while living in a trailer house--through creativity, .... I couldn't wait to get it so went out and bought it that day. I read it in two days and it has changed my life. Finally I feel good about the creative ideas I had for my home. I always thoughtthat because I wasn't a designer or artist that they must be wrong. Her life and work-with all income levels and types of people shows that we are all creative and our positive ideas are messages from the Creator. <P>I am now a follower of this idea and am convinced of her message's power;through her newsgroup I have found many others who feel the same and I feel I speak for them too--a person who has given her whole life to help others engenders a lot of loyalty--Katillac even sold her own home's contents to fund a Habitat for Humanity program. <P>...</span>

                    <span>After reading this book I had so many ideas I didn't know where to begin. I first saw Kelee on Oprah and thought her story was remarkable....her work with Habitat for Humanity is so inspiring. And now I can use her immense spirit and creativity for my own home. She is like a spiritual Martha Stewart but so much more interesting!</span>
