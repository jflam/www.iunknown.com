                    <span>Business and sales people working with tight marketing budgets like me will find this book very useful because about half of the marketing ideas are very smart, but inexpensive. I have used some ideas about cross-promotion from the book, and within days it helped me land a few thousand dollars worth of new sales, an amazing return on investment!!! For the most part the marketing suggestions are very simple and belong in the "why didn't I think of that file," but there are some that are more advanced and likely better suited to fortune 500 marketers with monster advertising budgets. Chapters cover marketing ideas for sales, advertising, public relations, retailing, marketing planning, websites and e-commerce, trade shows, competition, and customer service ideas. The author has even created a symbol guide which indicates things such as the approximate cost to implement the marketing idea, and if the idea is a do-it-yourself job, or if you should call in professional help. The book also contains many additional sources of marketing information, ideas, associations, and services. My only complaint is that there is so much information in the book that it is a bit overwhelming if you try to take in too much at one time. This book is my new marketing library.</span>
