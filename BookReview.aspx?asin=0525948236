                <span id="Label1">"Living is like tearing through a museum. Not until later do you really start absorbing what you saw, thinking about it, looking it up in a book and remembering&#151; because you can&#146;t take it all in at once." <BR> &#151;Audrey Hepburn<BR><BR>  <P>On many occasions, she was approached to pen her autobiography, the definitive book of Audrey Hepburn, yet she never agreed. A beloved icon who found success as an actress, a mother and an humanitarian, Audrey Hepburn perfected the art of gracious living.<P>  <P>More philosophy than biography, <I>How to Be Lovely</I> revisits the many interviews Audrey gave over the years, allowing us to hear her voice directly on universal topics of concern to women the world over: careers, love lives, motherhood and relationships. Enhanced by rarely seen photographs, behind-the-scenes stories, and insights from the friends who knew her well, <I>How to Be Lovely</I> uncovers the real Audrey, in her own words. <P>  <P>While she would have been the last to say so, Audrey Hepburn was an expert in the art of being a woman. <I>How to Be Lovely</I> imparts whatever wisdom and insight she found along the way to the millions who grew up, or will grow up, wanting to be just like her. <P>  <P>Published to coincide with Audrey Hepburn&#146;s would-be seventy-fifth birthday, <I>How to Be Lovely</I> offers a rare glimpse into the woman behind the mystique and the definitive guide to living genuinely with glamour and grace. <P></span>

                    <span>I really wasn't familiar with Audrey, but this book was a great introduction for me. Passed by it in a book store, and the title grabbed me. Sat down to browse thru it and never got up. Wonderful words of wisdom here. Didn't realize she was so down-to-earth. Now I'm off to find more stuff about her. There were a few editorial misses, but thanks for a great book.</span>

                    <span>This beautiful treasury shares the same qualities as its subject--there is magic at work here that winsomely floats forth and manages to be unforgettable. More than a lovely tribute to this remarkable icon, it resonates with life affirming smarts and down-to-earth pluck. Hurrah for author Hellstern. Audrey is smiling on you...</span>

                    <span>This is the perfect book to give for birthdays, hostess gifts, Christmas, Mother's day, graduation, or any special event in a woman's life. I sent it home with 15 ladies who attended a baby shower, and it has inspired several Audrey "film-festivals." Her thoughts on how to carry oneself with style, dignity and grace will translate to any generation. "How to be Lovely" should be on every woman's night stand.</span>

As a serious admirer and fan of Audrey Hepburn,I can truly say that this book has the thought,love,care, and kindness that are befitting to Audrey.There are many quotes that Audrey said and all are of tremendous wisdom and thought. If you're like me,you'll be an Audrey Hepburn fan for life.<BR>Audrey,you were a beautiful,talented,and loving lady-we miss you very much.<BR></span>
