                    <span>Here is a good survey of the development of differential forms as an extension of tensor calculus. This book successfully straddles the classical and modern views of physics on curved geometries, working its way forward from chapter to chapter, (or as the back cover says, by a process of successive abstraction), from parallel displacement to affine connections to curvature tensors and integration theorems on Riemannian manifolds. An appendix summarizing the theory of exterior calculus on manifolds closes the book.
<br />
<br />I was familiar with the original hardcover edition of this book and welcome its reissue as an inexpensive Dover paperback. While this may not be the ideal selection for those seeking a single mathematical guide to modern General Relativity theory, I'm not sure such a book exists for the needs of all readers. 
<br />
<br />Lovelock & Rund do a good job of scoping and meeting their objectives. The material is well-organized and the authors guide the reader clearly through most of the derivations. They show how curvature can be defined on a manifold with or without a metric, enabling the reader to make the transition from Euclidean space to Riemannian spaces with minimum confusion. By retaining traditional notation through most of the book, H&R provide the student with familiar handles to grasp. 
<br />
<br />Good supplementary reading can be found in other books available from Dover, such as Flanders' popular classic on Differential Forms, Bishop & Goldberg's Tensor Analysis on Manifolds, and Pauli's authoritative Theory of Relativity. Even if you have the dough for Misner Thorne & Wheeler and the spine to lug it around, you still might want these books in your library too.</span>

                    <span>As mentioned below, this book concentrates for 330+ pages on a "classical" index-based approach to tensors. Coordinate-free treatment is restricted to a brief appendix. There are only 10 illustrations in this very long book (none in the appendix). That means that you will need to concentrate very hard on the manipulation of many tiny indices in some long and hairy equations. 
<br />
<br />My hat's off to people who can learn this way, but I am in the camp that expects pictures for geometrical subjects. In this respect, Schutz is a much better book, as well as being coordinate-free from the get-go. (Ditto for Misner Thorne Wheeler and Carroll on general relativity, as well as various works by V. Arnol'd or J. Marsden that deal with this material in classical physics contexts.) I bought this book as a reference -- it might be useful also for people who want to come up with computational approaches to the material. 
<br />
<br />I might have given the book 3 stars but for the facts that (i)  no solutions to exercises (only some of which are in the "show that this stuff = X" format) and (ii) text is filled with "clearly"s, "obviously"s and other superfluities.</span>

                    <span>This is a book from which you can learn about tensors and really KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!!! Sure, so you can complain about it's slight lack of rigor--big deal!!!!!  Once you're done reading this book, move on to the books that DO have rigor (if you're a mathematician-type rather than a physicist-type), but if you want an introduction to the theory of tensors which provides true intuitive understanding of what tensors are, why they are useful, and how the idea of tensors arose, then buy this book.  This book requires almost no prerequisites except for a good background in vectors, matrices, and certain aspects of multivariable calculus.  Buy it NOW, and thank God that it is published by Dover.</span>

                    <span>Lots of material for the price, but this is one of those maths book with a "physical approach", IMO. Definitions for instances, like the definition of a Tensor, aren't always enounced clearly. <p>This just make things look more complex and different than what they are for no gain.<p>I believe that the book "Tensor calculus on manifold", same editor, Goldberg/Bishop does a better job: more rigorous and more concise.</span>

                    <span>Many years ago, this became the first book I had ever read about tensor calculus, differential geometry, or classical field theories, and I still have not found a much better treatment of any of these subjects anywhere else.  
<br />
<br />The notation is often very classical, in the sense that there are a lot of indices, usually referring to coordinate bases, and there is a lot of talk of "transformation laws."  While this style can be distressing to more advanced students, those familiar with the beautiful methods of avoiding such structures, I think it is useful to younger students, especially physicists, who yearn for concrete examples.  Also, for the one section in which a more formal approach is advantageous, such a treatment is included as an appendix.  
<br />
<br />The book is also wonderful for its breadth.  It is not a "tensor calculus" book, or a "differential geometry" book.  It is really best described as a "geometrical methods" book "with applications to theoretical physics."  Yet unlike most examples of this now-cliched subject, the breadth of material is matched by a cohesion of style.  </span>
