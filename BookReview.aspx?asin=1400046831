                    <span>If you like Tom Peters you will love Tim Sanders. Tim is a knowledge aggregator - he's taken a whole bunch of ideas from books he has read and turned those ideas into his business philosphy. This is about Tim Sanders, Inc. who happens to work for Yahoo! It's about personal branding, personal marketing, and adding value to the organization. Tim's point is that you can do all of that and still be a nice guy and if you do it right you will be creating a great experience for those who work with you or for you. It's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" for the 21st century networked world. I think it is a great book. Tim has taken some big ideas - knowledge acquisition, networking, killer app's, personal branding, compassion (i.e., love), etc. - and weaved them into a personal philosophy that he offers up as a guide to the business world. Whether you agree with Tim or not, it's pretty cool stuff. And if you want to follow his guide you should first make a list of books you want to read. "Love is the Killer App" should be first on the list.</span>

                    <span>Tim Sanders' book is a solid piece that is a thoughtful guide to life in corporate America in the 21st Century. We live in an economy that is heavily dependent on knowledge workers and on the old maxim, "It's not who you know, but who knows you." Sanders mentions that intangibles--namely, knowledge, networks, and compassion---are what govern the world of business. <P>If you look at background of many business leaders (i.e Hugh McColl, Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban, Lou Gerstner and Jeffery Immelt among them) you will find an almost insatiable desire to learn and gain knowledge through reading. Tim's focus on the importance of knowledge attainment and explication of the system he uses to extract ideas from books is worth the price of the book. I have already taken heed to a suggestion he mentions about buying multiple copies of your favorite books and giving them out as gifts.<P>Next, he focuses on the importance of developing a system to keep in touch with the various people in your network. As Sanders mentions on page 144, "Someday this will be true for all of us: Our network will equal our net worth." His system of collecting, connecting and disappering is useful and is something that is admittedly a weak spot for me. Additionally, when doling out network contacts, it is useful to remember to heed the advice of Jesus Christ who once admonished his disciples "to be wise as serpents but as harmless as doves." <P>The last part of the book was more of an affirmation of what I know to be true about life in general. Give people praise and support, pay attention to your attitude and make time to connect with people.<P>I've learned quite a bit from Sanders' work and had the pleasure to meet him during his book signing in Atlanta. He's for real and makes a good deal of sense.</span>

                    <span>Lovecats. That is what Tim Sanders tells us we need to be in order to be successful in today's world. Sanders, Chief Solutions Officer at Yahoo!, takes his message on the road as he consults with executives at top corporations on marketing and Internet strategy.<P>"Love is the Killer App," is a thesis on networking. Sanders stresses that the way to win friends and influence people is to give them value first. He advises to share your intangibles - your compassion and your knowledge with people with whom you want to do business. This is being a Lovecat.<P>Sanders goes on to illustrate the importance of learning as much as possible so that you have something of value to share. His formula for this is to read books - all the time! And, while reading, outline the book and understand the key points or "Big Statement" the author intended to make. Then, when you meet someone, find out what interests them and what challenges they face, and share what you have learned that would be relevant for them.<P>Through this little book, Sanders shares his own key to success - Nice guys rule!</span>

                    <span>This book is an interesting book which shows: As business people we need to update ourselves continuously with knowledge and love... It also shows strategies to better read and consume a business book... It is really helpful for the people who believe in human touch and sharing... I feel that i am not alone in this world after i read this book... Read the book you will get lots of good business book recommendations also...<BR>Some people again made some comments about the writing of the book... if you are interested to read literature go and buy Lord Byron or Shakespeare... The writer tries to share his passion and some people write comments about the language of the book... Be sincere... sincerity comes with human mistakes...<P>thanks</span>
