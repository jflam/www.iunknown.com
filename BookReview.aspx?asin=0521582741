                <span id="Label1">This new, expanded textbook describes all phases of a modern compiler: lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax, semantic actions, intermediate representations, instruction selection via tree matching, dataflow analysis, graph-coloring register allocation, and runtime systems. It includes good coverage of current techniques in code generation and register allocation, as well as functional and object-oriented languages, that are missing from most books. In addition, more advanced chapters are now included so that it can be used as the basis for two-semester or graduate course. The most accepted and successful techniques are described in a concise way, rather than as an exhaustive catalog of every possible variant. Detailed descriptions of the interfaces between modules of a compiler are illustrated with actual C header files. The first part of the book, Fundamentals of Compilation, is suitable for a one-semester first course in compiler design. The second part, Advanced Topics, which includes the advanced chapters, covers the compilation of  object-oriented and functional languages, garbage collection, loop optimizations, SSA form, loop scheduling, and optimization for cache-memory hierarchies.</span>

                    <span>Appel explains the structure of a compiler in a very clear and precise fashion, including a lot of quite modern techniques. *However* it is only clear and precise if you have a rough high-level understanding of compilers and a good knowledge of ML beforehand. (If you understand one of the two, it is an excellent book for learning the other but you will need to do some thinking for yourself.)<p>If you're looking to learn about compilers from the very beginning, buy something else (I liked "Crafting A Compiler" as a starting point). If you're wanting to get a lot more precise about the way you build compilers, buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This book aims at teaching the reader how to write compilers and interpreters. Compared to other books (most notably the Dragon book - Aho, Sethi & Ullman: Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools) the structure and organization of the compiler he teaches are better and more in sync with modern compiler research. So although ML is not a language that is used much in practice it is well choosen for teaching compilers.<p>The first part of the book is intended for undergraduate Computer Science university student and the second part is for graduate students. I have only read the first part and browsed the second part. The first part is founded on the development of a compiler - the Tiger compiler - and that is the main flaw of the book. The Tiger compiler is fairly advanced and it is built up one phase at the time (see the chapter headings in the synopsis). A undergraduate reader who has never read anything about compiler design before will be very confused. The book is good in the way that it presents many good compiler design ideas and I learned some from it, but for me it was not the first book on compiler. I just think that the first part of the book has too steep a learning curve - even if you are proficient with ML, which is an absolute must. Recommended for serious readers who already know something about compiler construction before reading it. For other people I recommend the older but somewhat outdated book: Aho, Sethi & Ullman: Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools.</span>

                    <span>This book is a textbook that forces you to work on a toy language called Tiger, then take you step by step thru the Lexer, Parser, Semantic Analyzer ... That is good organization; problem is, it purposely omits a lot of details so you have to burn a lot of your time trying to figure out what exactly **he wants** to have in the implementation. That is bad because it can get exceedingly hard, and as what other readers have said, it is very hard to understand what he is trying to say.<p>Basically, don't buy the book. Go look for something of commercial worth. This book will drive you crazy and make you lose your interest in compilers. The author is making the subject much harder than it actually should be.<p>If you are a university professor thinking about using this book as a textbook, please spare the souls of your students and rather come up with something reasonably easy to understand. Please. Really. I'm serious.<p>Ok, I hope I have shed some light for the potential buyers so they'll not buy something to frustrate themselves (horribly).<p>(Best thing is, he doesn't give you the model solutions to his projects, so you'll be forced to write his programs or give up halfway, no other choices. Not good at all)</span>

                    <span>Appel very clearly describes, step by step, the implementation of a compiler, and explains as well the reasons why ML is a good language to use. If you don't like ML (which is, incidentally, a "real  language"), there are Java and C versions of the book.</span>
