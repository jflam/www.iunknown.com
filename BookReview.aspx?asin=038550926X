                <span id="Label1">It's a killer title: <I>The Devil Wears Prada</I>. And it's killer material: author Lauren Weisberger did a stint as assistant to Anna Wintour, the all-powerful editor of <I>Vogue</I> magazine. Now she's written a book, and this is its theme: narrator Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of <I>Runway</I> magazine. Turns out Miranda is quite the bossyboots. That's pretty much the extent of the novel, but it's plenty. Miranda's behavior is so insanely over-the-top that it's a gas to see what she'll do next, and to try to guess which incidents were culled from the real-life antics of the woman who's been called Anna "Nuclear" Wintour. For instance, when Miranda goes to Paris for the collections, Andrea receives a call back at the New York office (where, incidentally, she's not allowed to leave her desk to eat or go to the bathroom, lest her boss should call). Miranda bellows over the line: "I am standing in the pouring rain on the <I>rue de Rivoli</I> and my driver has vanished. Vanished! Find him immediately!" <p>  This kind of thing is delicious fun to read about, though not as well written as its obvious antecedent, <I>The Nanny Diaries</I>. And therein lies the essential problem of the book. Andrea's goal in life is to work for <I>The New Yorker</I>--she's only sticking it out with Miranda for a job recommendation. But author Weisberger is such an inept, ungrammatical writer, you're positively rooting for her fictional alter ego not to get anywhere near <I>The New Yorker</I>. Still, Weisberger has certainly one-upped <I>Me Times Three</I> author Alex Witchel, whose magazine-world novel never gave us the inside dope that was the book's whole <I>raison d' etre</I>. For the most part, <I>The Devil Wears Prada</I> focuses on the outrageous Miranda Priestly, and she's an irresistible spectacle. <I>--Claire Dederer</I> </span>

                    <span>Lauren Weisberger's "The Devil Wears Prada" is probably one of the most alluring book titles in years. If only the actual content of the book were half so interesting. Alas, it's mostly whiny, poorly written and makes rather feeble grabs for sympathy and understanding, but doesn't actually get either.<P>Andrea Sachs wants to be a writer for the New Yorker. But for any chance at that, she has to work as a personal assistant for Miranda Priestly, chief editor of the prestigious fashion magazine Runway. She doesn't like fashion (despite an overriding concern with top-notch brand names) but is willing to do it to move up the ladder of success.<P>Soon she discovers that Miranda is, in fact, a boss from hell. Lunch demands, business trips, and phone calls are all given a manic twist as Miranda makes demands that no human being should have to put up with. Is it going to get worse? And just how far into Hades can Miranda take Andrea before enough is enough?<P>Only fashionistas and wannabe-fashionistas will find this book a compelling read. It's not even a good beach read -- even beach reads are supposed to have some semblance of a plot, or likable characters. This thinly-veiled roman à clef seems only to be a chance for the author to portray her ex-boss Anna Wintour as evil incarnate (get it? "Devil Wears Prada" -- how deviously subtle!). Worst of all, we're supposed to pity a woman who is working at a Vogue-like mag as a first job, getting prestigious resume material, and is making a mint to boot. Cry me a river, you lucky dog.<P>The writing is quite unbalanced. Despite Andrea's supposed apathy towards fashion, the designer tag of every dress, jacket and shoe is put forward. Weisberger's writing has a certain fluffy charm, but it lacks in zest. Perhaps in time it will balance itself out and be genuinely engaging. At the moment, it's just moderately interesting, with some typos that made me blink in disbelief. ("Heroine-chic" was a joke, right?)<P>The only characters who you'll remember as you flip the last page are Andrea and Miranda; the others are thin paper dolls. Andrea is pretty thin herself (and I'm not talking about her weight). Her whiny, petty, self-centered behavior has the occasional good deed thrown in, but it isn't enough to make her likable. On the other hand, Miranda's over-the-top evil behavior is funnier than it is evil.<P>Like wearing an ill-fitting miniskirt, this book is unpleasant and kind of embarrassing. Roman à clef novels are rarely good, but this one is worse than most. The devil who wears Prada is the only truly interesting thing about this flimsy novel.</span>

                    <span>I was excited to see that this book had finally been released on paperback so I picked it up immediately. However, it was very disappointing. The book is a 400-page rant from a selfish, boring character that we've seen millions of times before (think blonde, blue eyed, naive, small-town girl..) The author writes as though she is an expert in her field dishing the dirt - meanwhile the info in this book is common knowledge and there are even some things I find incorrect. Also, it is not particularly well-written or articulate. The author tends to go into such detail about daily trips to Starbucks but briefly mulls over entire months of the protagonist's life. <P>It may be a cute read for younger women or those who are really curious about the fashion industry.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book--I found it hard to put down, and it's the perfect companion for all those recent college grads slogging through their morning commutes (or perhaps their jobs). But ultimately Weisberger offers little original here; she just plays a series of riffs that she knows will sell plenty of copies. If you like Madonna better than Britney Spears, you'll like Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' Diary better than The Devil Wears Prada. Fielding employs many of the same rhetorical techniques as Weisberger--using lots of brand names and silly hyperbole to conjure vivid images--but her writing also doubles as social criticism, something that Weisberger's agent presumably advised against.</span>

                    <span>Weisberger's novel about a recent college graduate from an ivy league who is trying to make her way up the corporate ladder in order to finally have a job that requires more skills and intelligence that the 50 brain cells it takes to pick up a Starbucks frap and jot down messages from important callers will ring true to everyone who has had to do his/her fair share of bitch work. Any intern or recent college graduate who is simply forced to do busy work unaffiliated in any way with his or her major or expertise will find the story endearing, for I bet each and every reader is familiar with "the boss from hell." Surprisingly, there are a lot of those out there. However, although the concept is familiar to many, Weisberger's writing fails to elicit the desired response from the reader. Although one is expected to feel frustration, anger, and even pity for the Andy, the poor intern who landed a job far from her expectations, Weisberger is unable to properly convey the feelings to the reader, and one can find themselves associating with the main character only if they have previously been in a similar situation, not through the feelings and situations depicted in the writing. <P>Furthermore, although Andy's character undergoes through several changes as the reader turns the pages, the changes in her personality are not accurately described and are often illustrated in a very humdrum style. In addition, the ending proves to be a bit anti-climatic, and the main point that Weisberger was getting to need to be elucidated, for though it seems that the author tries to convey a message about standing up for oneself and following your career goals despite the obstacles in the way, that message is lost among the plethora of product placements, catchy one-liners, and secondary stories about Andy's boyfriend and best friend.</span>

                    <span>What attracted me to this book in the first place was the title- how could you resist something with a title like The Devil Wears Prada? Its a great novel, and I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who can sympathize with Andrea Sachs, a recent college grad who lands a job working as an assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor in chief at Runway magazine. Her year of servitude will get her any job she wants, even a position at The New Yorker, a job Andrea has always coveted. Miranda is a demanding boss, asking her assistants to do ridiculous, even absurd things for her, like getting two copies of the latest Harry Potter book for her twin daughters before it even hits stores, or expecting food orders in impossibly short amounts of time. But Andrea always does it, though inside she hates it. Andrea holds a degree in English from Brown, and... this is what she ends up doing? Doing dirty work for a woman who is impossible to please? It sounds similar to a lot of people who are just out of college, and this is why I liked the book so much. Many people spend four years, or more, getting degrees, and then they find that those degrees in no way prepare them for the jobs they'll have in the real world. <P>The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Andrea always sounded whiny and selfish. I mean, who really cares what you think? We've all had over-demanding, pushy bosses who expected the impossible from us. Half of me kept wanting Andrea to suck it up and do her job, the other half of me wanted her to stick up to Miranda. <P>In the end, Andrea sticks up for herself. But, lucky for Andrea, it all works out in the end (though she looses her job and boyfriend in the process). If you want something fast and fun to read, then I recommend this book.</span>
