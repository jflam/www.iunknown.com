                <span id="Label1">Over half the households in America include an animal companion.  Yet behind this immense love of animals lies an equally immense tragedy: each year, community animal shelters take in eight to twelve million lost and unwanted dogs and cats who face an uncertain fate.  <P>One at a Time: A Week in an American Animal Shelter brings this issue vividly to life via a true account of 7 days in a typical U.S. animal shelter.  With compelling photos and moving vignettes, this book chronicles the stories of 75 animals who passed through a Northern California animal shelter during one week.  Their gripping stories include excerpts from actual shelter records; the words of shelter workers, volunteers, and visitors; and the final conclusion of each animal's journey through the animal shelter system.  <P>Look into the eyes of these animals and let their stories give you a riveting and unforgettable glimpse into this nation's homeless animal tragedy.  Whether it is the lost dog quickly reunited with his family because he was wearing an ID tag, the frightened cat given up by guardians who didn't understand the commitment of caring for her, the cat facing euthanasia or the dog joyfully adopted into a new home, each animal in One at a Time has an important lesson to teach and a powerful message to share.  <P>One at a Time will help you to see the real faces behind the numbers, and to experience the miracles and heartbreak that play out every day in our nation's shelters... one animal at a time.  <P>Even more importantly, One at a Time will give you hope, because this tragedy can be ended and each one of us can be part of the solution... offering us the chance to become better people, to reawaken our connection with other living beings, and to reaffirm the sanctity of life itself.  The animals of One at a Time will show you how.</span>

                    <span>One at a Time sends a powerful message through the stories of individual animals who are homeless and in crisis. It is the finest example I have ever read on the topic of unwanted/homeless animals in our society and the shelters that accept all dogs and cats brought to their doors. Each animal's story and accompaning photograph provides a greater understanding of why millions of wonderful dogs and cats become homeless. In addition, One at a Time gives us hope by empowering individuals to facilitate change through simple acts of responsibity and kindness. <P>If every petlover (who in the past purchased a dog or cat) read One at a Time, their next opportunity to obtain a pet would result in a visit to their local shelter. Everyone who has an interest in animals, including breeders, no-kill advoctes, and public officials, will gain a greater understanding of the life saving services shelters provide.</span>

                    <span>This book has created a profoundly moving experience in my life. The authors are not shy nor do they gloss over the plight of shelter animals. "Pedigreed" pets may be nice for some, but many do not realise the needs of a shelter animal. Being a home-rescuer and foster-guardian myself, I was able to identify with the plight of the abundance of strays and how to help them. After reading the book, I also learned why animals do what they do in a shelter environment. An aside: I certainly was not prepared for the chapter on Euthanasia, but I am glad that it is there. <P> This book deserves to be in every vet's office across the country. I have started to purchase extras for my vets, and anyone who would listen. Please note also that the book provides ways you, too, can help raise awareness of this crucial need.</span>

                    <span>As I read Merilee Geyer and Diane Leigh's incredible book, "One At A Time", I re-visited my many years in animal shelters and realized that this book puts life back into all the animals I've known who've given their lives as a result of irresponsible guardianship. This is a book to share. This is a book to cherish. This is a book that pays hommage and tribute to the millions of animals that loved and lost. This is a book that celebrates those that found new love and companionship.</span>

                    <span>The collaborative effort of former animal shelter workers and animal rights activists Diane Leigh and Marilee Geyer, One At A Time: A Week In An American Animal Shelter is a true account of seven days in an animal shelter, featuring profiles of the pets taken in during that span of time. Presenting the truth of life and death in an animal shelter in unvarnished, uncompromising terms, and featuring black-and-white photographs as well as the stories of the canines and felines taken in, One At A Time is an emotionally moving and profound piece recommended to the attention of anyone who has every been graced with the company of an animal companion -- or who would like to be.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book! As the volunteer "Pet of the Week" photographer for the Inyo County (California) Animal Shelter for the past 7 years, I know firsthand the heartbreak of the animals that are abandoned. Diane Leigh and Marilee Geyer have done an outstanding job of opening a window for all to see the reality of life at a Shelter and, at the same time, done it with incredible sensitivity. I pray this book will change the disposable mentality too many people have about our precious, sentient companion animals. Until there are none, adopt one!</span>
