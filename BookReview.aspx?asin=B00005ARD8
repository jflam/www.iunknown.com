                    <span>This is heavenly music: I loved the sounds from the first track and can hardly wait to see the DVD. I have played the soundtrack for all eight hours of my work day today and still want to hear it again. <BR>I have been to the Far East and the music makes me want to return to see Nepal. I hope this region and people will not be devastated in the future.</span>

                    <span>Not speaking or understanding Tibetian, didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie, and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why. It guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high trails, powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air. You are at once engulfed in the Tibetian life, you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants, singing bowls, and drums.</span>

                    <span>After seeing the gorgeous film, I ordered the CD within days. At first listen I only heard the occasional heavy string sections and felt that I'd rushed into buying a CD that failed to carry the spirit of the film. However, after a few spins in the ol' CD player, I found myself listening to it every day. A consistent soothing melody recurs throughout the CD, echoing the Buddhist chant: Om Mani Pedme Hung. Then, going out, I found the chant continuing in my mind. What a wonderful effect! Use this mantra of love and compassion to soften, to ease and soften your mind, energy and spirit. The CD ultimately has that power.</span>

                    <span>Using Tibetan incantations, Mr. Bruno Coulais has composed some of the best musical scores I have ever listened. Every piece of music depicts the real life struggles of these people of Dolpo. The compositions are so strong, so natural, sometimes so haunting, it draws you ever closer to these people. To those magnificent and breathtaking sceneries, Mr. Coulais has added another dimension; his music tells the story, the drama, the struggles of life in its true authentic way of life of the Tibetans. With each piece of music you travel along with the caravan, singing their songs, sharing their moments of joy and sorrow. Unlike other soundtracks this one really belongs to the people of Dolpo. You must really listen to believe me.</span>
