                <span id="Label1">Doom, the video game in which you navigate a dungeon in the first person and messily lay waste to everything that crosses your path, represented a milestone in many areas. It was a technical landmark, in that its graphics engine delivered brilliant performance on ordinary PC hardware. It was a social phenomenon, with individuals and companies hooking up networks specifically for Doom tournaments and staying up for days to blast away on them (well before the Internet went big-time). The game's publisher, id Software, used an unusual shareware marketing strategy (give away the first levels, charge for the more advanced ones) that worked very well. On top of it all, the gore-filled game raised serious questions about decency in products meant for use by school-age kids. <I>Masters of Doom</I> explores the Doom phenomenon, as well as the lives and personalities of the two men behind it: John Carmack and John Romero.<p>  This book manages, for the most part, to keep clear of the breathless techno-hagiography style that characterizes many books with similar subjects. He tells the story of Carmack, Romero, and id--which includes far more than Doom and its successors--in novel style, and he's done a good job of keeping the action flowing and the characters' motivations clear. Some of the quoted passages of dialog sound like idealized reconstructions that probably never came from the lips of real people, but this is an entertaining and informative book, of interest to anyone who's let rip with a nail gun. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: The biographies of John Carmack and John Romero, and of their company, id Software. The development and marketing of all major id games (including Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom II, and Quake) get lavish attention.</span>

                    <span>As someone who spent a large amount of time playing Quake online, following Quake on the web, and talking about Quake on the IRC, this book was a very quick and highly entertaining read.  It also provides quite a bit of insight into how some of the most important and greatest computer games were created.
<br />
<br />The author clearly recognizes that video games are an art form, an expression.  Like any art form, there is the good and there is the bad.  The games by iD Software are great games, particularly the early games that this book focuses on.  Quite a bit of the book focused on these early games, Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, and Doom.  In fact, a surprisingly large section of the book was dedicated to Apple II games that the founders of iD software played and wrote and their time spent at the long-defunct Softdisk magazine.
<br />
<br />The first games I played were on an AppleIIc and it was very enjoyable to read about.  While I played a fair amount of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom I/II, Quake was my fix.  Of all iD's games, this is the one that, once released, took a life of it's own the most.  Reading through the later sections of the book that focus on Quake and the madness that ensued around it I came across many familiar names that I used to talk to, deathmatch with, or just know from living the lifestyle.
<br />
<br />Anyone who was there (I might know you!) and was involved in the community will very much enjoy this book.  Even though it was only a few years ago, I still find myself missing that time and this book was a reminder of just how exciting those days were.  There were also parts that brought back negative memories, such as the public mud-slinging between Ion Storm and iD and the reverberations it had within the community.
<br />
<br />Even if you never played any of the games mentioned, the evolving personalities and stranger than fiction success and failure stories are enough to keep you interested.  iD software is DIY at it's greatest, and to anyone looking to become a part of the video game industry this is an essential read.</span>

                    <span>Masters of Doom is a great behind the scenes look at one of the revolutionary game development companies in the business.  Starting from the very beginning, when the two John's were just children dreaming about games and hacking away at any computer they could find, the book chronicles the rise, and fall, of the empire known as id Software.
<br />
<br />The book, while it is based on actual events, reads very much like a novel.  Much of the action unfolds like a drama.
<br />
<br />If you or anyone you know loves games, I highly recommend this book.  It's an entertaining read all the way through.  
<br />
<br />My only true complaint about this book is that it ended.</span>

                    <span>This book tells the story of John Romero and John Carmack, the two computer programmers behind the game of Doom and the company they created, Id Software.  Additionally, the early history of the PC and PC gaming are discussed in great detail in this book.  This is a highly interesting book, especially if you grew up during what the book calls the "Golden Age of Gaming", which is the late 1970's and early 1980's.  The book is entertating, enjoyable and informative.  My only beef with the book is that the author seems to impart more importance on this story and its characters than I beleive is necessary.  Obviously, there are many more important events than the advent of PC gaming.  Regardless, the book is very enjoyable and highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>... then read this book. Kushner has done a simply excellent job at writing this book. It is laid out in a simple, chronological manner, very well informed and fun to read.
<br />The story of the two Johns and the rest of the iD staff, the living legends of the fps genre. Need I say more?
<br />Read this book!</span>

                    <span>I am not a gamer and have only played Doom once when I was dating an engineer, but as an entrepreneur and start-up person I loved this book. Masters of Doom paints a very vivid portrait of a successful start-up company from development through to marketing and distribution. It is a story that reads like a great movie with rich characters passionately building something they love. I couldn't put it down and couldn't stop thinking about it for days.</span>
