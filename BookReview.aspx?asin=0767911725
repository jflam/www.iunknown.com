                <span id="Label1">A fun, lively and learned excursion into cultural history that unlocks the mystery behind each letter of our alphabet, from the &#8220;A&#8221; of <b>The Scarlet Letter</b> to the &#8220;Z&#8221; of Zorro.<br><br>Letters are tangible language. Joining together in endless combinations to actually show speech, letters convey our messages and tell our stories. While we encounter these tiny shapes hundreds of times a day, we take for granted the long, fascinating history behind one of the most fundamental of human inventions -- the alphabet.<br><br>The heart of the book is the 26 fact-filled &#8220;biographies&#8221; of letters A through Z, each one identifying the letter&#8217;s particular significance for modern readers, tracing its development from ancient forms, and discussing its noteworthy role in literature and other media. We learn, for example, why the letter X has a sinister and sexual aura, how B came to signify second best, why the word &#8220;mother&#8221; in many languages starts with M, and what is the story of O. The book also features clever illustrations for each letter, such as Winston Churchill&#8217;s &#8220;V-for-Victory&#8221; World War II hand-sign, or the trademark &#8220;N&#8221; from the label of Newman&#8217;s Own salad dressing, or images from rock music and other pop culture.<br>Clearly explaining the letters as symbols of precise speech-sounds, the book begins with the earliest known alphabetic inscriptions from about 1800 BC -- recently discovered by archaeologists in Egypt -- and traces the history of our alphabet from its beginnings in Phoenicia, Greece and Rome and up through medieval Europe to the present day.<br><br>Packed with information, <b>Language Visible</b> is not only accessible and entertaining, but essential to the appreciation of our own language.</span>

                    <span>"Language Visible" is a delightful combination of history, humor, linguistics, puns, archaeology, and fancy. The thrill David Sacks gets from the subject is evident throughout. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. My family tolerated my frequent comments about some aspect of the history of writing or some other interesting tidbit from the book, and may have been sufficiently intrigued to want to read the book themselves.<P>The frequent sidebars are at once a fascinating set of trips and an annoying intrusion. They usually present entertaining information, but they usually interrupt the flow of the main text, requiring flipping back and forth to maintain context in more than one flow. There is even one instance of a sidebar within a sidebar, and one where the sidebar is interrupted to resume the main text. A minor annoyance, but still an annoyance. <P>As I singer, I have a particular fondness for the minutiae of pronunciation, and in this area the book let me down. It was as if the author had never heard of a diphthong or a glide. Given the technical names he used for the various consonant and vowel forms, I found it rather jarring to hear him imply that the American letter name "A" is a pure vowel, to see the French "J" sound presented as having *more* rather than fewer component sounds than the English "J" sound, and to hear him find only a slight similarity between the "U" and "W" sounds. This fault did not detract significantly from the book as a whole, but it rather bothered me in the U-V-W discussion, which are consecutive chapters in the alphabetically ordered book.</span>

                    <span>Scrabble players take delight. Linguists and lovers of the phonetic stand up and cheer. In this original and delightful book the letters take on their own personalities as author David Sacks reveals their origins and their transitions from ancient tongues into modern English.<P>Combining classic erudition (Sacks is the author of The Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World) with contemporary references and allusions--such as "p" being for "Puff Daddy" and "w" for President George W. (Dubya) Bush--David Sacks brings the alphabet to life and reveals its long and twisted history.<P>The sounds and shapes of the letters are explored in minute detail. We can trance the evolution of the letter "a" from its Phoenician origins as the symbol for an ox to its use by Hebrews as "aleph" to its incorporation by the Greeks as "alpha," and know that A was always first. We can see how the letter "e" (the most frequently used letter in the English language) was once shaped like a stick figure man in Egypt around 1800 B.C. in a long dead Semitic language, and how it became the logo for Enron (tilted up so that it supposedly symbolized "ascent and power"). Sacks reveals that one such Enron sculpture sold for forty-four thousand dollars at an auction in September 2002. <P>Why does X stand for the unknown and not Z? Sacks has the answer. How did G become C when the Greeks had gamma as the third letter of their alphabet? Indeed why do we have an alphabet at all? Why do we have alphabetic writing instead of the nonalphabetic kind as used by the Chinese and others? Sacks answers these questions and hundreds of others. He is obviously a man who takes delight in esoteric detail and in learning for the sake of learning, but he writes like a popular artist, not like a pedant. He takes delight in contrasting the old with the new.<P>The way the book is structured invites us in without preliminary. There is no table of contents, but there is an index. The "chapters" are not numbered. (They are lettered, of course!) The beginning word of each chapter is the same as the focus of its subject matter. Thus the chapter on A begins, "Associated with beginnings, fundamentals, and superiority," while the next chapter has "Below the best or second in sequence."<P>A form of each letter in some specialized or historic typeface and/or some information about it graces the offsetting page of chapter beginnings. An emblem from the Department of Agriculture for "Grade A" is one example; an embedded M in an illustration from the Mad-Hatter's party in Alice in Wonderland is another; and three zees penned by American type designer Frederic W. Goudy is still another. Each letter has a personality tag: there is the "Dependable D," the "Gorge-ous G," the "Exzotic Z," etc.<P>There is a Preface and an introductory chapter entitled, "Little Letters, Big Idea." The morphological history of each letter is illustrated showing the progression in many cases from the Egyptian hieroglyph to the Phoenician letter and then through the Hebrew, Greek and Roman adaptations and on into English. It was the letter N not the letter S that was originally an Egyptian snake, although Ben Johnson called S, "the serpent's letter," and it is often depicted as such. And it is M that comes from the hieroglyph for water, not, as one might think, W.<P>There are sidebar mini-essays and longer ones set over gray shading, each one focusing on some aspect of letters and their history, such as "The Alphabet in the Middle Ages," or "The Creation of American Spelling." Sacks does not neglect the sounds of letters and how they have been pronounced over the ages. In so far as possible he gives that history as well. He even explains why some letters are pronounced with an initial vowel sound, S and F, for example; and how others are pronounced with a trailing vowel sound, such as, B and C.<P>This is a highly visual book written in an infectious style that makes the alphabet anything but boring. It is a beautiful book and one to treasure. I am much impressed.</span>

                    <span>Actually, the first alphabet writings were carved in stone around 1800 BC. However, the alphabet has been evolving and changing ever since. It was not until the early 1800s that the letters j and v became official letters of our now 26-letter alphabet. (They did not tell us about this in elementary school.) We could have just as well had a 22-letter or 30-letter alphabet. About the same time that j and v were included, the thorn expressing the th sound, was lost. I found when visiting Iceland that it is still used there. Other letters have been lost through history. Could we lose a few more? The author is absolutely correct about the relative unimportance of the h. In my native Brooklyn, the h sound is rarely used, e.g. there can be pronounced dere. <P>I had wondered where the y came from. Now I know that the Romans imported it based on the Greek upsilon for use with words of Greek origin. The author missed mentioning my favorite y-word, syzygy, which has three of them. <P>There is some repetition in the book as well as an inconsistency. The language brought to England by the conquest of 1066 is referred to in different chapters as old French, medieval French, or Norman. I believe that the last is probably correct. There are still a few Norman speakers on the Channel Islands. On the island of Jersey they have Norman felines called cats in Norman as are ours, not French chats.</span>

                    <span>I first heard about David Sacks' book "Language Visible" after reading a favorable review in Discover Magazine some months back. Being a long-time linguist by hobby (my day job is computer programming), I couldn't resist buying the book in hardback, even though normally I hate spending that much money. I was not disappointed.<P>As the author points out on page ix of the preface, this is not intended to be a text book. No doubt expert linguists will be able to point out inaccuracies in the text, or quibble over some of the author's conclusions. For me, on the other hand, this is a veritable treasure trove of fascinating little nuggets of information on our familiar letters. Some of these are things I've known from childhood, looking at the big dictionary in the school library at the start of the section for each letter, where there would be diagrams showing the evolution of the symbol from ancient Phoenician up to the present day. I've picked up other bits of trivia along the way while doing research on historical topics such as the pivotal Battle of Hastings in 1066. Having it all together, under one figurative roof, on my own bookshelf, is priceless.<P>True, the book focuses on the English language, but by necessity it also talks about German, French, Italian and Spanish, as well as earlier languages stretching back to Latin, ancient Greek, Hebrew and Phoenician. With a little ancient Egyptian thrown in for good measure. For that is another nifty thing about this book: it takes advantage of discoveries made as recently as 1999, linking our familiar alphabet to certain exotic-looking Egyptian hieroglyphs. The introductory section tells how a group of Semitic people living in Egypt some 4000 years ago hit upon the ingenious idea of using easily remembered hieroglyphic symbols to represent individual sounds, strung together to form words. All of a sudden ordinary people, be they butchers, bakers or bricklayers, could learn to read and write in a matter of days. Literacy was no longer the exclusive domain of scribes, kings and priests.<P>The main part of the book consists of 26 articles, one for each letter, which were originally published in the Canadian newspaper "Ottawa Citizen" over a period of 26 weeks. While they've been edited somewhat for the book, to include such things as page references to related topics, they don't appear to have been completely rewritten. This is made evident by a certain amount of repetition from one chapter to the next, as might be expected given how a person reading the original "M" newspaper article might not have seen the "A" article published three months earlier.<P>Actually, this suited me just fine: as quickly as I plowed through the book, devouring the whole thing in less than a week, things had a way of running together, so the repetition came in handy. Some day soon I'll have to reread it all ....<P>Besides tracing the history of the letters, the chapters also go into their cultural significance in English, clear up to the start of the 21st Century. David Sacks also has a whimsical sense of humor. For instance, when discussing the silent P in certain Greek-derived words like "psychiatrist", he makes this humorous aside: "As every schoolboy knows, there can be a silent P in swimming".<P>Other features I greatly enjoyed include the family tree linking all of the world's major alphabets back to the Egyptians (with the sole exception of Korea's Hangul alphabet, which was invented from scratch). Also, there are tables listing the ancient Phoenician and modern Hebrew alphabets, plus the original Greek, Etruscan and Latin alphabets. Plus, several of the chapters have inset grey boxes, sometimes extending for pages on end, discussing topics like the following:<P> 1) The evolution of writing from Roman times through the Middle Ages, and where lowercase letters come from.<P> 2) The impact of the invention of Gutenberg's printing press on the modern world.<P> 3) Why there is a noticeable difference between British and American spelling.<P> 4) What happened to certain runic letters which appeared in Old English works like Beowulf, but which have disappeared since?<P>Sprinkled throughout the book are answers to a myriad of other questions as well. Have you ever wondered why are there sign posts saying odd things like "Ye Olde English Pub?" Why does the Spanish J sound like H, while the V sounds like B? How did Julius Caesar likely pronounce "Veni, Vidi, Vici"? Why is it important to mind your P's and Q's? Where did the expression "okay" come from? What does "Beowulf" mean?<P>I could go on and on ad nauseam but will stop here. Just get the book and read it for yourself. You won't regret it.</span>

                    <span>Ten thousand or more years ago, the species Homo Sapiens appeared on terra firma, as a consequence of biological selection and evolution. The small wild bands of uncouth individuals of the species, roaming and scouring the wilderness for their survival, rapidly started to evolve social structures. This social evolution continues and has already brought us internet connectivity!<P>In the hoary past, Homo Sapiens discovered in themselves an ability to communicate effectively. The process perhaps started with the recognition that they could produce and reproduce distinctive sounds and sound patterns at will; and, use these to communicate meaningfully and effectively.<P>For millennia, the transmission of data, information and knowledge in diverse human societies continued through oral traditions. Gradually, logos, i.e., visual symbols, started getting assigned to individual (oral) sounds/sound patterns and, many diverse scripts evolved. The process continues. Today, internet is helping transcend both the oral, as well as the written traditions of communication. The consequences of each stage of evolution, namely, formal oral communication, formal written communication and, (informal !) internet communication have been profound. Societal structures, aspirations and achievements have hinged upon these evolutions and revolutions in our communication methods. The eventual consequences of the still evolving internet revolution are yet moot. <P>Dr. Sacks' compendium of the history of scripts is essentially confined to the scripts that emerged in the present Middle East.<P>It is instructive to note here that the collective name for the letters of the predominant western sounds is the alphabet. The word 'alphabet' is clearly coined by stringing together the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. In contrast, the corresponding word in the Indian languages is 'varnamala', meaning a garland of colours. The implication is that each letter of the alphabet possesses a distinctive shade of colour (and, power). The various schools of the Saivite and the Indian/Tibetan Buddhist tantrik traditions have extensively explored and exploited the potencies of these concepts. <P>Our predominant script is called "Devnagri" - the divine vehicle of civilized conduct. The letters of our alphabet are called "akshar" - the immutable, the indestructible. The origin of the Devnagri script could, indeed, be divine, meaning thereby that the shapes of the individual letters are not arbitrarily or whimsically contrived but, possess an inherent significance. <P>The renowned German Indologist, Maxmuller, in the eighteenth century, carried out experiments using hollow clay models of the various letters of the Devnagri alphabet. He was pleasantly surprised by the results; when air was blown into the hollow models of the various letters, they emitted corresponding sounds ! Recently, American experimenters have obtained similar results - when different Devnagri alphabetic sounds were pronounced into a pipe, the emanating sound waves traced the shapes of the corresponding letters in the dust scattered near the pipe exit !</span>
