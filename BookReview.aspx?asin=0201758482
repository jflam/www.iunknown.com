                    <span>If you own a camcorder, buy this book. Like any introductory resource, this is not a 100% reference. Advanced sound and lighting, for example, call for a more advanced text. However, as with still photography and film, the 'basics' are 90% of what you need for good results, and this book provides the basics in a clear and concise form.<P>The 50 pages on shooting are themselves worth the price of the book. Before I begin any video project, I do a quick review of these fifty pages to be sure I haven't forgotten any of the rules, not to mention the dozens of Rubin's tips and tricks.<P>After the shooting section, the rest of the book is a bonus. In fact, the editing section is a good practical reference. Clearly a Mac user, the author does his best to not make that obvious, other than his reference to certain software which is Mac only.<P>I have and have read five other video, digital video, and video production books with advanced techniques and practices. Each has some value. However, this book is the one I go back to for a refresher time after time. Like I said at the beginning...buy this book!</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up as part of Broderbund's MovieShop Deluxe editing software. The book was great, the software was really bad. Thank goodness the whole thing cost me less than the book by itself.<P>This is great for the beginner who has just bought their first DV camera or is about to and has had no prior video experience. It doesn't get heavy into the technical aspect of cameras, computers, or film making. Rubin spends most of the book giving great advice on shooting, organizing, and editing. (Let your user manuals give you the technical stuff.)<P>The focus of the book is on creating and finishing small projects. The exercises in the book help you understand why you should do some things and not others. The chapter on shooting gives you the foundation on which to get great shots that you can really use.<P>I found the chapter on organinzing video probably the most useful for me personally. I'd had some previous film training in college many years ago before DV became popular, and while it covered shooting and edting, we never covered organization.<P>This is not a long comprehensive book. An average reader could get through it in 2-3 evenings and learn all they will ever need to know to make their home videos entertaining and enjoyable. Very highly recommended!!!!</span>

                    <span>170 pages of solid, easy-to-understand, information for the novice digital camcorder owner. If there is anything technical in this book, it is wonderfully sugar-coated so that reading it becomes enjoyable.<P>Anyone can take home-movies. Point and press a button. But, then watch your Christmas card list shrink when you show this boring rubbish to your friends. Michael steps through the easy, but precise steps that help you shoot good stuff. Then he explains how to edit it down to something your friends will look forward to watching.<P>For example, he explains the establishing shot, the cut-away, the shot/reverse shot, over-the-shoulder and POV. These simple techniqes will transform your home-movies from mundane to exciting.<P>If you have a digital camcorder, or anticipate buying one, then you MUST buy this book. Excellent job, Michael, thanks!</span>
