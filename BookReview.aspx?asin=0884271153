                    <span>I worked for a high-tech company of around 300 people in 1996.  The president of the company purchased and loved "It's Not Luck" so much that he required all the people in the company to buy and read it.  At this time, his company was well-financed and very high-profile.
<br />
<br />The president implemented Goldratt's recommendations, and the company proceeded to spend the company's money on all the wrong projects.  He overfinanced his pet projects and pushed breadwinners out the door before they were ready to ship.  The company's products sold progressively more poorly, and the company finally declared bankruptcy and went out of business two years ago.
<br />
<br />If you're going to read a business book, you should read a business book written by a guy who knows how to do business.  Goldratt is a consultant who's out to sell books, not a guy who's actually done the things he proports to know how to do.  Check out www.goldratt.com if you think that's not true.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, if you want to know how to run a company, go read "My Years with General Motors" by Alfred Sloan.  While Sloan's book also involves drawing bubble diagrams, it does not suggest that you can run a company by drawing pictures alone.</span>

                    <span>Sure the dialogue is forced and, as with all of Goldratt's books, the information presented is not new.  The gift is placing business principles in a context of a story with enough examples that one can extrapolate simple, logical and, powerful practices from it. 
<br />
<br />I find that Goldratt novels provide simple frameworks that can be easily adapted and provide guidance to business thinking and process.  For instance, from The Goal I constantly use and teach the three money measures for helping people understand the true impact of a proposed change in their business processes or automation.
<br />
<br />It's Not Luck is a great springboard for considering root cause analysis, program management for organizational change, sales tactics developed from customer needs, and generally good business thought processes for leadership.  
<br />
<br />When you consider how many managers and executives have made it into the business world with out the MBA, this is great starter information that can have the "formal" business labels attached to it later.  Additionally, when you consider how many people went through B school but do not remember to apply what they learned, this is a simple reminder and a tutor for implementation.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend any of the TOC novels these reasons.

                    <span>This book will give you an excellent understanding of when to use the thinking processes.  If you want to be able to apply the thinking processes without attending a seminar, you need three things: 1) It's Not Luck  2)Thinking for a Change by Lisa Scheinkopf (or one of the other thinking process books, but this one is the best) 3) Practice.  This requires a significant amount of time.  
<br />If you do not plan on attending a seminar or taking the time to read and practice the more detailed how-to material on the thinking processes, this book will be a waste of time.  The story isn't as universally appealing as The Goal; it is about understanding when to apply the thinking processes and major pitfalls to avoid. If you decide this book isn't for you, I would still recommend finding a write up of the disolving cloud (aka conflict cloud) method.  This is the one tool from It's Not Luck that really is for everbody.</span>

                    <span>In term of contents, this book is marvelous. In terms of plot and story-telling style, this book is quite dry for a novel, comparing to THE GOAL.
<br />This book doesn't offer a pleasure of good reading. That makes it huge different with THE GOAL. Eli probably needs Jeff Cox to fix them.
