                    <span>I rarely write reviews but I have to for this book and author.  The book (along with the author's website) has saved me literally hours of researching and creating formulas of my own.  I feel bad having to steal formulas from him but oh well, I just don't have time to come up with them by myself.  I will certainly purchase more books from John Walkenbach.</span>

                    <span>First, please read the title.  This book is about Excel formulas.  Please don't buy this book if you are looking for a general guide to Excel.  For that purpose, you may want to purchase Mr. Walkenbach's Excel 'Bible'.<p>That said, this book is incredibly useful.  If you know a little bit about Excel, this book will take you very far.  If you know a lot about Excel, you will be astounded by some of the things you can do using the proper formulas.  This book is chock-full of great tips that will radically improve your spreadsheets.  The section on financial formulas is particularly well-written with plenty of real-life examples.  I have been using Excel for Windows since version 2 (circa 1988).  This is the best Excel book I have ever purchased.<p>I unreservedly recommend this book to other Excel users.</span>

                    <span>I would recommend this book to anyone who spends a significant amount of their time working with numbers like I do! I was astonished at the amount of time I was wasting before I read this book, working through the tedious process of setting up long formulas. The book provides numerous tips on getting the work done faster. However, some of the advanced material in the book went right over my head!<p>It was money well spent for me.</span>
