                    <span>Good overview of what you'll need to do to get started but short on details and the computer-related stuff is outdated in 2002. Legal advice is good and sample form letters are useful.</span>

                    <span>For the photographer who wants to find a way to market his or her photography, this great little book will save a tremendous amount of time and energy that one might spend in trying to figure out how to get started. This is not a book that tells you specific companies to go to in order to sell your work, for that you'll need to obtain photography marketing catalogs. Fortunately this book supplies you with names of some of those resources so you can begin your search for clients. <P>"Photo Submission" guides you in many important legal aspects of starting your business, things I either wouldn't have thought of, or that I might have learned through trial and error. For example, you learn how to obtain releases from people who serve as subjects in photos, and what to look for in a contract with a client. The author includes how to submit photos in various forms, including loose photos, bound, and on CD, plus gives suggestions for artistic, appealing presentation of these portfolios. There are also important guidelines on how to charge a fair price for your work. One of the most helpful parts of this book is that it is full of templates of letters, contracts, and other forms that you can copy. <P>You may have more questions to ask after going through this book, and you'll have to do your own research on finding clients, but this book has the potential to build your knowledge of legalities as well as a sense of confidence and professionalism.</span>

                    <span>The subjects covered were helpful, but lacking in detail for one who is looking for expert guidance. I look for an author to get right to the point and explain things as an expert insider would guide the protege'. The author doesn't go much deeper than explaining the obvious, like advising the reader to find out if buyers prefer to review portfolois on CD's, prints, or transparencies. Many points the author makes raise questions rather than providing answers.</span>

                    <span>This fairly comprehensive book covers basically everything one needs to know about marketing one's photographs. The first half of the book features useful sections on storage of one's work, setting up a business plan, communicating with clients, promotion, copyright, and many other critically important considerations in establishing a successful commercial enterprise. The remainder of the book deals with photo submission, including developing and presenting a portfolio, selling work, and understanding the numerous markets for photography. A substantial part of commercial photography has to do with managing and presenting one's collections of photographs to potential clients, and this book succeeds admirably in advising on both counts. The book also includes sample business forms. Written in a clear, straightforward manner, this work will be welcomed by both advanced amateur and professional photographers. Highly recommended for all libraries, especially those supporting photography and business collections.Raymond Bial, Parkland Coll. Lib., Champaign, Ill.</span>
