                    <span>TJ English's "Paddy Whacked" joins the pantheon of excellent books on terrible subject -- gangsters.  While English has done a great deal of original research for this book, he is also to be credited for compiling previously published, stories, profiles and items into a single breathtaking volume on Irish gangs and criminals in America.
<br />English traces the most notorious criminals and gangs from the time of the great potato famine migration to present day.  Starting with the story of  mid 19th century boxer/politician/criminal John Morrisey, through the innumerable gangs of the later 19th century, through Owney Madden, Bugs Moran and others of the prohibition era, through Joseph Kennedy, to Whitey Bulger (currently still on the lam).
<br />It will not surprise readers that so many of the featured figures met untimely ends, often violent ones.  Readers will also see the relationship of Irish gangs with other ethnic groups, particularly the Mafia, and how the Irish gangs were eventually squeezed out of business by La Cosa Nostra.  Also, the lines between organized crime and legitimate business are seen to be blurry -- a common and appropriate theme of recent works on criminal gangs.
<br />English is a terrific storyteller.  He has a knack for selecting the right stories about the right people to illustrate the overall tale and his pacing is excellent. At no point does "Paddy Whacked" lag.
<br />English also puts his stories within the context of greater sociological, and political events of the times.
<br />Many of the stories are graphic -- as they should be.  It is easy to fall into the trap of romanticizing thugs and killers of the past, English never does, revealing the true brutality and selfishness of their actions.
<br />"Paddy Whacked" is a triumph of research, compilation and story telling.  It is at once an entertaining and important book.</span>

                    <span>(i'm 13) This is a great book that shows how tough and brutal the Irish mob really was and still is.  It goes from the time of the early Irish gangsters from Tammany Hall up to Whitey Bulger who is still on the FBI'S ten most wanted list. This book also has good infro on the war between the Irish and the italians in New York, Chicago, and Boston from Prohibition up 2 now. It also has some good info on the Westies, the Hell's Kithcen Irish gang on Manhattan's West Side which terrorized the place for 20 years. they were so powerful that the mafia had 2 make an alliance with them for fear of being overrun by 'em.  If you want some good info on the Irish mob from the 1850's to Present day i would definately reccomend this book</span>

                    <span>And all this time I thought that the big time gangsters in this country came from Sicily. I guess that comes from the Godfather movies. Then this book said that the Most Wanted Gangster on the FBI's list was an old fashioned Irish American mob boss by the name of James Bulger. 
<br />
<br />I had to check, but sure enough on the FBI web site (www.fbi.gov) you can find the ten most wanted and there he is, just below Usama Bin Laden. Not only that, but there is a $1,000,000 reward for finding him (Bin Laden is worth $27,000,000). 
<br />
<br />This is, as best I can determine the first book devoted to the Irish American gangsters that's been published. The most interesting, by far, of the people discussed in the book are the Kennedy family. Papa Joe was quite a character, a flagrant womanizer, who made his fortune by importing bootleg whiskey that he supplied to Al Capone. This also puts a different impression on Robert Kennedy's attempt to blame "the Mafia" - Italian based, as the source of organized crime in the U.S. 
<br />
<br />This is quite a book, recommended to anyone who is interested in crime history, or even the political history of the Kennedys.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who thinks they know the full story of organized crime in the U.S. is in for a surprise when they read this book. 'Paddy Whacked' starts with the Irish potato famine and comes right up to the present. The research is awesome and the writing style very witty and entertaining (I especially liked the chapter titles and sub-titles within the chapters). The book is long and in-depth with many names and events but well worth the time it takes to read. The early history in New York, New Orleans and Chicago is fascinating. The chapter on Joseph P. Kennedy and the JFK assassination was shocking to me. And I never before read anthing about the gang wars in Boston in the early 1960's that helped Whitey Bulger rise to power. Even though I've read lots of books on organized crime and was aware of many of the events in this story, they are told from a new perspective that made me think about it in an interesting way. This may be the best overview-type book ever written about the Mob in America. </span>
