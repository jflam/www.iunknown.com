                    <span>The book perpetuates harmful stereotypes about aging.  Cohen chastises  older people who try to take care of their health.  He claims that they are  searching in vain for a "magic bullet" to regain their youth.   Cohen then advocates a false mind/body dualism.  Through this dualism, one  gives up taking care of their body in order to follow their creativity.  I  honor the author's belief in the importance of creativity; however, I  believe that the approach presented is self-defeating.</span>

                    <span>As a 64-year-old elder, I was delighted by Dr. Cohen's marvelous book.  What an inspiration to me and others in my age group  Wait - Not only to me but for me and others of any age  - The recommendations and ideas presented  are superb - the examples delightful.  Also - a key element is Dr. Cohen's  TR/Bio - a program of visual stimulants to help caregivers and family and  friends to deal more effectively and humanely with sufferers of Alzeimer's  Disease. All told - the book cannot be praised too highly!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I have read on the subject of Creativity in  Later Life. I recommend it heartily.  Dr. Cohen, M.D. & Ph.D. has  become the acknowledged leader in this field with his brilliant synthesis  of his 25 years of experience working with older adults as a geriatric  physician and creativity researcher.  "We need a new frame of  reference in which to picture ourselves growing and recognize how the  influence of inner resources and life circumstances can present us with  opportunities to  revive our lives in meaningful and satisfying ways,"  Cohen maintains. His experience with his patients and his studies of aging  and creativity in the arts led him to revise Erik Erikson's model of adult  development in the later years. He divided Erikson's final stages of  generativity & integrity into four developmental phases which he claims  shape the way our creative energy grows and the way we express it.  Each  phase, he says, is shaped by our chronological age, our history, and our  circumstances. And each phase is characterized by changes in how we view  and experience life in a combined psychological, emotional and intellectual  sense. The four phases are: 1. Midlife Reevaluation/Quest Phase 2.  Liberation Phase (Formerly called Retirement) 3. Late-life Summing-Up Phase  4. The Encore Phase If we look beyond age markers for the Retirement of  Liberation phase and search, instead, for the underlying developmental  phase here, we find that it is defined by a kind of personal liberation  combined with life experience that lifts inhibitions and gives us the  courage to ignore social conventions that restrict our creative expression.  In this Liberation phase creative endeavors are shaped with the added  energy of a new degree of personal freedom that comes both psychologically  from within us and externally through retirement. Our creative juices may  be mobilized by the thought "If not now, when?" People tend to feel pretty  comfortable about themselves at this time , knowing that if they should  make a mistake it won't undo the image others have of them, and more  importantly, it won't undo the image they have of themselves.  This  psychological and emotional understanding provides a new context for  experimentation, and retirement often provides a new feeling of finally  having free time to try something new. Both these inner and outer elements  are liberating and additive.  This new sense of available Time and personal  Liberty in later life, combined with significant life experience, produces  new feelings of freedom, courage, and confidence commonly described by men  and women of advanced age. Here, too, contrary to negative stereotypes, the  feeling of  being more free allows older individuals to experiment, to take  a risk, to try something new. Most of us, as we head into our sixties, have  become more comfortable with  who we are. If we make a mistake while trying  something new, it doesn't shatter our self-image. So while someone in his  twenties may not dare to take an art class for fear of looking incompetent,  doing something unfamiliar, a person in his forties or beyond will be much  less concerned with appearances, and more interested in experimenting with  new ways to learn.  	Cohen's research underscores the adventurous  nature of adults in this liberated phase of development. His investigations  show that older adults who are not handicapped by extenuating circumstances  such as poor health or financial constraints--are just as venturesome as  their younger counterparts. This greater freedom and courage helps explain  why throughout history so many older adults in their late sixties,  seventies or beyond have assumed the role of shapers and shakers of  society. One thinks of Socrates, Copernicus, Titian, Montaigne,Goethe,  Rembrandt, Newton, Einstein, Nelson Mandela, Simone de Beauvoir, May  Sarton, Eleanor Roosevelt, as people who rose to greatness in their later  years. In the advancing years of late life, in what Cohen calls the Encore  Stage, there is a desire--a developmental urgency, really--to affirm life  in a number of ways. It might be through completing a creative work,or the  resolution of a longstanding problem, a statement waiting to be said, or  the right thing to do that had been on hold for years. 	The encore  phenomenon taps the inner pressure that many feel to do or say something  before it's too late. The phrase applies strongly to the field of music,  reminding us of how many  noted musical achievements have come late or at  the end of a musicain's or composer's career or life cycle--like the late  works of Verdi, Liszt, and Stravinsky. This is the time of advancing age,  in which creative expression is shaped by the desire to make strong,  lasting contributions on a personal or community level, to affirm life,  take care of unfinished business, and celebrate one's own contribution.  This phase typically occurs among those in their eighties or older. The  multidisciplinary Dr. Cohen cites some fascinating biological studies of  the the brain that reveal that between one's early fifties and late  seventies there  is actually an increase in both the number and length of  branches from individual brain cells in different parts of the brain  involved with higher intellectual functioning (Cohen,p.79) These branching  changes compensate for brain cell loss that can occur over time. They also  and give further evidence of the platicity or modifiabilty of the brain as  it ages.  	Something even more interesting about these neuro-biological  findings is that they directly correspond timewise to the unfolding of the  above human potential phases pointing to a possible biological connection  to the changes in human development in the second half of life. 	These  human potential phases combine elements of age-based developmental stages  as described by Erikson with the greater fluidity of life transitions that  we experience today. Sometimes we might experience a phase in sync with  others our age, but not always, the age of occurrence varies. Sometimes  they co-exist, intersect, even synergize or combine in a  way that adds  even greater energy to the mix.	The significance of these human  potential phases is that they set the state for a new creative thrust at  different points in our lives. Our awareness of these phases can help close  the gap between recognizing our potential and acutually harnessing it.  Knowing that the natural course of development can bring us closer to  tapping our creative potential at different times can provide a much needed  measure of confidence or faith which we sometimes need to begin, change or  energize our creative efforts. I have only scratched the surface of this  book, but this summary should be sufficient to indicate its importance. I  recommend that everyone interested in new discoveries about human  behavior,creativity and longevity read it.-John-Raphael Staude, Ph.D.  proteus60@aol.com</span>
