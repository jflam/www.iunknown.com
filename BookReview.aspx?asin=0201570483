                    <span>I'm a coffee freak.  I roast my own espresso and grind it with great care and pump it through a two group computer controlled professional Italian espresso machine. My wife thinks I'm obsessive about it. With that in mind, Perfect Cup provides a lot of excellent information that most people probably don't know, about how to make a great cup of coffee. It also talks about the characteristics of different kinds of coffee.  If A&P 8:00 is your cup of tea...coffee, you might not give a damn, but if you really are curious...interested, passionate about coffee, you will probably enjoy reading this book.</span>

                    <span>I highly recommend this book.  I bought it as someone just getting into enjoying the coffee experience.  I wanted a book that would help me learn more about brewing coffee, tasting, and what to expect from beans grown in the different areas of the world.  It gave me the info. I was looking for.  I also really enjoyed the section in which several coffee roasters across the US were interviewed about their roasting philosophies and what to them helped create that elusive perfect cup of coffee.</span>

                    <span>years ago(before Starbucks bought the world) Boston had a local chain called the Coffee Connection.  Their blends were perfect, their roasts were done by an old central american master and all of their employees were coffee lovers who could tell you details on any bean (once again, pre starbucks and the "we'll hire anyone" policy).  I once asked how they knew so much and was told that employees were required to read this book.  Somehow I lost my original copy ... so glad to see Amazon making it available again.</span>

                    <span>If you have ever had a cup of coffee - this book is a must! <p>From the history of the first coffee plantation, roasting, brewing, tasting, recipes and even traditions of coffee traders are all mentioned in the well-written  book. The writer writes in plain and very humorous English.  <p>I'm in the  coffee trading business myself, and this is one of the most accurate and  interesting books about the whole coffee business as I have read up to now.  The book also mentions coffee estates, retailers and roasters by name. <p>A  definite 10 out of 10!</span>
