                    <span>This extremely practical, highly focused book goes through the hands-on details of preparing a presentation or speech. Some of the instructions seem self-evident, but only because author Joan Detz is extremely thorough and recognizes that it is easy to forget these "obvious" tips under pressure. She provides a vast amount of practical information, far more than anyone could absorb at once, but her tips are worth reading again and again. She also includes good self-assessment forms and questionnaires. Many of these venerable public-speaking concepts date back to the Sermon on the Mount, but Detz adds her own spin by emphasizing that the focus should be on the speaker, not on slides or props (downplay the loaves and fishes). The book's power resides in its completeness; Detz seems to have thought of everything, and that is reassuring. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who must make presentations in public, under any circumstances.<br /></span>

                    <span>Extremely easy to read.  Every point is supported by real life examples or funny bloopers.  Because of its simplicity, it sticks and you are more likely to apply it to your next presentation, speech, delivering a status to the boss.  It is worth having in the bookshelf as a business reference or for personal situations.</span>
