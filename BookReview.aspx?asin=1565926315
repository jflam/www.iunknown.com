                    <span>This book in no way is a reference book or a how-to book. This book is designed for people who don't have previous knowledge about windows architecture and windows API.<p>I find this book as a fantastic tool since it gives me initiative and direction to understand the overall picture. I can use the knowledge that I gained in this book and know what I can do with win32 API. I also purchased the dan appleman's book for win32 api which consists of more examples and it is more a reference book .<p>If you have not programmed in win32 before --> this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>This is a very hard book (for VB programmer with no C experience) BY NECESSITY.  <br>Normally, you would like the programming book to have some explanation and plenty of code examples. In the case of Win32 API<br>for VB programmer, once you get all the intricacies, you just need to find the API function from API viewer applet that comes with Visual Studio. <br>      Why is the book hard by necessity?<br>C and VB have enough differences (e.g. variable type size differences, signed and unsigned type differences etc) to make the interoperability of languages difficult. Add to this the complexity of the Windows architecture itself and C + VB + WIN32<br>becomes much more complex, than just C + Win32, which makes me wonder, why use VB at all, if you are planning to make an extensive use of WIN32. Much easier to code in C or C++!<br>     Back to the book. <br>It does excellent job explaining C + VB + Win32 API interaction <br>thoroughly. He leaves no stone unturned. If you absorb the book cover to cover, you can consider yourself guru in the area. <br>You want need anything else than API function declarations. <br>     In short, this is a book for ONLY DEDICATED, serious programmer, intending not just to spice up his code with occasional API calls, but ending up with FULL UNDERSTANDING OF ALL ISSUES.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book to learn about Windows from a developer's perspective. It has the most lucid explanations I've read on the Windows operating system, covering topics such as processes, threads, synchronization, memory architecture, Windows messages, DLL injection and device contexts. There is a whole chapter dedicated to strings where the author cleary explains ALL types of strings used in Windows (there are very few books that include this important topic). For those who complain about not enough coverage of the Win32 API, *READ THE PREFACE!*. The author states very clearly that the book is "...not intended to be an encyclopedia for the Win32 API...", the goal is to present "...enough information to get an overall feel for the Windows OS and the Win32 API...". I think he went beyond the stated goal. As for the reviewers complaining about the book heavy slant towards C, it escapes me how anyone would want to read about the Win32 API without expecting to find C all over the place. This is not a book to learn VB syntax or VB tricks, it's about how to interact with the Win32 API from VB, so it's important to learn the details about the API, not about VB. Last but not least, do not expect this to be a hardcore guide to Win32 programming, that's something you just can't do with VB.<p>Added Dec 12, 2001: After studying the new .NET platform I realize that this book is sadly outdated. You can still use the Win32 API in VB.NET, but there's no good reason to do that anymore because the .NET framework provides equivalents for just about every API call you can think of, and more.</span>

                    <span>First, this seems like mostly a C book, not a VB book as the title implies.  Sure, the C structures and function call variables are usually provided w/translations (but not always!).  And there is a whole chapter on VB strings.  But I got the impression the author doesn't know a ton about VB and why a VB programmer might want/need to concern himself with the API function calls.  This didn't phase me a ton because I know C, but I thought a lot of the text wasn't much about VB at all.<p>First-and-a-half, the author is running Windows NT, so if you're like me and on Win 95/98 you may at times feel like you're being left out.  He does go to some lengths to compare and point out the differences between the two OS's, but (again) I felt like he was a C/NT programmer rather than a VB/9x programmer.<p>Second, even though the intro says its for both VB5 and VB6, I use the former and couldn't get the crucial examples on the CD to run without first hunting down and finding the needed DLL's on the I-Net one-by-one.  This was a tedious process because after a program would clear past one error message on startup it'd hit the next one.  And so on.  This was a huge hassle.  It probably didn't help that the one bad spot on my CD was the dll.readme file (maybe all this was pointed out in there) -- I probably should have taken the book back, but then I would have had to wait for them to order another one and for it to come in, go back a third time to get it, etc...<p>Third, the book is not any sort of complete reference to the API functions.  Some of the chapters only mention a couple of the functions relevant to the topic, or at least give you the feeling there's more out there that you might want to know about.  The functions that are mentioned sometimes only have one or two of their parameters explained (as if the others don't matter).  So if you're looking for an API reference book, this probably isn't it.<p>At least most of the typos in the book can be found at O'Reilly's website, though a careful reader can find a couple that haven't been flagged.<p>I expected a better book.  At least the writing is clear.</span>

                    <span>This book focuses on the Win32 API from a WinNT/9x standpoint, highlighting the differences between the two in a clear and concise way. If you are doing development on a Win2K box, however, then this book is probably not the best resource. The sections on the differences between WinNT and Win9x are largely irrelevant now, but the book is still a good resource for understanding how Windows works behind the scenes. If this book is updated to include current information, I would definately buy it again.</span>
