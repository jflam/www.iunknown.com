                <span id="Label1">Ronni Eisenberg, who lectures and gives workshops on organization skills throughout the U.S., is also author of the popular but slightly more intimidating Organize Yourself!. Here she's brought a slew of practical tips for managing your workspace, from your briefcase to your bulletin board, from your e-mail inbox to those endless interruptions from coworkers. She covers the basics, including organizing your desktop and stemming the flood of junk mail (send a note to the Direct Marketing Association). She also hits upon modern organizational dilemmas, such as how to decide if you'd be better off with or without a PalmPilot. Some of the hundreds of handy tips she offers include: <UL> <LI>ways for making both in-person and telephone meetings quicker and more productive; <LI>methods for confronting procrastination and poor work habits; <LI>10 rules to adhere to when filing; and <LI>14 ways to make meetings run smoothly and accomplish what you want them to.</UL> Much of Eisenberg's advice is geared toward the executive; she advises closing your office door to really concentrate on big projects, something that the cubicle-bound can't do. But if you aspire to have that corner office, or if you're prone to losing important documents or rushing to big meetings several minutes late with sweat beading up along your forehead, Eisenberg's words of wisdom should help you get your act in gear.</span>

                    <span>This book is somehow a checklist of what to do and what not to do in your office. But, it is just that; nothing deeper. I would say that it is complete, and it is for mid 1990s. But, in mid 2000s, with computers and e-mail to 'eat' most of our office time, it need  some enhancement in these areas. It covers them, but it focus 85% on traditional and 15% on electronic office.</span>

                    <span>I thought the ideas and tips were well divided into chapters in this book.  It was easy to look for hints in a specific topic area.  However, the read was so quick that I found myself looking for more insight into the ideas behind some of the suggestions made.  I have read other books that have been more detailed about the overall organization process and gave more concise directions on how to get started down finding your organizational flow.  This book is a great organizational review tool for AFTER you have incorporated your personal organizational process.  A good reminder of healthy organization tips, though, not necessarily a pool of original organizational hints.</span>

                    <span>This book is incredible!  After years of trying to organize, missing promotions because of my disorganization (losing items, unpolished image...), I have become reasonably organized.  I have even had a professional organizer try to help me, to no avail.  <p>Naturally, not every tip will apply to every office.  I was pleasantly surprised to realize that many were generic enough to be informative, but instructional enough to help.  <p>At less than ten dollars, this is a must-have.</span>

                    <span>Ronni Eisenberg&#8217;s book demonstrates how your work habits can be your best friends or your worst enemies when it comes to organizing your office productively. The book is a mixture of common-sense suggestions and useful organizational tips. She includes helpful hints for home-office workers and organizational tips for those who use personal digital devices. At times, it&#8217;s a little too intricate (you may feel you are getting detailed instructions on how to tie your shoes), however, it also offers organizational gems....</span>
