                <span id="Label1">In 1953, When Audrey Hepburn burst onto the screen in <I>Roman Holiday</I>, she forever changed the international ideal of elegance, grace, and beauty. Suddenly, glamour and even sexiness seemed attainable for women everywhere; Audrey was uncommonly beautiful, but she was <I>real</I>--hers was a look anyone could aim for, but few could pull off as effortlessly or effectively. By mixing a few classic elements of "Audrey style"--the little black dress, ballet flats with slim capri pants, bold hats and sunglasses--suburban housewives became more Hollywood than Hoboken in an instant.<p> Here author Pamela Clarke Keogh introduces us to the woman behind the clothes, using words from friends, fellow actors, and designers who dressed her to paint a picture of a truly remarkable woman. A humanitarian, artist, friend, and above all, <I>survivor</I>, Audrey inspired women and men alike to approach life with spirit, grace, and simplicity. The nearly 100 color and black-and-white photographs, paired with original sketches from such fashion luminaries as Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik, and Vera Wang, show that Audrey was much more than a beautiful, well-dressed personality; her courage and individuality come shining through in every page. <I>--Leah Ball</I></span>

                    <span>This is a very attractive coffee table book to own, and one you are sure to enjoy thumbing through time after time. It also goes into more detail on Audrey's style and wardrobe than most other accounts. However, the book was a little disappointing on a few fronts. A main feature of this volume is its numerous photos, yet frustratingly, all the photo captions are in the back, all are very terse, and many contain no dates or identifications. The introduction by Givenchy is elegant but very brief, so one should not expect a long and descriptive essay. And while I enjoyed reading the text and learned a number of things from it, I found it seemed to create a rather too idealized picture of a very complex person, and to be repetative in its descriptions (how many times is the word 'gamine' used?). At times I also sensed the author chose to interpret things in an overly romantic way to further this image--for example citing Audrey's inability to eat during times of stress as her reverting to her girlhood days in war-ravaged Holland when she had to do with little or no food. By all accounts, Audrey was an incredible human being, but I recommend reading this book along with other accounts of her life to obtain a more balanced description.</span>

                    <span>Hepburn is one of those rare and enviable creatures who manages to exude style, warmth, and class without even seeming to try. Clarke Keogh has done a wonderful job, keeping the layout and graphics simplistic and minimal. Additionally, she keeps the writing free of fashionista jargon, and does a suitable job researching Hepburn's past. I appreciated the sketches and quotes by some of the greatest visionaries in the fashion business.The book has a wealth of information about Hepburn, I constantly use it as a reference....and as inspiration! After all....what girl doesn't want to be Audrey?</span>

                    <span>A book like this should have more pictures. The ones it does have don't have captions. The writing is fairly ameteurish but does have some interesting stuff despite being from an angle I didn't like. I didn't like the big black pages with the white lettered quotes not just because some of the quotes weren't especially good, but because you can't read the middle that is in the binding and seems to be poor quality ink or paper. All around this book is just okay, great topic, poor delivery.</span>
