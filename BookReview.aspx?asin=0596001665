                <span id="Label1">To harden a router is to render it more heavily defended and more difficult to attack. Because routers (by definition) serve as points of entry into your network, it makes sense to devote extra effort to their security. <I>Hardening Cisco Routers</I> shows how to make adjustments to the configurations of routers from Cisco Systems to improve their resistance to attack, particularly external attack. This is essentially a book of specialized Internetwork Operating System (IOS) commands, as well as explanations of their behavior. It'll appeal to the router administrator--employed either by an organization's internal network staff, an outside consultancy, or a service provider--who wants to know which IOS commands he or she should add to routers' configuration files to tighten their security without a lot of hassle.<p>  The great thing about this book is that you can approach it in either of two ways. If you just want to clamp down on your routers' security weaknesses as soon as possible, you can begin with the checklists at the end of each chapter (each of which focuses on a particular area, like SMTP) or the big one in an appendix, which is comprehensive. These checklists include both "how" and "why" information, as exemplified by "Disable ICMP broadcasts with the <I>no ip directed-broadcast</I> command." If you want more information on the big picture, or want to prepare for a specific kind of attack, read the individual chapters for detailed advice on how to set IOS to behave as you want. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Internetwork Operating System (IOS) commands you can use to protect Cisco Systems routers from a variety of attacks. Specialized sections deal with security assessment, auditing, access control, privileges, optional services, and the legal importance of your login banners' contents.</span>

                    <span>Intended audiences: network administrators, security advisors/auditors, system architects.<P>This book is, pound for pound, among the best in my technical library. <P>Having almost no previous knowledge in router hardening (although I was aware of the basics of Cisco routers) a few hours with this book enabled me to review the "hardening" plan submitted by a highly paid security consultant, and provide useful comments on improving the proposal. <P>No doubt this book is the beginning, not the end, of my education on this subject. But this fine book got me off to a quick and productive start, which is high praise when compared to what could be said about so many other technical titles. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>It's nice to have all of this information in one place. A lot of it is available elesewhere but not all. The checklists are nice. But there's not so much to it.

                    <span>This book is concise and well written. It covers most, if not all of the areas involved in locking down Cisco routers. And it does so in clearly defined chapters, making it very easy to navigate as a reference. In addition, each topic is accompanied by clear configuration examples.<BR>I also found it very complete. Even covering information which I haven't yet come across in the various NSA guides and Cisco texts on the subject. As someone already mentioned, you'll no longer need to trawl the web and other sources for this info; Thomas Akin and O'Reilly's have done the hard work for you.</span>
