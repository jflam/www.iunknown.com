                <span id="Label1">To learn a Japanese martial art is to learn Zen, and although you can't do so simply by reading a book, it sure does help--especially if that book is <I>The Book of Five Rings</I>. One of Japan's great samurai sword masters penned in decisive, unfaltering terms this certain path to victory, and like Sun Tzu's <I>The Art of War</I> it is applicable not only on the battlefield but also in all forms of competition. Always observant, creating confusion, striking at vulnerabilities--these are some of the basic principles. Going deeper, we find <I>suki</I>, the interval of vulnerability, of indecisiveness, of rest, the briefest but most vital moment to strike. In succinct detail, Miyamoto records ideal postures, blows, and psychological tactics to put the enemy off guard and open the way for attack. Most important of all is Miyamoto's concept of rhythm, how all things are in harmony, and that by working with the rhythm of a situation we can turn it to our advantage with little effort. But like Zen, this requires one task above all else, putting the book down and going out to practice. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book on swordsmanship.  It's not about strategy.  Strategy is very high level (there are three levels of warfare: strategic, operational, and tactical).  This book is about tactics.  Strategy is how to win a potential war from a national level; operational refers to how an area commander (e.g. General Schwartzkoff) fights a theater; tactics is how you take a hill or defend your ship.  I've got tons of experience in program management, have published articles on management, have scientific degrees and an MBA, and I fail to see how this is a management book.  It seems like a HUGE stretch to me.  The rating, unfortunately, seems to depend on what one expects from the book.  I expected something that would be strategically useful (or at least operationally) from a management perspective.  Sun Tzu's "Art of War" (one of my favorite books and far better, I think, than von Clauswitz) certainly qualifies.  This book does not.</span>

                    <span>  
<br />Musashi's now-famous 'Book of Five Rings' is simply not the most influential sword-fighting book written in Feudal Japan. The most important book on Japanese swordsmanship, and the text of the Shogunate's own selected shool of swordsmanship is 'The Sword and the Mind': available as a translation by Hiroaki Sato. Musashi had a very personal and unique style of fighting involving the long and short swords used together. Quite possibly his style developed through the influence of his father, who was an expert in the jitte: a parrying weapon held in the left hand. Even if wielding the long sword by itself, he recommends holding it only in one hand, and developing the strength to do so: he mentions how often you will have to grab enemy spears or other objects with your left hand while fighting, and how holding a sword in two hands limits your sword's movement.  Musashi was fully devoted to swordsmanship, and it seems as if he spent all day every day of his life swinging his swords about: no wonder no one could match him! Musashi's main principles are: 1) Train as much as possible 2) Always be on the attack, and turn every defence into an attack 3) Do unexpected strange things to confuse the opponent 4) Attack while the opponent is in the middle of doing something else such as taking a step or breathing etc 5) keep yourself relaxed while fighting 6) Train to achieve complete control of movement. There are lots of little useful anecdotes he tells us about, such as how to keep the sun at your back and thus in the opponent's face. He also gives us a window into 17th Century battles concerning the benefits and detriments of the various weapons and so on. What clearly rings through the entire book is that this is the work of someone who is intimate to an incredible degree with the movements of the sword and the body. A great deal of his strategy involves timing and rhythms: catching the opponent at just the right moment. There is no doubt that these principles are of the utmost importance in winning any kind of sport; however, they are very simple principles and really depend on the swordsman having an incredible amount of skill and training which gives him enough freedom of movement and acute sense of timing to carry them out. One can sense the love Musashi has of fighting and the thrill he gets at his feeling of superiority at winning. However, Japan was not as impressed with his style as he was. It was the two-handed style outlined in 'The Sword and the Mind' that became the standard for samurai. I am not a duellist who's life is on the line, so I am not in a position to muse about why the preference remained for a two-handed grip, but certainly having more control of the blade, more speed, and a longer sword must have been factors. So, even though Musashi was undefeatable, he became so using apparently inferior weapons. While this is all the more impressive, it also means that his style is defective in its most basic element: its weapons! I should probably add here that Musashi clearly was acquainted with literature, and the fact that he was trying to immortalize himself through his book is obvious on every page. He was a great artist too, and his paintings and sculptures have been prized ever since he created them. He wanted to remain the best swordsman after his death, and this book was conceived as his means to that end. There is a great deal to be sure to be learned from this work - it is quite possibly the best book ever written on hand to hand combat, and it is very well organized. I should add too that where Musashi speaks of large-scale military manoeuvers he is speaking from experience, since he fought in and commanded in several battles. We however must remember that in his own time and later his style of two swords hardly had any students - and there are no fencers from his Nito school that ever became famous. While his very seemingly-practical 'hands-on' approach to swordsmanship appeals to us impatient moderns, the deeply introspective, psychological mind-games of Munenori's "The Sword and the Mind" appealed to the samurai of the Edo period.  However, the samurai of that period took on the role of civil servants and their role as warriors became less and less important, so practical advice on winning battles such as Musashi gives seemed less relevant to them than spiritual cultivation.  It is really a miracle that Japan's greatest samurai actually wrote a book telling us how to become as great a fighter as himself!  This book is a guide to success in martial arts, and it will give your martial arts knowledge a touch of 'class', since this book is a true classic of the best kind: if you can quote Musashi in your teaching, it can only look good for you!  I ought to note that Thomas Cleary's edition of the "Book of Five Rings" also contains the entire "Sword and the Mind" of Munenori, so Cleary's book would be ideal to buy! </span>

                    <span>Okay, so I really have no clue as to what compelled me to buy this book.  I hate to admit it but it looked "pretty" and it looked "historical," so I got it.  I also love the Japanese film classics starring Toshirô Mifune as the ultimate samurai warrior.  Many of them illustrate a combination of charm, sophistication, humor, even comedy, with violence, ruthlessness, and arrogance.  The comparative lack of graphic bloodiness tends to focus the viewer on the human dynamics and art of the situation, and while some of these classics have been translated by the Hollywood film industry for Western tastes, what transpires still has a "foreign" feel.  One sees the action and senses that something going on here is different, uncomfortable.  Upon reading a few paragraphs of the Book of Five Rings : The Classic Guide to Strategy, I understood why.<p>For one thing, I had not understood that the character in the samurai collection that Mifune had been portraying had actually been an historic individual living in a unique period of Japanese history.  Why I should have been surprised, I don't know, since the exploits of the likes of Pat Garret, Wyatt Earp, and Doc Holiday became the basis for a good deal of 19th and 20th Century pulp fiction, TV series, and movies in the United States.  In fact, the period in Japanese history that the translator describes sounds not unlike the "Wild West."  The sod busters and the ranchers have made their peace, leaving hundreds of gunmen unemployed.  The lucky ones find work as lawmen while the unlucky wander the country looking to enhance their reputations by lethal  confrontations to see who's "fastest on the draw."  The winner may ultimately find a job as a peace keeper; the loser finds a spot on boot hill.  In the case of the American western, the contestants use guns;  in the case of the Japanese samurai, they use swords and other equipment.  Still there seems something more to it. The something more, I think, is a philosophy, a school, an etiquette, even an art that leaves the Western mind a little uncomfortable.  <p>With some of the techniques of sword work and battle strategy, I think that as Musashi himself informs the reader, it is very difficult to "write" how to do a mechanical task.  One can only convey the "feeling" that performing such a task has for the expert writer on the subject.  In modern times this facet of the learning process is overcome by photo illustrations, but even then only to a very limited extent.  As the author points out, there is no substitute for experience with the process and practice, practice, practice.  Even the very limited experience I acquired years ago when I took fencing lessons helped me picture more clearly some of the moves the author described.<p>Part of the difficulty in connecting with the author's experience as he performs the various actions of sword fighting may be that this book is a translation from the Japanese, was originally written in an older version of the language, and embodied an ancient version of the culture itself, one that is no longer available even to modern Japanese let alone a Western translator.  A warrior of Musashi's time may well have connected far better with the similes he uses than a modern person.  The unique benefit of this fact, however, is that a great deal can be read into the work.  Part of this is the author's intention, but part of it is due to the very ambiguity of the work.  Just as the author himself suggests, the reader who does not concentrate on the words but allows the mind to float over them makes all sorts of interesting discoveries.  For instance a book on dealing with problem people suggested a technique much like Musashi's "To Know the Times," essentially to match the rhythm and intensity of the subject until one can gain control of that rhythm to de-escalate it.  His "To Become the Enemy" immediately brought to my mind the individual characters of Civil War generals Robert E. Lee and his opponent George McClelland.  As Musashi suggested, the enemy always feels he is outnumbered which means that a few may defeat many if they are trained in The Way.  Or as Lee is reputed to have said before a battle, "The Army of the Potomac is a very good one, unfortunately General McClelland brought himself along."  Lee understood The Way.  He knew that McClelland's personality, or lack of The Way, produced vast armies of the enemy in his mind.<p>In all a very interesting and surprising book, one I expect to read again and again to mine for concepts.  For a slender 95 pages, the author, like a good poet, has packed each word with a maximum of information because they encapsulate concepts and principles.</span>

                    <span>The Shambala Dragon Edition of Musashi's Book of Five Rings was passed on to me several years ago by a close friend and fellow martial artist after the death of our teacher, who had given it to him.  I have kept it and read it numerous times as a reference that is applicable to my own martial arts studies.  Throughout, Musashi gives insight into his theories and strategies regarding what he describes as "his" martial art, namely the art of Kenjustu (Japanese Swordsmanship), specifically his own "two-sword" or "Two Heavens" school.  Although it is an interesting and insightful look into Musashi's strategies for individual and collective combat, the Book of Five Rings is short on technical details, and therefore difficult to apply to one's own martial arts studies in any specific and systematic manner. This being said, Musashi's writings are still very applicable to any martial art in a generalized way.  With its lack of specifics, it is easy to see how publishers and readers alike could make the stretch that the Book of Five Rings is an excellent book on personal or business strategy-- rather than trying to sell it as an outstanding treatise on martial arts.  After all, there are a lot more business people and self-help readers to sell books to than there are serious students of martial arts.  However, these claims are more wishful thinking and skillful marketing than actual truth. If one wants to apply Musashi's strategies to business or the non-martial life, they will have a tough time trying to translate techniques such as those "on footwork" or "stabbing the face" into effective business management or personal growth strategies.  One could certainly apply Musashi's techniques metaphorially, but to do so would be to take the author's instructional commentary entirely out of context. It must be understood that Musashi's Book of Five Rings was not written for business people, or those interested in self-help techniques.  It was written about martial arts, for martial artists, by an undisputed master of martial arts, and must be read with this fact in mind to be truly appreciated and understood.  Every serious martial artist should own it, and study it and apply its general lessons throughout his or her martial arts career. The Shambala Dragon Edition, includes Yagyu Munenori's masterful "Book of Family Traditions and the Art of War" which is an added bonus for serious students of Japanese martial arts.</span>

                    <span>On the surface this book appears to be about the martial arts, warfare, swordplay.  However, a careful reading with an open mind will surprise the reader not particularly focused on those aspects.  Readers who've trained themselves to read complexity and symbolism as an overlay for everyday life experiences will find a strategy for the human life experience hidden here barely beneath the surface.  It's only one strategy, and not necessarily the one you'll choose to lead your own life, but it's still worth studying and comprehending.  In fact, readers completely unfamiliar with martial arts will find many 'lessons in life' worth digesting.<p>I believe it's worth the time and effort for study in the same sense as classic Chinese and European works of similar ilk.</span>
