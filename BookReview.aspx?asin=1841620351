                <span id="Label1">In this comprehensively updated third edition of Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide containing over 150 pages of new material, Philip Briggs invites you to share his sense of wonder at a country he describes as "the most welcoming, enjoyable and uplifting I have ever visited." He introduces a majestic landscape, a diverse natural history, the richest historical heritage in sub-Saharan Africa, and an exuberant and welcoming people who are "quite gloriously bonkers." <P>Inside you'll find: where to find some of East Africa's rarest wildlife; national parks and wildlife sanctuaries; historic sites, including the rock-hewn church of Lalibela - the unofficial eighth wonder of the world - and the ancient palaces and stelae of Axum; 65 new or revised maps and town plans; places to eat and to stay. (5 1/4 x 8 1/2, 544 pages, color photos, maps, illustrations)</span>

                    <span>I went to Ethiopia to see the children I sponsor through the Christian Children's fund. This guide was very helpful in preparing for the trip and I reread many parts after I got there to help understand what I was seeing. I wish I would have had more time to see the historic sights in the north and to go on an safari. I hope to return again someday for a longer visit.<BR>The Ethiopian people are the friendliest I have ever met in a foreign country.</span>

                    <span>Hi all of you, I did travel 2 years ago with the "The Bradt guide". This guide is the best on the marketplace. Met many people with the Lonely Planet and it seems there are an amazing amount of flaws in this onz. The Bradt is not perfect, sometimes it's a little bit inaccurate. But it was a very useful tool during my trip. Ethiopia was my best travel experience up to now !!! Thanks Philip Briggs. Just go.</span>

                    <span>There are few up-to-datea travel books for Ethiopia, but this is as good as any other country guide. The author, Philip Briggs, does a nice job of covering the major tourist attractions as well as focusing on the more quiet areas. If you are going to Ethiopia, this is a great guide to bring along!</span>

                    <span>Briggs's book is the best travel guide book on Ethiopia. His coverage of Ethiopia is fair and balanced. He seems to have excellent understanding of the Ethiopian culture and his book does a great job at explaining Ethiopia to the rest of the world. If you travel to Ethiopia, and I hope you do travel, this book will not disappoint you.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the most recent and most useful of the small number of guidebooks for Ethiopia available in the U.S. Descriptions of places to see were clear and informative, and the sections on how to get around, where to stay, good places to eat, and other tips for each town were accurate and well-researched. This book also contains useful sketch maps of many towns; these are now FAR more accurate than those in older editions, and I found them easier to use than similar maps found in other guides. There is also a thoughtful section on general issues related to travel in Ethiopia. I found this far superior to the other commonly available guides I own for information on Addis Ababa, the so-called "historical circuit," and the lowland desert areas (information on this last region is pretty scarce, but this book has more than others). The book is focused on providing useful travel information and not on long descriptions or photographs; if an informative guidebook to use while travelling is what you're looking for, this one is your best bet. (Be sure to get the newest edition, though-- the previous ones weren't nearly as good!)</span>
