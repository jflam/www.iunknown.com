                <span id="Label1">The riveting story of Nintendo's conquest of the interactive entertainment industry offering true tales filled with cocky arrogance, confidence and international intrigue that rival any novel.  Whether it is recounting the struggles over the game"Tetris," offering blow-by-blow narrative of Nintendo's bitter legal warfare or its see-saw competition with other companies for market leadership, Game Over is a masterful piece of business journalism and technical reportage-a book both cautionary and hugely entertaining.</span>

                    <span>While it is not entirely up to date, going only to just past the N64, this book is extremely informative as to the origins of the entire video game industry. It is not limited only to Nintendo, but stretches to every facet of what we know and love today. From the humble beginning of Nolan Bushnell to the era in which Nintendo was lord, ending with the fierce competition between Sony, Sega and Nintendo; it is all very well written without bias or lack of basis. A very worthwhile read for any true gamer.</span>

                    <span>I thought that this book was great. it told all about the pros and cons of nintendo and how they started out back in the late 1800's. It also tells about there rivals like Atari, and major computer companys. If your like me and love video games form nintendo you love this book. it may seem like a supprise at first since there are no pitures but it is still a very good book. they tell about how they started making trading cards in the east back in Japan, and how they made a deal with disney to make cards for them with pitures on them like mickey mouse. and how they started moving up and made millions of dollars by making the 8-bit classic NES, (nintendo entertainment system)<br>and where they got the idea of Mario. This video game empire I learned in the book, all started from an ape named donkey kong and a carpender (later turned into a plumber) named Mario. who was a bad guy and tried to save his girlfreind princess peach.</span>
