<h3 class="title">Whither the GAC?</h3>

<p>I see that <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040330#1080641913997">Ted Neward has been writing about the <span class="caps">GAC</span></a>. In particular, Ted writes "One uses the <span class="caps">GAC</span> to put assemblies into place that should be shared across applications".</p>

<p>I disagree. The only reason to put your assembly into the <span class="caps">GAC</span> is if you take the following oath: "I promise to <span class="caps">NEVER EVER</span> make any breaking changes in future versions of this assembly." This is the oath that MS took when it created <code>mscorlib.dll</code> and friends. And MS devotes a tremendous amount of time, energy and ultimately money to make those kinds of guarantees. And even <span class="caps">MS </span><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/changeinfo/Backwards1.0to1.1/default.aspx">has to make breaking changes occasionally</a>. </p>

<p>Most folks don't take that oath. Therefore I would argue that assemblies like Genghis <em>do not</em> belong in the <span class="caps">GAC. </span>They should be shipped as private assemblies instead.</p>

<p>So do you recommend putting a custom control dll into two or more bin directories if it needs to be used accross multiple web applications?  <br />

<p>I would still recommend avoiding the GAC in this case. If those applications need to evolve independently of each other, you will eventually run into a situation where that control needs to evolve with one of those apps, yet the other app remains unchanged. If you're not careful, you could introduce a breaking change into the control that breaks the unmodified app. It's just safer (and simpler) to deploy a separate copy of the assembly with each application.</p>

<p>John:</p>

<p>While (I think) I agree with you for commercial applications, when you have control over the environment, GAC can be a lifesaver.  As a f'rinstance:</p>

<p>We have a series of base class DLLs and architecture service DLLs that are used by about 120 different web services.  From a deployment standpoint, we have a "framework deployment" MSI, and a "web service deployment MSI."  Everything is strongly named with an auto-increment version number, so when we get to production we *know* that there aren't going to be any broken interfaces.  We find that out long before, if it happens.</p>

<p>For end-user applications where you don't have control over the workstation, your opinion looks like it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Well John - I think you are just wrong :)  What if you have an important bug fix and you have 5 web application that all use the same assembly?  You have to recompile and replace 5 dlls?  It is kind of like copy-and-past inheritence to me. That's a really bad way to share code IMO, which introduces way more problems than the GAC does.</p>

<p>I think your issue about not-breaking the interface holds true *until* you change the version number.  Once you change the version number (in spite of binding redirects and publishier policies) I think it is fine to introduce changes that might break apps compiled against v1, because they should be recompiled and re-tested against v2.</p>
