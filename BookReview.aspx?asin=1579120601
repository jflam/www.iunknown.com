                    <span>   My first criticism of this book is that the definitions are often very incomplete, giving only the definition of a particular word that the author feels may be misunderstood.  While that often might fulfill the prupose of the book, I think it would be better to consult a standard dictionary and determine which definition fiils the current need.
<br />   Also, this book does not (and of course, could not) contain every word an educated adult might want to look up.  It is simply one lexicographer's list of words that someone might misunderstand or mispronounce.
<br />    For that matter, I can't understand why this book is any advantage over a good, full-sized dictionary.  This is just a smaller dictionary of less often used words, but it contains no information on usage or pronounciation that would not be in any other regular dictionary.  It simply contains fewer words and fewer definitions for those words.  There are not any real mistakes in this book.  But if you buy a standard size dictionary, this book is simply redundant and much less useful.</span>

                    <span>I have to say - when I found this book lying around at my parents' place, I never thought I'd pick it up and start reading it.  I mean, it's a dictionary for goodness sake!  But when I got stuck looking up a word that didn't appear in my regular dictionary, I picked up this little oddity.  And trust me, oddity is the right word.<p>This book had some of the strangest words I'd ever seen, right alongside words I used every day.  Luckily, for most of the words I already knew in there, I was using them correctly, but every once in a while I would find something that I'd used often, but used completely incorrectly!  The title is definitely not a misnomer.<p>It's a scary thought, but once I started searching through this thing, I found that I could not put it down.  It's a load of fun using it for Balderdash words, and it really is quite informative.  If you're stuck on an essay and need a few synonyms, or you just want to make George Orwell turn over in his grave, this book is a must-have.<p>Honestly, it's a first-rate piece of work!</span>
