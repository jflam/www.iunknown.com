                    <span>I first came across "The Codebreakers" in the original edition, published in the 1960s. It was a massive read, and one which I never finished in one sitting; however, a love of history, the romance of espionage and the fascination of working with mysterious information kept me going. It is a pleasure to see the book has been reissued.<P>Kahn does not create a textbook for the serious cryptologist; such a work would be more mathematical in approach. What he does is give, from a layman's view, a good mid-level history of the art/science of cryptology. The first chapter, covering the cryptanalytic events of Pearl Harbor, brings you in; then he goes over the history of secret writing from the days of Egyptian hieroglyphics to roughly the present day. Interesting areas include the discussion of the European "black chambers" of the 1600s and 1700s, a good talk about how rumrunners in the Prohibition days used complex code/cipher combinations to thwart the Noble Experiment, and a highly entertaining chapter on the "ciphers" that proved Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare's works.<P>The updated edition falls short in its attempt at updating, which is why I don't give another star to the book. The discussion of cryptography in the world of the Internet is far too thin to satisfy. This, of course, could be a function of the beast; the Internet and electronic cryptology changes faster than any book could keep up with. In addition, information on the Enigma and other areas of World War II cryptology, declassified since the previous edition, could have been added to increase understanding of this critical time. However, the remaining "classic" text is still excellent, and has served as the layman's reference on cryptologic history for thirty years.</span>

                    <span>Definitely one of those books that will lead to a month or two of *excellent* reading. Kahn covers a mountainload of material, all at a light-to-medium depth, enough to wet your appetite, and with some of the systems and attacks described, enough that you need to spend a couple hours on a whiteboard to understand them, but not so much that it takes away from the historical aspect of the book. I definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting some very enjoyable medium-to-heavy reading.<P>The last chapter, though, was a huge disappointment -- the publisher made a huge mistake in coercing Kahn into releasing a new edition of this book when he was in the middle of another project. The added chapter is a short 15 pages that gives only a cursory overview of the last 30 years... it really would have served better as an addendum or as part of the preface, and can hardly justify a new edition. Its content was very weak compared to the rest of the book, and hinted at some misleading assertions without qualifying them. I was very disappointed reading it as the last chapter of such an excellent book. <P>As Kahn is definitely considered an insider during the last several decades, its understandable that he would choose not to write as in-depth on matters with which he may or may not have been exposed to in his professional dealings with the agencies and companies that have heavily influenced the cryptography community in the last 30 years. <P>But it seems that there is a ton of additional information has been made publicly available since the first edition was published, much of it in the last decade, regarding the time periods already covered in this book, that could have greatly improved existing chapters or led to new chapters. <P>Hopefully some day Kahn will have the time and inclination to return and do a new edition of this book, but until then, the first edition is just as good as this one and probably available at your local university library.</span>

                    <span>As a historian, with a particular interest in other than "American History", I found this book particularly compelling. I read the Earlier edition at least three times. <P>Yes, I found that, at times, the text gets bogged down in minutae that may not appeal to a particular reader, but in a volume of this magnitude, with this scope, and this ambition, that is virtually a lock.<P>What many of the reviewers don't seem to realize that the book was written in the context of the 1960s and that not only the writing, but also events described must be put into context. David Kahn does an excellent job of doing just that. To illustrate, I might simply point out his portrait of Herbert O. Yardley. One only has to read Yardley's "Education of a Poker Player" to understand just how accurate Kahn was in describing Yardley and his role. <P>Like all history books of a more specialized nature, there is a serious advantage to having enough background information to understand where events, people, and technology fit into the puzzle.<P>If you are seriously interested in what went on "behind the scenes" in much of the historical events of the 19th and 20th centuries, this book provides information that is an essential part of the puzzle.</span>

                    <span>This is the essential history of cryptography at least through WW II. But of course, at the time it was published none of the ULTRA and Enigma decrypts had been released. And since the original hard book edition had become a rare book... it needed to be reprinted: the paperback had been excised of much of the material in the notes. All that said, when I first heard that this second edition was to come out, I eagerly sought it out. But I returned it the next day. The only new material is a short superficial chapter added at the end. None of the former text has been changed and the new material is simply not worth it since I have the first hardback. If you want more on ULTRA and the others there are a number of excellent books on both cryptography and SIGINT operations published since. And after all crytography is just a game unless the results can be applied in real time to affect events.</span>
