                    <span>BLAST is a well-known tool for bioinformatics (biological sciences+computer sciences). In this book contains a concepts of central dogma of molecular biology, sequence aligment, sequece similarity, practical BLAST programs (divide into 5 programs), and how to install and use BLAST tool. Moreover, it also offers enough tips to improve my BLAST searches usage. I think this book's content is well-writing and well-organizing for comparative sequeces alignment tasks. I use this book to begin in bioinformatics and it can help me to learn about this. But this book does not contain all of things that I want to known on bioinformatics or computational biology.</span>

                    <span>If you want to understand the nuts and bolts of how sequence alignment works, then this is the book for you. It will be especially useful for BLAST users who want to understand how it actually works and also for developers who don't know much biology, struggle with the math, but have no problem reading a perl script.<p>The book is basically divided into:<br>0. A Foreword by Stephen Altschul (the co-creator of BLAST)<br>1. A quick web intro to a BLAST search<br>2. Sequence alignment and how the algorithms work<br>3. Blast and how the Blast statistics are calculated<br>4. The different types of Blast e.g. WU-Blast<br>5. Approaches to Performance speedup<br>6. Reference sections on BLAST parameters<p>The real key is that this book neatly splits the difference  between academic texts and papers which are quite often too difficult to read without sufficient background (and they are not precise about the implementation anyway) and the user-manual type texts which don't discuss the theory at all.<p>One of the best chapters (in my view) is chapter three, where they explain and illustrate the workings of the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms for global and local alignment. If you read the text, then study and run the included perl code, you WILL understand how they work, but be prepared to spend several hours trying different examples. The real advantage of this approach is that you get a deep, practical understanding of how alignment actually works, that you just can't get from reading a mathematical treatment of the subject. Once you understand this chapter, you are actually sufficiently expert to get inside alignment code and modify it for your own purposes.<p>Ian Korf does continually emphasize that the algorithms may look clever, but they are, in the end, robotic in that they will quite happily align complete rubbish if you are not careful about controlling the algorithm and thinking carefully about the results you get.<p>There are a couple of mistakes in the diagrams (chap 3), that are addressed in the errata, but the perl code is correct.<p>Finally, because this book is about BLAST, it doesn't mention other methods of sequence alignment such as Hidden-Markov Models or methods of multiple sequence alignment. Perhaps they'll do a book on those as well one day..</span>

                    <span>As the first reviewer mentioned, the book is not a fast read. In order<br>to run BLAST properly one must understand how and why it works. BLAST<br>exists at the intersection of molecular biology, computer science, and<br>statistics. This might sound intimidating, but once you read about these<br>topics in chapters 2-4, you'll see that it isn't so complicated and it<br>all fits together nicely. We know that BLAST users come from a variety<br>of backgrounds and we have therefore written the book for a general<br>audience. As a result, the book is more than just a BLAST manual, it's<br>also a friendly introduction to computational molecular biology.<p>Writing this book took a lot of time and effort. It went through some<br>painful transformations. The authors waged many battles against<br>themselves and each other to bring to you the kind of book we wished we<br>could have bought several years ago. We'll feel our work was justified<br>if you approach your next BLAST search as a scientific experiment and<br>not a Google search. And if we've helped some of you to embark on a new<br>career/hobby in bioinformatics, drop us a line, it's sure to make our<br>day.</span>

                    <span>Useful book for biologists to understand computer algorithm.  This book is very helpful if you are going through endless BLAST search. It is not a fast read but it is packed with useful information. I have started using the suggested examples and tricks in this book and feel more comfortable at doing the search. Important book for Bioinformatics researchers!</span>
