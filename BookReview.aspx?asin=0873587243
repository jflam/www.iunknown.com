                    <span>David Noble divides his book according to the various Indian groups: the Mogollon, the Anasazi, the Sinagua, the Salado, etc. Each entry is described by layout and history and accompanied by great photos and/or diagrams. But his entries are brief and preceded by driving instructions and, in some cases, tour times. One may get the impression that one is reading a travel guide as one reads Noble's book.<P>Personally, I will keep this book on that basis. I have had the chance to visit many of the sites mentioned in Noble's book. His descriptions are succinct and accurate. Noble's book whets my appetite on sites I want yet to see. This book's a keeper.</span>

                    <span>I have been to the Southwest four straight years now and I still refer to this book when planning my vacations. The book describes every major ancient site in the southwest with plenty of pictures and maps to give you the confidence you need to visit them. What I liked most about Mr. Noble's style of writing is he mixes in historical information alongside detailed descriptions on how to get to and visit the sites. The result is a history book that reads like a guide book. I'm the first person to admit that I have a short attention span when it comes to reading 100+ page books on places I want to visit. I tend to scan the text for what I'm interested in and miss alot of background information. By arranging the book in regions and giving each site its own 2-4 page section, it is easy to get a quick overview for planning and catch some interesting facts as well. As a result of this book, I have visited numerous sites in Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. I can vouch for the accuracy of the descriptions and directions contained within the book and would highly recommend purchasing it if you are even remotely interested in the ancient sites of the southwest.</span>

                    <span>I became fascinated by the wealth of archaeological resources in the American Southwest while working as an archaeological photographer and editor at a research institute in New Mexico. I found that the Southwest is a veritable archaeological museum! I wrote this guidebook to offer people interested in American Indians and America's cultural heritage much more information than is available in standard travel guidebooks. <P>I did a lot of research on the sites, consulted with archaeologists who excavated them, and had all chapters professioanlly reviewed to make sure they are accurate and current. Using this guidebook will give you a unique cultural and historical framework for discovering the scenic beauty of the Southwest. I include current directions to sites (only sites that are open to the public, accessible, interpreted, monitored), suggest other nearby places to visit further reading.<P> This book has sold nearly 90,000 copies over to date. Happy exporing!<P> David Grant Noble: Author of "Ancient Ruins of the Southwest"</span>
