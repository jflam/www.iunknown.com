                    <span>If you're looking for a lengthy academic, tome on the subject of business meetings, this book is NOT for you. However, if you're a busy professional that hardly has enough time for pleasure reading, this is definitely the book for you. <p>The authors of "Running a Meeting That Works" have produced a practical, "to the point" guide for those required to run meetings. Recently appointed to the chairmainship of a committee, I realized that I needed to improve my ability to conduct business meetings. Only looking for this book out of a sense of urgent need (several meetings are on the immediate horizon), I was looking for a book that would be a quick and easy read and would provide practical advice that could be implemented immediately. This book clearly fulfills these requirements. <p>The book consists of 14 succinct chapters that are organized for the most part around bulleted or numbered lists. I have found that these lists can be easily reviewed and re-reviewed in order to recall key points. Additionally, the main ideas in the lists (generally the first sentence) are bolded or set off in different color font than surrounding text focusing the reader's attention on the main idea or concept. <p>In addition to being well written and organized, it is clear that the author / publisher / designer paid careful attention to the needs of the audience. Great job! Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>A few years ago, Industry Week estimated that poorly-led meetings cost American businesses over 37 billion dollars annually.  The current number  is undoubtedly higher.  <p>This book is for all those who aren't getting  the results they want from the meetings they lead.  Since that is almost  everyone, you're in good company.<p>Designed for those with limited  training and expertise in this area, you may at first think the authors  have overdone a good thing.  I can testify from personal experience that  the most successful meetings I chair follow each of the pieces of advice in  this book.  Obviously, if the subject isn't worth that much effort, you  probably shouldn't be holding a meeting anyway.  There's probably a better  way to go.  In fact, that's one of the suggestions that authors make:  Only  hold meetings when no alternative will do.<p>To get a sense of the book,  here are the chapter titles:  (1) Know your purpose  (2) Why have a  meeting? (3) Prepare what, who, when, here, and for how long (4) Prepare  yourself (5) Prepare others (6) Who's in charge? Do's and Don'ts of Leading  (7) Encourage participation (8) Dealing with difficult situations (9)  Collaterial materials (10) Audio visual Assistance (11) Guest speakers are  welcome (12) Wrapping up (13) Assess the meeting (14) Report  results.<p>Each chapter begins with a quote from Alice in Wonderland (where  many totally useless meetings occurred) to establish the problem.  The  chapters then go into the theory of why the step is important, the choices  about how to take the step, and provides a useful framework to guide you  through the process.  <p>The only thing that I found missing from the book  was some direction on how to get advice about how to make the meeting more  successful while you are in the planning stages.  Early input often can  help you avoid big problems later.  <p>With better-led meetings, you can  have shorter and fewer meetings.  This can provide the opportunity to have  more time for being with those you care about.  What an opportunity!<p>Get  to the point!<p></span>

                    <span>Miller and Pincus hit just the right tone with "Running A Meeting  That Works".  The mood is light and concise.  The reader is led  through the meeting process in a "how to" format that is very  easy to follow.  It can be adapted to just about any type of private or  public business.  The standard format is presented on pre-planning, agenda  making, dealing with conditions, topics and different types of audiences.     I would have liked to have had more information on how to deal with  difficult people, but I guess that's a different book! If you're looking  for ideas on how to run a successful meeting, this book should do it for  you.  If you require more technical help on delegating, directing or team  building, you will need to look elsewhere.</span>
