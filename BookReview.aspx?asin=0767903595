                <span id="Label1">Drawing on the success of her first book, <I>Creating Sacred Space with Feng Shui</I>, Karen Kingston has met popular demand by expanding on the indispensable activity of clearing clutter. There is very little of actual Feng Shui here, and certainly nothing you can't get elsewhere, but the clutter problem gets full and complete treatment. Kingston reminds us that clutter is stuck energy that keeps you stuck in undesirable life patterns. Therefore, you can "sort out your life by sorting out your junk." Kingston covers the reasons we keep things as well as the amazing stories of people who have cleared their clutter away. More than just junk, clutter is all those things that have negative symbology and that collect stagnant energy. This latter can also apply to bodily, emotional, and spiritual clutter, all of which Kingston describes with characteristic passion. In an age of accumulation, it's good to see a book that frees up life again.</span>

                    <span>Whether or not you are a practioner or believer in Feng Shui, this book is helpful. It's easy to read and makes you think. I have read it more than once and having lent it out on more than one occasion, find myself having to repurchase it because the people I lend it to love it so much. It is a good book to get you started in clearing out the clutter in your home & in your life. I didn't jump right in and create a perfect world for myself. But I did take the lessons to heart and started off slowly. I came to realize that my stuff was controlling me instead of the other way round. When I allowed myself to look at my belongings the way Ms. Kingston suggests, I was finally able to start clearing my home of the un-needed stuff & low energy. I have been working on this for a year now. And everytime I go through a certain part of my home, even if it is just to dust, I clear out even more. (I originally started as a way to eliminate dust collectors due to allergies). It has even helped me curb my spending habits. I need less space to live in now and have managed to tackle some other things that needed doing to help myself emotionally & physically. This book isn't a cure all, but it is a great way to get jumpstarted. I now keep more than 1 copy to give out to anyone who expresses an interest in how I helped myself find a better way of life.</span>

                    <span>Okay. Time to throw out stuff, clear surfaces, realign furniture, put a single perfect flower in a simple vase, sit back, and begin to relax and thrive in your own home. Feng shui, the Asian art that crosses the borders of architecture, philosophy, Zen, and housekeeping, has stormed the shores of America and found a welcome reception. Much bunk has been written about this ancient 'art,' but this book pares it down to one simple aspect of the process: getting rid of clutter. Once that's done, much stress is reduced from one's life, and you can begin to enjoy your home environment on a level previously unimagined. This is a good book to get you started.</span>

                    <span>Author Karen Kingston needs to stick with what she knows, and that is obviously about dealing with clutter. That portion of the book is useful, but doesn't really say anything new.<P>Where she totally loses credibility is when she makes gigantic, illogical leaps and says things like, "..if the previous occupants were happily married, it is likely that you, too, will find marital bliss there." I could have done without the chapter on de-cluttering your colon (really), her assertion that wearing bras causes breast cancer (puh-leese!), and her instructions to clap in my corners to relieve the static energy there. Probably my favorite quote would be, "...leave exorcism to trained professionals." 'Cause, you know, we're all wanting to de-clutter our homes of those evil spirits.<P>If you're swamped with clutter, get real and throw stuff out, recycle it, or give it to someone else who might be able to use it. If you're highly motivated, have a garage sale. There, now you don't have to buy this book.</span>

                    <span>The author does provide several good clues for clearling clutter but the message is obscured with her incesstant self-promotion. She provides scant clues to Feng Shui, so little in fact that she could have dropped Feng Shui from the title made no changes to the text. Her book reads more like an advertistment for her dubious services than a help book for those needing to find the benefits of losing their clutter. <P>If you are into rebirthing, crystal power and the other trappings of new age nonsense, this is the book for you. If you are after a good book on clearing clutter save your money and look elsewhere.</span>
