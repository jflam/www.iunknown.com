                <span id="Label1">From 1966 to 1976 the malevolent rage of the Chinese Cultural Revolution struck a devastating blow to all religions in China, destroying countless temples and shrines that had stood for centuries and forcibly returning thousands of monks and nuns to lay life. Bill Porter had been told that the venerable hermetic tradition in China had also succumbed, but he went looking anyway. What he found, Taoist and Buddhist monks and nuns living in huts and caves deep in the mountains of central China, is more than a revelation, it is a glimmer of hope for the future of religion in China.  </span>

                    <span>This book reads like an adventure story but it is all true...Bill Porter speaks Mandarin and has many friends in China so he could travel into territories where few Westerners are able to go without a guide. He won the trust of many hermits high up in the mountains of China and tells a wonderful tale of their survival against all odds...Sadly, they are a dying breed and the last of a generation who dedicated themselves to a monastic life of meditation and living without wordly goods. A really good read! Marilynn Seits</span>

                    <span>I read this book over the fall of 2002. I read it very slowly to match the books own pace.I am rereading it now and again find it to be one of the most enjoyable books ever. I love Bill Porter's translations of Stonehouse et al and I think we owe a lot to these guys in Port Townsend and other obscure places for taking the time to share this quiet wabi-sabi stuff with us. In this book Bill ventures into the remote Chung-nan mountains looking for any left-over Buddhist and Taoist hermits from the Cultural revolution of Mao tse tung and he finds a surprisingly resiliant culture indeed. His talks,shared cigars& koolaid teas with the assorted hermits are a delight to hear about. All of us Taoist Zen afficianados wonder if any of these guys suvived and they have. This book was written in the late eighties early ninties however and now I wonder if they still do as many were quite old.
<br />Anyway again all praise to Bill Porter. </span>

                    <span>I was pleased at the start of this book, to have some geographical descriptions but it became more of a travel diary of where to go and what not to do.  It is understandable that such an elusive prey as solitary hermits requires determined searching and physical effort, but less of the travellogue and more of the interviews may be useful.  If you want to follow in some of Porter and Johnson's footsteps, be sure to have real time stamina and energy.  This appears to be an exhaustive examination of the roads to travel.  Little here to gain from insight and spiritual discovery, though there are a few gems hidden in the very wordy treatise.  Not recommended for impatient travellers.</span>

                    <span>What a great book! An American expatriate living at a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan takes advantage of the lifting of travel restrictions to see if China's legendary tradition of hermits still endures. He arrives in 1989, during the student demonstrations in Tienanmen Square. The officials assure him that the decadent hermits have been completely wiped out long ago. In spite of this, the scholar presses inland to the heart of China. He finds himself drawn to the Chungnan mountains- the mighty spine of the dragon, the bones of China itself, dividing the Yangtze country in the south from the Yellow river country to the north. He doesn't realize that this is where shamanism first arose in China, if not in the human world. This was where the Immortals lived. This was where Lao-tzu wrote the Tao te Ching. Here, he finds his hermits, Buddhist and Taoist, young and old, male and female. I think that the best part in the entire book was when one ancient hermit, who had been living in the mountains since 1939, asked the author, "Who is this "Mao" that you speak of?"<p> After his initial contact with Chungnan hermits (he would return) the author heads back down into modern China. He finds that the Tienanmen Massacre has occurred.<p> Upon reading this book I got a sense that the true bones of China were untouched by Communism, as they will no doubt be left untouched by Corporatism. I found this book to be inspiring- you could not invent a piece of fiction this good. However, I also found myself wishing that the author had brought that ancient hermit back with him to face down the butchers of Tienanmen.<p> One man centered in the Tao can do much....</span>

                    <span>This book provide a fleeting image of cloud people, the Chinese hermits who have turned their backs on this world of red dust. There is a stark contrast between the monks and hermits, and the busy American, rushing about asking homely questions like "Were you upset when the Red Guards burned your library?" or "Do you get any mail?"<br>Yet, I find myself returning to "Road to Heaven" because there are a few anecdotes, gems and asides about famous hermits that make it worthwhile reading. Searching for a lost quote, I return to the hasty interviews with abbots and nuns standing guard at old temples and shrines. And I find more to their stories than first meets the eye.<br>There is stillness and tranquility in the frugal lives of the Chinese hermits, and a firm unwavering grip on the essentials of religion. They represent the last living flicker of the spiritual wisdom originating with Lao-tzu. And now their world vanishes into the darkness, like sparks from a windswept fire.</span>
