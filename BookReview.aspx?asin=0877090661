                    <span>The book seems to have been conceived as a textbook, and some of the pages devoted to general IT discussion seems a little redundant to me (especially considering that the book is quite short).<p>Despite this, I consider it a very useful book on the subject, and the advice on how to structure data is very well presented and convincing.<p>What surprised me is to find some very good hints and rules of thumb on practical aspect of Data Modeling, which usually you don't find in this kind of books.<p>I've not yet been able to try out the data design methodology detailed in the book, but I'm more than willing to give it a try next time I have to participate in specifying an application DB.<p>All in all, a good buy. It short enough that reading it cover to cover is not a daunting project, and after having read it once you will probably want to use at least part of what you found in it. I'd really like to see a similar treatment for other IT ideas and problems, like OO design, for example.</span>

                    <span>This book gives you the basics on how to develop solid data models.  The only problem I can see with this book, is that you need to have some clue of what you are doing before reading this book.  If you want something that will take you step-by-step read "Database Design For Mere Mortals" by Robert Hernandez.  This book takes nothing for granted and goes through the whole database design process, from the first interview with the user(s), to the actual design of the database.  Overall, I thought this book as good, especially to be only 100+ pages or so.  However, buy the other book if you need more indepth knowledge.</span>

                    <span>I have introduced a good variety of developers and analysts to this little book with a positive reaction on all occasions. It makes very few assumptions and moves rapidly from the introductory level to advanced practicality. The author has a style which is commendably concise and precise, relaxed but not wordy, illustrating with copious diagrams. His enthusiasm and professional attitude are obvious, his experience coming from extensive teaching and consulting in the USA and China. He promotes data modeling and database design for systems of any size by entity relationship analysis and diagramming and speaks as a generalist, not tied to any specific database technology.<p>Chapter 1: the difference between conceptual, logical, and physical database design. Good for those who need to be released from inveterately thinking at the physical level.<p>Chapter 2: the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), entity attributes, cardinality, recursive relationships, optional/mandatory bounds, and a fascination little section on Quillan's semantic data model for artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge modelling.<p>Chapter 3: how to convert ERD's to relational tables, and performance v. flexibility.<p>Chapter 4: worked examples - a range of simple starter data models. Includes Human Resources dept., tech support, ticket reservation systems, a charity, industrial production operations manage systems, and activity-based costing.<p>Chapter 5: strategic database planning across the organisation to avoid duplication of effort.<p>Chapter 6: Object-oriented data modeling (unfortunately predating UML, time for a second edition Lawrence!).<p>The appendix covers normalization of a relational data model beautifully, including create/update/delete anomalies, functional dependency between attributes, and Normal Form (first normal form, second normal form, third normal form, and domain key normal form (DKNF)). There is an useful reference bibliography and index.<p>Excellent value, highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book was really great.  I found myself understanding every concept the first read.  The book gave me the most info in the shortest amount of time, compared to any other book I've read.  For those of you who have been working informally with databases for awhile, this book is the next step.  I believe the book helps beginners all the way to the experienced.  The only thing I would suggest is to have some knowledge of relational databases.  Even if all you've used is Access, that will do.</span>

                    <span>I have been trying to find a book on modeling that didn't put me to sleep.  Also am trying to transition to ood and wanted to get a better grasp on it.  This book met both those goals and more!  In a little over 100 pages it presents more information than 300+ page books!  Also has some great Entity Relationship diagrams. Kudos to the author!</span>
