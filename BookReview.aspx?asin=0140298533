These stories-each of which unfolds like a mystery-will help owners better understand the ever fascinating cat psyche. Following on the success of her comprehensive book, <i>Think Like a Cat</i>, Johnson-Bennett sheds light on the communication breakdowns between cats and their humans.</span>

                    <span>Pam Johnson-Bennett offers excellent, common-sense advice for dealing with feline behavioral problems. The situations and solutions discussed in this book suggest that, no matter how bad your kitty's behavior, there is hope and light at the end of the tunnel. We humans just need to pay better attention to what our cat companions are telling us and to learn how to think like a cat. Johnson-Bennett is one of the best feline behaviorists around and this would be a great book to read if your cat has any issues. Highly recommended</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for cat lovers. I've owned cats all of my life and they still fascinate me. This book is full of funny and intriguing tales from a cat behaviorial specialist. I finished reading it within a few hours, it was so interesting - I couldn't stop. Even when I thought I might know a lot about feline behavior - I was surprised to learn a great deal more from these stories.</span>

                    <span>This book is so much fun! Not only will you learn about feline behavior and begin to recognize various behaviors in your own cat, but you will also laugh out loud at the situations Pam gets into with some of her most memorable feline clients. This book is a real hoot!</span>

                    <span>The author presents some stories about how she successfully solved problems related to cat behavior. Every story ends the same way, with Pam Johnson-Bennett making an astute diagnosis and saving the day. Everything is neatly tied up by the end of each chapter.<P>I wanted to believe her, but I came away with the feeling that at the very least, she took some real liberties with the truth.</span>

                    <span>Pam Johnson, self-taught cat psychologist, relates 13 true cases she has had to deal with oddly behaving cats (or their odd owners). She writes that it's usual for her to be entering the owner's window now rather than going through the front door. After you read through the cases, you'll understand why. A gentle giant cat usually extroverted happy cat suddenly hiding in corners, a cat that shreds printing paper, a cat that runs itself into the wall, the cat who gets violent on Sundays, a cat that overgrooms itself so much that it gets bald, a cat that hates one of its owners when she comes home after work, 3 heartwarming stories involving owners with their cats, etc. They're so funny, so entertaining, and makes you understand that we as humans are so ignorant as what it's like to be a cat and live in a cat's world. It would DEFINITELY be great as gifts to other cat loving friends even if you buy them used/out of print. I'll definitely be keeping it on my bookshelf with my other cat books.</span>
