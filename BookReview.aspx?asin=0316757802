                <span id="Label1">The vastly expanded Second Edition of Dr. Rothman's acclaimed  Modern Epidemiology reflects the remarkable conceptual development of  this evolving science and the engagement of epidemiologists with an  increasing range of current public health concerns. This landmark work  is the most comprehensive and cohesive text on the principles and  methods of contemporary epidemiologic research.Coauthored by two  leading epidemiologists, with 15 additional contributors, the Second  Edition presents a much broader range of concepts and methods than Dr.  Rothman's single-authored original edition. Coverage of basic measures  and study types is more thorough and includes a new chapter on field  methods. New chapters on advanced topics in data analysis, such as  hierarchical regression, are also included. A new section covers  specific areas of research such as infectious disease epidemiology,  ecologic studies, disease surveillance, analysis of vital statistics,  screening, clinical epidemiology, environmental and occupational  epidemiology, reproductive and perinatal epidemiology, genetic  epidemiology, and nutritional epidemiology.</span>

                    <span>Some professional epidemiologists see this text as the most thorough and complete resource manual ever written on this subject. In contrast, I see this book as an encrypted enigma. To say that it is difficult-to-follow would be a gross understatement. The major problem is the middle-third of the book, which covers statistical concepts. The authors fall into the trap of presenting way too much unnecessary detail, even in situations when it is not warranted. Apparently, the authors were on a self-absorbed ego trip when they wrote this component. One is definitely better off getting statistical concepts directly from statistical texts, such as Alan Agresti's, An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis. Still, the book is not completely useless either. The last several chapters cover specific areas in epidemiology and may be useful to those with a keen interest in a specific area.</span>

                    <span>The first edition of this book was a superb, tightly written mongraph, but it was a single-authored work written in the 1980s and needed to be updated. This new edition seems to be intended as a more comprehensive reference work on epidemiologic methods, adding a dozen authors and covering many topics that were not in the first edition, such as reproductive epidemiology and infectious disease epidemiology. Some readers might find it to be too detailed and broad to be easily digested in a short time. Nevertheless, as a reference guide, I don't think that it has any rival. The first 100 pages or so are a clearly rewritten update of the core material from the first edition. The middle chapters, which are new and mostly written by Greenland, are a little slow-going but are worth the effort if you want a cutting-edge insight into epidemiologic methods. The final section, with many contributors, presents the specific methodology of nearly every area of epidemiologic research. Overall, this book is essential if you are serious about understanding epidemiology.</span>

                    <span>I agree with many reviewers here that the book is great, but poorly organized and put too much on statistical methods. I have read through it from cover to cover for my exams. Nevertheless, the first part discussion is very good, but you need to read other books before reading Rothman's book. Acutally, I really hate Greenland's writing, it is too obscure. I would not recommend this book to students.</span>

                    <span>"Here's what everyone else thinks about this topic (you name it), but here's why they're wrong and it's really a whole lot more complicated than that." This book verges on the surreal - there's the feeling that a little peyote might help one "break through" and suddenly absorb the 5th dimensional world of complete mastery of all the quasireligious mysteries of epi.<BR>Yeah, I was exposed to it in my very first epi class and as others have said, it's not for beginning students; however, my professors (30 years into their fields) tell me they still turn to it on occasion. Kidding aside, there were some profound truths that (I think) I got. But ask a VERY simple question, like, does external validity refer to the source population or populations outside the source pop, and you will find yourself trudging through tar for hours with gaiters on.<BR>Look at it this way: a priest gets to spend the rest of his life trying to refine his understanding of the Bible... well, guess what you'll be doing, pal. Might as well not get frustrated about it...</span>

                    <span>Don't invest in this book, even if it is considered required reading for your course(s), you will be much better off... trust me. THis book is supposedly cutting edge in terms of epidemiological methods (whatever that means). But, the authors have written this book in a way that is confusing, misleading, and uninterpretable. The chapters written by Rothman and/or Greenland seem to purposely confuse the reader with unnecessary teminology and excessive use of equations. Moreover, this book could not be more poorly organized. Don't waste your time or money. I relied on "Epidemiology in Medicine" by Hennekens (which is not great, but good enough) and web-based resources to get through my doctoral program in Epidemiology. My classmates hated Rothman too.</span>
