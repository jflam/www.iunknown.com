                    <span>This isn't really a bad DVD release, but it is on the low end of the quality material expected from National Geographic. The heavy metal music blaring over MTV-style edits of tornadoes and lightning storms occasionally dips into the murky waters of the worst of reality TV programming about disasters. Ditto the black-and-white recreations of tragedy a la Rescue 911. Techniques like these are used mostly during sections about disasters that don't get caught on tape as often, but it's still annoying.<P>The feature is only 55 minutes in length, but the DVD contains two extra programs, both around 20 minutes long (one on lightning strikes and one on tornadoes and storm chasers). They are both interesting and somewhat informative...in fact, I liked the program about tornadoes better than the feature. <P>And, while I do expect National Geographic to produce a more top-shelf product with a little more substance, the 5.1 audio and the crystal clear picture produces a treat for your senses. This release is definately designed to entertain rather than inform.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the other reviewers who gave this DVD 5 stars except on the point about tornados. There is one very good sequence in the video but the remainder of the tornado section is very sparse, especially compared to the time spent on other natural events. If you want tornados, I suggest finding another video.</span>

                    <span>The thing that impresses me about National Geographic DVD's is the amount of effort put into their documentaries.This one has everything.It covers tornadoes,hurricanes,earthquakes,fires,storms and building collapses.National Geographic puts a great deal of effort into covering the history of the disasters,far more so than others that cover the same thing.It covers the why of what happens,the history of the area,the type of land,the people and how it occurs.This is the DVD to own if you want one on the wild side of nature.It is only about 54 minutes long,but is a good DVD...</span>

                    <span>I owned this on VHS. So when it came out on DVD, I just had to get it. National Geographic has always done an excellent job on their documentries.Natures Fury is a good example. The picture clarity is what you would expect on a DVD. The sound quality makes the tornadoes and booming thunder sound like it is in the room. If you like to chase violent storms or enjoy watching these wonders of nature, waste no time and buy this DVD!</span>
