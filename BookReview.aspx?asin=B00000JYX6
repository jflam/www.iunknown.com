                    <span>Spectacular! The video is fantastic. The undersea cinematography is great, high caliber work all around. The soundtrack is appropriate to video, relaxing "new age", done in Dolby Digital. Screen saver and Wallpaper for your PC. It will rank high in my collection of Reef and Ocean videos. I recomend it for a gift to a special friend. This work truely deserves recognition and support. In fact I'm going to look for more work by David Hannan.</span>

                    <span>My family once owned the video to this movie. It was so relaxing, peaceful, and beautiful. The first time I saw it, I fell asleep (that's not a bad thing). This a great video for the whole family; babies will be mesmarized by the color (then quickly put to sleep because of the music), kids with be awed, teens will find it very facinating, and parents can take a well needed break. This video/DVD can take the stress out of anyone's day and turn a bad day upside down. This movie wasn't made to have a plot, it was created just to be beautiful. Everyone should own this; I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Coral Sea Dreaming shows a variety of ocean life and habitats, both under and around the water. Â  Compared to relaxation DVD's, this has the highest quality picture that I've seen. The picture on a widescreen rear projection TV needed no adjustments. Although the picture is very sharp and clear in many places, there is some variability in the picture quality. Some scenes were fairly fuzzy. It's filmed in full screen mode. I'd like to find this type of movie in widescreen filmed with high definition cameras. It probably sounds pretty goofy, but I enjoy watching fish swim around! I highly recommend Coral Sea Dreaming.</span>

                    <span>I have almost all available underwater DVDs. If you want one thats like meditation, "Coral Sea Dreaming DVD" is really one of the best. The quality of the film sequence is crystal-clear. It's indead as the title is.</span>
