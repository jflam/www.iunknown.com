                    <span>Well it's now 1998, and Bristol Computing has jumped on the growing  Microsoft lawsuit pile with  another claim that something is rotten in  Redmond.  The contentious arguments have now moved to the  issue of the  Win32 API, an issue Andrew Shulman first discussed in his investigative  masterpiece,  "Undocumented Windows". <p>If there is a Microsoft  monopoly it is that they have total, proprietary, 100% control of the API  to which  the majority of computer applications are written.  The 1992  publication of "Undocumented Windows"  revealed for the first  time that there was no "Chinese Wall" between Microsoft OS  development, and  Microsoft Application development.  The playing field was  indeed not level.  Shulman also discovered  the reprehensible methodology  of using arbitrary changes to low level system calls, the "shared  dll's", to  spike the performance of competing applications.<p>As they  used to say in Redmond, "Windows isn't done until Lotus won't  run".<p>The Windows OS triumphed over the more sophisticated and  capable Mac, and the powerful but  balkanized UNIX environment, because of  the vast selection of shrink wrapped applications offered.  <p>The  Microsoft strategy of providing an open platform GUI, promised both an open  Hardware  Reference and an open API.<p>Yes, the Win32 API was sold to eager  third party developers as an open platform.  Microsoft  subsequently  captured the mindshare and investment efforts of most third party  developers by providing  an effective access bridge to an highly  competitive hardware development community.   Shulman's work  proved that  while the hardware reference was open, the API was not.   <p>Since then,  investors and developers have come to realize that all opportunities on the  Windows  platform belong to Microsoft.  It is just a matter of time, time  which is measured  by Microsoft  first  encouraging third party developers  in their efforts to grow a new application category, then by their  moving  in to seize the opportunity once the category proves profitable.<p>Perhaps  the most important aspect of Shulman's work is that he explains in detail  his investigative  methods.  The book also comes with an API sniffer  utility so that developers can prove for themselves  the shenanigans they  must contend with.<p>Undocumented Windows remains a good read and goes a  long way towards explaining the two defining  developments of technology in  the 90's.  The unstoppable (but most predictable) application dominance  by  Microsoft has come to pass.  And, seeking opportunities elsewhere, the  Internet gold rush of  investors and developers in 1994.</span>
