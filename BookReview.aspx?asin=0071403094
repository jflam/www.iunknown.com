                    <span>Want a wealthy mate?  Here are some dos and don'ts from "Updating" by Leil Lowndes (LL):
<br />* Get the National Geographic and Scientific American magazines off your coffee table!  Those are middle class!  Only display literary or foreign magazines.  And forget about National Enquirer or Sports Illustrated-those are low class!
<br />* Never wear bright colors!  Red is a proletariat no-no!  (Didn't anyone inform Nancy Reagan of this?)  And natural fibers only, please. (Note - in the 21st century synthetic fibers don't exactly look like John Travolta's leisure suit in Saturday Night Fever.)
<br />*Never wear a baseball cap or a tee shirt with writing on it.  (I saw a picture of Bill Gates the other day wearing a baseball cap.)
<br />*Never have a second hand on your watch.  "The leisure class doesn't need to track seconds." page 118.
<br />* Have a threadbare oriental rug in your living room and d√©cor alluding to "Mother England" 
<br />*If you must lower yourself to owing a television, keep it hidden.  
<br />*"Royals" never use a euphemism such as "restroom" or "bathroom".  Only use the word "toilet".  
<br />
<br />As you can probably tell from the above, LL is advising you on how to pass yourself off as an old money blue blood.  She offers this as serious advice, but I find this chapter outrageously funny.   She even gives you a quiz to tell how high class your living room is.  (Subtract 3 points for each color photograph you display.)  
<br />
<br />I'm not sure that I, being of Eastern European Jewish ancestry, could successfully pass myself off as being blue blood, having been at Hebrew school when I should have been at the debutantes' ball.  And someone of African ancestry might have even more trouble.  Subtle (and some not so subtle) ethnic and regional prejudices abound in this book.  
<br />
<br />Another piece of advice on landing a wealthy mate is to move to a wealthy neighborhood.  LL tells the story of a middle income gold digging friend who moved out of her nice apartment in Queens to an expensive neighborhood in Manhattan where she paid big bucks to rent a closet-size apartment.  But a year or so later, the friend told the author she had good news that she could only deliver in person.  So LL goes to her friend's new apartment which is the penthouse of the same building.  Her friend had married the multi-millionaire art dealer she met in the elevator!  Gold digging success!  This gambit paid off handsomely for LL's friend, but if you don't meet your megabucks mate this way, oops!  There goes your retirement money. 
<br />
<br />Any book on gold digging worth its ink should give advice on how to land new money!  Afterall, is a gold digger fussy about whether she (or he) lands a nouveau rich Microsoft millionaire?  But there's zero advice on how to land Bill Gates' single friends.
<br />
<br />I don't want to mislead you into thinking this is only a gold digging manual, however.  You also learn (chapter 3) "How to Find a Drop-Dead Gorgeous Mate". The trick here is to give no indication that you are swooning over them for their looks.  Instead, feign (oops that was my word) an appreciation for their kind heart or integrity.  Don't let on that you landed them for their looks.  
<br />
<br /> The book rather implies that good looking and/or wealthy people are better specimens of humanity than the rest of us, although LL acknowledges that even beautiful people can have flaws.  She gives the example that you're with your ho-hum (read average looking) date when you spot an extremely attractive stranger who smiles at you and dines alone.  Well gosh dang it, you're stuck with a frog!  LL recommends you give all frogs (and frogettes) their hopping papers to free yourself up for "royals".  Frogs, according to the context of this book are anyone not rich enough, beautiful enough or otherwise not good enough for you.  LL uses a bit of evolutionary biology to justify gold digging and looks-ism, see page 2 "Bugs and Beasts Are Smarter When Choosing a Mate."  Afterall, animals choose mates based on looks and ability to bring food for the offspring.
<br />
<br />There's also a bizarre chapter on "How to Capture a Magical One-of-a-Kind Mate" which is basically a quirky artist type with unusual sexual habits.  Another seriously intended chapter I recommend only for entertainment value. 
<br />
<br />Ironically, after the chapter telling you how to pass yourself off as blue blood is the chapter, "How to Find an Honorable Mate," which preaches impeccable honesty at all times.  It's one of only two chapters that in my opinion give good dating advice, if taken in isolation from rest of the book.  The other bit of good advice is the section in the last chapter, "Be Careful What You Wish For (You Just Might Get It!).  Here she quotes studies showing that finding your rich or beautiful partner might not make you happier!  For instance, the former hippy chick who married a wealthy blue blood and lived in a mansion in the 'burbs with a maid, cook, and gardener.  With no job and nothing to do, she turned to alcohol and drugs.  Wow, so after writing a manual on gold digging and landing gorgeous people, LL tells you you might not want to be doing this after all!  A fine unintentionally comic ending for a dating book that belongs in the humor section.

                    <span>Silly me.  I actually expected to learn "how to date out of my league", being that the phrase was in the title. If you're looking for entertainment, by all means this is your book.  Informative?  No way.  What this really is, is "how to put yourself in someone else's league so you can get them". In a different nutshell:  spend as much or little money as you have to do nothing but make yourself *potentially* desirable, but even that's not guaranteed.  But that's not what's implied by the title.  You think I didn't know that I might have to put forth some effort?  I've read about a dozen other books that tell me that.  From this particular book, "UpDating", it seemed implied that Lowndes could explain how you could get a higher-league person with very little effort or change on your own part, at least that's what I was expecting.  Instead it's just another in the long line of "do this and you MIGHT have a chance with her" books.  Next...</span>

                    <span>Updating begins with common-sense tips from figuring out your own interests, personal preferences and direction in life, and then figuring out what kind of a partner would best complement your desired lifestyle and goals in life. 
<br />
<br />Leil then guides you through an overview of four different categories (classes) of people: good-looking, rich (classy), honorable, and one-of-a-kind (X-royals), with a small subsection of Triple-X Royals (one may say, "kinky to extreme" kind).  She has chosen these particular four based on the interest of majority of people who have attended her workshops.
<br />
<br />While characteristics of people in different categories may overlap to some extent, the characteristics are based on their predominant values, backgrounds, preferences, what can help you to establish rapport or what will turn them off and run in the opposite direction.
<br />
<br />I was delighted with the entire book, but felt particularly warm and fuzzy when I got to the X-royal delight (one-of-a-kind) people, as I read her amazingly accurate insights .</span>

                    <span>Updating isn't Leil Lowndes at her best. Its filled with very obvious "tips" and ideas. Some chapters are helpful, but a lot of it is out of date (even though the book is brand new!) or very nearsighted. An example is when the author refers to landing a "rich" mate, she only seems to write about the qualities "old money" seek. The chapter on confidence is good.  Some people may find Updating helpful, but unfortunately, I didn't. </span>

                    <span>I'm not ashamed to say I am an attractive woman with high class tastes. And I want a man a lot more cultivated than the "frogs," as the author calls them, that I've been dating. Reading this book doesn't guarantee that it will turn every frog into a Prince, but it sure will help guys please women they thought they could never get. I've shared the book with some girlfriends and they all agree.  <br>	In one part Lowndes tells you how to dress, how to furnish your home, how to talk to more refined people and even how to exude the quiet confidence that all women like. Read it and then call me!</span>
