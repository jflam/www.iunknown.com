                <span id="Label1">Software Product Management decodes the software product management process with an emphasis on coordinating the needs of stakeholders ranging from engineering, sales, and product support to technical writing and marketing. Based on real-world experience in managing the development of enterprise software, this book details how a team can work together smoothly to achieve their goal of releasing a superior software product on time.  <P>Instead of being a step-by-step cookbook that attempts to meet everyone&#146;s needs, the book guides managers to develop the framework appropriate for their organizations and company goals, understand the tradeoffs, and make the right decisions. The book also addresses the challenges of product management in a period of increased commoditization of software technology products. By providing a historical context for the evolution of today&#146;s software marketplace, it presents ideas for prospering in a still rapidly changing environment.  <P>Dispensing practical, usable information for experts and novices alike, Software Product Management is quickly becoming the go-to reference in the library of every product manager, programmer, CTO, and entrepreneur and anyone interested personally or professionally in software.</span>

                    <span>Having been in software for the last 20 years at Sun, Novell and Microsoft, I was at first a bit skeptical about this book. However, after reading it, I would highly recommend it to both novice and experienced software professionals - all the way from programmers to developers to marketers to sales to management. This is a great reference on how the whole process works and how you can add value. A must read for anyone in the software business.</span>

                    <span>This book offers no real insight for people who have been involved in the life cycle of either enterprise / "shrink wrapped" software. The book primarily deals with issues that would be common knowledge to most people who have worked in these roles for even a short period of time. It might have been better if the author had included real life scenarios of product management failures / successes and provided some sort of "analysis". Since this book provides neither depth nor breadth, I would classify this book as an utter disappointment.</span>

                    <span>I would say this book is a great look at software product management for professionals of all levels. The book stays true to its summary (see above) and is an overall great reference. Even though I have been a CTO for 6 years now, I found a lot in the book that was very useful. My staff also found the book very useful. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Having been in software and technology for the last 20 years at major software/technology companies, I feel somewhat qualified to write a review on a software book. I was extremely impressed with this book as it presented a first-rate look at the "real-world" side of taking a software idea all the way through sales. If you are involved in any aspect of software or technology, this book is a must read to identify ways to do your job better, and to understand the other aspects of the life-cycle and how to add value in those areas as well. A fantastick book-highly recommended.</span>
