                <span id="Label1">Mickey Williams's <i>Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 24 Hours</i> is a worthy addition to the Sams 24-hour series. In two dozen short and digestible sections, the author gives a "greatest hits" tour of some of the most important features in Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), along with what's new in Visual C++ 6. Along the way, this title also manages to review the basics of the C++ programming language.<p> Early lessons concentrate on building simple MFC programs using basic dialog box controls like buttons, edit controls, list boxes, and combo boxes. Using real code examples, the author moves to the basics of MFC document/view architecture (always a difficult topic to present clearly), menus, and Graphical Device Interface (GDI) graphics programming.<p> Williams then discusses several common controls (first introduced in Windows 95) for building more sophisticated user interfaces. The advanced section of this tutorial provides an introduction to viewing Dynamic HTML with MFC Web controls.  All in all, this group of tutorials is concise and extremely useful for anyone new to MFC control programming.<p> The book closes with some material on using dialog boxes as application windows (using form views) and the basics of targeting ActiveX controls within Visual C++ 6. It doesn't tell you everything there is to know (no mention of database classes or C++ templates), but if you want a quick introduction that covers some significant technical turf, you'll like this efficiently presented title. <i>-- Richard Dragan</i></span>

                    <span>Don't expect to learn to write general c++ code from this book. It focuses specifically on the MFC class and does a great job of that. Most programming courses don't teach anything about MFC, but in many cases, you are expected to know it for work or upper level programming courses. I have certainly picked up the basics from this book.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up to learn the Visual C++ IDE and this book does a fairly good job at that, while also giving an introduction to the MFC framework. The book attempts to teach the language, but it is more of a refresher for the very experienced, but rusty, C++ developer.<P>Each chapter takes about an hour to read, if you are an experienced C++ developer and if you do not try any of the examples, but make sure you read the Q&A sections at the end of each chapter because they contain some very valuable tips.<P>As for the examples, they mostly work, but there are a few errors and unclear explanations, which can make things very frustrating. Chapters 9 and 10 have the biggest problems.<P>Overall I liked this book and do recommend it if all you want to learn is the IDE and a little about the MFC. You will need an MFC companion. DO NOT EXPECT TO LEARN C++ FROM THIS BOOK.</span>

                    <span>I found this book a great help. Although I am an experienced C and C++ programmer I have previously found it difficult to get to grips with Microsoft Visual C++. Other books claiming an easy way have been superficial and omitted much detail. If other reviews have been critical of this book, perhaps it is because the subject is difficult. <P>The book gives a good balance between practical guidance on writing a Windows application with MSVC++, and explanation of the theory behind it. It briefly covers the C++ language itself, but is better suited to C++ programmers wishing to write for Windows. It uses the MFC method throughout and doesn't waste time on old-fashioned API methods. Of course the 24 hours are not consecutive, but I found that each of the 24 chapters takes about an hour as claimed, and this structure helps the reader to plan a manageable programme of learning the subject. It also serves as a useful reference book after completing the course.</span>
