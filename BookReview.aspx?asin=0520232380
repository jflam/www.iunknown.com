                <span id="Label1">In this landmark volume, Alison Brysk has assembled an impressive array of scholars to address new questions about globalization and human rights. Is globalization generating both problems and opportunities? Are new problems replacing or intensifying state repression? How effective are new forms of human rights accountability? These essays include theoretical analyses by Richard Falk, Jack Donnelly, and James Rosenau. Chapters on sex tourism, international markets, and communications technology bring new perspectives to emerging issues. The authors investigate places such as the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and the Philippines. The contemporary world is defined by globalization. While global human rights standards and institutions have been established, assaults on human dignity continue. These essays identify the new challenges to be faced, and suggest new ways to remedy the costs of globalization. 2 line illustrations, 14 tables</span>

                    <span>Alison Brysk is an Associate Professor at the University of California-Irvine. Eleven of Ms. Brysk's colleagues from academia have contributed outstanding original research to this book. Most of the authors are specialists in political science, women's studies, international law and related fields. The focus is on how human rights may become more or less secure as a result of globalization. The end result is a scholarly analysis of the contradictions of globalization that no doubt will give thoughtful readers much to consider.<P>The book is well-structured. Ms. Brysk contributes introductory and concluding essays that provides excellent context and analysis. In between, the main content is divided into four sections containing three articles each (except for the first section on "Citizenship" which has only two articles). There is also a forty-page bibliography for those who want to access the reference material.<P>I found the first section on "Citizenship" to be one of the best in the book. Kristen Hill Maher argues in the first essay that the demand for cheap labor in the U.S. and Europe fosters a kind of "neocolonialism" that has negative implications for the rights of "illegal" workers, their families, and society. The second article by Amalia Lucia Cabezas addresses the topic of sex tourism in the Dominican Republic. The essay descends from a high-level perspective of corporate domination of trade, economics and the tourist industry down to the realities of the exploited male and female workers who often turn to sex to augment their meager incomes. Interestingly, Ms. Cabezas shows how resourcefulness has enabled these workers to become empowered in the face of long-standing cultural prejudices and gaining respect and upward mobility for a few.<P>The second section on the topic of "Commodification" discusses global markets. The failures of "globalization from above" are criticized by Richard Falk, who contends that a more humane form of capitalism that benefits people can only come about by harnessing democratic forces to create a "globalization from below." One of the many discoveries from Wesley T. Milner's statistical study is that increased economic freedom leads to an increase in inequality and hence has a negative effect on "subsistence rights" for people in poor countries. And Raul C. Pangalangan believes that international labor standards are needed to combat the sweatshop conditions that are conspicuous in nations that are managed by corrupt rulers who have effectively sold-out for private gain.<P>The third section addresses "Communication". Shane Weyker discusses how the Internet and other forms of electronic communications have aided some struggles (such as the Zapatistas in southern Mexico) but is also frequently used by the powerful for the purposes of surveillance and disinformation. Clifford Bob studies the dynamics that might cause some groups to receive favorable coverage (such as Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni tribe's conflict with Shell Corporation in Nigeria) and others to go almost unnoticed. James N. Rosenau's article is a highly specialized piece of research that assesses the impact of globalization on security rights, economic rights, cultural rights and political rights. <P>The fourth section is on the subject of "Cooperation." Jonathan Fox's study of the World Bank's Inspection Panel discusses the panel's mixed record of success but nevertheless argues that its existence is testimony to the power of people to effect institutional change. Wayne Sandholtz shows that cross-border military interventions continue to be justified on "security" concerns (not humanitarian), although there is hope that international law might soon recognize humanitarianism as a just cause. Jack Donnelly's "Human Rights, Globalizing Flows, and State Power" was especially appealing. Mr. Donnelly takes the almost unfashionable position of reasserting the value of the nation-state. The current trend of allowing multinational corporations to undermine the social fabric is effectively impoverishing the workers and polarizing class relations. While recognizing past abuses of state power, the author argues that only the state has the means to redistribute wealth in a manner that ensures human rights and the long-term viability of the society. <P>In short, this book should intrigue graduate students, professionals and others who have a keen interest in human rights. It is full of nuanced discussions written by some of the leading subject matter experts and will challenge and stimulate demanding readers. I congratulate Ms. Brysk on her project and highly recommend this book.</span>
