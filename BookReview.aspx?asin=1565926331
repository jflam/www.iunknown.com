                    <span>Within a week of my diagnosis of colon cancer, I had this book, along with "What to Do If You Get Colon Cancer" by Paul Miskovitz and Marian Betancourt, in hand. Together they provided critical information on the illness, on finding a surgeon and what questions to ask about treatment. While recovering from surgery, and now in the early stages of chemotherapy, I have kept these books by my side to guide me step-by-step. Information is presented clearly and compassionately, so that I know what might be expected as I progress through treatment. Without these guides, I would be muddling through instead of being able to take charge of my illness. They are invaluable!</span>

                    <span>I was recently diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer stage 3 and looked for a single specific reference. I thought this book was excellent. I am a medical doctor with a specific background in critically assessing medical evidence but learned of a lot of resources I had not been aware of, including cancer question list servers etc. I would buy it as early on in your treatment as possible -, things like choice of treatment center, surgeon, pre vs post surgery radiation are all things to try to become knowledgeable about as early on as possible. I think the tone of the book is exactly right, combining technical and lots of humane/quality of life advice (including how to talk with friends and younger family members) . My spouse who is a teacher but has no clinical background has also found the book excellent in answering her questions. I feel Lorraine Johnston has performed a real public service. Good luck to any patients and family, this book will definitely help you give quality survival its best chance!</span>

                    <span>After being diagnosed with colon cancer, I started my research by reading books on the subject.<P>I found this book was well wriiten, but seem to focus more on explaining the disease for family or somebody wanting to provide support for a person with colon cancer. In this respect, it does a good job in explaining the disease and giving points to consider, i.e., the type of hospital, the way to reference doctors, etc.<P>The book did not fit what I was looking for. I wanted a more technical explanation about the disease and what to expect during the operation and post-operative period. I did not get that comfort level from this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is designed for the newly diagnosed patient with colon/rectal cancer. My mother is in this position, so I just read this book. It answered just about every question imaginable,in easy-to-understand language. It is a very comprehensive, thorough, up-to-date resource.It is set up in an easy-to-follow format. It has an outstanding appendix with tons of information, including how to further research this illness. It gives dozens of web sites for the patient/family to explore fully all of their options. It even has a cardboard fold-out booklet to keep medical notes in as treatments proceed. Just about the only thing it doesn't address in full are ways to make the patient more comfortable during chemo, etc. but it does refer to many other books that cover additional topics.</span>
