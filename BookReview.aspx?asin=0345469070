                    <span>This book was very easy to read for me because I kept thinking all of this juicy stuff was going to happen.  The storyline I expected to materialize never did.  The ending was a big let down for me.  I understand the author needed to glorify fireman but it seems like she could have done that and added a little spice to the storyline.  I am really disappointed; although I must say the writing was very good.</span>

                    <span>How elegant and powerful the words flow.  How passionate the meaning of life becomes through the words written in this magnificent novel of God's merciful grace and that wonderful undeniable unseen strength we call faith! I found courage through this novel to "Fan the Flames" when life throws me a curve! Your words are absolutely beautiful and intoxicating through visual consumption as you leave the reader craving   each word. I've read all of Parry's books to date and I have not been disappointed yet.

                    <span>This was one emotional ride!
<br />Between the dangerous pranks that kept happening on the "C' shift and the emotional ride into the lives of Jerome, Lloyd and Andrew I was holding my breath!  I never knew what was coming next and the thought of any of the characters dying left me on the edge of my seat. I found it very emotional when Jerome's wife got hurt. The letters from the  Firefighters in the back of the book were touching. This story is snappy and full of wit. It was well balanced between emotions and spice. 
<br />Fannin' the Flames was a 4 alarm fire of emotions.  Captivating.

                    <span>This is a book that every avid AA reader should have on their bookshelf.This book made me go through all different types of emotions. The relationship between Nicolle and Jerome was a beautiful one that was definitely joined by GOD. They reminded me of my husband and I. I really felt like these characters were real. I felt like I was lost and also EbonySatin taught me a few things about firefighters that you never really think about. Like for one they are not fighting three alarm fires all the time but are mostly taking car accident calls as well as health calls. Even though I work in health care I never really thought about it. I learned other very important facts and history as well. But GO BUY THIS BOOK AND SEE WHAT PARRY BROWN IS UP TO.....I see why Parry Brown is a motivational speaker because she has motivated me with each book that she has written.</span>

                    <span>It's a good book.  The one thing I love about Parry Brown's books is that she has such positive strong black males.  And Fannin the Flames is no exception.  Meet Capt. Lloyd Frederickson and Jerome Winters, two firefighters with the L.A. County Fire Department Station 27's C-Shift.  The C-Shift, comprised of all minorities, is experiencing pranks of sorts believed to be racially motivated.  As if that isn't enough both men, who think they have perfect marriages, find themselves fighting for them.  Lloyd's wife of thirty years tells him she wants a divorce.  And Jerome's wife is involved in a very bad car accident, leaving him to care for himself, their children and home.  To make matters worse, the pranks during the C-Shift are getting more serious and dangerous.  Can they find the prankster before it's too late?  Will Lloyd and Jerome be able to save their marriages?  As a bonus we get an update on the Naylor sisters of Sittin in the Front Pew, as Glynda plays a role in getting to the bottom of the trouble at the station house.</span>
