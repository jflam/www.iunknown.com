                <span id="Label1"><br><b>The HOTTEST Guide yet to the mysteries of Harry Potter</b>  <P><b>Secrets & clues revealed!</b>  <P>This Guide, extremely popular the last two years with Harry Potter fans everywhere, is your key tool for developing the skills needed to sleuth those important clues, themes, and running bits.  By recognizing these hints, you'll have even more fun predicting what is yet to come.  While the world awaits the release of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, JK Rowling has teased that her clues lie right before fans' eyes--or between their fingers.  The trail is marked for books 6 and 7, but do you know where to look?   <P>Waters&#146; presents her detailed hunt for clues in an interesting and provocative, yet fun-to-read manner.  With this Guide in one hand and the Harry Potter books in the other, you&#146;ll: <ul><li>read the Harry Potter series in a whole new light, delving below the surface to ferret out those sly clues buried by the cunning JK Rowling,<BR><li>understand better why the Harry Potter mysteries have captured such a phenomenal world-wide following as you uncover the detail to which Ms. Rowling has crafted her story and her world,<BR><li>amaze at how deceptively she&#146;s hidden those clues,<BR><li>discover new ones on your own!</ul>  <P>Wizarding World Press has attracted quite a following, which started with this Guide&#151;the most popular book to analyze the clues and mysteries hidden within the Harry Potter series.  Discover it for yourself.  <P><i>The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter</i> is for you if: <ul><li>You&#146;re new to the series and want to know what all the hubbub is about (and want to start with the best and most complete book available for capturing the themes, clues, and future possibilities).  Get all your theories in one place here.<BR><li>You&#146;re new to book 5 and would like to better understand what has come before.  Read the Guide first, then pick out those clues in <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> on your own.<BR><li>You&#146;ve read all the books, but it&#146;s been a while.  Refresh your memory and tighten your skills before book 6 is released so that you&#146;ll be prepared to fully appreciate your first read-through of <i>The Half-Blood Prince</i> and discover more clues on your own.</ul>  <P><b>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</b>  <P><b>HERE&#146;S A TASTE OF WHAT&#146;S IN THE BOOK... </b> What secrets do Neville and Professor Snape hold?  <P>Did you understand exactly how Dumbledore's "Mirror of Erised" worked?  <P>Are you aware that what Harry saw in the Mirror was not accurate?  <P>Do you know how to solve Snape's poison bottle puzzle in the room "through the trapdoor?"  <P>Did you know there are actually 2 solutions to that puzzle?  "In chapter 16 of Book 1, J.K. Rowling writes that Harry 'watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.' Even after reading the book several times, it still catches readers by surprise when they realize that this note was the message used to trick Headmaster Dumbledore into leaving the school for a trip to London. That clue doesn't help us solve the plot of the book and it was never explained or mentioned again, but when we then see a similar clue in Book 4, we need to pay much closer attention! Look for yourself - it's awesome!"   <P><b>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</b>  <P>This Guide takes the pain out of the wait for <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>!  <P>Don't be left out. See for yourself what everyone is excited about.  <P><b>Note</b>:  <i>The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter</i> is best read alongside JK Rowling&#146;s books&#151;not as a replacement (then where&#146;s the fun &#61514;?).  It does not give the plot away in advance, but there <b>IS</b> a spoiler warning because it discusses the endings of each of the books in chronological order.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a Harry Potter fanatic; I just like the books and the movies (and the actors and the author and the characters and the plot...)This book was a great guide for hidden clues, plot predictions (Divination for books?) and "I-didn't-think-of-that"s. If that's what you're looking for, then this is perfect for you. But if you want the absolute facts, you might want to wait for J.K.R.'s own guide. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes what you infer from this book can sound outrageous (Lily Potter a Slytherin? Lily's related to Dumbledore?)and sometimes the author goes of on tangents about a tiny insignificant clue (or so we think), but the rest are based on evidence carefuly gathered from the books and J.K.R.'s interviews. 
<br />
<br />A note: This book covers books 1-4 only. The "New Clues" book is for book 5 and is a hints only guide (it doesn't tell you exactly what the clues mean). I bought both and think it was well worth the money, but this is something to keep in mind. 
<br />
<br />All in all, this book and its companion are a must for every semi-serious to serious HP fan. </span>

                    <span>I loved this book.  It had a wealth of information and great analysis.  It was filled with a lot of interpretation and great insight.  I would rate this book from a scale of 1 to 5, I give it a 6.  I had my relatives read the book and they loved it too.   It must be part of a Harry Potter fan's library.  I wouldn't  leave my library with out it.  The price is worth the money and it's a great book to own.  Go out and buy this!!!!  Great JOB Wizarding  World Press!!!  A++++++</span>

                    <span>Being a fairly new fan to the Harry Potter world, I received this book as Christmas present. I was interested at the idea, but not nearly as interested as I would become once I started reading. 
<br />
<br />I believe that the reading level is easy enough to understand for 8-12 year olds, but I'm 23 and I had such a great time reading this book. The book molds to its reader as each person gets what he or she would want out of it. I found the mysteries enticing and proceeded to do my own research on backgrounds of names, places, mythological references... just so I could solve more of the puzzles JKR has so coyly laced her books with.
<br />
<br />I loved the book so much I bought it for my 13 year old niece and she can't get enough of it, either!
<br />
<br />I think some of the people who give the book negative reviews were disappointed in the clues discussed and that analysis of the book because they are so well informed.  Sure... if you spend a few hours every day discussing theories on a Harry Potter chat board you're bound to say "well duh... I already knew that". But honestly, for the rest of us who are just discovering the mysteries of Harry Potter, this book is a revelation.
<br />
<br />A compliment to the authors: despite any criticism, you did a fantastic job of taking complex theories, ideas, and clues and putting them in one collaborative book for everyone to enjoy.
<br />
<br />A note to the bloggers (as I am one myself): come on, you've got to respect that this book was published in January of 2003. Most of the theories or "unoriginal ideas" of The Guide have only been discussed and analyzed within the past year and a half which gives this book a pretty good lead on the market.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book because of its remarkable insight, humorous sarcasm, and immeasurable thoroughness.</span>
