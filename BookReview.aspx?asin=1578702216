                <span id="Label1">Microsoft COM is prevalent throughout Windows operating systems--95, 98, NT. To build applications which interface with Windows systems, therefore, programmers must understand and learn to use COM. This book will lay the groundwork for understanding COM, and focus on how to develop applications in Delphi which interact efficiently with Windows systems. The book will include coverage of DCOM, Microsoft's distributed architecture which is based on COM. It will also cover the latest developments in Delphi 5, currently due out in September 1999.This book will teach COM programming to Delphi 4 and 5 programmers. After providing an understanding of the COM framework, it offers a practical exploration of COM to enable Delphi developers to program component-based applications. Typical real-world scenarios, such as Windows Shell programming, automating Microsoft Agent, and creating and using ActiveX controls, will be explored. Discussion of each topic will be illustrated with detailed examples.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is not worth buying, because there are too many features that was just left off by the author, using always the same excuse: "Well, this feature is not commonly used, so I won't disscuss it any further in this book". Besides that, it gives you a big averall coverage of COM. If you want to go to the inners of COM, this book is not for you. It was not for me.</span>

                    <span>Um livro importantíssimo para aqueles que querem utilizar todas as potencialidades da programação baseada em COM/DCOM. A introdução ao ADO é bem feita, e com um exemplo muito prático e elucidativo. Apesar dos poucos erros em alguns códigos, o livro é muito bem escrito, sintético e didático. Eu o recomendo. Programadores em Delphi do Brasil, leiam este livro!</span>

                    <span>This book has already added several nuclear warheads to my programming arsenal. It explained many concepts I have struggled with in a very explicit manner. There is a severe problem with this book however. I have already found errors in the code examples that have hindered my learning. The top code example on page 24, and on page 26 are good examples.      On page 24, TObject was not typecasted as a TFormattedInteger and thus could not be casted "AS" an IFormattedNumber. It generated the compiler error described on page 25 even though I had a GUID declared in the IFormattedNumber interface.      On page 26, MyInteger is incorrectly declared as a IFormattedInteger, even though no such Interface is declared in any of his other examples.    I do not want to belittle this excellent book however. I just simply cannot give a book with these types of errors 5 stars when the writer obviously did not test every example he presents. It is definately still worth buying. I even suggest buying this in tandem with "Delphi4 Unleashed" by Charley Calvert because that book explains COM/Interfaces a little differently and can help you get the concepts faster by filling in some of the gaps. Hope this helps. Curtis S. Lead Programmer/Analyst Insurance Technologies Corp.</span>

                    <span>I find the book usefull for writing COM objects with delphi. This the only book I find at amazon writing COM objects with delphi. But I have a  question about writing DCOM objects. At page 299 under the title  "Creating DCOM client". The author says us to import  DCOMServer.tlb type library. But I cannot find this on neither my machineor  anywhere else. Is it a standart Type library? It will be very good if you  ilimunate us for this. Thanks You.</span>
