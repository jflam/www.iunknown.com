                    <span>As an author and professional speaker on marketing, I've recommended this book for years. It provides more specifics and sound advice for novice and experienced marketers on direct response advertising than anything else I've seen. It provides good fuel to test an ad agency's stuff-- especially those that say things like "oh, you can't track that..." I've re-read this book probably 20 times -- and you should too if you really want to improve the results of your advertising.</span>

                    <span>It is so good because Caples was in the mail order advertising business for forty-something years, and that's one of the few kinds of advertising that gets real feedback. Ads can be tested and the results can be compared. So Caples gives you FACTS rather than opinions about what works in advertising. <P>The book is very informative and also very interesting because Caples will show you two examples of ads he ran as a split-run and says "one sold three times more than the other; can you guess which one?" Then he'll tell you, and tell you WHY. <P>Not only that, but the book is extremely readable. I'm the author of Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on putting the most useful information into a readable form, and this book is as good as it gets. As David Ogilvy says in the introduction, "This is, without a doubt, the most USEFUL book about advertising that I have ever read." No more endorsement than that is needed!</span>

                    <span>This book is the best book on marketing that I have ever seen! You know, I think this book provided with me the same stuff that would cost me 5000+ dollars to have some "marketing guru" to tell me the secrets of advertising. This book is literally a gold mine! I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to motivated people with this pen. Read it today!<P>Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated</span>

                    <span>First read Claude Hopkins's "Scientifc Advertising," then read this. Any modern-day advertisers and copywriters who don't follow the teachings of Caples and Hopkins are doomed to failure.<P>Caples picked up where Hopkins left off, expanding upon Hopkins's work and breaking new ground with his work. Far too many advertisers today fail to heed the advice of Caples and it shows both in their advertisng and the results they achieve. <P>"Tested Advertisng Methods," together with "Scientific Advertising," form the Bible of Advertising. If you are a serious student of advertising and/or copywriting, this has to be on your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>This book is a jewel that every marketer or member of an ad agency should have as a reference. It does not lose time in trying to be creative. It's quite the opposite, with the author defending what he defines as "scientific" advertising, the type of advertising that wins sales as opposed to ad awards. It provides clear explanations on concepts of written copy and tests every different type of ad you can imagine - short copy x long copy, ads with picture x ads without picture, etc - to provide the reader with a quite good idea on the types of ads that really work in generating sales.<P>The only caveat of this book: it does not mention techniques that work better in radio and TV.</span>
