                <span id="Label1"><div><b>A deeply affecting memoir about the bond between two sisters&#8212;and the 150 pounds that nearly separated them</b><br><br>As young girls, a year apart in age, Alison and Amy Wilensky were almost indistinguishable. And they were inseparable: growing up in a comfortable Boston suburb, they were never far from each other&#8217;s side, wearing matching dresses, playing the same games, eating the same food. But Alison began gaining weight in elementary school and by the time she was sixteen was morbidly obese. The sisters remained close, but over the years the daily indignities and affronts endured by Alison took their toll, reshaping her identity indelibly and affecting the sisters&#8217; relationship in unanticipated ways.<br><br>In her late twenties, Alison underwent gastric bypass surgery, in the wake of which she lost more than 150 pounds and achieved the shape she&#8217;d dreamed of for so much of her life. It wasn&#8217;t just her body that was transformed: every significant relationship in her life was profoundly altered. <br><br><i>The Weight of It </i>is a universal story of how we discover what makes us who we are, and how we become the people we want to be. Amy Wilensky is uniquely equipped to write this book, and she does so with fine perception, insight, and compassion. <br><br></div></span>

                    <span>The story about how a woman goes from being morbidly obese to being a normal weight is a story all by itself. Growing up increasingly overweight, deciding in her twenties to undergo surgery, and how she coped with her new body would have made a fascinating story alone. But Amy Wilensky has not written a biography of her sister, who lost the weight, but a memoir about two sisters and their family. This makes The Weight of It a more engaging story and broadens its appeal.<P>Like most Americans, I should lose some weight and like most American women, I have worried about this nearly every day since I was about eleven years old (I grew up before girls popped out of the womb obsessing about their weight). But I would not have read the book if it had been about the weight only. The sisters and how they grew up together and grew apart was what intrigued me.<P>I enjoyed Amy Wilensky's descriptions of two sisters playing and fighting, how they enjoyed collaborating on cooking projects, about how the older sister was cautious and prudent, and the younger sister exuberant and creative.<P>Amy's apparent admiration for and exasperation with her sister comes through and sounds genuine. The writing is mostly direct and believable. Only a few times does Wilensky get bogged down in overly philosphical musings. The story speaks for itself and doesn't need a voice-over telling you what lessons you should draw from it. The description of Alison's Alice in Wonderland party near the end is a great conclusion to an ultimately upbeat book.</span>

                    <span>I am buying copies for all of my friends! The Weight of It is simply a beautifully written book that was difficult to put down. Wilensky examines herself, her family and her loving, imperfect relationship with her sister in a voice that is compelling, funny and fiercely smart. The author's exploration of her sibling relationship is flawed, complex and heartfelt, just as any balanced examination of a such a relationship must be. The story is peppered with poignant thoughts and facts about obesity, prejudice, gastric bypass surgery, sisterhood and identity. Throughout the book, Wilensky drives home an interesting, sad truth; obesity, like alcaholism, affects the entire family. After reading this book, I have more compassion for both the overweight and their families, and I know more about gastric bypass surgery as well. Any person who has struggled with his or her own weight, or who has pondered the causes and effects of obesity, will find this book fascinating.</span>

                    <span>Amy's sister Alison certainly sounds like a person that would be fascinating to know...immensely creative, complicated and colorful. I enjoyed reading about her very much. However, the subject of her weight gain and loss is not nearly enough to carry this book. It might have been, if she herself had written the book, but reading about someone's else's weight issues from a sister's perspective is not, frankly, that interesting. I'm not saying that Amy Wilensky is not a skilled writer, for she certainly is, and I loved a lot of the little details included here, but I think she would have done better to write a general family memoir or a portrait of her sister overall.<P>I also found upon finishing the book that I didn't really completely get her perspective and feelings about her sister pinned down. The book starts with a scene on an airplane where her sister Alison is portroyed quite negatively, and scattered throughout the book are other scenes like this. Sometimes they seem to be out of the narrative flow and I am not sure why they are included in the way they are...they seem a little mean-spirited alongside the more balanced parts of her characterization of Alison. I think perhaps Amy's feelings are still a bit in flux about her sister, and this book may have been better written with the perspective of a few more years.<P>I would not discourage buying or reading this book, and in fact I am quite eager to read Amy's other book, Passing for Normal, but I would not buy it if you are mainly interesting in reading about weight issues or weight loss surgery.</span>

                    <span>As a memoir, I got that Amy was writing about HER experience, and her own identity in relation to her sister. But somehow, I still needed to see more about her sister, Alison. I read the book jacket again after I finished the book, and ultimately I think it missed the mark: the jacket writes about the stranger that Alison became post-op, but its hardly what was covered in the book. Indeed, we learn very little about Alison at all, and Amy appears guarded in discussing the relationship, almost clinical in her description of their relationship. There are some strong moments, but very little tenderness, and a lot of the drama falls flat.</span>

                    <span>After having read Passing for Normal, Wilensky's first book, I was delighted to see she had another on the shelves! She is a terrific writer with a knack for getting at the heart of family (in this case sibling) relationships. This book takes the reader through the twists and turns of sibling rivalry, jealousy and love in a very thoughtful and refreshing way.</span>
