                <span id="Label1">Ed Bott and Carl Siechert have combined their considerable talents for producing user-level documentation in creating <I>Microsoft Windows XP Inside Out</I>. One of the most carefully researched books on Windows XP to date, this large volume has all the information and procedures most everyday users of the operating system will want. With its nicely formatted how-to instructions, detailed documentation of command-line commands, intelligent explanatory text, and broad scope, this book makes a great reference for a family or business that uses Windows XP extensively. Even the illustrations are more helpful than usual, largely because the publisher has gone to the trouble of annotating many of them with pointers and labels.<p>  Bott and Siechert deal with the most controversial features of Windows XP, notably product activation, in a straightforward way. They simply explain what activation is for, tell how to go about it, and move on. If you're a power user interested in getting around activation and performing other unsanctioned hacks, look for your information in online newsletters. This book plays by Microsoft's rules, and that's fine. It's obvious that the authors have had access to Windows XP for some time, and spent a lot of time exploring its new features. Count on this book to explain the complete set of Windows XP's features--even the exciting networking stuff--in terms you can easily follow. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Microsoft Windows XP (Professional and Home editions) for home and office users who want to install, use, and run applications. Emphasis is on basic set-up and configuration, hardware installation and modification, file management, multimedia, and networking.</span>

                    <span>This Microsoft Press reference book is a tome and over kill for the casual user. But if you really want to learn how to use the very best of XP this is the standard, the premier, it is the definitive guide. XP Inside Out is an appropriate title. My first Windows user's manual was measured in ounces and a hundred plus pages. XP is over 1200 pages and almost 7 pounds. You need wheels to go desk to desk with it. You can take it to bed, it's bigger than your pillow. You can soak it in paraffin to make a Yule log. But it's this size that creates the very best topical layout, reference, and index that I have yet seen by Microsoft. Users can actually trace error messages to their plain English explanation and suggested solutions - a first for Microsoft. Authors Halverson, and Young, Microsoft "employees," have produced a superb reference tool for power users, developers, system designers, software instructors, consultants, and CIOs. If you want to know anything about XP, use this book. It is suitable for (interested) users 12 years of age to professional software and hardware systems experts. That's quite a span and good technical writing, editing, and layout is responsible. But there is more. The book includes a full text and illustrated e-book version on CD (40 MB on your hard drive and running with MS Internet Explorer or Netscape). That's worth the cost of the book by itself because standard XP search, find, and print tools can be used to navigate the 1,400 pages instantly. It's worth the Amazon.com price, no reservations by this reviewer.</span>

                    <span>I have intermediate experience using previous versions of Windows (2000, NT, and 9x). I am beginning to work with XP Professional. I purchased this book because of the volume of information contained within the pages as well as on CDROM. There are several bonus chapters on the CD. I use this book as a reference manual for times in which I cannot figure something out on my own. This text seems to be very accurate. It is highly readable and has useful tips for those who want a cursory overview of a topic, and it has more in depth analysis if you want more detailed discussion on a topic. As far as computer books go, this one has been quite useful.</span>

                    <span>After installing Windows XP I began to ask several question about the configuration and administration of the operating system. I found this book to have the answers and much, much more information for me. I also found that this 1250 page reference manual is very useful in studying for the Windows XP Professional Exam, 70-270.<P>Published by the company that produced the software, this book is broken down into 9 parts, with part 1 being the XP Overview of installing, configuring, deploying, moving files and components. Also covered here is accounts, permissions, policies, passwords and troubleshooting hardware.<P>Part 2 is the customization of XP with task scheduling, power management which includes hibernation. Part 3 is the explorer which has areas like managing and finding files, encryption and offline work covered. Part 4 is the digital media section which includes the media player, scanner and imaging.<P>Part 5 is the advanced IE area including internet security, customizing Outlook express, web hosting and communications. Part 6 the goes into system maintenance and recovery, which tackles topics like routing and disk management, troubleshooting errors messages and regedit.<P>Part 7 is the networking part talking about small to large networks, sharing resources and remote access. Part 8 teaches about system administration with topics like profiles and policies and the even viewer. Finally part 9 is the Appendices which include the command prompt. MMC, services and system information.<P>The cd-rom included has a number of utilities and tools and you need to have XP installed in order to run the cd. Also include the e-book of the book and overall an excellent manual to have on hand.</span>

                    <span>For Windows XP coverage it is very good. The book is very well documented. What you'll find in the 1200 pages is nearly everything you want to know about the OS. Having worked with XP for over 2 years, I am finding new things out everyday. I was pleasantly surprised to see that these authors have gone to great lengths to make the understanding of the OS not as a complex as it seems. The book also has a cd included and an e-book. I think the overall value comes from the fact that the book covers a wide range of topics and is detailed and well documented. I also recommend Windows Server 2003 Inside Out which has quickly become my most valued server reference.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a phonebook-sized volume with the words "Windows XP" printed on the cover, this one is for you. But there are more focused, more detailed, and far more useful books out there. Don't let all the shill reviews here fool you; Windows XP Inside/Out is yet another weak Microsoft in-house effort, used as nothing more than a pretense and an excuse at the lack of real support from this software behemoth. 1300 pages of you-probably-already-know-this information, and virtually no substantial coverage of the registry, scripting, networking, or security. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.</span>
