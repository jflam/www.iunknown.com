                <span id="Label1">Your class library works, but could it be better?  <I>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</I> shows how <I>refactoring</I> can make object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.<p> Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about <I>Refactoring</I> is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and UML.) <p> Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the "smell" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 "refactorings"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and "after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research.<p> Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, <I>Refactoring</I> is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p><B>Topics Covered:</B> Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools.</span>

                    <span>Some of the reviews here have focused on this book as a way of learning coding techniques for refactoring. Other reviews have focused on refactoring being another term for what they have already being doing. While learning some new coding techniques might be a side effect of reading this book, the real value of this book is descibing a process and terminology for facilitating refactoring - something that many developers have done on an ad-hoc basis for years. It has been invaluable in broadening the acceptability of refactoring, an activity that was often dismissed as not being a good use of development resources time. It also gives a vocabulary for discussing refactoring rather than relying on engineers own adhoc practices. And there's probably a few refactoring techniques that won't seem obvious.
<br />
<br />For C# users,  you may wish to look at NUnit.org for a .Net version of the JUnit software mentioned in the book.

                    <span>Although this book has been around for a few years now, the technique that Fowler names "Refactoring" is as old as programming.  I've been doing refactoring for the twelve years I've been a professional programmer, often to the chagrin of my supervisors; they often seemed to subscribe to the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality.  Yet I could always tell that the code *was* broken, even if it didn't appear that way when the product was used.  I was beginning to suspect that I was the only one who saw this, and then I read this book - written by an eminent researcher in the field and one of the brightest people to ever put pen to paper.
<br />
<br />By giving a name to the technique, it can be talked about in planning/design meetings, discussed as a best practice, measured, and demonstrated.  But Fowler takes it much further - he gives names to common refactoring techniques as well as what he calls "bad smells", or signs that you need to refactor.  ("Speculative generality", for example - a perfect name for an annoying tendency of the 10,000-foot architects).
<br />
<br />This book is well-researched and well thought out, and is a must-read for anybody who's serious about software development.  It's principal value is in providing common terminology for common actions, in addition to good justifications for each refactoring.</span>

                    <span>It doesn't happen often that I finish a book within 2 days. This time it is because there is surprisingly little new stuff for experienced programmers. It is well written and probably of use for beginning programmers, but as I went through the refactoring patterns, I kept saying to myself: "yes of course, I do that all the time.., where are the flashes of new insight?".</span>

                    <span>I'm surprised with the high Refactoring's Rating. I've read GoF Design Patterns and Fowler Refactoring is not able to reach the experience. Is simplistic, don't give you nothing new on OO programming, and don't have the category to became a classic.
<br />Perphaps I'm not a great programmer (who knows...) but the Refactoring's seems a child story. I'm sorry, many people talked amazing things of Fowler UML distilled. Perhaps, but this is not the case.
<br />For middle brained, s quarter of programmer, I don't recommend the book. Only if you're interested in something like "which're the refactorings (intuitive) algorithms to implement in some place" try it.</span>
