                    <span>I read this book as a first year grad student studying journalism. It's an interesting read - probably the only book I read that whole semester that I actually liked. It leaves the reader with a sense of purpose and commitment to the craft of journalism. 
<br />
<br />Then I went out and start reporting in the real world. I immediately realized "Elements of Journalism" is hopelessly idealistic. The book has a great vision for where the profession should be, but no suggestions on how to get there. </span>

                    <span>For my journalism class, I had to choose a book of merit about the media. "The Elements of Journalism" doesn't disappoint. This book takes the form of an instructional guide in that its objective does tell what journalists should be doing in order to create an effective press and what the public should expect from it. I find "The Elements of Journalism" to be of great use since it outlines what every budding journalist should follow to maintain ethics, objectivity, and truth in their work. It even describes man's history with the need for communication and a briefing of journalism's role in history. The book is written with clarity and the topics flow together. I also noticed that Kovach and Rosentiel developed many "theories" of the media-which all seem true too.
<br />
<br />What will always stay with me is the "The Theory of the Interlocking Public"-that states that everyone has an interest and is an expert in something. We need to be knowledgeable about the realistic description of how people interact with the news in order to present information as accurately as possible so that an individual group is not drawn to an article but a WHOLE variety of people depending on their level of knowledge about the world. Good journalism targets each level. I always remember this while writing an article for the paper. 
<br />
<br />As for what citizens should expect from the press, I admired the quote "The marketplace fails if we as citizens are passive, willing to put up with a diminishing product because we have no alternative. It works only if we act with a voice and a reason." It basically means that the purpose of a press (to convey the information that people need to be sovereign) will deteriorate if the people don't take action and speak up in what they believe in and hold true. 
<br />
<br />And, I can go on and on....because this book is so full of insightful information. I recommend it for anybody interested in the workings of the media.</span>

                    <span>The newspaper I work for has been going through some major renovations to reclaim readers, offering them a product that they want - that they can't live without. This book gives another side of the same story, focusing on the principles that journalists must keep in order to survive on into the 21st century with their integrity intact. I am a sub-editor and will be strongly recommending this book to all of our senior staff, including those in non-writing departments.</span>

                    <span>If you are a reporter, an editor, a source, a media-critic or just want to be more informed about the people informing you -- buy this slim little treasure trove of clear, well-written prose.<p>It is remarkable for its honest portrait of American journalism circa the New Millenium. It is designed to be a primer for citizens, journalists and journalism students in the issues surrounding:<p>1)Ethics<br>2)Commercial Pressures<br>3)Techniques<br>4)The Future<p>And unlike most media-critic books, this one doesn't have a political chip on its shoulder. Nor does it take an arrogant tone, despite it's axiomatic nature (to paraphrase Carl Sessions Stepp). <p>It's actually a pretty humble assesment by two people who care a lot about journalism.</span>

                    <span>Did you ever give much thought to the "unbiased" nature of journalism? Or about "balanced coverage" in articles and newscasts?  Well, Kovach and Rosenstiel certainly have -- and their thoughts on these concepts are nothing short of revolutionary.  <p>1.  The authors argue that by nature, journalists are biased -- and that this is ok.  <p>2.  They also claim that "balanced coverage" is unfair, and should  not be a goal of journalism.<p>Sounds crazy, right?  At first blush, yes; but by clearly delineating what journalists SHOULD do, the authors make a strong argument that "bias" and "balance" are misused terms that ought to be discarded.<p>For example, they say that requiring journalists to be unbiased is unnatural, for bias is part of human nature -- and professional journalists should not be required to forget who they are.  Instead, journalists should maintain an *independence* from those they cover, so that they are not unduly influenced by people they interview -- even if they do agree with them.<p>Likewise, they argue that "balance" should not be a tenet of journalism, because not all voices deserve equal time.  The authors instead suggest keeping the news "comprehensive and proportional," so that the time allotted to various parties in an issue is proportional to their role or importance in that issue.<p>And so, perhaps Kovach and Rosenstiel aren't so crazy, after all.  In fact, the book is full of sensible arguments like these, making it a fascinating read; what I've discussed here is only the tip of the iceberg.  <p>I highly recommend it!</span>
