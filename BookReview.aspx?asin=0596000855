                <span id="Label1">Completely revised and improved, the second edition of <I>Programming Python</I> is an excellent compendium of material geared toward the more knowledgeable Python developer. It includes dozens of reusable scripts for common scripting tasks, and is one of the best available sources of information for this popular object-oriented scripting language.<p>  In over 1,200 pages of material, this book offers an extremely comprehensive guide to Python development. Though his book is densely packed with information, Mark Lutz is a lively and witty writer whose focus is on getting things done using the natural strengths of the Python language. To that end, after an introduction and history of the language, the book shows how to use Python for performing automated tasks with files and directories (for example, for doing backups both locally and on Web servers). Not only will this book teach you more about Python, but it will also give you a library of code that you can use as is or adapt for your own projects.<p>  The text covers every conceivable facet of Python and the language's support for networking, files and directories, task management, and even persistence (through its support for <I>shelves</I>). Complete Python programs show how to create e-mail clients, do reporting, and create Web applications (for an online errata database). Chapters on doing graphics programming in Python, as well as coverage of both built-in and custom data structures, are especially good. Because Python is often used for automating installations (in some Linux distributions, for instance), readers will appreciate the sample code and tips for using Python to create bulletproof installs.<p>  Later sections show how get Python to work with C, Java (through <I>JPython</I>), and other languages. The book concludes with useful reference sections summarizing key aspects of Python, like its revision history, relationship to C++, and other material. There aren't many titles on Python, and fans of this up-and-coming language are lucky to have such a solid tutorial and guide available in <I>Programming Python</I>. Perfect for those with just a little previous exposure to the language, it's all you need to master Python in-depth and tap its considerable power for virtually any software project. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to Python <li>Basic system scripts with Python (including file and directory tools) <li>Working with processes and threads <li>Pipes and signals <li>Sample scripts for system and Web utilities (including backing up files, program launching, replicating and managing directories) <li>Graphical user interface design in Python (including the <I>Tkinter</I> module) <li>Widgets and basic components <li>Layout options <li>Event handling <li>GUI examples (including a working text editor, image viewer, and clock) <li>Network scripting (sockets, FTP, and e-mail clients) <li>Server-side scripting <li>Sample server scripts for an online errata database <li>Python on the Internet (including Zope, JPython, and XML tools) <li>Databases and persistence in Python (including <I>pickled</I> objects and <I>shelf</I> files) <li>Custom and built-in data structures in Python <li>Text and string handling <li>C integration with Python (including the SWIG module) <li>Embedding Python calls within C <li>Hints for using Python in real projects <li>Reference to recent changes to Python <li>Python vs. C++ quick-start guide</ul>  </span>

                    <span>Yuck yuck yuck. I'm so unhappy. This book reads like it was written by a 10th grader and was surly was organized by a chimp. It's not organized in any logical manor. It covers some greatly important topics only briefly and then covers totally useless stuff in depth. It spends hundreds of pages talking about web applications. That might sound like an ok idea however most Python web application developers are using Zope for good reason, doing it any other way is silly. The book also talks at length about GUI programming however it never actually gives a proper theory overview to Tkinter so really all you're learning is how to make what Mr. Lutz has already done. As a Python veteran I'd avoid this book. If I didn't already know Python and I bought this I'd be Royal mad. Learning Python is what should be bought if you're a newbie but this book is a bear even for an expert. Avoid it!</span>

                    <span>Here are the critisisms: 1) author's style of writing is somewhat convoluted. The material is not organized in any way that it can be referenced quickly. 2) there is large section on GUI programming that covers tk. How about wxPython? running a tk GUI means that your Python interpreter is calling the tcl interpreter which runs the GUI. THis can be slow. WxPython does not go through two interpreters, is cross-platform, and uses native GUI toolkit. He should have at least covered that a little bit. Otherwise the book is fun to read, and informative if you are at least a Python novice.</span>

                    <span>For those of you not aware of it, Python is an oddity as far as languages go, which in turn makes it one of the more powerful ones out there. It has the power of perl as far as scripting goes. You can use Python to write scripts to tweak your machine to your liking, make it perform certain tasks to update your system, etc. It Also interfaces with a large variety of GUI packages, Tk being the one explained in this book, but you are not limited to just this GUI interface. You have a choice between 5-10 GUI fronts that makes GUI programming a breeze. (though not as easy as VB/VB .NET).<p>Just to re-cap, Part 1. of this book deals with scripting, part 2 is GUI programming,<p>the next part deals with Network programming.<p>Python makes writing my own ftp client a breeze. It has a huge network library which is part of Python's Standard library. (after writing an ftp client in C, Python is a walk in the park).<p>Also covered in this book is how Python interfaces with databases, as well Integration, among a variety of topics covered in this book.<p>Did I mention that Python is fully portable? Windows, Linux, Unix; Intel/ Sparc, u can run your Python program without any problems :)<p>A few things of note.<p>If you're new to Python, I'd recommend trying "Learning Python" first.<p>If not, Python is an extraordinarily large language with an immense standard library for you to explore. the book walks you to a variety of little projects, so after learning the language, you'll have some fully functional programs to use (assuming you don't cheat and simply copy and programs from the companion CD).</span>

                    <span>This book appeared to have lots of potential and I'm sure there is lots of useful stuff in the 1200 odd pages. But finding anything in it is impossible. The index is almost non existant and hasn't helped at all.<p>Of course if you read faster than I do you might not mind browsing a page at a time through all 1200 pages.<p>As a reference manual it was a waste of money.</span>
