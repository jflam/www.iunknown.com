                <span id="Label1">Beneath the enormous umbrella of Buddhism, there is a diverse galaxy of customs and beliefs, but there is also a kernel of truth that every sect holds dear. Rahula Walpola, scholar and monk, discovers this foundation of Buddhism for us first through straightforward explication, never skipping over a point that has yet to be substantiated, then through translations from key scriptures. Logical and focused, these are the essentials of Buddhism; know them first, then move comfortably on to other Buddhist works.</span>

                    <span> This book is an amazing introduction to Buddhism, instead of all the new age rubbish (that is as far from Buddhism as the Hippi return to nature was far from the Native American's way of life)it presents a simple and I'd say uplifting summary of the major themes and theories at the heart of the original teachings of the Buddha.
<br /> Well written, simple and truly compelling, this presentation will be very useful to anyone studying religion or precisely Buddhism. It doesn't pretend to be exhaustive but still follows a very demanding line that tries to avoid any cliché and easy summary. It doesn't present the schism between Theravada and Mahayana traditions since it focuses on the original basis.
<br /> I recommend it to anyone curious about Buddhism.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for all those who are guided to find out more about Buddhism without most of the one-sided different sects. Thats one reason I liked it. Also the history,dates,times. Pictures are a plus in here. This was one of the 3 or 4th books I read that changed my mind on becoming a Buddhist.Clear,precise. Beside the Dalai Lamas books I recommend this to others searching.</span>

                    <span>I find this book to contain not only the best but perhaps among the only good expositions in English of what the Buddha is said to have taught.  My response to those who might cite it as "dry and scholarly" or as "introductory," simply would be to repeat the previous statement.  As to previous comments on the issue of Mahayana versus Theravada, I would say that the many branches of Mahayana tradition seem to occupy themselves in general with topics beyond what the Buddha is said to have taught.  Whether one views these as advancements or corruptions is a matter of doctrinal dispute, as is the soul/no soul question, for which the Buddha himself, one senses, might have had little use.</span>

                    <span>What the Buddha Taught was written in 1959. It is a little dry, but goes right to the core of Buddhism.
<br />It is continually being printed in new editions.  I first came across this book in a religion course in college.  It is written like a college text, and is written to educate, not inspire.

                    <span>I know there are some people trying to make this a battleground to point out their differences and views between Theravada and other. no Self or Soul etc. I see this as two bulls walk to clear water to drink, but they fight over no clear or reasonable reason and leave the water muddy, which is undesirable to others or to them to drink..<br>Forget about soul or not soul, but there is much more important, logical and beautiful things to learn from this book. Those things are free from all opinions but universal. It shows the world in a completely different way from other religions. It does not ask anyone to believe. But come and see for yourself. IF you disagree, that is fine. But clear understanding that gives you confident and assertiveness. Buddhists are free to question their own religion. There are no universal powers to watch your wrongdoing but you watch yourself.  <br>I am very glad that I came across this book. Now I learn to meditate and learn to love and be compassionate to everyone with no different regardless they are friends, enemies or unknown. I am not perfect but I am learning. The joy I get from this cannot explained by words.<br>This book is not really for beginners as I see it. It needs an analytical mind to analyse it on your own time. Just reading it is not enough. My way is questioning while reading.<br>But still I have lot to discover and understand. So far what I understood is rewarding.<br>If you want to enjoy this book, make yourself free from conclusions before start. Have an open mind don't be afraid to question it try to understand it before you jump to conclusions.<br>My doubt about rebirth is not scientifically proven but I found there is lot of researches and investigations have proven that this is very much a possibility.</span>
