                <span id="Label1">The success of "open-source" software is dependent on programmers around  the world being able to develop software that runs on many flavors of Unix and  Linux. The GNU <I>autoconf</I>, <I>automake</I>, and <I>libtool</I> "autotools"  are powerful tools that simplify writing software on different platforms. <I>GNU  Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool</I> is a technically adept and expert guide to  using these utilities effectively. Any C/C++ or script programmer who writes  software under Unix/Linux will want to have a copy of this book to make better  use of these powerful and sometimes obscurely documented tools.<p>  This text is filled with the nuts-and-bolts details of running these three  utilities, including command-line switches and the actual, generated files that  automate the build process and help programmers port code between different  environments. As such, this title will be appreciated by those at their  workstations who want a hands-on guide to using the autotools.<p>  There's a danger of missing the forest for the trees here, with all of this  necessary detail, but the middle sections of this book pull back a little with  several useful chapters on the bigger picture of code "portability." Chapters on  both C and C++ portability explore language features that likely will cause  trouble when code is moved between different versions of Unix (or even between  Unix and Windows). A similar section also discusses the issues when developing  portable shell scripts.<p>  Readers will appreciate also sections that are devoted to actual source code  that's built with the autotools. Starting out simply, the authors also provide  examples of more complex source-code modules (including projects that make use  of dynamic loading and cross-platform builds). The genius of the autotools  utilities is certainly in the details of command-line switches, and the expert  tips that are offered here. But it's good also to get a perspective on why you  use these tools, and what they do for the working Unix developer.<p>  By covering both the nitty-gritty and the higher level issues of "portability"  in a broader sense, this title succeeds as both a hands-on reference and as a  guide to understanding how to write more portable code generally. It'll be a  virtual must-have for any serious Unix C/C++ programmer. Although it's not a  book you necessarily read from cover to cover, it's chock-full of useful advice  that can save considerable time for anyone who writes software for Unix and  Linux. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <table cellspacing="7"  border="0"><ul><ol><tr><td><li>Introduction and history of Unix and  configuration tools <li>The <I>configure</I> tool <li>Makefile and dependencies  <li>GNU autotools used for a simple program <li>Porting options and  <I>configure.in</I> <li>Bootstrapping techniques <li>Comprehensive introduction  to the GNU <I>libtool</I> utility (building and linking options) <li>Using  <I>libtool</I> with <I>configure.in</I> and<I>makefile.am</I> <li>A larger GNU  autotools project <li>Distributing files in tarballs <li>Installing and  uninstalling packages <li>Strategies and tips for writing portable C code with  the GNU autotools (including data types, cross-Unix and Unix/Windows portability  issues) <li>Guide to C++ portability (includes issues with variable scoping,  exceptions, template, and the Standard Template Library) <li>Dynamic loading and  the GNU <I>libltdll</I> tool <li>Advanced <I>automake</I> tips <li>A complex GNU  autotools example (including dynamic linking) <li>Introduction to M4 (the  underlying language of the autotools) <li>Script portability issues for the  Bourne shell and its variants <li>Cygnus's Cygwin and the GNU autotools  <li>Cross-compilation techniques <li>Reference for installing the GNU  autotools</ol></ul></table>          </span>

                    <span>if you had three books on the GNU build system and were ready to delve into the arcane details, this would be an excellent book. <p>if you are looking to learn how to use automake and autoconf to manage a small to midsized project, this book is worthless. the authors jump from the basics to esoteric problem cases and back frequently, and there is no help for those who do not already know the system well.</span>

                    <span>First off, the book is very non-linear and very disorganized.  The subject material is extremely difficult and non-linear, so this was probably a very difficult book to write, and I sympathize with the authors.  I couldn't have done a better job.<p>However, as of Nov 2003, the versions of autoconf, automake and libtool that the book uses are very out of date and very deprecated.  It's not a matter of "some things have changed", it's a matter of "they're completely different".<p>The main ideas and concepts remain the same, but as for the details... you will NOT be able to use autoconf / automake / libtool after reading the book.  You'll be floundering in "did I do something wrong or is this just because I'm using a newer version?".<p>Do not buy this book until the authors update it.  You will NOT learn the subject material and will be very sorry you spent the money.</span>

                    <span>As a guide to Gnu autoconf, automake and libtool, this book is quite useless. It is utterly and totally disorganized, and much essential information is just not there at all. So don't bother with it if you want to learn about any of those subjects. The book is not entirely without merit, however. Its redeeming features are scattered sensible comments about software portability and software architecture.<p>The authors are obviously very knowledgable and experienced about software. I encourage them to "throw this one away" and try a rewrite from scratch. Short of that, they could provide a road map through their book; first read this chapter, then skip to the second half of that one, etc.<p>The sad news is that there may not be any good guide to autoconf etc anywhere yet. Like the DNA in your body, all autoconf files are very likely descended by an evolutionary process from a few original specimens.</span>

                    <span>... this is your lifeline. <p>I sit here, staring at a messy Makefile.am and let me tell you, the future is looking pretty bleak. Imagine the rainiest day, the most miserably cold weather, the most awful meal you've had to eat and say tasted great: for some, the pain of dealing with cross platform Makefiles is exponentially worse. <p>I thank all the authors of this book every time I try to do something impossible within the constraints of GNU make syntax. <p>This book clearly explains Makefile syntax. Then, it explains how to automate it all with GNU autotools. Then, it provides a bunch more information. I think this book is clear and well-informed, and I find myself turning to it instead of the on-line manuals. (Note, this book is available on line as well, for free. Buy it anyway.) Some of the details may be lost on people not doing serious, cross platform Unix development, but the read is still highly recommended.<p>For those still think mulletts are cool, writing Z80 asm is "fun," that women and cooties are inseperable, and that real programmers write their own damn Makefiles, I offer my sincerest sympathies. The first step is admitting you have a problem. The second step is getting this book. <p>Godspeed.</span>
