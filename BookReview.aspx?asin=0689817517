                <span id="Label1">To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the publication of L. Frank  Baum's <I>The Wizard of Oz</I>,  master paper engineer Robert Sabuda has created a pop-up version of Dorothy's  adventures in Oz that fans will find hard to resist. Modeling his depictions of  Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the rest after W. W. Denslow's  original art, Sabuda adds a third dimension that would have rocked  Denslow's--and Baum's--world. A rapidly spinning cyclone actually casts a breeze  over the startled reader's face. Glorious red poppies wave seductively in a  field. And the Emerald City positively glitters with green, especially when  young readers try on the special tinted "Spectacles for You" provided in a  pocket on the page. The abridged text, provided in minibooklets set onto each  page, covers enough basics for the Oz novice, but we recommend a read-aloud of  the original, as well, for all the glory and detail of Baum's fantastic tale.  Sabuda's homage to the classic is truly spectacular; even purists will gasp in  delight at the sight of the humbug wizard floating away in his shiny green,  gold, and blue hot-air balloon. This great introduction to the story of Oz  doubles as a fun collector's item. (Ages 3 to 7) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>I have admired Robert Sabuda for a long time, but he has truly outdone himself in this wonderful pop-up tribute to one of children's literature's classics. There is plenty of text here (which can sometimes be a failing of pop-up books), presented within miniature booklets on each page, and these mini-books have pop-ups themselves, which may be less ambitious than the seven centerpiece artworks, but are quite beautiful and clever in their own right. The text matches Baum's book rather than the movie, so you will find that the witch uses a magic cap to summon the Winged Monkeys, and Dorothy inherit's the Wicked Witch's silver shoes rather than ruby slippers.<P>There are no pull-tabs and nothing for you to do other than enjoy Sabuda's artistry as a cyclone ascends over the Kansas prairie, the Munchkins approach Dorothy's house in Munchkinland, a field of red poppies appears to put some of the travellers to sleep, the Emerald City (complete with green spectacles!) rises from the page, the Wicked Witch's castle emerges, Oz's balloon takes off and Glinda greets the adventurers in the country of the long-necked Quadlings.<P>This would be a fabulous introduction to the story for older youngsters or a fine collectible. Really beautiful.</span>

                    <span>Robert Sabuda is one of my favorite illustrators and certainly the most renowned pop-up book artist and paper engineer working today. Combine Sabuda's entrancing three dimensional illustrations with Frank Baum's glorious story about Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion, Toto and their amazing adventures in the Land of Oz and you have pure magic!<P>The pop-up illustrations are quite intricate, with artwork that's faithful to W. W. Denslow's original illustrations. Sabuda works in a fresh, new style here using prints made from cut linoleum blocks. He brings the drawings to life in a way that will enchant children and adults alike. Each page contains a large pop-up and a small booklet which tells part of the story. And each mini-book contains small pop-ups too. There's a cyclone that really twists, a wizard's balloon that sails into the sky, holographic foil creates a true, sparkling Emerald City made even greener with the included green glasses for the reader<P>The text is slightly abridged so I would suggest that true "Wizard of Oz" fans include an unabridged copy in their library. I recently bought a copy for my cousin's little girl. She calls it her "magic book" and can't seem to put it down. This very special edition, published to commemorate the book's 100th Anniversary, is well worth the price and will surely find a place of honor on your bookshelf. It is spectacular!<BR>JANA</span>

                    <span>This is impressive! Something really great for Wizard of Oz enthusiasts to keep for years. Don't buy it intending it for small children to handle independently, though. The amazing detail is somewhat fragile. But don't be afraid to get it and hang onto it until they're old enough to be careful with it. It's really incredible!</span>

                    <span>Sabuda is a genius. There are popups inside of popups in this book. Each page has a large popup tableau, then on the sides are more popups in sub-books that contain the text. I would recommend this book to kids ages 5 and up. And I do mean 'And Up', since as an adult this book still blows me away.<P>One thing that boggles my mind is how Sabuda's books are created. I'd like to tour the 'factory' or whatever. Because for the amount of time it took to create each copy of the book the cost is TRIVIAL.</span>
