<p><P>I've been toying with the idea of building a WinForms app that would let me publish my digital photographs to the web. I even went as far as building a simple ASP.NET WinForms host so that I could use ASP.NET to generate my photo galleries. But <A href="AOP/fog0000000115.html">CLAW</A> makes it difficult to have more than one hobby, so I began to look around for alternatives.</P><br />
<P>I recently discovered <A href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</A>. This is a web app that lets you upload a bunch of digital photographs and very quickly publish them to the web. There's a bunch of really great convenience features that makes publishing photographs a snap. </P><br />
<P>As a test, I took a bunch of photographs that I took yesterday, and fed them to Adobe Photoshop Elements (this shipped with my camera). There's a nice batch mode that you can use to trim down the size of your photographs for publication to the web. I selected the default 150dpi setting for my otherwise monstrous 2560 x 1920 images. This trimmed my average image size down from roughly 1.5MB to 200K.</P><br />
<P>Next, I zipped up the images and fed them to PBase. Their server software rocks. It unzips your images, drops them into a gallery, generates thumbnails as well as small, medium, and large resized images. To see it in action, <A href="http://www.pbase.com/jlam">check out my account on PBase</A>. So far I've only got one gallery in there, but I plan on adding more (I've already shot over 200 photos with my CoolPix 5700).</P><br />
<P>PBase is currently free. I have no idea how they can afford to run a bandwidth hungry service like that without charging for it. But I'd be more than happy to throw some money their way to pay for their service. This is a great example of a web app that works. That said, I really want a classic Windows app to use as a front-end. I accidentally messed up my folder settings something awful using their HTML-based UI. But given their market constraints (this is a classic example of a horizontal app), I'm more than happy with the solution that they provide. Well done!</P></p>

<p>I guess that was inevitable. I contributed more than that as a donor, so it's actually a price break for me </p>

<p>I only just discovered pbase 2 wks. ago and regardless of the fact that we discovered a yr. apart, I completely agree with both yr. positive & negative comments about the service.</p>

<p>It looks great, is realtively easy to use & has great features (esp. compared w. blogger.com--where I came from).</p>

<p>My problem (& I think you mentioned this in somewhat technical terms which I had some trouble following) is with the CSS stylesheets & textual elements.  The editing function is miserable & is unnecessarily hard to use or figure out.  They should do a better job of explaining to users how to use stylesheets AND how to edit existing stylesheets in order to personalize them for an individual member's use.  I think that their FAQs & Help info is pretty lame.</p>

<p>Here's hoping that the good stuff stays good & the bad stuff gets fixed.</p>
