<h3 class="title">Algorithm complexity and modern CPU's</h3>

<p>Remember your college introduction to data structures and algorithms course? Remember how you spent some time calculating the complexity cost of various algorithms based on big-O notation? There was one very important assumption that was made whenever you made those calculations: <strong>that the cost of accessing any address in memory was constant</strong>.</p>

<p>With today's multi-tiered <span class="caps">CPU</span> cache architectures, it has become increasingly obvious (to those who care) that that assumption is no longer valid. A full cache miss on a modern 3GHz+ P4 will mean that you will waste ~1000 operations while waiting for the data to show up at the <span class="caps">CPU. </span></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jangr/">Jan Gray</a> <a href="http://www.fpgacpu.org/index.html#021110">wrote an excellent essay</a> that attacks a data structure that is responsible for lousy performance characteristics on modern <span class="caps">CPU</span>'s: the venerable linked list. In this essay, you'll see some of Jan's prognostications on the future of <span class="caps">CPU</span> architectures. My favorite quote from this piece is "This scenario is so bad and so common that the microprocessor vendors use 80% of their transistor budgets for on-chip caches -- Intel as glorified <span class="caps">SRAM</span> vendor.".</p>

<h3 class="title">C++ programmer ethos</h3>

<p>Why is it that whenever I start writing [Managed]C++ code that I:</p>


<ol>
<li>Feel the urge to write wrapper classes</li>
<li>Worry much more about failure conditions / scenarios</li>
<li>Think obsessively about const-correctness</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, writing wrapper classes is pretty much all that I use MC++ for these days. There's a bunch of unmanaged Win32 <span class="caps">API</span>'s that I need to call from managed code and MC++ is the perfect tool for the job (only a masochist would try and manipulate <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/security/security/sid.asp">SIDs</a> from C#/VB.NET).  </p>

<p>Yes, I know that Whidbey provides wrappers for SIDs and their friends in <code>System.Security.AccessControl</code>, but I need to deploy systems <em>today</em> on <span class="caps">V1.1.</span></p>

<h3 class="title">aspnet_compiler.exe rocks!</h3>

<p>Today's favorite feature in <span class="caps">FX2.0</span> is brought to you by the letter a, as in <code>aspnet_compiler.exe</code>. Finally we have the ability to compile an entire <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> application within a daily build process. In the past, if you had code in your <code>.aspx</code> files, you wouldn't know whether that code actually compiled until you <em>ran</em> that page. Now, you can compile the entire application during your daily build and get immediate feedback on compilation errors.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000364.html">AssemblyDiff tool</a> doesn't diff <code>mscorlib.dll</code> since you can only have one version of mscorlib.dll loaded in a managed process.

<h3 class="title">Assembly Friendship</h3>

<p>[Via <a href="http://www.cookcomputing.com/blog/archives/000323.html">Charles Cook</a>] Jim Hogg from the <span class="caps">CLR</span> team <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/OKloeten/posts/35176.aspx">talks about an upcoming new feature in V2 of the <span class="caps">CLR</span></a>: "Friend Assemblies". There will be a new assembly-level attribute called <code>InternalsVisibleTo</code> that lets the author of an assembly specify who it wants its <code>internal</code> methods to be visible to.</p>

<p>This is extremely useful for unit-testing. There are many occasions where you need to make the internals of a class visible to unit-testing code. Today, this essentially forces you to have to conditionally compile your unit-testing code into the same assembly as the code that it tests. In <span class="caps">V2,</span> you will be able to cleanly separate the code from its tests. It also enables a scenario where <code>InternalsVisibleTo</code> can be used to allow diagnostic code to run against a shipping assembly at a customer site.</p>

<h3 class="title">Ant community reaction to MSBuild</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.iseran.com/Steve/blog/archives/000029.html#more">Steve Loughran posts his initial thoughts</a> based on a reading of the docs. He has a number of interesting criticisms of MSBuild, particularly about pushing dependency analysis to the target level. Steve is a co-author of the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1930110588/iunknowncom-20">Java Development with Ant</a> and an Ant committer. </p>

<p><a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/static/antville/files/stefanbodewig/whoami.html">Stefan Bodewig</a> posts several entries about MSBuild. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/stories/10575/">target depenencies</a> Stefan raises some interesting issues about dependency analysis, much like what Steve did in his entry. This is a particularly interesting problem when you consider what happens with dependencies if you want to <em>incrementally</em> update an <span class="caps">FTP</span> server. It's unclear to me how Inputs/Outputs would conflict with an <span class="caps">FTP</span> task that did smart dependency analysis against remote date/time stamps.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/stories/10616/">conditions in MSBuild and Ant</a> Stefan advocates using properties files in Ant over <span class="caps">XML</span> property elements. The problem I have with property files in general is that they aren't <span class="caps">XML. </span>This makes it much harder to manipulate these files through generalized <span class="caps">XML</span> techniques such as <span class="caps">XSLT. </span>It's not impossible, but it increases the friction considerably. +1 to MSBuild for avoiding property files (even at the cost of additional verbosity).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/stories/10636/">Items in MSBuild</a> Stefan examines the way tasks can be decoupled via Items. Specifically, it's the OutputItem element in MSBuild that allows tasks to both consume and <em>emit</em> Items, which makes it far easier to couple the output of one task to the input of another. He also proposes a very interesting "pipe" syntax that would allow tasks to be decoupled <em>without</em> incurring the friction involved in defining an OutputItem for a task.</p>

<h3 class="title">MSBuild on v1.1.4322</h3>

<p>I just tried adding the following app.config file to msbuild:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;?xml version =&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;startup&gt;
        &lt;requiredRuntime safemode=&quot;true&quot; imageVersion=&quot;v1.1.4322&quot; version=&quot;v1.1.4322&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/startup&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre><p>It seems to work ... so far. That's pretty good news if you want to try out MSBuild on your existing <span class="caps">V1.1</span> projects. I haven't tried this yet on a machine that doesn't have <span class="caps">V1.2</span> installed yet - any takers?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It doesn't work. I just tried it on a <span class="caps">V1.1</span> framework box. There is at least one dependency on <span class="caps">V1.2,</span> but it appears to only occur on an error path in the code: <span class="caps">V1.2</span> defines a SecurityException.get_PermissionStateInstance() method that isn't present in <span class="caps">V1.1. </span>No time to dig through why the security exception was thrown in the first place, though ... I guess we'll have to wait and see whether there's an "official" implementation in the future from <span class="caps">MS.</span></p>
