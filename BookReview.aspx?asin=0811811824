                <span id="Label1">Most Westerners, thanks to television documentaries and numerous books, have some inkling of the appalling destruction of Africa's many ecosystems and the animal species that live in them. Fewer are aware of the work being done in several African nations to preserve these ecosystems. The noted travel photographer Frans Lanting takes us into one protected area, the Okavango River, which begins in the mountains of Angola and ends a thousand miles later in the very heart of Botswana's Kalahari Desert, "the great thirstland." Lanting's photographs are stunning, capturing lionesses in mid hunt, ibises on the wing, and elephants preparing to charge. A trained ecologist, he also takes care to describe how the river interacts with the dry lands that surround it. Lanting's book belongs in the libraries of both Africa buffs and river aficionados. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>Frans Lanting had created marvelous book. His pictures portray the unique beauty of the region, convey the wildness of a place, and force a viewer to visit the place immediately. The photographs and text also urge the people to save this unique ecosystem. We realize the impact of water on the unique environment of the delta that supports the greatest variety of the flora and fauna in the world. At the same time these photographs make us realize what will be lost if the water will be gone. This book has inspired me even more after I visited the Okavango delta. It made me to relive my own experiences once again. After more than 5 years of its publication, this book is still the best pictorial work on Okavango delta. Simply, the greatest!</span>

                    <span>Mr. Lanting is a unique and wonderful photographer who is a great help to all of us. His photos capture the wildlife of the Okavango as they are -- not postcard photos. He has a respect and reverence of this fragile ecosystem (unlike none other in the world) and all that lives and dies there that is captured in this book. Botswana is a special country with a unique ecosystem in the Delta that you should travel to. I've had the good fortune to experience Africa eight times, Botswana twice. I will return many times to the Delta as there is so much there to experience and each time its fresh. Let Mr. Lantings photos pursuade you to go.</span>

                    <span>This book makes me suspect that Frans Lanting is not only the worlds greatest wildlife photographer but also the greatest bird photographers, crocodile photographer, elephant photographer etc. As usual, his photography is far from the species type of photography often seen. Lanting connects with the subject and transform the experience into art. In addition, he is not afraid to break the rules and make it work. The book is a must in any nature photographers library.</span>
