                    <span>I'm not gonna go deep into the contents of the book because others have done that. All I'm gonna tell you is that if your looking to understand photography in anyway this book is for you. John Shaw spells everything out to you in a very simple way that is easy to understand. If your not sure the first time just re-read the section again and it will come to you. </span>

                    <span>There are a lot of other photography books out there with the same general content as this book -- an overview of photographic techniques, equipment and the creative process as they relate to landscape photography.  Although it is not an outstanding book, it is better than average, primarily because of the clear, direct way in which John Shaw writes, and the practical advice which he provides.</span>

                    <span>THis book takes the mystery out of landscape photography. The techinal aspects are simply explained and illustrated in many cases which allows the artist at it were in you to be released. Very thoughtful and insightful a must for anyone interested in landscape and even travel photography.</span>

                    <span>This book give precise and thoughtfull insites on both the technical and creative methods used to produce superior landscapes. There are numerous excellent examples. He does not get bogged down with technical trivia. I would definitly buy this book, it is a bargain. Its only shortcoming is not having a section on digital cameras that are taking over much of the market. These cameras allows instant feedback on photo results including histograms that remove all the guesswork and waiting to get film developed.</span>
