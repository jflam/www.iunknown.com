                <span id="Label1">In 1941 Janusz Bardach's death sentence was commuted to ten years' hard labor and he was sent to Kolyma--the harshest, coldest, and most deadly prison in Joseph Stalin's labor camp system--the Siberia of Siberias. The only English-language memoir since the fall of communism to chronicle the atrocities committed during the Stalinist regime, Bardach's gripping testimony explores the darkest corners of the human condition at the same time that it documents the tyranny of Stalin's reign, equal only to that of Hitler. With breathtaking immediacy, a riveting eye for detail, and a humanity that permeates the events and landscapes he describes, Bardach recounts the extraordinary story of this nearly inconceivable world.  The story begins with the Nazi occupation when Bardach, a young Polish Jew inspired by Soviet Communism, crosses the border of Poland to join the ranks of the Red Army. His ideals are quickly shattered when he is arrested, court-martialed, and sentenced to death. How Bardach survives an endless barrage of brutality--from a near-fatal beating to the harsh conditions and slow starvation of the gulag existence--is a testament to human endurance under the most oppressive circumstances. Besides being of great historical significance, Bardach's narrative is a celebration of life and a vital affirmation of what it means to be human.</span>

                    <span>This book is the most daunting first hand account of the Gulag that I have read. Voices from the Gulag and Through the Whirlwind are also well-written accounts. Man is Wolf caputures the brutal experience with power and eloquence. From a literary standpoint it is a simple read but from a human perspective it is devastating. I had to stop reading on anumber of occasions to keep from being in enveloped by the horror of the book. This book will change your perspective on human nature, WWII and Eastern Europe.</span>

                    <span>What a great story. I couldn't put the book down. It is a view of WW II and Soviet Terror told from a unique perspective. I was enthralled to read the first hand accurate descriptions of human suffering and maladies. Then to my suprise the Author revealed himself to be one of my professors during Medical School! He never talked about this part of his life during my brief and peripheral association with him, and was a hard but just teacher with glimpses of remarkable human tenderness. <P> The first hand description of vitamin deficiencies was insightful.<P> Buy this book and read about human courage and survival</span>

                    <span>I grew up in Iowa City around the corner from Dr. Bardach. I delivered his newspaper when I was a kid and used to see him and his wife at local tennis clubs. That's all I knew about him-until I was 30 and my parents were reading his book. When they told me what it was about, I was stunned! I couldn't put the book down. His story is riveting. How on earth does a Polish Jew in WWII go from a hard labor camp in Siberia to being a renowned surgeon at a large teaching hospital in the middle of Iowa? It puts life into perspective and will remind you that anything is possible. Dr. Bardach truly lived the American dream.</span>

                    <span>You won't be dissapointed! I had no idea that 30 years ago when I was a 14 year old child, I was being operated on by a fomer Russian Officer condemned to death in a concentration camp! What I remember is a very kind doctor/man who encouraged an Iowa boy with a cleft lip to be all he could be. It was just last year when I was grieved to find out that the doctor who gave me a new face had died. Only later did I find out and become amazed at all he had gone through. I just had to buy the book, and found it VERY difficult to put down, not just because he was the man who operated on my lip/nose 30 years ago, but also because he wrote very well from a first person point of view. I only wish I had an autographed copy of his book! Rest in Peace, my friend! May the Lord richly bless you!<BR>-rickmauderer@charter.net</span>
