                    <span>This book is amazing, and that's because this woman is amazing. The book has been around for years, but Barbara is still out there, traveling and promoting the joy she has derived in her life for working for her favorite person -- herself. 
<br />
<br />I met her in Washington, D.C., at a seminar she gave, and in a desperate moment, I contacted her personally and she immediately gave me a wonderfully encouraging response. She practices what she preaches -- she warns her audience that there are a lot of people out there who are altogether too happy to burst your bubble and try to convince you that it is your civic duty to work at a job or company you hate -- and it's because people are jealous and maybe even terrified that you will succeed and leave them to be miserable the way you used to be.
<br />
<br />Recently, I left a job and am freelancing. It's tough; there's just not enough work to cover my bills right now. But I am doing it on my own terms, and I would say that reading this book and talking with Barbara gave me the courage in myself to know that, if I want it badly enough, I can make it happen. She is full of ideas of what you can do and how you can use your strengths, and she's more than happy to give you her thoughts on untapped markets -- because, let's face it, she knows that keeping her thoughts to herself won't make a difference in the world.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book because of its content that never loses its timeliness. I urge you to find your dreams and run after them, and do it knowing that a truly amazing person helped to blaze the path for you.</span>

                    <span>Did you know that the official definition of small business is a company with less than 500 employees? For most of us however, "small" means somewhere between sole proprietor and fifty employees. If this latter definition fits your vision, then this is the book for you. I've been recommending it to friends and clients for a decade, and for many it has been the breakthrough thinking they need to craft a business based on their values about thriving.
<br />
<br />Conventional wisdom states that small businesses fail for lack of capital and lack of knowledge. These are but symptoms. The real struggle springs from poverty of imagination and reluctance to learn. This book is rich with examples for moving beyond the conventional and liberating your creativity. In addition, the author comes through on the pages with wit, wisdom and compassion.

                    <span>This is a remarkably interesting book about how to approach self-employment. It is not a cookbook or listing of readymade businesses, but rather a guidebook about the entire process of moving into self-employment.
<br />
<br />Published in 1993, some of the information is a bit dated, but since the primary thrust of the book is not to provide the reader with specific current opportunities, the book holds up very well over time.
<br />
<br />There are many examples of people building different types of businesses, and advice from some well-known success stories. The book is broken into five parts, each with two or three chapters. Each chapter starts with a relevant quote, and treats a specific area of focus, such as; Doing First Things First, Uncovering Your Assets, Creating Multiple Profit Centers, Marketing On A Shoestring, etc.
<br />
<br />While there is plenty of advice on creating and starting a business (or multiple businesses), the thing that I think is most important in this book is how the author deals with the psychological issues. Most books on starting your own business will mention the emotional and mental obstacles involved, but seldom give the reader much in the way of concrete methods for dealing with them. This book gives you the tools for dealing with the most difficult part of running your own business - your own habits and attitudes. Winter spends a great deal of time covering the psychological groundwork necessary to succeed at being your own boss. She does this in a clear manner, with examples from the real world. There is also a booklist in the back with resources for different areas, such as Personal Growth, Marketing, Entrepeneurial Inspiration, and so on.
<br />
<br />I found this book one of the most useful in working on my attitude about being self-employed. It is a positive, uplifting read without being unrealistic and full of fluff. This may well be one of the best books around for preparing a person to start their own business. While there is not a laundry list of business ideas nor a lot of technical detail like legal issues and such, I think that creating the kind of mindset that allows one to succeed is the first and most important step in reaching that success, regardless of the venture. This book will be a very great help in establishing the kind of mindset that will allow one to succeed. I think the author's approach will also allow this book to be of use for decades to come, regardless of how technologies and markets change. This information is basic to all business ventures.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book for the individual who has a gut feeling that something better exists than a 'job' to create a flow of income to support oneself.  This is a very inspiring, well written book for anyone and everyone who has had it with the corporate 9-5 nonsense. The author 'walks the talk' and has a great deal of information to offer in this book.  This is the first book that I read cover to cover in a long time.  For the wanna be entrpreneur...no book is better.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book in 1998 -- back when the economy was booming -- and it is one of the few books that is as relevant today as it was then.<p>Yes, it's about being your own boss -- but it's about living your life...doing things you enjoy doing and things you're good at and making a living at it.<p>As a person who has a business, this book is about getting started, about keeping yourself inspired and staying focused and passionate about what you do.  It isn't, however, a bunch of navel gazing rhetoric, like some of the books in this genre.  At the same time, the book requires some honest introspection, and talks about the things you may have to sacrifice in order to live a life away from the usual.<p>This book is wonderful.  And I highly recommend it to anyone who a) wants to have her/his own business, or b) currently has a business and has lost the passion -- it is a great kickstart.</span>
