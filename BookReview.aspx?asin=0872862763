                    <span>I enjoyed reading Married To a Stranger. As I read, I kept reveling in the ability to read the ideas of such a rare protagonist in our literary canon, the Iranian female. Minou's story is a hero's journey of sorts--and I say of sorts because of the patriarchal ideas we've grown up with. I should write that it is a hero's journey, period. <P>Why it's three and not four or five stars: I wanted to know more of Javad and his involvement in politics and writing; I wanted to know more of his affair; I wanted to know more about Minou at the end of the novel. I hope I haven't given a lot away here . . .<P>However, looking at it culturally, what a nice experience as a reader to be shown Iran from a woman's point of view. Superb.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Rachlin insightfully describes universal human feelings of love and longing in a voice not usually heard from--a woman from Iran. I highly recommend this book for people interested in an original portrayal of familiar but important themes.</span>

                    <span>I read Foreigner and Married to a Stranger a few years ago. I borrowed them from the public library (for people who can't find these books to buy, they are available at the public library) and I am planning to re-read them again. I wish there were more books such as Nahid's available in the market. The Iranian Americans are newer immigrants and we do need to read and write and self discover ourselves in the new land in order to be able to understand our complexities and adjust to our new situations. This market without a doubt will be much richer in the future.</span>

                    <span>So far this is my favorite of Nahid Rachlin's books. The story is told in simple sentences, corresponding with the youth and naivete of the main character, Minou, who marries an older man of her own choosing after graduating from high school. She has no idea what she has gotten herself into, and while her parents claim an arranged marriage would have been better, this is questionable since the book takes place in the late 1970s, before, during, and after the overthrow of the Shah and the fundamentalist revolution. The book opens with a young girl's happiness about her upcoming wedding and the tension gradually builds up to the end. Rachlin's books give Americans an inside picture of Iranian culture and society, particularly concerning the position of women. I hope she will continue writing.</span>
