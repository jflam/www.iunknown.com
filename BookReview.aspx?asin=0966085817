                <span id="Label1">This comprehensive guide presents, in words and photographs, the very best hiking opportunities Utah has to offer. Some of the trails wind through deep redrock canyons, while others climb lofty snow-covered peaks. Visit a 700-year-old Anasazi cliff dwelling on the Colorado Plateau or discover a pristine alpine lake in the Uinta Mountains. About half of the hikes can be completed in one day, but many take more time-they range in length from 4.5 miles to 33.5 miles. Over 250 color and black & white photographs and 80 detailed trail maps are included to help you choose the adventure that is right for you!</span>

                    <span>great descriptions of the hike, recommendations on best seasons, really good maps, wonderful colour photographs, comprehensive driving directions and easy USGS quad map referenes - could it even be better than the incredible California Hiking? I bought Canyoneering the San Rafael Swell as well, and am sending it back because this book covers what I need in a much easier to read style - and is less likely to get me killed en route while rock climbing without a belay. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Who knew there were so many great hikes local to the Wasatch Front? And it gets better than that, this book has a hike for every season and every day of the year. From easy to difficult, senic to exercisic, you'll never get bored in Utah again. This book offers some of the tradional hikes Utah is know for plus many hidden treasures. At first I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to start. There were so many interesting sites I wanted to do them all. Having done quite a few now I can't wait to do more. And you'll never get tired of the views, you can do your favorites hikes again and again, try one in summer and in winter. The book als has great descriptions of the plants and animals native to the area. So take it along and lean about your suroundings in a quite medow or under a shade tree. A must for the hiking enthusiest!</span>

                    <span>Anyone intending to do any amount of hiking in Utah, whether it be for a day or an overnight trip, will find David Days' "Utah's Favorite Hiking Trails" an invaluable source of information! The layout and design of the book aids in pre-trip planning. Included are detailed trail maps for each hike, an extensive index, a rating of each hike by the author and a clear and definitive description of the route of the trail. Along with the maps and numerous black and white pictures, the author includes two multi-page groups of color photographs of the areas listed in the Guide. My wife and I found these to be very motivational and inspiring and are looking forward to our return trip to Utah to visit many of the areas Mr. Day lists in his book. I have seen and used many trail guides over the years and find "Utah's Favorite Hiking Trails" to be among the best and would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Utah.</span>

                    <span>I bought the book to plan a trip next summer and I am thoroughly excited. I especially appreciated the easy U.S.G.S. topo map references. I gave the book four stars because I haven't hiked any of the trails yet. Let's see if I bump it to five when I get back. See you in Naturalist basin early August.</span>

                    <span>One of the best books for anyone interested in Utah hiking. The book has great variety with trails of all lengths and types. I have hiked 9 out of the 77 trails listed in the book and am looking forward to using the book to plan future trips to Utah.</span>
