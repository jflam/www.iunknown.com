                    <span>This book is excellent!  At the time I read this book I had been working with Access, Sybase, & Oracle for 7 years.  However all of my database knowledge was product-oriented and I did not have a really firm grasp of general database concepts and principles: primary & foreign keys, tables, joins, and other basic concepts were never explained thoroughly.  Sure you can read about these concepts in the documentation for whatever database product you're using, but everyone glosses over these important basic concepts and assumes that "someone else covered it", when in fact no one has.  This book changes all that.  Although it is written for beginners, I suspect that even intermediate administrators and developers will get a lot out of this book; it's the kind of book where just when you think you already know the material, you come upon some nugget of information that clears up a concept you'd always had trouble understanding.  That's what makes this book valuable.  The fact that the author is british doesn't surprise me; I've noticed lately that when it comes to technical writing, English authors do an excellent job of covering the basics before going on to the more technical material, whereas American authors tend to focus more on writing books and articles that are product-specific.  Now that Mark Whitehorn has covered the basics in this book, I hope he will consider writing an Oracle book.</span>

                    <span>This is for beginners and has little substance<br>beyond the obvious. If you're interested in database design,<br>don't buy this book. The introduction claims: "you shouldn't read this book if you're looking for a 'How to use Access' book". This is a misleading statement</span>

                    <span>Inside Relational Databases is an excellent introduction to the topic and a very good resource.  I read the book cover to cover and found the authors' insights helpful and rather clever.  I had taken a database building course in college and this book not only reintroduced me to the subject but enhanced the design skills I thought I had kept sharp.  I recomend this book to anybody looking for material on relational databases.  It is very well written with the reader's interests in mind.  The authors' sense of humor shows well without making light of the subject.  I have rated this book with a well deserved, in my mind, five stars.</span>

                    <span>New to database theory myself, a search for "database design" produced an overwhelming response of choices within Amazon's search engine.  After about a week of reading reviews, I chose this book.  <p>Dr. Whitehorn  de-mystifies database design and theory using straightforward examples and explanations.  I cannot emphasize enough that this book lays down fundamental concepts for beginners; he goes to some lengths to make the "jargon" of database designers accessible to all people interested in developing a relational database.  Coupled with Michael Hernandez's book "Database Design for Mere Mortals," this book elegantly moves through the phases of design and beautifully complements Hernandez's book:  "Inside Relational Databases" is about the structure of the database (assuming you've already done the majority of the "footwork" as described in Hernandez's book.)  [It's pretty obvious that I'd recommend both of these books--just read their reviews and you'll see what I mean.]<p>I would strongly recommend reading this book PRIOR to buying a bunch of how-to books related to your particular Relational Database Management Software.  If you know how to do it without the software, you will have put the horse before the cart.<p>I personally love a book that assumes I'm not a complete idiot (thus I don't like those "...for Dummies" books,) with less than 300-400 pages, whose author is an authority on the subject (Bill Marklyn--the co-author--oversaw the design and creation of MS Access!), where there's not too much sarcasm and "personality" put into the work, and where I can learn with only a little effort!  This is my book!  I hope it can be a good learning tool for you as well.</span>

                    <span>Whew. This is an outstanding book. It is simple and straightforward and explains complex concepts in an accessible way.<p>If you want an excellent overview of databases, this is the place to start.<p>Some examples:<p>The chapter on Integrity (Chapter 16) instantly and lucidly gets the point across. I was a convert after reading the first 4 paragraphs.<p>The exceedingly-simple ("yet-so-few-others-do-it") chapter breakout of Tables, Forms, Queries and Reports. Each chapter is its own "little-world" untouched with non-related ideas. The authors tie them together later. Extremely well executed.<p>Excellent and I mean *excellent* typography and layout. The paper is white and high quality. The book is smallish in size and is readable, flippable and portable.<p>This book does it right, in every way.</span>
