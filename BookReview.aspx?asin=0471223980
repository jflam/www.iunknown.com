                    <span>Of all the books Ive read on software testing this book is by far the best.  For me it incorporates both the theory and practical advice for excellent execution. The book is also written in a style that is easy to follow unlike some technical books on this subject.</span>

                    <span>I am a final year graduate student and I started reading this book as a part of the reading assignment for the course "Systems Testing and Verification". I found this book very valuable for the internship I am doing as a product test engineer. The book is indispesible guide for the beginner and good reference for the professionals. The real world experience of the author makes this book an appropriate guide line for all those who wants to deal with testing process. I have applied some key concepts from the book for the test cases I designed and the result was quite satisfying. I would not have come up with such a good test cases on my own without refering to this book. Its worth keeping this book as a future reference.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is one of my favorite software testing books.  It has an especially good chapter on metrics for evaluating the progress of your testing effort--the metrics are easy to calculate, and VERY importantly, easy to understand by--and convincing to, in my experience--the people you'll be reporting your progress to.  There's also a good chapter on bug-tracking, and some discussion of how to write bug reports that I've found very useful for training new testers.  Plus, there's lots of useful perspective on general management issues--hiring; the interdepartmental issues that (as far as I know) are unique to testing; etc.<p>I wrote this review based on the first edition--a second edition has since come out.</span>

                    <span>This is the only book on testing that I have found that concentrates on the management tasks associated with the testing process.  Rather than just the mechanics of testing, the book covers everything from establishing and funding test teams to coordinating corporate responses, from developing plans to assuring that they succeed.  Just the guide that IT managers need.</span>
