                <span id="Label1">As everybody who's anybody knows (and the rest of us too), the most exclusive Hollywood party is <I>Vanity Fair</I> magazine's Oscar-night bash. <I>Vanity Fair's Hollywood</I> is like the ultimate movie party--and how inviting it all is! Flip through the thick, glossy pages and greet the greats of all ages. Lillian and Dorothy Gish share a spread with Blythe Danner and Gwyneth Paltrow. Ms. Deneuve, resplendent in scarlet, meet Mr. Valentino, in classy black and white. Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra, meet Liz Taylor as Cleopatra (and if it's not too catty, did you notice Claudette was better dressed?). The stunning photos are cleverly juxtaposed. Julia Roberts, posed naughtily in see-through undies in the water, is followed by a very properly attired Doris Day in a see-through skirt. Day holds six brightly dyed poodles by white leashes; the composition forms a visual rhyme with the six accusing fingers pointed at Peter Lorre in the next picture. The photo captions by Christopher Hitchens are as succinctly clever as Dorothy Parker, encapsulating entire careers in a punning paragraph. Even if you've seen a shot before, you learn things: in the most notorious still ever snapped at a Hollywood party--the one where Sophia Loren ogled Jayne Mansfield's voluminous bosom--Hitchens tells us the object of Loren's appalled regard was "the strategic dabs of makeup on [Jayne's] nipples."<p>  Like any good party, this vast book offers sparkling talk as well as gobs of eye candy. The brilliant Peter Biskind evokes the '70s heyday of superagent Sue Mengers, D.H. Lawrence makes a stab at defining "sex appeal," Patricia Bosworth adds the patented <I>VF</I> dash of scandal in a piece on Lana Turner's gangster boyfriend's murder, and Hitchens gives a quickie history of the fabled Sunset Strip. Not everything rises to the august occasion: Carl Sandburg's poem about Chaplin and Clare Boothe Luce's snooty ode to Garbo are mostly of antiquarian interest. Most of the historic stuff is great (e.g., Fritz Lang directing a crowd scene in <I>Metropolis</I>), and the most austere cineaste should own this book. On practically every page, <I>Vanity Fair's Hollywood</I> dazzles. It's a keeper. <I>--Tim Appelo</I> </span>

                    <span>Hollywood has always stood for dreams. Vanity Fair's take has always<br>been to turn the tinsel used to depict those dreams into glamor. This<br>book is very much in keeping with the magazine's slant and Hollywood's<br>most inflated view of itself. The book faithfully reproduces a<br>cross-section of Vanity Fair's 86 year history. <P>Before you read<br>further, let me caution you that this book teems with suggestiveness.<br>If that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, skip this book.<P>The<br>photographs are the best part of thebook. There are large numbers of<br>outstanding examples of work by Edward Steichen and Annie Leibovitz.<br><P>The pages are oversized, and many images are done as double<br>spreads. This makes for seeing very large features of the stars<br>portrayed, and this has high impact effects on the viewer -- evoking a<br>sense of the wide screen. The editing was wisely done to select many<br>images that can be reasonably faithfully reproduced that way.<br><P>Unfortunately, many fine photographs were reproduced with the<br>middle fold through an important part of the image. Some of the<br>images that were not so spoiled also were overinked in a way that make<br>the details hard to discern. Inexplicably, there were no credits<br>listed for many photographs. I graded the book down one star for<br>being insufficiently well designed, credited and printed to portray<br>all of the photographs to their best advantage. <P>Except for this<br>very regrettable and significant set of flaws on the photography side,<br>the book is very well done. The selection of photographs was<br>brilliantly done to not only highlight great ones, but to create<br>interplay among them . . . and among themes . . . and among<br>generations of Hollywood performers. I found it all quite exciting<br>and entertaining.<P>Some of my favorite photographs in the book<br>are:<P>Jack Nicholson; Annie Leibovitz, 1992<P>Robin Williams, Eddie<br>Murphy, and Jim Carrey; Annie Leibovitz, 1997<P>Doris Day; John<br>Florea, 1953<P>Spencer Tracy and Katherine Kapburn; n.c., 1949<br><P>Nancy and Ronald Reagan; Harry Benson, 1985<P>Pee-Wee Herman; Annie<br>Leibovitz, 1984<P>Walt Disney; Edward Steichen, 1933<P>Dustin<br>Hoffman; Herb Ritts, 1996<P>Rita Hayworth; n.c., 1946<P>Robert<br>Redford; George Gorman, 1984<P>Meryl Streep; Annie Leibovitz,<br>1982<P>Gloria Swanson; Edward Steichen, 1928<P>I also liked the<br>caricature of Greta Garbo by Miguel Covarrubias from 1932.<P>The<br>essays were more of a mixed lot. My favoite was D.H. Lawrence on sex<br>appeal. "Sex appeal is only a dirty name for a bit of life<br>flame." Other essays looked at Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo (by<br>Walter Winchell), the queens of gossip columnists, and agent Sue<br>Mengers. <P>After you have finished enjoying this close-up look at<br>Hollywood, ask yourself where your dreams come from. Then consider<br>where they should come from. Should Hollywood be the source of your<br>dreams, the reinforcement of your dreams, or simply be a source of<br>entertainment? You'll have to decide. But do so explicitly. Your<br>dreams are too important to turn over to others to create and<br>manipulate.<P>As the Everly Brothers used to sing: "Dream, Dream,<br>Dream . . ."<br></span>

                    <span>A wonderful book that portrays the glitz and glamour of Hollywood at its most glorious. Vanity Fair's best inspirational photos are presented from the distant and not-too-recent past. A perfect gift for that star follower in your world. Every page screams "Hooray for Hollywood", and the nostalgia of some will have you yearning for past times. It's possibly the most beautiful book ever made on the stars that captured our imagination and inspired us.</span>

                    <span>While there were some great vintage articles and photographs, why are pages blown to show wastes like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and other I-make -money- because- of- my- looks and not acting ability "artists?" Many obscure silent and early talking stars could've and SHOULD'VE been included. But that's the way it is- nobody cares for the old. Makes a great coffee table book. Get this from the library. I was disappointed. I was done with it in one afternoon.</span>

                    <span>This book is filled with photographs and essays about Hollywood and its stars. There is a wide variety of photographs exhibited here. My only complaint would be that they are not set up in any kind of order. A picture of Jack Nicholson playing golf on one page and then turn the page to find a picture of Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. I suppose they thought chronological or theme order would have been too predictable. My favorite photos are: Doris Day (p. 26), the essay and photo of Greta Garbo (pgs. 42-43), James Dean clowning (p. 47), Jayne Mansfield and Sophia Loren (p.158) the Malibu Beach drawing from 1933 (p.242), Sophia Loren (p. 247), Jackie Cooper and Mickey Rooney (p. 276), Loretta Young in 1935 and 1999 (pgs.292 and 293) and Olivia de Havilland (p. 310). As you can tell, my interests are toward vintage photos, but there are photos of today's celebs as well, such as Gwyneth Paltrow or Cameron Diaz and these are wonderful photos, too. The pictures in Vanity Fair are always unique and this is a great compilation.</span>

                    <span>I have always loved movie books, and this one on the stars is great. The pictures are really fabulous, and I have spent hours looking through it and reading the text over and over again. My only disappointment is that there is not enough old Hollywood in the book. But, for new Hollywood photos and gossip, this is a primo tome.</span>
