                <span id="Label1">Patterns are higher-order designs that can be reused across projects and types of computer systems. <I>Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models</I> defines over 70 patterns, beginning with some from the business world, such as the Party and Accountability patterns, which define the players in organizations and whom they report to. Many of the other patterns are drawn from the health care industry and mainly show patterns of doctor-patient interactions.<p> The patterns for financial markets will probably be accessible for the majority of readers. Author Martin Fowler defines a Transaction pattern (and related patterns) as well as several patterns for the Accounting of Objects. He moves on to modeling stock markets with Portfolio, Quote, and Scenario patterns, which define how a price for a stock is determined for a given moment. Interestingly, he establishes patterns for Forward Contracts (for derivatives) as well as Options, and so takes on a complicated area in today's financial markets.<p> Fowler's considerable design experience in these fields is beneficial, as he is able to define each pattern in both text and software engineering diagrams. Only rarely does the author provide implementations of these designs and those that are furnished are done in Smalltalk, which makes this book more suitable for those who have experience in object design.</span>

                    <span>I bet you are an object oriented software developer striving to build better applications. If you have not read GoF <i>Design Patterns</i> and followed that with Vlissides's <i>Pattern Hatching</i>, read those first. Follow those with this, Martin Fowler's <i>Analysis Patterns</i>.<P>As two readings of <i>Design Patterns</i> took my OO knowledge from infancy to adolecence, <i>Analysis Patterns</i> will take you from adolecence to adulthood. Fowler's work does not put together patterns from the <i>Design Patterns</i> book, but takes its time to decompose actual application domain concepts to applicable object models. It will then be up to you to use your knowledge from <i>Design Patterns</i> to create mechanisms that support properly modeled business concepts as <i>Analysis Patterns</i> describes.<P>If you like OO modeling and design, but are wondering how better to apply your modeling concepts, Fowler's book is something you will definitely benefit from. However, make a pot of coffee per chapter-this book is very dense with concepts.<P>Fowler ends <i>Analysis Patterns</i> with some more easily read chapters on application design on a larger scale. You've heard of "n-tier," his discussion of the concepts of "n-tier" at the end of the book are possibly worth reading first.<P>After reading this book-and understanding it's motivations-you will never again be tempted to take "innocent" shortcuts in your application design. You will not be motivated to use "Strings" for "measurements" or "doubles" for "distances." You will look upon your peer's object designs either with a new understanding that they know that going the distance with their object model is worth it-and you won't demand they dumb down their design ever again-and you'll likewise gain intuition about where a simplistic business domain model is going to fail.</span>

                    <span>This is simply an excellent book; quite possibly the best book I have read on analysis.<P>Martin Fowler cheats by actually being able to write. He has a very lucid prose style making this a very readable book (a strength that also manifests itself in his book UML Distilled) even though it deals with complex subjects.<P>The book deals with using patterns to address particular business areas. However, it has a great deal to offer anybody interested in analysis or modelling (whether they are working in the OO world or not) and provides one of the best explanations I have read of the purpose and objectives of modelling.<P>Each problem area is presented very clearly and a number of different solutions are presented at different levels of abstraction (and hence complexity) with lots of useful insight into the factors that would determine the appropriate model.<P>Analysis Patterns is a book that bears reading and re-reading. I frequently refer it as an excellent source of interesting ideas on ways of approaching complex modelling & analysis issues. I have never managed to take one of the patterns and apply it as is; however, the ideas and concepts expressed in the book influence many of my models (even when the business problem I am tackling initially appears to be entirely unrelated to any of the patterns).<P>Frankly, this is a book I wish I had written.</span>

                    <span>Kind of funny, reading the reviews here makes it clear that this book is something of a sleeper, it has not gotten the exposure that a lot of the other pillars of the pattern community have. I think the reason is that people may glance at it and think that it is too domain-specific. In fact, this book does a lot of great things, it is a meditation on some crucial OO modeling issues. <P>The first problem Fowler broaches is a patient's weight and he states, correctly I'm sure, that most programmers would just make weight a class property and make it be of type integer. But there are problems with that approach. First one is the issue of units. If you make it an int you are assuming that it is just a count of pounds. What happens if you want another measure? Furthermore, what happens when someone asks where the patient's weight has gone in the last month. <P>From this point of departure, many issues are taken up. For people who have grappled with OLAP before and know something about dimensional models, it will seem as though he is trying to make an operational into an analytical model, which experience has taught us is not good. But, in fact, there is sanity to Fowler's approach. <P>Personally, if he ever does rev this book (read on his site that he is thinking about it), I wish he would consider writing a section that attempts to hide the observation elements and seamlessly map them back into the object model. Having a separate class keeping track of what the weight of a person represented by another class is does ultimately seem to undo the objectness of the model, but that's a minor nit. Definitely a book that I've returned to many times.</span>

                    <span>I really do like Martin Fowlers books. He is bright, clear, rigorous and relevant. This is his first book and most difficult to grasp book. I started reading it a few years ago and had to give up: it was too abstract for me to grasp. Now with a few more years of OO and pattern experience it shines at me in all its beauty.<BR>This book condenses so much Analysis/Architecture/Modeling knowledge that it is difficult to come up with an idea to tackle the abstraction problem. Examples might help but how many does one need. I guess far too many.<BR>Still I have a wish: Please write a new edition with UML diagrams and sample code in JAVA.<BR>Then I also do have a big wish: I want more of this topic.</span>
