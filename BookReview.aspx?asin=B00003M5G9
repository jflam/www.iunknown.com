                <span id="Label1">Come meet Mark Twain. OK, true, the humorist has been dead for more years than we care to remember, and not many of us around today were alive to hear what he sounded like.  But Hal Holbrook is so spectacular in his one-man performance that you could swear you were listening to Twain himself.  The gravelly voice, the lined face, the slow shuffle, and cigar-induced throat clearings seem so natural that you'll have difficulty recognizing Holbrook beneath the white suit, the gray hair, and the handlebar mustache. <p>  <I>Mark Twain Tonight!</I> began as a Broadway show in the 1960s and was filmed as a CBS special in 1967.  Yet you'd never know it, because the humor, which is more than a century old, is still laugh-out-loud funny today. Twain--I mean, Holbrook--gives a monologue that is rambling, intelligent, and humorous as he culls together commentary from a variety of Twain sources. From dachshund hounds, politics, and patriotism to cigar smoking, memory loss, and religion, this 90-minute video leaps from subject to subject as we're entertained by material that's as fresh today as it was when it was written in the 1800s. <I>--Jenny Brown</I></span>

                    <span>Hal Holbrook does a one man performance of a 70 year old Mark Twain, weaving together the stories and wit of the latter. I found Holbrook's portrayal to be annoying but any rendition of Twain is better than none at all.</span>

                    <span>my only regret about MARK TWAIN TONIGHT is that it's only 90 minutes. holbrook apparently has about 12 hours worth of material that his life shows alternate among. these 90 minutes include his views on man (the only animal that blushes), his mississippi adventures as seen through tom's eyes, and jim blaine's story of the ram and old man wheeler. the ram story alone is enough to be twice worth the cost of the dvd. buy the disk. holbrook is now at just the age where his twain would be even more sublime. let's hope the sales of this dvd inspire him to do another all these years after this 1967 performance. the sound and video are good (for broadcast tv) -- mainly though, holbrook is outstanding and twain is -- twain IS twain. buy it. watch it.</span>

                    <span>I was introduced to Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain Tonight in a high school English class in 1962 and have been fascinated with Holbrook and his Twain presentation ever since.  As the story goes, Holbrook took up cigar smoking to get the timber in his voice, spends three hours in make-up preparing, and has even listened to Edison recording tubes of Twain to get the voice and inflection just right.  Sit back and enjoy tales from a hundred years ago that are just as germaine today.  You'll soon be convinced that the man in front of you is actually Mark Twain!</span>

                    <span>if you have not heard the recordings or saw the television special 'mark twain tonight' starring hal holbrook, you are in for a real treat.  my aunt took me to see the one man show many years ago in toronto.  when he came a second time, years later, i took her.<p>i have listened to the two recordings of mark twain and mark twain tonight  at least once a week for over twenty years.  hal holbrook is not talente,  he is gifted. listening to 'jim and huck on a raft' is so touching to me it defies description.  if hou have ever trusted anyone on anything trust me.  this is not to be missed.  i have never heard or seen anything quite like it.</span>

                    <span>Having seen Hal Holbrook perform live in Mark Twain Tonight, I was delighted to aquire the DVD of his 1967 television broadcast performance.  I have long believed, and this DVD confirms  that Mark Twain Tonight is easily one of the greatest treasures of the American stage in the last half of the 20th Century.  That Mr. Holbrook has performed Mark Twain every year since 1954, in over 2000 shows, is  nothing short of miraculous.  This 90 minute performance brings the wisdom, humor and humanity of one of the most morally insightful men of the 19th century to life.  His words continue to be as hilarious, poignant and relevent in the 21st century as they were in his own time. </span>
