                <span id="Label1"><div>The new C# language and Internet software services have received much of the attention surrounding Microsoft&#8217;s new .NET environment. However, Microsoft has also redesigned the way Windows desktop applications will be created and deployed in the future. Intended as a tutorial for C++ and Java programmers at all levels, this book shows how C# and the .NET framework can be used to develop Windows applications with .NET. As a way to demonstrate how Windows Forms applications are constructed, the book provides a chapter-by-chapter guide to building an image application to view, share, and manage digital photos stored on a hard drive or on removable media. Also discussed are Visual Studio 7.0, C# language syntax and usage, Windows Forms controls, ADO.NET, and other topics vital to the creation and deployment of Windows applications in this new environment.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This is by far the clearest and best way to get up to speed writing Windows Form applications. I especially like the format of the "Action/Result" tables. It clearly shows the sequence of steps required to accomplish the current task described in the book. I also like the eBook format so I can have it on the screen as I experiment with my own development.
<br />
<br />Both beginner programmers and former C++ Win32 developers will welcome this approach to entering the world of .NET and C#.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I last wrote code for a living about 6 years ago (Visual Basic 4).  The opportunity came up to do some coding in C# and I was recommended this book after buying a few duds.  I have to say, as an introduction to C# and .Net, this is the best book I've read yet.  The format is excellent and the project is easy to follow.  I originally got the book for programming controls but was surprised to find that most of the object-oriented programming concepts were summarised well without being explicitly discussed.
<br />
<br />If you need an introduction to object-oriented programming without all the hocus-pocus then this is for you.
<br />
<br />From my experience, get a general C# introduction first.  When you get to the OOP section, start reading this book and complete the project.  Then go back and finish the first book.  As other reviewers have mentioned, DB programming is not covered, but as I'm using Microsoft's data access application block it didn't matter to me.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>No detailed coverage of the Progress Bar control. Reason: so that multithreading and concurrency could be avoided. It is a common GUI programming task to allow a user to cancel a long running operation while keeping the GUI updated and responsive. However, this requires spawning off a separate thread to handle the long-running operation. That thread must also be able to communicate with the main GUI thread. This must be performed carefully but it is easily done by experienced GUI programmers. You won't get coverage of that with this book. Good luck....

                    <span>If you are just getting started with Windows Forms, and want to learn the basics, fine.<p>If you want to develop data-driven real world, esp. enterprise applications, this book is of very little help.<p>The author seems to be a novice in large-scale application design. He can certainly build a simplistic sample program, using as many features in Windows Forms as possible, but I doubt his ability to create even the most basic data-entry app for your client.<p>It's really strange almost all reviewers gave it a 5-star rating. <p>On a side note, I've read quite a few titles published Manning, and am under the impression that "lack of depth" is their hallmark. (Have you read the ".NET multi-threading" one? the author obviously didn't have much insight into threading, much less .NET threading)</span>

                    <span>Ok, I'll admit it. Lately, I've been the type of person who will absolutely swear by reading customer reviews before buying a book. Then after purchasing and reading the book, I wouldn't invest the time to write a review in order to help others.<p>Until now.<p>This book has captivated me, and I can't seem to put it down. Mr. Brown speaks well, presents his material in a logical, orderly fashion, and with child-like ease. I haven't read a book that compares with this quality since Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think!"<p>I especially like the way the Mr. Brown lays out the framework for the book, and encourages you to follow along with the "project". After completing the book, you'll have in your possession one complete, functional Windows Application. You could, of course, simply download the code from the publisher's web site (which, btw is organized chapter by chapter, section by section), but I've enjoyed walking the path with Mr. Brown as he explains concepts, the .NET framework, and what his thought process is as he builds a working photo album application.<p>What's more, I haven't seen *that* many typos in this work. There are some, don't get me wrong, but I was easily able to spot them even before writing the code. If you follow along with the process he lays out, you're bound to spot the mispelled variable names when they do appear. Even if they slip by you, you'll recognize that something is amiss when Intellisense doesn't kick in. Believe me though, these minor setbacks don't even compare to the major headaches one receives when trying to use code from say...Wrox.<p>Believe me when I tell you that you will enjoy this book from the moment you begin chapter one. This book isn't meant to be a reference, but rather, a valuable learning tool that is a joy to read, easy to follow, and rewarding when complete. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning to build functional, intelligent interfaces and having fun doing it.</span>
