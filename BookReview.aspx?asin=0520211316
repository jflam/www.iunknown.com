                <span id="Label1">Following the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution, the  People's  Republic of China gradually permitted the renewal of religious activity.  Tibetans, whose traditional religious and cultural institutions had been  decimated during the preceding two decades, took advantage of the  decisions of  1978 to begin a Buddhist renewal that is one of the most extensive and  dramatic  examples of religious revitalization in contemporary China. The nature  of that  revival is the focus of this book. Four leading specialists in Tibetan  anthropology and religion conducted case studies in the Tibet autonomous  region  and among the Tibetans of Sichuan and Qinghai provinces. There they  observed the  revival of the Buddhist heritage in monastic communities and among  laypersons at  popular pilgrimages and festivals. Demonstrating how that revival must  contend  with tensions between the Chinese state and aspirations for greater  Tibetan  autonomy, the authors discuss ways that Tibetan Buddhists are  restructuring  their religion through a complex process of social, political, and  economic  adaptation. Buddhism has long been the main source of Tibetans' pride in  their  culture and country. These essays reveal the vibrancy of that ancient  religion  in contemporary Tibet and also the problems that religion and Tibetan  culture in  general are facing in a radically altered world.</span>

                    <span>Having traveled extensively through Tibet and Sichuan and Qinghai provinces, and lived in Beijing, I was interested in reading a book recommended to me as "a true look". First of all, the comments of the first reviewer are absolutely dead wrong. Having read the Chinese propaganda, and really lived the Chinese propaganda, this is not it. Rather, it is one of the only pieces of scholarship about Tibet in recent history that doesn't fall victim to the Western agenda of portraying Tibet as sympathetically as possible. This is a complex issue, and both sides have done their best to skewer public opinion in their favor; however, to accuse these men of simply being mouthpieces of the Communist party is doing a great disservice to what is truly a breath of fresh air. For a good look at propaganda, go to a Beastie Boys concert. I applaud the editors for keeping politics out of their writing. I highly recommend this text to anyone curious about the real situation in Tibet.</span>

                    <span>Having read the preceding comments, I find myself in sympathy with all of them to a certain extent (some more than others). Goldstein and Kapstein's informative and challenging edited collection is precisely that - a collection, and includes viewpoints from a variety of academic researchers on Tibet. AS a result, it does not constitute the accepted 'word' on Tibet, nor in fact does it present ANY single viewpoint. Certainly, it does not deserve the accusations heaped on it by the first reviewer, but at the same time, the editors DO come to a particular view of Tibetan political consciousness that not everyone wouyld agree with. That view, if I might summerise, is roughly that the national identity generated around Tibetan Buddhism is not necessarily a prelude to full-blown Tibetan nationalism, and therefore that Tibetan Buddhism can be allowed to flourish by the Chinese authorities without it necessarily generating sympathy for the independence movement). Personally I do not agree with this perspective, and it is clear that the writers are attempting to produce an academic analysis which, as the Tibetan writer Tsering Shakya has recently argued for, cuts a path between the various absolute "black-or-white" political positions that surround the Tibet issue. At the same time, the authors take odds with the widespread view that ALL Buddhism in Tibet is forbidden, and argue that (thankfully) many Tibetans are capable of negotiating a meaningful Buddhist revival despite Chinese communist rule (the extent to which this holds true in the 2 years since this book was published is another issue). As a result, it IS possible to read this collection as proposing an analytical agenda which is not exactly "on-message" in terms of the position of certain pro-Tibet groups, but that is a LONG way from saying that it is Chinese political orthodoxy.</span>

                    <span>I am surprised by a reader's comments regarding this book as being one of misinformation considering that Melvyn Goldstein is one of the (if not THE) foremost scholar on Tibetan buddhism in the country. One aspect of this book, and Dr. Goldstein's point of reference that must be kept in mind, is that Goldstein separates political Tibet from what he refers to as "ethnic Tibet". He is neither pro-communist China nor pro-political Tibet in his stance, but rather gives an educated and informed look at a political situation that, through a lack of reasonable compromise, has escalted to the point that the Dalai Lama will be forced to make some difficult choices in the next few years. This book outlines both the political and the ethnic situation in Tibet and explains how buddhism has played a major role in both. I feel if you want an informed and balanced view of the situation, than any of Goldstein's books would provide you with the necessary information to form an intelligent argument.</span>

                    <span>I write this, provoked by deeply narrowmindede, negative review from anonymous person in Miami. I'm a danish journalist, practicing buddhist through 25 years, finding this book extremely important, because it draws attention to the "real Tibetan buddhism" in Tibet today, where courageous and compassinate lamas (like Jigmed Phuntsok Rinpoche)is strugling to reinvoke and revitalize the rich and beautifull Tibetan tradition. The picture drawn in this book may not be fitting the preconcived ideas of romantic old Tibet or the easy standpoint of neglecting the hard and complex political conditions on the Top of the World in favour of support for the popular high lamas of the exile-community. That seems to be the reason why the book can provoke the kind of anger, expressed in the review from Miami.</span>

                    <span>At first I was not aware of the author's point of view. He has spent extensive time in China and Tibet, and has witnessed many of the upheavels. However, I was amused at first at the innaccuracy of much of his information, and then became disappointed, as I realized that he rather strong anti-religious bias. This bias is not conducive to understanding any aspect of Tibetan life and culture. I would advise against reading this book unless you are curious of the official stance of the Chinese Communist Party.</span>
