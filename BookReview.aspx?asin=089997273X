                    <span>While this book doesn't provide all the information that you will need to undertake some of these 4x4 adventures, the author certainly gets you off to a running start. I use this book to learn about roads in an area I am visiting, then buy the appropriate maps and contact ranger stations, etc. to find out road conditions. It has brought several very cool drives to my attention that I otherwise wouldn't have known about. This book is a fixture in my glove box on trips to the Sierra.</span>

                    <span>I just bought another copy of this book, this for my son's birthcay. My wife and I finally got to use ours last summer and found it very useful. Had no problems following it over about a week, and used the maps it recommended. I recommend it, and in fact this is the third I've bought. We have others in the series, and liked them also.</span>

                    <span>We used this book to plan our trip to the area. We rented a 4WD, since we're experienced owners and planned to take advantage of what sounded like some wonderful adventures. However, we quickly learned that this book was a disappointment. We got lost several times, and found that the directions were not at all helpful. The reference to the USFS and USGS maps should have alerted us that the maps in the book are incomplete. We got straightened out only after visiting a ranger station and getting a totally different map and handout of drives from them. We took the drives they recommended and had a fantastic time. The fact that the bookstores at the ranger stations don't carry this book is a clear indication that it is not a useful purchase.</span>

                    <span>I live in the area and I didn't even know these roads existed nearby. I gave it for stars as I have already broken the book's spine. Whish they had not changed it from spiral bound.</span>
