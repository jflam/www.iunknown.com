                    <span>Fabulous photos and a tremendous variety in decorating styles make this a fascinating look into the homes of Londoners. *London Interiors* features homes of both celebrities (people like suit designer Ozwald Boateng and one of the Gallagher brothers and his wife) and non-celebrities (including some pseudo-celebrities such as designers and internet entrepreneurs.) <P>What the people in the book have in common is their interest and ability to use a space to its utmost/ create a space which really speaks to them personally. These folks are all successfully practicing "unofficial" feng shui, wearing their inner creative hearts on their sleeves, er, homes. Many of the photos of the homes and apartments/studio/work-spaces have the owners in them, smiling away. I thought this was a nice touch, because it let me see the face behind the design/living style, and gave a fuller glimpse/view into the personality of the person(s) living there/using the space. <P>Each (color) portion is foreshadowed by a black-and-white photo of the street/outside portion of the home. An interesting way to say, "you're here, welcome inside," before the color, personality, and personal style beckon and dazzle before you. I thought it was interesting to see that behind the somewhat drab London brick facades, these colorful and multi-faceted worlds existed, normally hidden from view. The next time I'm in London (hopefully someday, sigh, it's such a great city), I will have to make a point to remember all these funky little oases hidden away, and that I've gotten to see them close-up, and vicariously experience going into these homes/studios.<P>Definetely one to check out -- I found it by chance at the local library, and really enjoyed reading it. For the decorator interested in seeing a large variety of distinct, personal styles, each taken to the hilt. Highlights are the kitsch/color/clutter-filled apt of the man in the leopard skin suit (you'll see what I mean :) ), to the completely opposite almost thoroughly minimalist house, with not a stray speck of color or furniture anywhere (besides the ABSOLUTE basics) -- ie: even the bath is made of slate.... rather, three pieces of it set into a wall -- you can hardly tell it's there or what it is!<P>It will definetely inspire you to take a new look at the space around you and maybe give you some nudges in the direction of making some design changes. It is a varied and eclectic book, so chances are, you will find one home or idea that speaks to you the most. If not, even seeing people unafraid to take their design ideas and run with them will probably be inspiring in and of itself. A caveat, however, this is not an interior design guide-book or how-to book. It is just a snapshot view into early 21st century life in a living, thriving London.<P>Since *London Interiors* is one of many products in the European "Taschen" series, there are small paragraphs in italic German and French text translating the larger English paragraphs on each page.</span>

                    <span>Contemporary London is an extraordinary city - endlessly creative and imaginative, vibrant and contradictory, multiculturally unique, paradoxically sophisticated and iconoclastic, sometimes eccentric, but always intriguing. This book is a window on the private worlds of a handful of Londoners whose homes reflect the city in all its spirited diversity. <P>Architect John Pawson and wife Catherine's rigorously minimal, utterly disciplined, nearly color-free home contrasts with the lush, jewel-toned environment of clothing designer Ozwald Baoteng. Peter Hone's extraordinary West-London flat is packed, literally up to the ceiling, with priceless plasterwork architectural artifacts, while interior designer Jonathan Reed's Chelsea loft is handsomely kitted out with masculine antique and modern pieces in the natural palettes of stone, wood and leather. Retailer Sam Robinson's Notting Hill flat is a living scrapbook of vivid, cozy femininity and contrasts completely with Rolf Sachs's light filled showcase of contemporary art and collectible furniture.<P>Not just selected from the expected posh and stylish areas, LONDON INTERIORS shows us homes in up-and-coming, but still gritty Hoxton and Shoreditch, and off-the-expected-path Spitalfields and Hampstead. <P>LONDON INTERIORS is packed with 450 gorgeous pictures showing the infinite variety of modern London living, and with nary an inch of chintz in sight. <P>Jane Edwards trained in fashion, journalism and photography at London's St. Martins School of Art but became interested in interior design while living in Hong Kong and South East Asia during the 1990s. She was a contributing editor to Elle DÃ©coration among other magazines and is the author of a book on Asian interior design. Ms. Edwards lives and works in London.</span>
