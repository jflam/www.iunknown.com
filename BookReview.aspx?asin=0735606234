Exchange leverages existing IT investments through built-in connectivity, coexistence, and migration tools. MICROSOFT EXCHANGE 5.5 ADMINISTRATOR'S POCKET CONSULTANT gives IT implementers a hands-on, immediate reference that will get them through situations and challenges that arise, taking the most concise, direct approach possible. The book focuses on specific case scenarios in support and management of Microsoft Exchange Server. Many tables, listings, and precise, step-by-step instructions that cut to the chase will be the focus of this book.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for an in-depth troubleshooting giude, there are plenty out there. If you have been working with Exchange and Outlook for some time, but can't remember how to do those mundane tasks "helpdesk" does, this may be the ticket. Don't remember how to install or configure AutoAccept Scripts? Its here. Need to move mailboxes (you've done it dozens of times---two years ago), its here. This book gives equal time to both Exchange and Outlook, not something you find everywhere. It is what it is. Don't expect it to be more and you'll be glad that you got it.</span>

                    <span>This book is lucky to get 2 stars. The only reason it did, was because it took Technet and shrunk the pages. It's more convenient than carrying around a Technet CD. There is no new information in here. If you have been using Exchange for a while, don't buy this book. If you have Technet (and know how to use it), don't buy this book. I was looking for a book that would be more in depth and help me out with troubleshooting Exchange. This book does not do that. If you have never seen Exchange and were recently hired to support 20 Echange servers across a large WAN, buy this book, otherwise look for something else.</span>

                    <span>I praise Microsoft Press for producing a book that is so simple to use. If you are an IT professional and want to be a hero, you need this book!!! Better yet you can't live without it. It gives you step by step procedures to maintain your server at top notch condition. I have bought other books that were so hard to understand and use and cost an arm and a leg, but this book and the other Pocket Consultant books are just what you need. I can't wait for the IIS pocket consultant to come out. Microsoft Press needs to produce more of these books for other applications.</span>

                    <span>If you completely don't know what you're doing with Exchange and don't have the patience to read a 700 page manual, this book is for you. I read it in an afternoon and still refer to it occationally. The discriptions are brief but to the point and will point you in the right general direction. You can look up the details on a subject in Technet. Good book to take a quick look at some of the functionality of Exchange 5.5 and Resource Kit.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for handy ready reference. If you are trying to perform a certain function or decipher a properties box, this is the book to have. However, if you are looking for a logical step by step breakdown of Exchange Server 5.5 or want theory behind 5.5 this is not the right book.<P>It is well written for its intended prupose. It is concise and to the point. Just what you need when you need to configure a component of Exchange Server.<P>I have referred to it on six occasions so far and found the answers five of those six occasions. The title is an apt one: The Administrator's Pocket Consultant.</span>
