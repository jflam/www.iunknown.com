Leslie's ability to help the reader understand how to apply the concepts of behaviorism is world class.  This book is extremely well written. The examples bring the concepts to life and you walk away with a meaningful understanding of how to apply behavioral principles in business. This book was clearly written by someone who applies the concepts in taking on real business challenges.</span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding book that supplies the missing link to implementing strategy.  People make all organizations function effectively and efficiently, and it is an element many managers overlook when implementing strategy.  Managers need to identify the behaviors necessary to fulfill strategy, and then align the reward system with these behaviors.  Another important point was the impact managers have on the people in their organizations.  Managers possess tremendous power as a result of their position/rank on the organization chart, and they need to be more cognizant of how their actions impact people ranked lower in the firm.</span>

                    <span>William S. Cook, Pittsburgh<p>A "Universally Applicable" Business Book<p>At last, a book that applies as specifically to families, and other human organizations, as it does to almost any business, "change management" situation or project.<p>This is a book worth reading because of what it is and what it is not, and what it can do for one's personal effectiveness as a leader or parent.  It is a book that will not become obsolete over time.  It deals with the essence and causes of productive and unproductive human behavior.  It defines a rational approach and framework and a "set of tools" for getting the right things done well, through motivated people...young or old.  It is not a book that is heavy on qualitative theory and light on realism, tangible content and measurement of results.<p>It advocates some things as essential to influencing the right behavior - the right actions and reactions - that some will feel are "known" or obvious; while it explains their importance and role in the practice of the right and meaty stuff of leadership.<p>The author provides readers with convincing, competently written methods for moving from strategies, plans and sound, established processes through productive, measurable, committed human implementation.  In most of us, it will require intensive, persistent practice.  The payoff lies in the ability to retrofit unsatisfactory communication, business or family processes and performance shortfalls as well as to get more things right on the first attempt.<p>For review and better absorption, each chapter has a brief, superb " Bottom Line" summary and "What's Next"? commentary.  The Epilogue and "Final Thoughts" are useful reminders.  Appendices A, B, C and D are essential first-reads and rereads.  These appendices are not to be missed if you want to become even more competent than you already are!</span>

                    <span>This absorbing, practical book advocates the use of behavioral science in the workplace to achieve increased profits. This is a valuable resource for those who work in a group setting because it supplies helpful information on communicating effectively within a team. Author Leslie Wilk Braksick structured the book logically and wrote it clearly. She provides numerous real-life examples of how to apply the principles in the text. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who leads an organization or manages people, and to all executives who want to add behavioral science techniques to their leadership skills.<br /></span>

                    <span>This book is a must-read for managers. It describes the behavioral science behind performance improvement, and shows how to deploy behavior change technology to improve bottom-line organizational performance. The first 6  chapters explain behavior principles and tactics such as pinpointing,  antecedents, consequences, shaping, and providing feedback through coaching  (including executive coaching). Many examples drawn from Dr. Braksick's  extensive consulting experience bring these principles to life, and several  appendices provide practical advice and guidelines on using them in  organizations. Chapter 5 on Feedback and Coaching is an especially  excellent "how-to" guide explaining how managers can use feedback  effectively to target key behaviors that will produce key results. Chapters  7 & 8 detail common organizational problems (implementation failures,  and corporate challenges like mergers, ERP implementations, retention and  succession plans) and show how behavioral science can be applied to handle  these problems. In sum, this lively, easy-to-read book does an excellent  job describing behavior principles and how to improve performance with them  in the real world of daily organizational life. Managers at all levels can  learn practical things they can do to improve the bottom line by learning  about behavior, and how to change it so that it produces those key results  necessary for organizational success.</span>
