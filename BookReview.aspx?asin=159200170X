                    <span>I have created dozens of flash websites, but about 2 months ago I had client that need some marketing materials animated on a VHS tape.  I have long wondered about using Flash for broadcast, but never really delved into it.  I bought three books from here on the subject matter and this one was certainly the most comprehensive. While I learned about all the technical parameters of the broadcast world, I also learned a ton of simple tricks to improve my graphic skills.</span>

                    <span>For those of you looking to join the new Flash Production revolution, whether you're a traditional animator, a student pursuing a career in the animation industry or an independent flash animator looking to make the jump from web to television and film, look no further. I have the perfect book for you. Hollywood 2D Digital Animation is THE definitive guide for the new generation of storytellers producing broadcast-quality animation. There are a few books out on the market that discuss the topic of Flash Animations for Broadcast but this book is different in a big way.  This full-color book discusses the flash production pipeline in great detail and features innovative step-by-step digital animation techniques that provide an efficient way to produce amazing broadcast animation. It's also loaded with incredible, original animation and artwork as well as interviews from veteran studio animators. There's even a chapter that discusses how to pitch your content to the major studios. So if you're serious about producing your flash content for broadcast, this is your guidebook! I highly recommend this book to our members at FlashTV and to all our participants of The Greatest Story Never Told competition.</span>

                    <span>Sandro Corsaro recently released his new book Hollywood 2D Digital Animation, H2D, which could best be described as going to the next level from his previous book The Flash Animator, TFA. In TFA the author's point of view is creating traditional 2d animation for distribution on the Web. It is an overview of how to utilize Flash to create animation and publish that animation on the Internet. TFA has lots of good examples and sample files as well as interviews with successful Web 'toonists and has been regarded by many readers as an excellent learning resource. <p>Corsaro's new book H2D has a different point of view which is the application of Flash as a major part of a broadcast production environment. He spends a lot of time in interviews and discussion talking about the typical studio production pipeline and the pros and cons of Flash as a cost saving tool. There is an interesting comparison between "Ink and Paint" applications and Flash. As well as pro's and con's of scanning VS digital drawing. Corsaro and co-author Clifford Parrott also discuss character design do's and don'ts, optimizing Flash's strengths, creating special effects, implementing camera moves, and methods for going from Flash to broadcast. There is minor overlap between TFA and H2D but it is minimal, mostly some of the same art work, otherwise H2D moves toward a different focus which is Flash as a major tool in broadcast production. References to the WB, Cartoon Network and Hanna Barbera as well as interviews with industry pros are scattered through out the book. A CD with samples different from the CD that came with TFA is included. I personally enjoy Corsaro's writing style and I found both of his books easy to read and very informative. TFA is a better introductory book for new Flash movie makers. H2D is a good introduction to taking Flash to the next level from the Web to Broadcast. There is still plenty of room for more detailed and comprehensive books and instructional resources addressing these subjects, but for now Hollywood 2D Digital Animation is a welcomed addition to the current literature.</span>
