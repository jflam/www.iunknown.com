                <span id="Label1">Here's a great big fantasy that you can pull over your head like a comfy old sweater and disappear into for a whole weekend. Christopher Paolini began <I>Eragon</I> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p>  Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. <p>  In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <I>Eldest</I>. (Ages 10 to 14) <I>--Patty Campbell</I></span>

                    <span>This is my third favorite book*, which I read after coming across a review in the Christian-Science Monitor, and I soon after ordered this book from the library, for I myself, like the author of this books, am an aspiring young (fantasy) author.<BR>I wrote this review namely because I was saddened by the fact that the average review had so quickly dropped from 5 and a half stars to four.<BR>Here's the story's plot summary:<BR>A young boy with a strange mark upon him goes off to search for his heritage and/or avenge the death of his Uncle, and later finds himself with odd magical powers.<BR>You've heard it before, you say?<BR>You've seen it in a dozen films, and read it in four times as many books?<BR>Well, of course, but I reccomend one should read it.<BR>The story does borrow from a lot of things, but who's saying a derivative story can't be enjoyable?<BR>This story is actually an improvement on LeGuin, Brooks and Jordan , namely because, unlike those others, who Mr. Paolini is accused of copying, Paolini can tell a good tale. <BR>This story (unlike Brooks' shallow travelogues, LeGuin's philosophical drivel or Robert Jordan's lame writing style) focuses for the most part on characters and character development rather than droning on about what the ale tastes like or the shrubbery that can be found on this hill or that.<BR>And Paolini never read Jordan or Brooks, though the influences of Tolkien, McCaffrey, LeGuin, Herbert, Peake, Lucas, Roddenberry, and possibly Pullman, are evident.<BR>The only thing I had against this book was Paolini's prejudice against the mentally ill (one character, we learn early on, lost everything he had, went mad, usurped the throne, and was since then considered a villain. I must say I felt empathy, rather than contempt, for the villain, and hope the title character finds a way to understand the poor man.)<BR>Overall, great book, with one minor flaw.<P>________________________<BR>*First favorite is Pullman's Dark Materials, second is Williams's Dragonbone Chair.</span>

                    <span>Everybody has said it: Eragon is basically a rehash of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Dragonriders. Well, guess what? It is. Luke Skywalker, Eragon, innocent farmboy whose family gets killed and this crazy old man starts teaching him stuff. Elves, dwarves, orcs/urgals, an ancient language, and a character name that sounds suspiciously like "Aragorn." Magical kid with unusual talent. People who ride dragons (duh). It's all here.<P>BUT that doesn't make Eragon any less fun to read. I mean, yeah, he took some ideas, but give him a break. Not only did he combine them in a new way, but his characters--especially Saphira and Angela--have their own personalities. And he was 15 when he started writing it. Now, I am 18, and an aspiring author also interested in the science fiction/fantasy genre, and I have to commend Paolini for his work. It's hard to write a good story and get it published when you're so young. I haven't managed to do it yet. And his story is interesting enough that, despite my best efforts, I couldn't fall asleep until I'd read "just one more chapter"... until there wasn't "just one more chapter" left to read. If I was that hooked (this coming from a girl who's been known to throw books accross the room if she didn't like the way they were headed), then Eragon's definitely got something going for him. I can't wait for this Sunday, when I can meet Paolini and tell him in person how his book inspired me to keep trying, and kept me entertained at the same time. I look forward to reading his next book.</span>

                    <span>They say one should ask questions if one does not know something and that one shall learn, but... Paolini might as well tell the entire story in an interview if he liked asking and answering questions so much... Eragon asks twenty questions and when someone has only answered one, he asks fifty more. For example, when Eragon is talking to Brom:&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;"Dragons have no beginning, unless it lies with the creation of Algaesia itself... Their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on their silver ships.'&#60;br /&#62;'Where did the elves come from?' interrupted Eragon. 'And why are they called the fair folk? Do they really exist?"&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;That gets really annoying and if Eragon was a real boy, I'd slapped him after the third question. It's probably just me... who knows.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I'll brush away the fact that Paolini's story is derivative from other fantasy novels, but let's look at the view of a person whom has never read any fantasy novels and a close up on the writing.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Descriptions are good, but too much of a good thing makes it bad. It's like he inserted descriptions of places and things randomly and messed up the flow of the story. The beginning chapters aren't very engrossing and I find myself getting easily distracted by things like a piece of lint floating through the air. When I read a well-written book, that sort of distraction does not happen.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The dialogue... is a joke... It may seem harsh,I laugh at them not because they're funny, but sometimes they're so ridiculously corny, they're funny. It makes the characters seem so flat and and unable to relate to the readers.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I really am too lazy to type anymore critisms, since you can read most of them from the other reviwers.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Paolini is a very good writer... with practice. So an advice to you Paolini, go to college like you should of did, take some writing courses and then come back with something we can work with.</span>

                    <span>&#60;br /&#62;Eragon is a wonderful book about a boy named Eragon who discovers a dragon egg, and soon finds himself in a world of magic, wars, and adventure. He travels with his dragon to safety, while seeking revenge on the evil king, Galbatorix, for killing his uncle. With elves, dwarves, and warriors, Eragon and his friends help defeat the orcs sent by Galbatorix. &#60;br /&#62;I highly recommend this book to anyone ages 9 and up.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the greatest books of all time. One might call it good against evil, but the good aren't that heroic. It is a coming of age story where the main character struggles with himself and his own feelings as well as his enemies. A great epic novel much like The Lord Of The Rings, except it is not as hard to follow.</span>
