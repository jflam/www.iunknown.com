                    <span>It is a compact book and easy to read. Although it does not go deep into many parts of the kernel, it kind of makes you feel good that you can grasp the fundamentals in a short time. The chapters are kept rather short, such that you can go through a few in several hours. Contrasting it with The Design and Impl. of FreeBSD, the FreeBSD book provides more depth into how the general Unix concepts (e.g. explaining how sessions work in FreeBSD etc.) are implemented in the kernel. In summary, I would definitely finish reading this book, get the big picture, and then try to specialise on a particular kernel subsystem.</span>

                    <span>Robert love clearly describes many of the important Linux Kernel internal APIs.  I have been working on kernels of different OS's for over a decade.  This book clarified some areas of the Linux Kernel for me.
<br />
<br />This book mostly talks about the 2.6 Kernel, but it occasionally references earlier kernels - mostly to indicate what 2.6 does differently.</span>

                    <span>When I wanted to just refer few things in this book, I couldn't stop with that and continued to read and ended up reading several chapters in one sitting. You will enjoy reading this book, most of all finally understand the big picture and the details. I personally would thank the authors for their work.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Simply put this book is well written. The author makes difficult concepts accessible to even newbies. I own both editions, and the second one is even better than the first. This book would also be good as a supplement to the required text for a college-level course on operating systems where Linux is one of the OSes discussed (as is the case these days). </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book dives into the structure of the kernel and how it works in great details.  It doesn't lose you in technicalities like some books, instead Robert Love keeps it as close to simple english as possible and tries to make it very easy to read.
<br />
<br />I've never read a book that taught me so much about the kernel's inner workings in just the first 3 chapters.  I've now read about half of them and will probably finish it today.  This book is truly amazing.</span>
