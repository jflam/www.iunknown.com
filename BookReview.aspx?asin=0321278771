                    <span>Adobe offers GoLive as a powerful tool to build pages in a website. It is complicated enough that the authors of this book present 200 tips, to perform common and useful tasks.
<br />
<br />The contents pages show a titular summary of the tips. Given that GoLive is from Adobe, it's no surprise to see an emphasis on the visual presentation of the pages. Typical is a tip about writing links in PDF documents, or another tip about converting an HTML file, and any associated referenced images, into a single PDF document. Of course, there are also several tips involving Adobe's flagship Photoshop. 
<br />
<br />Overall, the tips seem straightforward to understand and do. This appears to have been a deliberate choice by the authors. The book is most useful if you already have the basics of GoLive. A good companion to a standard text on GoLive.</span>

                    <span>I have been using GoLive since the Cyberstudio days, and this book STILL florred me on how much useful information it contained. Everything from the "Well duh! I can't believe I didn't know that" to the "WOW" tips are in here. 
<br />
<br />Simple. Consolidated. Useful.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great catalyst for experienced as well as new GoLive users. It's great way to learn all those little hidden, new or forgotten goodies in GoLive, whether you want to know how to be a more efficient GoLive user or want to know what you've been missing and don't have the time to learn. This book is a quick, enjoyable, easy read. I'm already looking forward to a "More Tips & Tricks!" book, but it's hard to imagine they've missed any with this one.</span>

                    <span>I recently met the Author Adam Pratt at Mac Designers Conference this year in Chicago and Adam introduced me to GoLive CS, I was hooked within 20 minutes. Reading this book is like speaking to Adam but instead of 20 minutes, it feels like a 6-8 hour training. The book is simple and effective for the beginner and full of tips and tricks for the intermediate user already using GoLive. It covers the basics from setting up the site to advanced features like creating cool Quicktime slideshows with GoLive's impressive QuickTime editor. The book is filled with great resources such as hidden shortcuts (for Mac & PC), detailed descriptions of each object and there's even a resource listing sites that are full of GoLive Tutorials.
<br /> 
<br />Being a Senior Web Developer and College Instructor, I highly recommend this book and give it 5 stars. </span>

                    <span>It might be easy to dismiss this book as simply a tips and tricks book without any real depth if you just have a quick look at it, but it is much more than that. This book explains in images and short and clear texts how to do something, points at easy to miss buttons and explains what to do with them, and  fills in your knowledgegaps about GoLive. It also adds understanding to what GoLive can do and how to do it. The texts might look short, but together with the images they are quite enough to give you that aha-experience of understanding. I've used  GoLive since it was GoLive Cyber Studio 2, long before Adobe bought it, and today use GoLive CS. I've used GoLive daily for years. I've really enjoyed this book and learned a lot of new things that I didn't know before or have missed somehow over the years just because I've used GoLive for such a long time. I warmly recommend it to both new and old users. It has something for both the novice and the more experienced user. Buy it! Read it! GoLive will be all that more fun to work with after having gone through this book.</span>
