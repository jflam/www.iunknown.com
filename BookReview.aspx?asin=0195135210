                <span id="Label1">The bloodiest day in United States history was September 17, 1862, when, during the Civil War battle at Antietam, close to 6,500 soldiers were killed or mortally wounded and another 15,000 were seriously wounded. Moreover, James M. McPherson states in his concise chronicle of the event  <I>Crossroads of Freedom</I>, it may well have been the pivotal moment of the war and possibly of the young republic itself. The South, after a series of setbacks in the spring of 1862, had reversed the war's momentum during the summer, and was on not only on the "brink of military victory" but about to achieve diplomatic recognition by European nations, most notably England and France. Though the bulk of his book concerns itself with the details--and incredible carnage--of the battle itself, McPherson raises it above typical military histories by placing it in its socio-political context: The victory prodded Abraham Lincoln to announce his "preliminary" Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves. England and France deferred their economic alliance with the battered secessionists. Most importantly, it kept Lincoln's party, the Republicans, in control of Congress. McPherson's account is accessible, elegant, and economical. <I>--H. O'Billovich</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Once I picked up a book entitled 'Heroes of the Civil War' or something close to this. In it  was stated that it was a known fact that there were some 10,000 or more 'Medal of Honor' recipients in the northern army and not one medal issued to the cowardly secesh! Nowhere did it state that most of these medals were subsequently stipped from the recipients nor that the rebel army neither had the metal to make them nor a reason to award defenders of their hearth and homes. McPherson's Antietam doesn't reach this level of claptrap, but is of the same ilk with a 21st century twist in my view. 
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a detail of the battle or how the fog of war played out on this important battlefield, don't expect it here. The lucky Lee was found out, and the sympathetic McClellan beat him back with half a will. Wham, bam, it was over! 
<br />
<br />This book is 98% spin, the winners spin, of course. From a perspective of knowing how the war ended up, it is just a matter of seeing the inevitible. How could they have been so stupid back then? Any fool could see that the righteous north would pull this off. They had the high ground, right? The secesh were basically evil, no? 
<br />
<br />For my two cents (more than this book is worth) I wonder how many centuries must pass before most American scholars will arrive at a balanced view of this tragic chapter in our history. Based upon McPherson, a recognized expert, we have a couple more to go.  </span>

                    <span>CROSSROADS of FREEDOM: Antietam is an excellent study of ONE of the pivotal moments in American history.In "Hallowed Ground"...McPherson's even briefer essay on the battle of Gettysburg...GETTYSBURG is noted as "an event without equal...with the welfare of the republic itself"(p.18);and as what British historian Sir Edward Creasy regarded "the sixteenth decisive battle of the world"...
<br />
<br />The key thesis Professor McPherson proposes is that without the Union's Pyrrhic victory at Antietam(where Federal and Confederate Forces equally suffered casualties approximating 13,000 per Army)the American Civil War may have catastrophically concluded: and Government of,for and by the people perished from the earth FOUR SCORE & Six years from the founding of the Republic, with recognition of the Confederacy by Europe;subsequent"mediation" of Truce;and the end of the UNITED STATES. As other reviewers observe, there had been a tremendous and devastating reversal of Union Army fortune that had put The Army of the Potomac...once within 5 miles of Richmond...on the run and demoralized. A vainglorious General George B. McClellan is fascinating study in megalomania, near-criminal insubordination; and almost"feckless" timorousness. His personal feud with General Pope(and its  consequence for the Union cause)is nothing less than astonishing. McClellans's pettiness; inability to act when "handed" the battle[The Providential finding of Special Order 191 on September 12,1862 stating General Lee's command to divide his Army into four elements AGAINST WHICH ACTION ON THE PART OF MCCLELLAN(...in reversed circumstance,Lee or Jackson would certainly have boldly attempted...)could have destroyed The Army of Northern Virgina in detail, thus ending War];yet ironic and undeniable charisma among his troops which steeled them to fight and "win" the bloodiest single day(of)battle in American history is focal point of this study. Furthermore, it's indisputably demonstrated that President Lincoln was in battle not only with the Southern Confederacy; a vast number of Northern political enemies(particularly Democrats who adopted "the war is a failure" as their platform for 1862 Congressional Election..and which McClellan himself would adopt in opposing Lincoln in the Presidential Election of 1864)but many Officers within the Union General Staff(!).
<br />
<br />Professor McPherson's essay also stresses that victory at Antietam permitted President Lincoln to issue THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION...freeing slaves in "Southern States in rebellion"[as only Constitutional Amendment could effect such a radical"understanding" and mutation of black men's rights (recall the Dred Scott Supreme Court Decision of 1857).] This overtly altered the NATURE OF THE CIVIL WAR itself...as many affected to understand and wage it...and foreshadowed A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM. 
<br />
<br />ANTIETAM...this pivotal moment in American and world history...is typically excellent writing of Professor McPherson. His ability to contextualize and provide comprehensive analysis of the battle and its implications goes beyond mere strategic/tactical military treatment. This is excellent study for novice or serious student going beyond the topically political/historical by providing a philosophical"telescope-in-reverse" describing Plays & Players, who...on September 17,1862...fought to(effectively)save or destroy the United States in a way no Enemy has truly attempted(though 9/11 may have been such an attack)or...with continued blessing of God,shall ever accomplish...

                    <span>After reading the book first and then reading the reviews, I have to agree that the book has it's good and bad points however I think that the title is a little misleading.  I was expecting to read a book that would go into a little more detail regarding this bloody battle.  I think I was past page 100 (Total story pages of 156) before Antietam was even mentioned.  I did gain some insight regarding many of the social and political dramas that happened prior to the battle but when you read the title of the book, that is not what you are expecting to read about.  If you are looking for a book about the battle, this is not the book to get.  If you are interested in a lot of the things that were occurring, especially in England and France regarding their involvement, and whether or not they should recognize the Confederacy then perhaps this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>James McPherson's book on the battle of Antietam has its pluses and minuses.  Its strength lies in its treatment of the political situation at the time the battle of Antietam was fought.  I think he did an excellent job laying out the South's desire for recognition by European powers and how closely it came to acheiving it.  He also reflected well the ups and downs of morale in the North and South leading up to the battle.  His writing style is easy to follow and I found it difficult to put the book down.  
<br />
<br />This having been said it is the battle itself which is the weak point of the book.  While this book does an excellent job laying out the political landscape, it does a poor job of actually describing the battle.  Not because of poor writing or anything like that, it's simply a very short description of the battle.  It basically stayed at the corps level and didn't delve much into the division or brigade level and certainly not much into the regimental level.  
<br />
<br />I think McPherson did well at trying to prove a thesis.  His thesis is that the battle of Antietam layed at the crossroads of the Civil War, in which the momentum that had built for European recognition of the South was stopped and the Emancipation Proclamation finally had the proper political moment to be released.  September of 1862 was the closest the South would ever come to that recognition and the Emancipation Proclamation would change the tenor of the war and swing the political momentum back to the side of the Union.  In this sense then the battle was one, if not THE pivotal moment of the Civil War.  I think he argued his thesis quite convincingly.
<br />
<br />The only reason I gave this book three stars instead of four or even five was simply because I felt it fell short of adequately describing the battle of Antietam itself.  This having been said, I would recommend it as a fine political and military overview leading up to the battle and after reading it would then turn to Stephen W. Sear's book "Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam" for an excellent military treatment of the battle itself.</span>

                    <span>Professor McPherson has written an excellent and concise book about the battle of Antietam, and more accurately a book about the context of this battle in the overall Civil War.   Those history buffs wanting a detailed account of every troop movement, and an hour-by-hour account of each skirmish, should look elsewhere.  If they want a fairly quick read, and a strong argument that Antietam formed a true turning point in the war as early as September 1862, then this is book is right on target.
<br />
<br />McPherson has long been known as a historian interested in putting events in context.  His excellent Battle Cry of Freedom, perhaps the best-known one volume account of the Civil War, doesn't get into the actual fighting until about page 300, and so McPherson's propensity to "set the stage" is characteristic of his writing.  After pointing out in his preface to Crossroads of Freedom the bloody toll of Antietam (more soldiers died in one day at Antietam than on Sept. 11 2001 or on June 6 1944, by a wide margin), McPherson spends a good deal of time detailing the events and the mood of the country leading up to the Autumn of 1862.
<br />
<br />After several military victories in the first part of 1862, many in the North (including several reputable newspapers) assumed the Confederacy was on its last legs, and that by July 4, 1862, the rebellion would fail.  In particular, the loss of General Albert Sidney Johnston at Shiloh was demoralizing.  Plus Union naval victories and the capture of various river cities and ports (like Nashville and New Orleans) isolated much of the Confederacy.
<br />
<br />However, McClellan's inertia and then his humbling defeat in the Seven Days Battle, followed by Pope's disastrous defeat at Second Manassas, changed all that. Coupled with some other victories in the South and West, by the summer of 1862 things were looking up for the South.  Lincoln and Halleck could not coax McClellan to attack Lee with the Army of the Potomac, the public lost confidence in the army's leaders, and leaders of Parliament in England, as well as Napolean III in France, began to openly discuss recognition of Jefferson Davis' regime as a legitimate government.  They waited on one more decisive Confederate victory, and Robert E. Lee marched into Maryland in Sept. 1862 (flush with victory from whipping Pope) to deliver a fight in the Union's backyard.
<br />
<br />Antietam was a truly fascinating battle, with Lee gambling and defying conventional wisdom once again by splitting his army in 4 parts in the face of a superior foe (he was confident the tentative McClellan would not attack him piece-meal).  The famous discovery of Lee's battle orders wrapped around a few cigars is explored here, and McPherson expresses amazement at the puzzling delay by McClellan in siezing the initiative and attacking Lee's disjointed army upon learning of the deployments. As another reviewer notes here, this book often-times excoriates McClellan, and it is sometimes hard to believe in retrospect Little Mac escaped court-martial for his interminal delays, his refusal to obey direct orders to attack, and his petty refusal to come to the aid of Pope at Second Manassas.  In fact this book points out that in the summer of 1862, many (including some in Lincoln's Cabinet) thought McClellan should be court-martialed and even shot, but ultimately Lincoln  knew the only hope to bring his great army to battle after Pope's defeat was to once again reluctantly elevate McClellan.
<br />
<br />Ultimately McClellan drove Lee from Maryland, and inflicted tremendous casualties, leading Mac to later consider this battle his greatest achievement.   His superiors were not as enthralled, upset at him for not bringing in his reserves (he never had 20,000 troops in action at any one time, despite having about 70,000 troops at his disposal) and for not pursuing Lee's beaten army and possibly bringing a quick end to the war. By letting Lee escape back over the Potomac, the Army of Northern Virginia would live to fight another day, and to make life generally miserable for Lincoln in early 1863 at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. 
<br />
<br />However the Union victory at Antietam did enable Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, and it pretty much put an end to serious discussions of recognition of the CSA government by European powers.  When one considers the stakes of the battle, and the immediate ramifications once the one-day bloodfest was over, it is tough to argue with McPherson's thesis that the battle was the true turning point of the war, and a "crossroads of freedom."  
<br />
<br />I enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book, and believe it covered the subject matter in McPherson's typical excellent fashion.  He uses extensive sources including newspaper editorials, private letters from McClellan to his wife as well as his telegraphs to and from Lincoln, and diary entries of people like Gideon Wells, etc. Highly recommended.</span>
