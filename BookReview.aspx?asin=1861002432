                <span id="Label1">With just a bit of effort, Visual Basic developers can make use of Win32 C API function calls to extend the functionality of their programs. Jason Bock's <I>Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial</I> shows you how to write faster, richer Visual Basic applications using Win32.<p> The book begins with the basics of the Win32 API, including system dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The author covers Win32 API declarations and the often tricky mappings between Visual Basic and Win32 C data types. (His tips on using Strings will be indispensable for anyone who has ever struggled with Unicode Strings within Visual Basic.) The author uses a simple file encryption program to illustrate basic Win32 calls for better file input/output (I/O), including reading and writing files.<p> Bock also offers tips for extending user interfaces, including how to customize the TreeView control. Next come GDI graphics calls, including customizing a form's background and using bitmaps for menu items. Tips on setting hooks for your windows and using callback functions round out the tour. Final chapters introduce material on COM that shows you how to package modules using Win32 calls into reusable objects.<p> Throughout the <I>Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial</I>, the author's exceptionally clear prose style--and distinctively personal touch--helps bring the reader along. This excellent book assumes only a basic knowledge of Visual Basic and absolutely no C/C++ experience. It puts the benefits of Win32 C API programming into the hands of almost every Visual Basic developer. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> </span>

                    <span>The contents of the book deserves a five-star rate, but the extremely boring explanations of the author made me downgraded it to a mere 3-star rate. <br>I started to read the book -approximately four months ago- very excited because the contents of the book is something that has always interested me. <br>After maybe twelve to fifteen pages, I had to stop reading it because the absolute boredom the author transmits with his explanations of the theme. <br>I overcame that boredom and continued to read. <p>The book has excellent examples with which to learn the API from; and the author's knowledge is undeniably outstanding.<br>I have not been able to finish the book yet because the annoying way the author explains -as a consequence, my learning of the API/VB is still truncated.<br>However, my proposition is to finish the book because, I know, needed knowledge will come from it.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book about a year ago when I had a need to learn how to use Win32 API.  I read a little, then started to skim, then skip sections, then put it aside completely where it collected dust while I found my answers elsewhere.  I eventually picked it up again after I had become casually familiar with the Win32 API and realized that my remorse over the purchase wasn't the book's fault - rather it was my expectations of what the book was going to deliver.<p>The Win32 API is vast and complicated.  A casual glance at Win32 API books that go over just the Functions and Types (in only 4000 pages) will prove it.  Any programmer looking at this book to solve a specific problem for them should keep looking.  The book does not cover that many specific API situations, but rather explains syntax and structure, how's and when's, etc (metaphorically explaining what the abbreviations for a cup or tablespoon is and how to read a recipe card rather than how to cook any particular dish itself).  I recommend the book as either your first introduction to the Win32 API after you have got VB6 down but before you actually need the Win32 API, or as a refresher for those who know the general gist of how to use the Win32 API, but want to fill in the gaps of what some things are, why they are used, and when to use them.</span>

                    <span>I can honestly say after doing about 80% of the examples in this book,  that I found only about 20% of the stuff useful.  And of all the stuff I  learned I can honestly say that it did not make my understanding of API's  more clear.<p>To me API is something you have to spend some time with.  And  it is hard cause unlike picking some new control and just figuring out what  it does by its properties and methods, API's aren't something you can  quickly grasp (IMHO) by playing with them.<p>I didn't like the 'I will  explain what all this does later', concept either as one reviewer  mentioned.  If your going to write out tonnes of code explain it all before  you move on.  This book doesn't do that.  ALSO DON'T throw pages of code  and more pages and then explain what it all does.<p>DO IT IN SMALL CHUNKS!!  Any developer who writes tonnes and tonnes of code and then tests his/her  program is nuts.  Take it in small steps.  The book doesn't do this and I  feel that was its greatest fault.<p>I'd write this huge routine and sure it  would work, but I'd be saying to myself "what do these 2 lines here at  the beggining with the API call do exactly"..  Then I am coding more  and then the concept is atempted to be explained to me in its entirity..  And I am sitting there "What the hell did I just do?"<p>Well  that's my 2 cents. The good thing is source code is available from the  publishers web site, and what errors there are in the book are easy to  see.. nothing huge (that is unless you are really new to VB then u  shouldn't be using this book first). However, the mutex example was VERY  helpful and I have it in one application already.  I know what it does but  I don't really understand its mechanics...  And I think that's how I feel  about this book in the nutshell.<p>Got some usefull code (not a lot) but  API is still a mystery to me....  There's propably something better out  there..</span>

                    <span>A lot of people have mixed feelings about this book. But i think it really depends on your level of programming. If you are a absoloute beginner to the Win32 API, then forget this book, it'll just get you lost. If you have  a little experiance in the API, (for example, i had used the API for a few  BitBlt functions), then this is a good 'next level' book. If you have no  idea what i mean when i say 'BitBlt Functions' then this book probably  isn't for you. This book is a good reference and fairly useful when  troubleshooting API problems, and it also goes a bit beyond the Win32 API  which can be informitive. I enjoyed reading this, and escpecially building  the encryption program that this book helps you compile along the way, but  as i said before it really matters what skill level you are at.</span>

                    <span>Personally I thought this book was great for progammers just starting out with the API or Applications Programmers Interface. The examples are well laid out and the code is mostly bug free. Yes this book does not have the depth of some other earlier mentioned books, however it is important to  realize that this is a tutorial. Because this book claims to be a tutorial  it should be rated on how well it teaches the subject. Personally I think  the author did a great job and I learned a significant amount from this  book.</span>
