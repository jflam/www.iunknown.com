                <span id="Label1">Carly Fiorina is the most admired-and most vilified-woman in corporate America. Recruited in 1999 to run Hewlett-Packard, the legendary company that helped invent Silicon Valley, she promised big changes from the moment she arrived. She was a marketing whiz at a company that worshipped engineers, an instant celebrity in a culture that preached modesty, and a woman in one of the most sexist industries. <br><br>  No wonder the purists hated her. Yet for twenty years, she had consistently won over those who doubted her. And at HP she believed she could connect two hostile cultures, remaking the high-tech pioneer while staying true to the HP way, the old-fashioned values of company founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard. Her zesty new style would be "perfect enough." <br><br> Could Carly make it? Her boosters and enemies asked that question with nail-biting intensity. In 2001, she entered an epic struggle with Walter Hewlett, son of HP's late cofounder, over the company's destiny and her stunning plan to merge with archrival Compaq. For months Fiorina and Hewlett battled in the boardroom, in the media, and, ultimately, in court. They couldn't stop until one side destroyed the other. <br><br> In this fascinating human drama, George Anders draws on unmatched sources to probe beyond the headlines. He reveals Fiorina to be both braver and more vulnerable than outsiders ever realized. And he discloses the role played by a powerful recluse in Idaho: the only person at HP who could bridge the old era and the new.</span>

                    <span>George Anders' "Perfect Enough...", a history of the Carly-<BR>era at Hewlett-Packard with an emphasis on the proxy fight <BR>over the Compaq merger is a useful book but it is not a good <BR>book. It is useful because it presents how Carly Fiorina and <BR>the HP Board wish to be viewed. This is helpful to those <BR>who wish to understand how to better communicate with the <BR>HP Board.<P>The reason this is a bad book is its poor treatment of Walter <BR>Hewlett, David Woodley Packard and even the late Bill <BR>Hewlett. HP engineers and HP alumni also are unjustifiably <BR>demeaned. While this is unfortunate, I have no doubt that <BR>this reflects the attitude of Carly Fiorina and some members <BR>of the Board. <P>Anders did manage to document a few new interesting HP <BR>anecdotes, but given his sloppy, low energy research, I don't <BR>know how much faith to place in these. For example, he <BR>refers in the book to the most famous memo Dave Packard <BR>ever issued, but apparently did not even bother to obtain a <BR>copy, because it was missing from the archives. Even a brief <BR>visit to HP's computer operations would have resulted in <BR>multiple copies of this memo being supplied by staffers, over <BR>25 years after it was issued.<P>The interesting anecdote is a Carly quotation where she <BR>expresses her animus toward powerfully-built men, as <BR>indicated by their neck size. It is useful to remember that <BR>capitalism requires animal spirits, and Carly's attempt to <BR>eliminate these at Hewlett-Packard, unless corrected, will <BR>bring about HP's destruction.</span>

                    <span>This book, unfortunately, did not have real coverage in the two areas that I regard as most important: quality of sales and marketing execution and wisdom of business investment decisions. When any CEO steps into a position like the one Fiorina did, what investors most want is the highest quality marketing and sales of existing products and the best business judgement available concerning future investments. Anders' famously tells us what the HP Board had for lunch one day but failed to provide insight into these two key areas.<P>There were major failures in both areas that Anders could have warned us about. For example, HP has fallen from number 3 when Carly took over to number 6 in the digital camera market. It was critical to move from number 3 to at least number 2 in this market in order to have a good business here and instead we find she fell to a pathetic and unsustainable number 6. Her VP responsible for this disaster still has his job, apparently with an office near a beach in San Diego. Before Carly, when this general area was a wildly successful one for HP, a previous HP VP lived close to the key HP imaging site in Boise, Idaho. Anders could have warned us this was failing and why.<P>I was also very disappointed that Anders did not warn us about the poor new business investment decisions being made Fiorina aside from Compaq. Heavy investments in "digital entertainment" may provide Carly with an excuse for her hobnobing with Hollywood and music industry people but is unlikely to yield much in the way of profit. About the time he retired Jack Welch (former CEO of GE) mentioned that he had never met Carly. I doubt she has much time for people like Welch that were in the position to buy billions of dollars of HP products because she spends so much time with people that are unlikely to buy anything including Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Sheryl Crow, Oprah Winfrey, Ben Affleck, the Sopranos etc. There does not appear to be a real business agenda here -- it seems social in nature. This obvious perspective should have been noted in Anders' book. Surely the fact that Carly Fiorina has taken her eye off the ball at HP, and this has been going on for many years, deserves to be at least duly noted.</span>

                    <span>This book falls into an interesting category, those books that are irresponsible by omission. George Anders' primary irresponsibility was his failure to point out that Carly Fiorina has never been focused on solving key HP business problems. This was clear in the Compaq merger debate this book reviews where she failed to answer the issues that Walter Hewlett and other critics raised in a substantive way. <P>It is even more true today -- it is clear from her recent activities that Carly Fiorina has essentially given up on HP and HP business problems and instead is focusing completely on personal interests. In reviewing the topics of her last 10 business speeches, only one (her Oracleworld keynote) promotes HP business interests. The other 90% focus on a variety of personal interests - her desire to be viewed as a great humanitarian, gender celebrations, etc. At the very minimum, HP shareholders, who have suffered a loss of 49% in the value of their shares during the Fiorina administration, deserve to have her focus her efforts on HP business. Surely this huge investment of her time in marketing herself as a great humanitarian etc can wait until she leaves HP. It only demeans HP to have a CEO (who HP has paid over 100 million dollars in cash, stocks and options) cost its shareholders 49% plus the time value of money of their investment and add insult to injury by public demonstrating to all her lack of interest in her job.<P>Anders' book could have been a valuable contribution if it had simply emphasized Fiorina's lack of interest in the true duties of her job.</span>

                    <span>There are two sides to every merger and in the case of Hewlett Packard and Compaq Computer, the competing sides weren't just the companies. They include the historians documenting it. <P>For Perfect Enough, George Anders gained access to HP CEO Carly Fiorina and her fellow board members and executives. It provides a full picture of the genesis of the computing deal. Explaining the frustration board members felt at the company's inability to keep up with competitors benefiting from the Internet boom such as Dell Computer Corp. or release a killer new product since the laser printer in the early 1980s, Anders stresses that the board members - and not just Fiorina- were seeking a radical makeover for HP. <P>Peter Burrows' competing book about the merger, Backfire, paints Carly Fiorina as a brilliant marketer and communicator who stumbled into HP after one of the worst executive search jobs of all time by Christian Timbers. Her first two years was good idea after good idea followed by poor execution after poorer execution. The Business Week journalist implies the Compaq merger was primarily a way to deflect attention away from her inability to turn the company around after her first two years there.<P>Anders' more sympathetic account is fascinating at times such as its description of the complex relationship between Fiorina and David Packard's daughter Susan Packard-Orr. But, Burrows' book - unencumbered by any sense of loyalty to Fiorina, who snubbed the author - digs deeper into Fiorina's past by interviewing her ex-husband and childhood friends, thereby providing a much fuller picture of the executive, if not the entire organization. <P>Taken together, the two books complement each other nicely. It remains to be seen if the same can be said for the merger.</span>

                    <span>I came to HP as a result of the Compaq merger. This book provides a lot of insight into why HP does things the way it does, and from where I sit provides a much more balanced assessment of the merger than does the other book on the market. I use the information gained from the book in my dealings with the very much "blue" organizations that still exist within the company. <P>This is still a hidebound company, and the good ol' boys that have been around can't deal with the concept of a strong female leader. And there are still too many employees wearing blinders which say "Bill and Dave's way or the highway." Well, Bill and Dave brought an absolutely staggering amount of over-design into the company, and while that may have worked in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, it gets in the way in today's marketplace more often than not. Kudos to Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anders for not bowing to the pressure from the GOBs and telling it like it is. <P>And to the 21+ people who recommended Bill and Dave's Excellent Adventure over this book - it's time to move on, folks. They did many wonderful things - but Bill and Dave's time has passed.</span>
