                    <span>First a cautionary note: I don't believe in "good" or "bad" in history. Things happen because of the complex interrelations between many factors, and coincidence (yes, it plays a role). So the worst way to read this book is from a sentimental point of view: mean Spaniards conquest and kill good Indians. Just imagine what would have happened if the human-sacrifice-prone Aztecs had conquered Spain (but then again, they had no ships to cross the Ocean).<P>Nevertheless, this is a crucial book, because it tells the story of the Conquest from the view of the conquered. That is needed to fully understand this vital historical process. The book is a selection of indigenous stories telling the event. One can perceive the utter terror and misery brought upon by the destruction of the Indian societies. The fear, the superstitions and the desolation of the Indians during and after the total destruction of their world. Leon Portilla has done a much-needed effort here. He deserves praise for it, and the book deserves to be read.</span>

                    <span>The Broken Spears is the story of the conquest of Mexico, as told by the conquered: the citizens of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. It's a beautiful book that reads something like an epic, with all the elements of tragedy, comedy and poetry. The passages are taken from different accounts and codices and translated into English.<P>It starts out with the omens foretelling the coming of the Spaniards and ends with the elegies on the fallen city. There are quite a few illustrations and poems, all of which are beautiful. Some of the accounts read somewhat contradictorily, but I suppose that is to be expected, as most of these accounts were probably recorded orally. <P>If you are at all interested in the history of the Aztecs, Mexico or Cortes, this book is a must read. It's not so often we get such a glimpse into a conquered people, and this book is a great compliment to books such as The Conquest of New Spain by Bernal Diaz.</span>

                    <span>"The Broken Spears" is a very informative book and gives readers an insight on the Mexican/Aztec point of view of the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish. <BR>The introduction is very helpful so don't skip it like I tried to! Some of the text does get boring at times but if you're reading this book for a college class keep your eyes open and notebook handy, you'll need it to keep places and names straight.<BR>For all those below who hated the book, maybe you're right, but did you understand it and the point for the writting of this book?</span>

                    <span>I just read the book, and i think it is great. It took the account of many indigenas and shows the feelings they had at that time. History should always been told by the two sides. <BR>It is really well written, easy to understand. And the ones who didnt understand it just dont read it, this kind of book is not for you.</span>
