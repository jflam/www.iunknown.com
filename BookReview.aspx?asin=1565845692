                <span id="Label1">Now in paperback, a sobering look at the threats to privacy posed by the new information technologies. Called "one of the best books yet written on the new information age" by Kirkus Reviews and now available in paperback, The End of Privacy shows how vast amounts of personal information are moving into corporate hands. Once there, this data can be combined and used to develop electronic profiles of individuals and groups that are potentially far more detailed, and far more intrusive, than the files built up in the past by state police and security agencies. Reg Whitaker shows that private e-mail can be read; employers can monitor workers' every move throughout the work day; and the U.S. Treasury can track every detail of personal and business finances. He goes on to demonstrate that we are even more vulnerable as consumers. From the familiar--bar-coding, credit and debit cards, online purchases--to the seemingly sci---"smart cards" that encode medical and criminal records, and security scans that read DNA--The End of Privacy reveals how ordinary citizens are losing control of the information about them that is available to anyone who can pay for it.</span>

                    <span>The book was very thought provoking. However, there seemed to be some factual errors when discussing intelligence-related topics that he might have cleared up with a little homework. It amazes me that so little is actually being published on this topic when it will dramatically (and irrevocably?) alter our own sense of who we are and how we fit into society.</span>

                    <span>I think Reg Whitaker did an excellent job in descriving how our privacy can be infringed on a daily basis. The best part is the second chapter, where he explains that the digitalization and the creation of databases are the main 2 causes of "the end of privacy"</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because an author I have read who was recommended on a online news site also recommended Reg Whitaker. I was amazed to see that everything I had learned by reading a novel, "Transfer" by Jerry Furland was for real. I am getting a serious case of the shakes here. I thought "Transfer" was just another book about near term events that may or may not be accurate. Not anymore. I am convinced. Read this book. Get smart about where we are headed. Tell your friends and colleagues too.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Whitaker has done a fine job of increasing my awareness of surveillance and how it can affect my every day life. I have become more careful about the information that I disclose and to whom I disclose it. While computers and computerization are a large part of the surveillance industry, I felt that more time could have been spent on other types of privacy theft and less on cyber voyerism. Overall, I believe that the book served its purpose, assisting me in my professional and private life. Again, I believe too much ink was spent on the computer aspect of surveillance.</span>

                    <span>I save a lot of money using coupons, I always fill out and return warranty cards. I have found myself the recipient of mail I did not solicit and offers that seem to exhibit more about me than I am comfortable with. It seems almost like rape. What amazes me is that Mr. Whitaker (is this a guy thing?) seems to believe it will all be okay-that we won't end up like Winston Smith in 1984, because the power of government is "de-centralizing and power is shifting to the "market". Well, I never get invited to the Whitehouse, and Presidents don't take vacations in my home, or play golf with my husband (Art-my husband-is a scratch golfer-I'd like to see that actually). I don't like what is happening, I cannot answer for anyone else. It is frightening to have Mr. Whitaker state that this seems to be an issue of little concern. I beg to differ. Maybe I'm no Claire Wolfe but I can sure tell my friends to read this book and see what they think. I bet they feel like I do. I'll be telling them to check out Jerry Furland's "Transfer" too.</span>
