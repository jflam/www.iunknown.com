                    <span>I bought this book to learn Actionscript. But, all I learn't is how to write basic actionscript in flash mx. The chapters are boring and will want you to pay real close attention. I had to read 2 times for each specific actionscript tasks. The introduction is good but I was not able to understand anything after hour 5. So it is waste of time.</span>

                    <span>THE BAD:<br>First of all, there are indeed so many errors in this book, it is ludicrous. For example (page 75, number 4) , one script tells you to use "gotoAndStop" but then in the code it has written "gotoAndPlay". If you type in the code as given, the movie doesn't work properly, but if you then figure out that the author really _meant_ to put in the code what he intially said - ie: "gotoAndStop" - the movie works fine.  It's that kind of thing that can really drive you nuts. <p>THE GOOD:<p>That said, I did learn (or re-learn) some programming concepts from this  book and it has gotten me started in ActionScript . I'm one of those poor schmucks ( aka: "a designer") that has been trying to learn programming on my own for six years and until recently, couldn't tell a function from a variable. So the fact that this book got a few programming concepts through my thick skull made it a worthwhile read... in spite of the errors.</span>

                    <span>This book contains very good examples and is easy to follow. It would be even easier to follow if I wasn't having to continuously correct coding errors throughout the book.  If you want to beef up on your debugging skills then this book is great.  I am a little disappointed in the author and his quality control in publishing this book.  It would be a fabulous book otherwise.</span>

                    <span>well, i dont mind the missing cd-rom coz i found the fla files online.<br>ok: so i am a beginner, and i needed a book that would get me running on actionscript. well, this book certainly dispelled my fears about actionscript and i can now read actionscript with fair understanding. <br>but where this book fails is when it rushes to explain actionscript CONCEPTs by giving code and devoting a paltry line or two to explain it. sure, i understand that there is a definite time constraint when trying to teach something quickly, but not this fast!!<br>its pretty good uptil hour 8-9, and after that its jerky. inadequate explanations, and "type this and understand what it means" advise. <p>but on the positive side, ALL the examples are real world and often used. u will quickly come up to speed with scrolling, menus, buttons etc. but..... the concept itself? dunno.</span>
