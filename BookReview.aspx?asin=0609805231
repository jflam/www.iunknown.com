                <span id="Label1">You don't have to believe in God in order to experience God.<br>--- Deepak Chopra<br><br>The celebrated author of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind and The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success has written his most ambitious and important work yet, a runaway international bestseller that has inspired hundreds of thousands of readers to rethink their concept of God.<br><br>According to Chopra, the brain is hardwired to know God. The human nervous system has seven biological responses that correspond to seven levels of divine experience. These are shaped not by any one religion (they are shared by all faiths), but by the brain's need to take an infinite, chaotic universe and find meaning in it. How to Know God describes the quest each of us is on, whether we realize it or not. For, as Chopra puts it, "God is our highest instinct to know ourselves." This book makes a dramatic and enduring contribution to that knowledge.<br><br><br><br><br></span>

                    <span>The book's okay but rehashes alot of the stuff he's videoed and written over the years. He still uses the same tired old terms like "energy and information" never really explaning what it means, and "quantum soup" only deepening the mystery of the mystery. I fail to understand why anyone who writes about "God" has to make this all sound "mysterious". To explain one mystery with another is annoying, probably misleading and certainly lacking in a clear and distinct thesis. For clarity I'd read Aquinas - really! Oh well... Chopra is popular reading for popular ideas in mind / body problems and should really be sold as Philosophy 101 rather than billed as any kind of medicine or healing. Whew... Sorry Deepak. I don't think you know any more about this "mystery" than anyone else except maybe that you're very good at the presentation - as poetry and prose. It's well written no doubt and it's not bad either. I simply didn't get the purpose of the book other than to make me feel good about "God". Touchy feely books about God are all over the place and so are Churches and Temples and prayer beads along with incense and black light posters.<P>Let's hope Chopra write's a book with new material next time. If you wnat some challenging stuff I suggest you read Charles Templeton's new book.</span>

                    <span>Incredible! People supposedly read the book (like the previous writer from Denver) and then seem to ignore the entire premise (which is that we each project the God we need, as the author maps out in 7 general stages. Each God is not false, only that the particular conceptualization reflects only each person's own personality and level of consciousness...). Several reviewers PROVE Chopra's point, by instead holding that the book is bogus because it does not honor that particular reviewer's God projection (i.e., their dogma of ultimate truth)! Take my advice: buy the book if you think you have an objective open mind and soul, read it a couple times in quiet depth, then come back here and read the reviews - it is hilarious! For example, Chopra never said that God is merely the physical universe, as the previous reviewer asserts. The people who protest the loudest are those most attached to their particular God "stage" ("my projection of God is real, the others offered in the book are bogus and flawed. Chopra missed the boat because he does not proclaim supreme my view or those of my guru or favorite spiritual author"). Maybe the book will get through to you? Then you will see illustrated constantly by the people you meet each day. Your response? Humor and compassion? Let's hope so.</span>

                    <span>It is clear that this book draws its ideas from great Eastern books in addition to including examples from Western Culture. It does make a lot of sense to draw interpretations and ideas from the great Eastern sources since they are complete and scientific. Western religions are more shallow and superficial and dwell more in the material world. How else can one explain the Western books talking more about Commandments for living? I think that most critics of this book have a problem because they are non-accepting of different or more complete universal interpretations of God. Most of these people are so immersed with their lives in their world, this planet and following the commandments that they cannot see the rest of the Universe.</span>

                    <span>Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works.</span>
