                    <span>This is a terrific handbook, full of useful information presented concisely and with considerable wit. Is this guy really a lawyer? The photos illustrating the author's points, and the accompanying comments, alone make the book worth buying (for example, a "legitimate expectation of privacy" is humorously and aptly demonstrated by the image on p. 39.) A bonus is the good, common sense advice it contains to help the photographer stay out of trouble, and to allay concerns that otherwise might unnecessarily cause the photographer to pass up good shots. A very good addition to any photographer's library.</span>

                    <span>Everyone who takes photos in public places should have a copy of this book. Krages points out that laws restricting the publication of photographs are different from laws about making those photographs in the first place, and many misconceptions are the result of confusing the two. He also has some good suggestions for staying out of trouble, how to deal with confrontations if they occur, and when to call a lawyer. He writes: "Confidence in knowing one's rights is important when photographing action on the streets but knowing how to avoid upsetting people can be more important." He says that most lawsuits are the result of emotional issues rather than a desire to collect money.<P>If you want an extended discussion of copyright law, look elsewhere-- this book is about *taking* photographs, not publishing them. Good information and advice on every page.</span>

                    <span>Photography is getting down right confusing as far as legal issues are concerned and not knowing what is legally correct and what isn't can make or break your business. So how do you remedy this? You can hire a lawyer, take a chance and hope what you are doing is legal, or you can read "Legal Handbook for Photographers." The author, Bert P. Rages, Esq., is a practicing attorney, stock photographer and writer so he knows the issues fellow photographers must wrestle within the world of photography. Subjects covered in the 123 page book include how local, state and national laws are made, the enforcement of laws, photographing in public and private places and privacy issues. Understanding copyrighted materials and restrictions on subject matter is covered as is lawful and unlawful seizures of your film and equipment. Chapter seven discusses establishing your personal ethics. This one volume could save you much heartache and money. It is certainly worth the price...</span>
