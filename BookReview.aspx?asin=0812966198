                    <span>I am quite surprised at how many great reviews this book has received.  My only explanation for this is that the this author must attract readers who already have considerable historical background.  As one who really wanted an introduction to this time period, I feel the book sped way too quickly through its specialized topics, while omitting important areas.  (If you are going to make the book all about the artistic achievements of the Renaissance, why not at least mention the musical accomplishments of composers such as Josquin and Palestrina?)<p>I completely agree with the reviewer who felt that this was full of name-dropping without much depth.  I felt that the book focused too much on artistic individuals without developing a sense of what Renaissance life was like for the everyday person.  <p>Most importantly, it was very hard to appreciate all the works of the artists mentioned without any pictures.  It was like reading a pamplet about all the works in a museum, without ever going into the musuem.</span>

                    <span>First off I would just like to say that I generally don't like Paul Johnson.  I don't like his conservative politics or his anglo-centrism.  While I admit he wrote two great books -- MODERN TIMES and HISTORY OF THE JEWS, which I've read thrice and twice, respectively -- I don't rate his other books very highly at all, and there are quite a lot of them.<p>The second thing I had wanted to say is this:  Pay no attention to the "Publisher's Weekly" review above because it's a pile of nonsense.  The quote about Leonardo is a misquote.  The actual words Johnson uses go like this:  "There was not much warmth in him.  He may have had homosexual inclinations." -- I mean, if you're going to quote somebody, please try to get it right.  In addition, Johnson's remarks about neuroticism pertaining to Michelangelo was only part of a larger point that suggested ordinary categories of psychoanalytic thought failed to explain Michelangelo's genius, not that he wasn't neurotic.  Also, Johnson does not single out Shakespeare, Chaucer, Kipling and Dickens as the only English writers of genius.  He only suggests that, above all other English writers, they had inexplicable insight into the thought-processes of other human beings.  Finally, the P.W. review says that "dates of birth and death abound," as if to suggest that Johnson's book is hardly more than that -- which is rubbish (if Johnson, on the other, hand omitted the dates, he would then have been guilty of the serious offenses of shoddy scholarship and confusing the hell out of the reader).<p>To address the book itself, Paul Johnson is a non-academic generalist in an era of academic specialists, and I don't think I have to explain the reasons why we need such people, now perhaps more than ever.  His book is pithy and yet thorough.  His insights are, for the most part, judicious and provocative.  The material is well-organized, for in successive chapters he addresses the historic and economic background of the Renaissance, followed by Literature, Sculpture, Architecture, Painting and, finally, "The Spread and Decline of the Renaissance."  For such a small book, there is really quite a lot of information.  One could certainly do much worse for a general introduction to Renaissance culture.<p>My only significant quibble with the book is that Johnson is largely blind to the greatness of the late Renaissance phenomenon known as "Mannerism" (he even fails to mention El Greco's name!), which, knowing Johnson's ultra-conventionalism, is hardly surprising.  For this reason I dread reading what he has to say about Modernism is his recently-published history of art.</span>

                    <span>I am a layman with regard to the arts, but has a keen interest in it, and I thoroughly enjoyed this little work by Paul Johnson.  As always he is opinionated, sometimes infuriatingly so (I notice from the formal reviews that this does not endear him to academic historians), but that prevents his writing from being dull and academic.  So what if he thinks that England had produced only four authors possessing of true genius- it's his opinion and he is entitled to state it.  In this book Johnson gives a concise overview of the Renaissance: why it happened, and the major figures who contributed to this re-birth of painting, sculpture, etc.  And he keeps it short, mercifully- it was nice to be able to finish a Johnson in a few days instead of a few months.<p>Above all, after reading this I want to re-visit Florence, the centre of the Renaissance, with this book in hand, looking for the wonderful art works produced by the masters.  And I am sure that is what Johnson hoped for when writing this book, that it would make readers excited about the art of the Renaissance.</span>

                    <span>This is the first book I read of Paul Johnson's that is not a kilopage tome.   In less than 200 pages, Johnson gave the Renaissance a most delightful treatment.  <p>This book will disappoint those who try to look for exhaustive treatment of any area of literature and art of that fabulous era, or of any of the fabled masters.  But it delights the reader with a short tour of the Renaissance Italy (and to a lesser degree, Europe) by vivid illustrations of some of the most outstanding literary, architecture and artistic accomplishments and the personalities behind them.<p>A most valuable part of this small volume is its casting of the Renaissance in a historical and geographical context.  What brought about this marvelous revival of high arts?  How was it related to the Gothic tradition?  How some "imported" technologies, such as the movable type printing press from Germany and the oil paint from the Low Countries, were enthusiastically adopted by the Italians in propagating ideas and revolutionizing art forms. How the guild system produced successive generations of artists and also contemporaneous competition.  Roles played by local politics and art patrons, and, of course, the church.  And how eventually the French and German invasions from the north undermined the power foundation of this spectacular flowering of the arts, while ushering in the era of Reformation and the Baroque.<p>As a short history book - rather than a subject matter book - I find it informative, illuminating and well worth a couple of evening's reading time.</span>

                    <span>Johnson does a great job of summarizing the Renaissance in a quick 150 pages.  The book summarizes the forward thinking which resulted in a revolution in the sculpture, paintings, and buildings of this period.  Man was outwardly focused during this time and shows developments in Italy and then in the rest of Europe.<br>The problem that I find with these quick reads of a complex subject is they have so little space to explain the subject and adequately make it interesting.  Johnson does a great job in the summary but fails to motivate the reader to other works which expound on the Renaissance.  <br>For those who need a quick read on this fascinating time in history, this is a quite capable book.  It describes the advancement in literature, sculpture, painting, and building of this period.</span>
