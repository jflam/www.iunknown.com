                    <span>I came from purely Windows environment and I know nothing about UNIX or Linux except a few C commands many years ago. I tried a few books like shell scripting, learning the shell and by example, but I gave up as their speed was too fast for a beginner like me. Only after a few intro pages, these books started to write complex commands which I was confused and unable to continue. The worst thing is, most of them don't explain in details what those commands do and expect readers to know. This book does not assume you know basic UNIX commands, and it covers the basics in first section.  It has short chapters and each of them tries to teach you the basic concepts in one area with simple examples. This is the book that gives you confidence to move on and it does not try to feed you with too much knowledge at a time. After reading this book, you are equipped with basic idea of what shell scripting is and able to move on with advanced books.  A very good step-by-step book for beginners who know very little or nothing about UNIX shell programming.</span>

                    <span>Becoming thouroghly proficent in various shells and being able to write shell scripts whether simple or of vast complexity is a fundemental requirement for becoming *NIX savvy.  Whatever your flavor, Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris - you must know shell scripting to be taken seriously. 
<br />
<br />The title of this book, "Teach Yourself Shell Programming in 24 Hours" is no joke. Even if you know nothing of this subject, a couple passes through this book will bring you all the way up to a moderate and respectable level of proficency.  While this book only covers a tiny part of a massive skill, you will leave this book with the confidence and the ability to learn more and more without the help of another book.  Of course, there are more advanced books out there, and it can't hurt to look, but I STRONGLY reccomend starting here.</span>

                    <span>Very helpful book. I first tried using unix a year ago, it seemed really hard. Now after i read this book i understand how to use most of the commands in the shell terminal even though im only 12 years old! Really. <br>P.S. : No, I am not a nerd.</span>

                    <span>it's quite useful on getting you started on shell programming.  As always you'll end up using the man pages to find out various other options and what not.  It definitely gets you started on the right track it is NOT a "bible", however.  After the book gets you going you can just continue on using man pages and other online help though.</span>

                    <span>Great for the first time shell user, but if you know your way around @ all ....... you'll find more info in the man pages --- this is one of those long, drawn out lesson by lesson books.....<br>By the end of the book --- you really haven't learned more than you could from any of the various "bible or unleashed" books ... except this is non-distro specifac .....<br>Waste of Money</span>
