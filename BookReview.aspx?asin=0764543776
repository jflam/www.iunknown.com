                    <span>I bought this book some time ago. My printing is November 2002. I like the book, and learned a lot, but in my printing there is at least one glaring error in the usage of the 'using' keyword. On page 159 and at least two other pages it's used similarly to this:
<br />
<br />using(DataSet roles = SomeFunctionThatReturnsDataSet())
<br />{
<br />     return roles;
<br />}
<br />
<br />The implication of the above code is that somehow roles will magically be disposed when no longer needed due to the fact that it was created within a using block. In reality, it is disposed immediately on exit from the using block.
<br />
<br />The only reason that the code works is that the DataSet dispose method only releases some remoting related resources, and DataSet does not throw an AlreadyDisposed exception (as it should) when methods are called on it after it has been disposed. If that behavior of DataSet changes in the future, any code that tries to use roles after it is returned from within the using block will fail. 
<br />
<br />I posted this on a site dedicated to this book but no one seemed very interested.

                    <span>This is definitely one of my favorite books.  I've only gotten half way through it, because I'm busy converting all of my websites to use the code examples in the book.  I would not recommend this book for beginners, but it is excellent for intermediate programmers.  I read Visual C# first, and skipped around through several ASP.NET books.  I really can't say enough good things about this book.  If you want to learn how to build solid ASP.NET websites using C#, this book will give you a good foundation.</span>

I will make it simple and fast I have been programming for over 10 years and this book was the most impressive 'practical' resource I am ever read. The examples were wide range, but you could feel the entire design process.<p>Grat stuff, I would like to see more in this series</span>

                    <span>The code is all over the place in this book.  It is fragmented, very hard to follow and does not follow the Patterns and Practices from Microsoft for ASP.NET development.<p>I realize the book is pretty old, but here are some major issues I found in the book...<p>-  namespace Vs folder structure Vs project name<br>   varies from module to module<p>-  no step by step to make sure you can actually develop the application<p>-  very sketchy on how to use the IPrincipal and IIDentity classes<p>-  no "here's why we did it this way" descriptions<p>It's just full of gaps and reads more like a mystery than a reference book.  I usually find WROX books useful, but this one what a major disapointment.  I hope that people consult the Microsoft docs before they use these approaches.</span>

                    <span>Well, this is a very good application creation. If you download the code and simply use it. You will have just some minor adjustments to make in web.config file and IIS manager. But, if you want to do it yourself, read every chapter and write down the code. Fiouuuuuuuu!!! Good luck. I tried it and with many help from the wrox forum I just finished it. <br>So many errors in this book. It's why I canno't give this book 4 or 5 stars. The stuff in it is very professional and working with it is very pleasant but when I buy a book it's for reading and trying it, not for downloading code and running this one.<p>So keep in mind if you buy this pro book, very good programming concept but poor writing.</span>
