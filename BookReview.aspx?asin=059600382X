                    <span>I'll start with the good news: The Fifth Edition of this book does contain a few new pieces of information, and has also undergone a *very mild* visual update in the form of new "In this chapter" table-ettes on the first page of each chapter.
<br />
<br />Paradoxically this book's "In this chapter" table-ettes illustrate one of the chronic problems that exists throughout the entire O'Reilly "Complete Reference" series -- an apparently theological aversion to providing simple cross-references to the specific page or pages containing cited material.  Similarly (and every bit as annoying), the concise descriptions of the html tags contained in this book's alphabetically ordered index painstakingly omit a simple x-ref back to the pages that more fully describe the tag.
<br />
<br />The second chronic failing of this book (in fact, the entire O'Reilly "Definitive Reference" series) is the near-total absence of useful examples.  I suppose one could argue that a self-described "complete reference" is above such things, but some concise examples of how the referenced material does useful work would greatly improve the information transfer capabilities of this sort of book.
<br />
<br />In the end, this book would be so much more useful and usable as a "complete reference" if only it had some simple x-refs and a few illustrative examples.  As it stands, this book is  reasonably useful if you also happen to have (a) a grasp of HTML and XHTML fundamentals in the first place, and (b) access to supplemental resources such as Internet search to fill in the gaps left by the non-existent examples.  (And oh yes, the patience to thumb back and forth from page to page in lieu of actual printed cross references...)

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fat book with a lot to like in it. The authors thoroughly explain HTML (and its recently-standardized twin XHTML) in its latest version (4.01). They also give a good explication of layout using the current standard (CSS2) of Cascading Style Sheets. They spend some time talking about embedded content such as pictures, Java applets and Javascript scripts. They look, too, at XML, which is the "meta-language" used to define XHTML.
<br />
<br />At the time they wrote this book (2002) the versions of the standardized languages they discuss were in the avant-garde. But many of the old ways of doing things are now obsolete, and older browser versions gone. Unfortunately, the authors constantly advert to these early browser versions and their quirks, and spend much time discussing outmoded and non-standard techniques that by their own admission should be avoided. (Let me emphasize that they whole-heartedly approve of the direction away from non-standard and layout-laden HTML and toward the CSS approach.)
<br />
<br />As it is, this book is quite usable whether you are writing old-fashioned HTML and loading your documents with physical layout instructions, or writing austere strict-version XHTML and restraining yourself to using style sheets to do layout. It has detailed essays on all the tags and a good chapter on CSS, and has useful appendices at the end for HTML grammer and tags, and for style sheet properties. It also has much that no longer applies. Perhaps the next edition will be less universally useful -- but also lighter.</span>
