                    <span>First of all I have to confess that this book was acquired under the conditions that I probably know 90% of the materials covered in the book. Thus my interest is in the 10% I am not aware of and the other 10% if there are alternative ways to solve problems better than I am doing now.<p>In this regards, I am satisfied. However if you are looking for learning simple "how-to"s like conditional formula, creating a chart, you would be disappointed since this book covers too much depth for beginners and it becomes easy to get lost in the sea of information.</span>

                    <span>The "Read Less - Learn More" trademark on the cover encapsulates the essence of what any reader can get out of this very non-traditional software user's guide.<p>Although I am an MBA grad and am knowledgeable of data analysis techniques, I had always considered myself a novice user of Excel. I recently found myself in a predicament where I had to quickly learn the more complicated Excel features of data analysis in preparation for an interview for a position with a market research firm.  In a panic, I went to the local B&N bookstore and bought a copy of the old stand-by Dummies Series- "Excel Data Analysis" (I'll refer to it as "DS"), as well as the book in this review (I'll refer to it as Visual Blueprint, "VB").  <p>The thing about this book that really appealed to me was the logical and clean (uncluttered) explanation of each of the topics presented.  It's a very user-friendly manual to follow along with the use of a computer (to go through the exercises).<p>Progressive screen-shots are always located at the bottom half of each page, in successive order from left to right with clearly labeled numbered steps to follow.  The examples that are shown in the screen shots are simple but very illustrative.  <p>On the top half of each left page is an introduction of the topic being covered and what the main processes are to accomplish the particular task. On the top half of each right page are additional methods of application and extra hints and descriptions of the syntaxes for functions that can be used.  <p>The arrangement of the graphics and the text work very well together and allow the reader to efficiently grasp each of the concepts being presented.  What would normally be covered by a traditional user's manual in five to ten pages (reading from top to bottom- large text sections interspersed by graphics), this reference does the same in either two pages or four pages maximum.  The way the editors have laid out this manual was very clever; not only does the reader have a lot less pages to get lost in (especially when trying to work through the examples with a computer) but also the topics are presented concisely and as simply as possible. <p>I relied heavily on this book to prepare myself for an Excel test given by the company I was interviewing with.  I spent at least 90% of my time referring to VB, and where necessary, I spent 10% of my time referring to DS for supplementary information.  I studied over a period of one week and passed the test well enough to be hired!<p>As enthusiastic as I am about this book, it is far from perfect with regards to being an ultimate and comprehensive manual for Excel.  (That said, however, the Appendices are full of useful information...keystroke and navigation shortcuts as well as a handy reference for VBA and function syntaxes / commands....much more than is included in DS.)  Additionally, as another reviewer had written previously, I can corroborate that I had found a few minor errors (formula calculations in examples, syntaxes), but not in such a large amount as to dissuaded one from using this book. My other negative is that the examples provided on the included CD were poorly referenced in the Manual; some examples, I couldn't find on the CD.  Again, this didn't happen often.   <p>I gave this book a perfect score, not because it is an authoritative and fully comprehensive manual on Excel Data Analysis (it isn't), but because it delivers on empowering readers to learn the software in much less time than traditional manuals can deliver.  VB is quick and dirty- but it works!</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book because I am preparing for the MOUS Exam and it appeared to have a different layout than the standard MS-sponsored book; I thought I might pick up an extra nugget or two. After having read through about half of the book, I can say that I am disppointed in the quality of the text. Maybe I have become too accustomed to American literary technique (Microsoft, Dummies, etc.), but in my opinion the flow is course and dry, even for a computer tutorial. Knowing approximately 75% of the content already, I sympathize with anyone picking this up for the first time.<p>However, the most frustrating aspect of the book by far is the errors that exist throughout the book, especially in regards to coding mistakes. With more time, I would actually list the dozen or so I have already found. Let's just say when you are explaining something "relatively" complex, like conditional formulas (hint, hint...), the coding example should be accurate, not completely opposite of the correct method. This, and many other examples, confused me so much I had to do them myself in Excel just to prove I wasn't losing my mind.<p>The book has great potential as an alternative to the standard MS Press release. However, when you're competing against the other guys, you have to be perfect. This book is definitely not.</span>
