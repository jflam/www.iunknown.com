                <span id="Label1">Sarah Susanka contends that people are naturally drawn to intimate spaces. Large structures inspired by outdated patterns tend to result in houses that just don&#146;t work. In The Not So Big House, she proposes clear guidelines for creating homes that serve spiritual needs as well as material requirements. Topics covered include designing for specific lifestyles, budgeting, building a home from scratch, and using energy-efficient construction. With more than 200 color photographs as well as floor plans, the book is perfect for homeowners ready to rethink their space. &#147;Susanka says to evaluate what makes you feel at home and let your activities define your rooms.&#148; &#151; San Francisco Chronicle</span>

                    <span>Don't just look at the pictures, READ the book! The text is just as good as the pictures! Realtors and developers `(natural dislike) love to tout "square footage". This book shows what skilled craftsmen can build for people with intelligence. I like the common sense approach to really analyzing what your needs and expectations are in a house. The real shame is the lack of respect trained trades-people receive in parts of this country. I took advantage of the good Mid-West (MN-early 70s) vocational school system after my military tour. On moving to Southern California, I quickly realized that my special carpentry skills were not needed or wanted by the local market. I then finished a Bachelor's degree and went into const. management. This book made me dust off my Stanley (hand saw) mitre box, "real" framing square, and start tearing out painted wood and drywall in my house to make it a real "home". A must have for the home library!!</span>

                    <span>It would be a mistake to think that this clever title reflects an eco-sensitive philosophy. Here are key sentences that show the author's mindset: from page 15, "While you might be able to afford a 6,000-sq.-ft. house, you may find that building a 3,000-sq.-ft. house that fits your lifestyle actually gives you more space to live in"; from page 37, "Another client, living alone in a brand-new 5,000-sq.-ft. house, called me because she wanted to plan an addition. . . . Rather than add on, we reconfigured part of the existing space by opening up the maze of rooms into an open, public space"; and on page 182, "Sustainability does not mean that we should give up any of the hard-earned comforts that we have come to expect in the modern world." This is a book for the rich and the eco-insensitive. If your idea of appropriate cost size is a quarter million dollars or more, this is an idea book with seductive pictures. But if you care about the world in which your grandchildren will live, don't buy into this mindset, and don't buy this book.</span>

                    <span>Susan Susanka presents her ideas on how to build a better home. Half way through the book she presents her trinity of compromises that the architect, builder & home-owner have to make...price, quanity & quality of the proposed home. I think this is the gem in the book. As many have noted, this is definitely not a book for a "small" or "cheap" home; and this should be obvious as nobody who is limited to building a "small" or "cheap" home would hire an architect to design it! Though she never states it, I estimate that the houses she designs cost over $500,000 to build so consider that when you read this book.<P>I value this book for the ideas it presents; however, it is definitely a coffee-table book rather than a reference for an architect or home-builder. Not until the last two super-homes does Susan even mention a number. Nowhere in the book does it actually talk about the square feet, total price, price for materials, cost/square foot, material trade-off possibilities, building codes, or anything that is actually needed to design or build a house (or even remodel). The lack of details and thoroughness was disappointing and the reason I only gave her three stars. I suppose this book can be considered a "theory" book rather than a "practical" book, but it seems to me that a well-written book could contain both.<P>On the plus side, the pictures were very nice; there were floor-plans for each of the houses and Susan has a very nice and clear writing style.</span>

                    <span>Let's see....2000 square feet is considered "not so big." And working one's way up -- oops, I mean down! -- to that modest allotment of space requires spending at least six, more like seven figures. And, supposedly, this fits under the philosophy of "simpler living."<P>What sort of people buy into this? Bourgeois bohemians, of course, a subspecies wittily described in "Bobos in Paradise" by David Brooks.<P>These are people with lotsa dough who live in nice neighborhoods and drive nice cars. But they're not rich, you see. They're "progressives" (read: liberals). So, in order to assuage the subconscious guilt they suffer for the "sin" of their own affluence, they drop loads of money on expensive stuff that's no different in quality from many cheaper brands, but merely has "progressive" cachet. You know...REI and L.L. Bean clothing ("environmentally aware"), coffee that costs $12 a pound (because it's "fair trade"), and just about anything that comes out of the public radio tchotchkes catalogue.<P>Susanka's book has kicked this up the ultimate notch. No longer is buying a high-priced Saab or Volvo the ultimate in pretense to "conscience" while indulging oneself. Now the bobos of America can take out second and third mortgages to cover what their six-figure incomes won't and build the "not so big house" of their dreams. Hey, it's not the money that's important. It's "feeling good about your choices."<P>Susanka, Obolensky, and anyone who gave this book a good review are welcome to trade their huge houses for my one-bedroom, second-floor apartment in a working-class neighborhood with no off-street parking. They can then acquaint themselves to their hearts' desires with the reality of "modest living."<P>As for me, I'll buy lots of cool stuff and fill up their former abodes. I've got better things to do than wring my hands over my "ecological footprint." And for my housewarming party, I'll be barbecuing up a few spotted owls, bald eagles, dolphins, and baby seals in that spacious back yard.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I are preparing our 5-year old, sterile house for sale with the intention of buying an older bungalow. We'll be looking for slightly smaller houses, since we've found that so much of the space in our present house is really wasted. We won't be building from scratch or even remodeling, but the philosophy of design in this book is really helpful to us as we think through what we want and need in our next house. I think the basic Not So Big concept is sound for any budget: square footage means little, rather, utility and comfort is paramount. The book is teaching us to think in terms of spaces rather than rooms, of getting the most possible use and enjoyment from a space. I think it will definitely help us train ourselves to see the possibility in houses we look at in our search.</span>
