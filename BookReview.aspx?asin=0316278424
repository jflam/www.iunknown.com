                    <span>In "The Last Amateurs" (a title that sounds like it could be a Bruce Willis film title), author John Feinstein ("A Good Walk Spoiled" and "The Majors" to name a few), returns to his true love, college basketball. In revisiting a subject that he last broached in his "expose'" of Bobby Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers in "Season on the Brink", Feinstein proves very quickly that this book is a labor of love and that he is indeed a true fan of the sport. <P>His subject matter is the 1999-2000 basketball season of Patriot League members, Navy, Lafayette, Lehigh, Army, Bucknell, Colgate, and Holy Cross. Although I consider myself a serious fan of college basketball, I must admit, I knew very little about this league or its teams until reading this book. Having grown up a fan of Big Ten basketball, I'm not sure I could have identified the states, let alone the cities, that these Patriot League teams called "home". And, while I was certainly recognized the names of the league best known coaches, Ralph Willard and Don Devoe, the rest of the leagues coaches and players toiled away in basic anominity.<P>Feinstein changed all that.<P>His description of the dedication and effort that these teams put forth every year, with little national recognition, was intriguing. He drove you to get to know these players and coaches better. And, along the way, gave the reader a vision of what college basketball (and athletics) should really be about - working toward graduation and playing for your school's pride (instead of playing to impress NBA scouts). This is the purist's view of college basketball and it was refreshing to read!<P>I would encourage any fan of college athletics to give this book a try. In a sport where one's allegiance to his school lasts only until agents come knocking at his door, it is refreshing to read about players who genuinely care for one another and their alma mater. To read about these true "student-athletes" (who worried about missing classes and took course work with them on road trips) is a tremendous breath of fresh air.</span>

                    <span>As graduate of Bucknell, I was very pleased when I heard that John Feinstein had decided to focus his next book on the Patriot League. For all Patriot basketball fans, I think the book provides a certain degree of vindication - The Patriot League does play entertaining basketball on the outskirts of the big time, without the felonious behavior and coddled athletes of the larger conferences. Better still, once a season we get to see ourselves on ESPN, in the conference championship. I'd venture that all of the Patriot schools quietly root for whoever makes the NCAA tournament in hopes finally getting that first elusive upset.<P>That said, is Feinstein's book a good read? For me, as an alumnus it was great to hear a respected journalist's perspective on the conference. However, when friends that didn't know anything about the Patriot League asked me about the book, I found it hard to recommend it. It occasionally reads like a long Sports Illustrated article, and the descriptions of game play are quite repetitive by the season's end. I bought the book as a gift for my college roommates from way back when, but I don't know if it could hold the attention of someone who wasn't as familiar with the league.</span>

                    <span>He basically just rehashes the season. I didn't really feel connected to the players, coaches or schools. Some of the material that discussed the Army program, gave me a good sense of place, but that was about it. It would have been wonderful to learn more about the day to day lives of these impressive young men. Sitting around and talking hoops with them while they ate dinner after practice--seeing them at home on vacation. That type of thing. None of this really came through.</span>

                    <span>John Feinstein took the time to get to know the coaches, players, and competition style of the Patriot League, and makes a valiant effort to present the PL experience. Having read the book, I feel like I know the "flavor" of the Patriot League, perhaps as well as I know the flavor of my own ACC (Maryland graduate and diehard basketball fan, class of 1987). Feinstein really communicates the feel of being in the PL: the love of the game, but all in balance with academics and the rest of life. These schools, these players, this league, are all of very high quality of character, and glorifying high character quality is certainly a worthwhile endeavor.<P>However, for anything beyond the general feel and character of the league, Feinstein's occasionally brilliant, frequently overly-detailed writing gets lost in the horrible disorganization of the book. Feinstein says he follows a season in the PL, and that's certainly true. The trouble is that the league has seven schools, seven coaches (and multiple former coaches), seven athletic directors, seven school presidents, seventy-or-so players, and each school plays 20-odd games per season. Most of those mean little or nothing to the average reader who would pick up this book. While Feinstein, having lived the season, watched the games, and developed relationships with the people, can keep them all straight, I don't know Fran Fraschilla from Ralph Willard, and I don't remember which one coaches where, and I couldn't tell the difference between Lafayette and Lehigh. Feinstein does absolutely nothing to make these clear to the reader.<P>It seems to me that the obvious organization for telling the much needed story of the Patriot League would have been to write about each team, individually, over the course of their season. Then, after that, use the conference tournament as a means for tying the seven stories together. Instead, Feinstein wrote it as he lived it -- a game at Colgate means telling about them, then off to Holy Cross, over to Bucknell, down to Navy, back to Colgate -- oh they're playing Bucknell, gotta tell more about them... Meanwhile, readers are going crazy trying to figure out which team is which, which coach goes with which school, which player goes with which coach, etc.<P>The result of the disorganization is utter confusion. It is telling that what I remember best from the book is a quote from Duke's Coach K (who was a former Army coach, but the quote is from his time at Duke). He spoke glowingly to his players about the high quality of the character of the players on the Navy team, and then emphasized the need to BEAT them, because they're NAVY and he was ARMY. Which is a great story, but why do I remember that better than any of the actual Patriot League stories? Because I was so lost in the whos, wheres, and whichs of Feinstein's disorganization.<P>There are excellent anecdotes, funny stories, and character-telling quotes and actions described throughout the book, and for that, it's worth reading. But, I recommend one of two ways for reading: Either 1) read lightly, look for the good stories and ignore the flood of names, dates, and details; or 2) take notes as you read, and make a list of a) school, b) coach, c) other school administrators or former coaches, and d) players, just so you have a handy reference sheet to keep them all straight when Feinstein refers back to someone he wrote about 150 pages ago.</span>

                    <span>Having read all of Feinstein's previous books (and most of his articles) I was an eager purchaser of this book. I was living in Germany at the time and my NCAA tournament addiction was suffering greatly, so I was hoping for another ACC or Bobby Knight sort of book. Needless to say, I was disappointed.<P>John tries to create an image about this league that simply isn't there. Is it nice that the league has certain rules that create a more academic regimen? Sure. . .but only if they enforce it on ALL the teams in the conference. Is it good that there is a 100% graduation rate for most of the schools? Sure. . .but only because most of them will never play in the NBA. Heck, the one kid in the book that was a legitimate NBA prospect left after his sophomore season. Is it a nice story to see the small schools play the Dukes and UNC's of the world? Sure. . .but the truth is that the small schools want the money and the big schools want the 'W'.<P>Let's not kid ourselves. College hoops is a business. I would love to see truly amateur athletics come to the fore again, but it won't happen. There is too much money to be made and Mr. Feistein knows it. Amateur athletics sells. . .why do you think he wrote the book?</span>
