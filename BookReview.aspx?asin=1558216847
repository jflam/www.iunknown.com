                    <span>This emotionally riveting often poignant story recaps the arrest, trial, and sentencing of Polish officer Slavomir Rawicz by the Soviets after they annexed Poland during the WW II era. But wait, that is just the first chapter!!<P>One year later, Rawicz and six other partners in crime escape from the oppressive Siberian labor camp where they were imprisoned (with help from a most surprising source). With a sentence of 25 year hanging over his head Rawicz figured he had nothing to lose. The escapees came from different ethnic backgrounds but were united in one common accord. Escape, The duty of every prisoner.<P>They start out over the long trek across Siberia toward British controlled India. Along the way they endured starvation, sickness, exposure to freezing elements, the heat and thirst of the Gobi desert, and many other plights. Imagine crossing the Himalayas in the winter with no protective clothing and very little food and no way of melting snow for water. But through it all they never lost their desire for freedom. THEY WOULD RATHER HAD DIED IN THE WILDERNESS AS FREE MEN THAN LIVED AS PRISONERS OF AN EVIL EMPIRE CONVICTED OF CRIMES THEY NEVER COMMITTED.<P>And as a teaser to get you to read the book I ask: And what about the Yeti? Did you believe it?<P>I don't give a lot of 5 star ratings but this one is well earned.</span>

                    <span>I discovered this book through a rave review from The Common Reader which also signalled that it was back in print finally. As others have recounted, the book tells the incredible tale of the prisoners' escape from Siberia (and the harrowing journey to get there) as they cover 30 miles a day on their way to India. It's amazing the level of detail the author is able to recall and the hospitality of the Mongols and Tibetans he met along the journey. Reduced to starvation and exhaustion (especially after the harrowing crossing of the Gobi Desert), they exist meal to meal looking for food and water. Even in this state, their humanity shines through as they grieve for the ones who died on the journey (the story of Kristina is one of the most touching you'll ever read) and push each other as they climb the Himilayan peaks in shabby clothing and moccasins. An incredible tale of survival and determination, well written and well recalled. Inspiring and life changing.</span>

                    <span>There have have been questions about the truth od this book. What rings true is the deep emotional turmoil of the author as he hangs on to his hatred for his tormentors, and there's no doubt thess dark passions helped spur him on during his long and often seeminly endless trek. It's a sad book. An amazing journey of the mind and the soul can be found in IN THE GHOST COUNTRY by Peter Hillary, a mind-bending account of his haunted journey to the South Pole. Deep stuff.</span>

                    <span>This book purports to describe the travels of a polish<BR>officer in 1942 escaping from Siberia across China and<BR>into freedom in India. As a travel book, it doesn't<BR>hold up. As anyone who has travelled to these areas can<BR>tell you, no small unsupported group of people is going<BR>to just walk across those deserts without water or cross through<BR>Tibet north to south during the coldest months of the year.<BR>There are no landmarks to speak of presented in the book that<BR>in any way line up to the geography of where he claims to have<BR>gone. Beyond that, his story of escape from the russian camp is pure unbelievable melodrama. And for good measure, it contains<BR>a bigfoot (or snowman) sighting near the end.<P>I suppose a few people will believe that some of the worst<BR>deserts in the world are just there to walk across or that<BR>you can just kind of find your way over the Himalayas during<BR>the coldest part of the year to India.<P>I also couldn't help but wonder where his companions ended up<BR>after. Did they all just fall off the face of the earth<BR>after arriving in India? And on a journey like this, why would<BR>you only know one of your companions as "Mr. Smith". Most people<BR>would learn the entire life stories of the others on a trip like<BR>this supposedly was. Or at the very least learn the names of<BR>those your moving with.<P>If you want to read real survival stories, try something<BR>about Shakelton or the book Great Heart.</span>

                    <span>This book is the story about a young Polish officer who is imprisoned and tortured by the Soviets. In a mockery of a trial he is sentanced to twenty-five years in a Soviet prison camp. It is here the real story begins.<P>In the middle of Siberia, this Polish officer plans the unthinkable: escape! He selects six other companions to attept this act of deparation with him. In planning his escape, another reviewer indicates that he receives help from an unexpected source. You will not believe who assists him in his quest for freedom!<P>The balance of the work deals in the trek across Siberia, Mogolia, the Gobi desert, and finally the Himalayas.<P>In the annuals of human history you would be hard pressed to indentify a person whose sigle mindedness approaches Slavomir Rawicz.<P>This is a terrific book!</span>
