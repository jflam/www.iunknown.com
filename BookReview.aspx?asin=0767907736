                <span id="Label1">Your home is an extension of yourself; therefore, when your home is in turmoil, your life is in turmoil.  However, when you attend to your home, you begin to feel less hurried and more in tune with the world around you.  There is delight and calm to be found in the midst of washing dishes or changing the water in a vase of flowers; there is pleasure to be experienced in the repetitions of daily life.<br><br>In<b> Sweeping Changes</b>, Gary Thorp shows how the principles of Zen can bring harmony and peace to your life at home.  You don&#8217;t need special surroundings or to sit quietly in a formal posture to achieve the tranquillity of Zen; you can find it anywhere&#8211;in the action of dusting a shelf, organizing your closet, or feeding your cat.  As Thorp conveys in sparkling prose, many everyday activities provide an opportunity for Zen practice, satisfaction, and spiritual growth.  Whether you live in a small room, an apartment, or a palace, this delightful, insightful book will not only change your feelings toward housekeeping, it will help you see your home, and your place in it, in a new and nurturing light.<br></span>

                    <span>I've seldom read such kind hearted and helpful wisdom as Gary Thorp offers in Sweeping Changes. Read this book and then watch the everyday "ordinary" moments of your life become embued with meaning and deserving of profound respect. You'll never look at dust or think of water in the way you once did. I feel compelled to give my small review as a way to help this book make it's good way into the wide world. With deep bows to Gary Thorp. I hope you have a second and third and fourth book in mind...</span>

                    <span>I've been on a thirty year search for a book like "Sweeping Changes". Although, I've read a lot of books on zen, only a few seem to capture zen's true essence. Gary Thorp, author of "Sweeping Changes", is able to convey this zen essence to his reader. He writes of bringing mindfulness into all aspects of daily living. But Thorp does this without being prescriptive. Instead, after reading (or shall I say savoring) a chapter of "Sweeping Changes", you find yourself inspired to bring your entire presence to the task at hand; whether it is sweeping the kitchen floor, taking care of the kids, or addressing a challenge at work.<P>For now, "Sweeping Changes" will have a special place on my book shelf; a place where it comforts me with its very presence of zen.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I wanted guidance in discovering the meaning in everyday life and everyday things. I thought I might also learn how better to "care for the things that care for me." I didn't really find that here; instead the book is filled with obscure instructions and seemingly disjointed statements. I'm not sure what I've read. Is this Zen?<P>I wanted to like the book, but I think I'm looking for something else, something that feels a little more concrete. I will say that the book is a nice compact size, with nicely textured paper--it felt good to hold. If I'd found it more useful, I could imagine carrying it around with me, allowing the corners to become dog-eared and worn. Alas, it will be retired to the shelf.</span>

                    <span>...Oh so *BORING*. I read the blurbs and descriptions about this book and the reviews and was really looking forward to receiving my copy. But it was *so dull*. I kept reading, hoping to find something in it, atleast one little part that would make it a worthwhile purchase, but I could not find one single thing. I enjoy books on sacred spaces, and creating a sanctuary feeling in your home, a haven, a comforting, welcoming space. I enjoy being rather Hestia-like while doing my housework, and really enjoy the process (when not rushed, but let's face it, we all get rushed in our chores sometimes), and I love the end product of all my hard work - a clean and beautiful home that I can relax in. Ahhh...very rewarding! But reading this book was not. I had high hopes for it when I ordered it, but was very disappointed once I read it. I am glad it has been beneficial to so many people here who have reviewed it. But for me, it was so boring, I would have rather been doing housework! ;)</span>

                    <span>Are you familiar with the story of the young beginning monk who goes to the Zen master and asks him what he should do to attain enlightenment and the master asks him if he has eaten his bowl of rice, the boy says yes and the master says, "Wash your bowl." ? Gary Thorp with compassionate good nature explains how to wash your bowl. Enlightenment needs no special equipment and each and every creature and object in your life is just waiting to give it to you. I think this book suggests many ways of how to see that. It's magical. You don't have to stop anything that you are doing, you don't have to join any club or cult or religion, you don't have to be anything but what you really are. Just read the book and meditate on it and everything will be fine. No kidding. It's that good.</span>
