                    <span>I think this is an excellent book for someone interested in constructing complex adaptive systems.  It clearly lays out the technical guidelines that you would need.  And of course, it was written by the man who originated genetic algorithms!<p>However, if you are new to the phenomena of complex adaptive systems (CAS) or agent-based models (ABM), this might not be the best intro book for you.  This is particularly true if you are wondering what a genetic algorithm is right now.  I think you will get the most out of the book if you are already somewhat familiar with CAS and ABM as Holland does not dwell on illustrative examples.  (Yes there are examples, but they are very short compared to other authors on this topic.)  Because of this, I think this book will be rather dry and technical and non-intuitive for a real newbie.  If you have no idea where to begin, try _Growing Artificial Societies_ by Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell.<p>One final comment: for excellent in-depth look at the reiterated Prisoner's Dilemna model with genetic algorithms that Holland briefly discusses, read _The Complexity of Cooperation_ by Robert Axelrod.  (Axelrod and Holland mention each other in their books.)</span>

                    <span>The ideas presented in this book by John Holland are no doubt interestring.  The thought of spontaneous self-organization though hardly new has intrigued humans for centuries. Intuitively it makes sense and appeals to most peoples physical and methaphysical sensibilities. We know and hope that there is more to life than our common sense knowledge of it and the often dull and mechanistic accounts of natural science. Emergence theory therefore has an immediate appeal. Holland manages to keep this "flame" alive for one chapter (the first one) then the wholle enterprise is drowned in techno babble and most "non-hacker" readers are bored and dissappointed. This book is one more instance of a genuinly interesting idea being mercilessly slaughtered by bad writing. It's a true waste. It makes you wish writing courses were made compulsory for natural scientists and techo folks. Unfortunatelly it is hard to reckommend a better book on this subject... Most of the existing books are either written by litterary incompetent but hard core techno devotees  or by soft science writers ruminating the self evident and riding the tidal wave of hype. All for the buck and a snapshot in the spotlight. A non-trivial sign of an over-hyped field of inquiry, dangerously bordering the realms of pseudoscience. At least chaos theory had Edward Lorenz as a respectable and astute front figure, managing to keep the delicate balance between scientific integrity and popular appeal. As for emergence theory that post is still vacant. Holland may be an important contributor to the field of emergence theory but he fails the requirements for that post.</span>

                    <span>In the worlds of Complexity and Artificial Intelligence, the name of John Holland is revered, and for good reason.  One of the most important contributions to both fields was Holland's invention of genetic algorithms, a class of optimization techniques that applies a survival-of-the-fittest heuristic to a broad range of otherwise intractable problems.  He is certifiably a genius, and his words on the subject of complexity should be considered close to the gospel.  <p>To the benefit of all mankind, this god of complexity has seen fit to lay down his word on the subject in a manner suitable to the masses.  He posits seven basic properties of complex adaptive systems (worth reading and memorizing in their own right), then uses the rest of the book to demonstrate that adaptive systems possess these properties and shows us how a computer can capture such adaptive mechanisms.  Pure gold and totally accessible.<p>This book excels as an exposition of complex adaptive systems for the masses, and as a tutorial for the technically inclined.  If you are so technically inclined, follow this book with Holland's "Emergence" and "Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems."  Then head on over to Goldberg's book on genetic algorithms and maybe some Koza (a quick Amazon search can find these for you).</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating readable book.  Dr Holland shows us many interesting behavioural models with fascinating results.  His Echo model and genetic model results are particularly interesting, and insightful.<p>Still, it seems to me, models based on atomistic concepts and the law of large numbers ought to be subjected to performance measurements based on thermodynamics.  Dr. Holland has not shown that these complex adaptive systems imitate nature better than a similar model based on, for example, oxidation-reduction.<p>Following the ideas of Arthur S Iberall I believe a theory of complex adaptive systems needs to be evaluated in terms of Navier-Stokes equations.</span>

                    <span>Although the order in "Hidden Order" may seem hidden before you read this book, it won't by the time you finish it.<p>Many books on fashionable current topics like complexity theory and complex adaptive systems are very lively in expressing the potentials of the field.  This one isn't.   Most books in these fields are either way over the heads of non-mathematicians, or just recount the story of the origin of the field.   <p>This one is extremely modest and understated, but has the special merit of explaining the basic principles of complex adaptive systems in a way that any attentive reader can understand completely.  It doesn't dwell on non-linearity, it just mentions it as one of the important principles that characterizes complex systems.  <p>This stands out as not only an exceptionally clear description of the basic principles with simple understandable examples, but also a surprisingly dull read if you're used to popular accounts rather than texts.  Going from the popular accounts of Chaos and Complexity Theory to this is a little like spending months reading Dr. Seuss' charmingly excessive rhymes, and then going back to "See Spot Run."  <p>So it would be easy to miss what is so great about this book, that it actually makes the underlying principles of complex adaptive systems accessible to virtually anyone.  Without the fanfare, without the hype, without the flashy graphics, Holland describes step by clear step how agents interacting with each other in certain ways that reflect 7 general principles end up organizing themselves into systems with their own properties. <p>Holland does not spend much time on thinking of applications for complex adaptive system models, he makes a brief, almost off-handed mention of the possibility of locating "lever points" where small strategic changes can make useful large changes to huge complex systems in real life, and the proceeds to describe his 7 principles.  This is followed by a more detailed discussion of the agents themselves that compose adaptive systems, and finally some discussion of ECHO, a class of models that illustrates Holland's application of the principles.<p>There is no mystical reverence for emergence here, or any questionable speculations, this is a conceptual introduction you can can use to get a solid background, and then form your own opinions about the topic and its implications, and go on to read the more advanced books on complexity and systems thinking.<p>This is probably not a book that will inspire you about the importance of the potential implications of the field (which are great), unless you tend to get excited reading about rules and algorithms.  It is a book that rather matter-of-factly describes what may well turn out to be the underlying structure of a myriad complex systems in nature, including ourselves and our social organizations.  <p>"What enables cities to retain their coherence despite continual disruptions and a lack of central planning ?" he asks on the first page of the first chapter.  That's one of the few hints of the amazing possibilities raised by a real-life model of complex adaptive systems in this book.  But if you keep that possibility in mind, this simple straightforward though often uninspiring discussion of systems principles could be a very useful little hinge to open a very big door to a remarkable field.</span>
