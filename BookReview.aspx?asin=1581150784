                    <span>You'd think that a book about emotional branding with a forward by Sergio Zyman would have something interesting to say.  Unfortunately, this book make a number of good points but it's not all that interesting.  Many of the points should be fairly intuitive and obvious for marketing people who have a clue.  Some points made are interesting refreshers, like the importance and potential impact of invoking multiple senses in the consumption and purchase experience.  Unfortunately many of the chapters are not newsworthy and can be summarized by their lame titles, such as "Women: The New "Shoppers in Chief" and "Gay and Lesbian Consumers: Sincerity is the Best Policy!"
<br />
<br />The book mostly gives examples of brands that have done X or Y really well without leaving the average reader or business person with any concept about how the point is relevant in a gernalizeable sense.
<br />
<br />Final gripe is that the book reads a little bit like an advertisement for the author's firm.

                    <span>Emotional Branding is a must, it is complete, well written and full of inspiring examples
<br />
<br />The decalogue alone is worth the purchase
<br />
<br />1) from consumers to people
<br />2) from product to experience
<br />3) from honesty to trust
<br />4) from quality to preference
<br />5) from notoriety to aspiration
<br />6) from identity to personality
<br />7) from function to feel
<br />8) from ubiquity to presence
<br />9) from communication to dialogue
<br />10)from service to relationship

<br />they have, the brand</span>

                    <span>This book has all the appeal of an IKEA coffee table: it looks great on the outside, but when you get down to it, it's nothing but cheap filler.
<br />
<br />The concepts are tired (this is mere repackaging of 1987 material by a designer/design firm who is trying to drum up business). The writing is self-aggrandizing. This book could have been written in less than a three-page memo. 
<br />
<br />If you still speak with an arrogant dot.com era vernacular; if you enjoy using mantras like "recontextualizing the brand"; or if you enjoy hearing yourself breath, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book. 
<br />
<br />In the end, this book says a lot without saying anything at all. Buy something by Aaker (though he is a bit dated) instead.</span>

                    <span>Gobe is definitely on the right track here, but he drags on a little too long for my liking.  He's got some interesting ideas on how to treat the brand and give it a personality, but I don't really see all the hype that everyone talked about. This book is on just about every "must read" business book list, and I'm sure in 2002 it deserved to be there, but in 2004 it's more like a "recommended reading."  You won't regret reading this, but you might get something more out of a newer book.</span>
