                <span id="Label1">An insightful look at the misplaced faith we place in things, and meaningful advice on achieving material and emotional well-being. <P>"Getting what you want" today is increasingly linked to buying something. But is the purchase always enough? Picking up where "simplifying" may not satisfy, <I>Dematerializing</I> acknowledges the pleasures, along with the pitfalls, of living in a material world. With a sharp reporter's eye and a wry sensibility, Jane Hammerslough encourages readers to explore how a consumption-crazed culture affects their own relationships with objects. By considering what possessions can and can't do, and by exploring where belief in the magic of the material encroaches on belief in ourselves and other people, <I>Dematerializing</I> offers insight into the pressures of living in a possession-obsessed environment--and ways to tame materialism in our own lives. Grounded by real-world examples, research, and the author's own experience, this inspiring book is for those who appreciate having "nice things" but are also disturbed by the control "nice things" sometimes have on their lives.</span>

                    <span>Because we practice a voluntary simplicity, your money or your life way of living I am always interested in books on the subject of downsizing or decluttering or dematerializing. So this book caught my eye. I especially liked how she speaks to the issues of fear and feeling one may be deprived if they do with less. How as a society we have evolved and look to things to bring us a feeling of worth or happiness whereas in decades past it was family and friends whom we turned to. Ironically those were also the decades when people had money in savings accounts and weren't in debt. The books premise really is money cant buy you love.<P>I especially liked Chapter 11 where the author talks about the value of having one day (Sunday) where we don't do anything except rest and relax. And she differentiates between recreation and fun and real rest and relaxation. And she discusses developing a will for living. Doing what gives one pleasure as well as an income. And the importance of simply being thankful for what one has. I really agree with her on that. I often stand in the shower and realize that there are people who have no indoor plumbing. No hot water at the turn of a knob, and now clean clothes fresh out of a washing machine and dried and ready for me to wear. Or the fact that I turn a knob and I have hot water to wash dishes, which in turn helps prevent diseases that in so many of the worlds countries are rampant.<P>It is a book I recommend although I believe Your Money or Your Life is number one and the author agrees since she lists it on the books to read section.</span>

                    <span>Although I had high hopes for this book, I was disappointed by Hammerslough's mediocre analysis of consumerism in America. It may be plumped up by some interesting examples of materialism, but it fails to really identify the cultural roots of why we overspend, why we seek comfort in things.<P>Most dismaying is the final chapter of the book, which provides a superficial overview on how we can overcome our materialist nature. This chapter reads like a simplistic advice column from a whiny monthly magazine.<P>Save your money for something you really need.</span>

                    <span>This wonderful book is both highly thought-provoking and down-to-earth. It is a truism that American values over the last 20, 50, or 100 years have shifted dramatically toward accumulating material goods. Hammerslough explores the desperate paradox that even though we buy more and more things, they don't make us happier or draw us closer to our loved ones, despite the marketers' promises. Her distinctive contribution is to show just how far excess materialism alienates us from our own best selves, from loving and understanding others, from nurturing a true sense of security and belonging.<P>Every day, Americans receive over 3,000 marketing messages such as "Do you care enough to send the very best flowers?" or "Promise her anything, but give her Arpege". What effect does this really have on our relationships? On our sense of adequacy?<P>The book concludes with several modest and practical suggestions to help individuals refocus their emotional energies on what really matters, and to begin to ask the right questions to help separate between "want" and "need". One of the most appealing aspects of the book is Hammerslough's warm and humane first-person voice; she does not take a cold above-it-all approach by any means.<P>At Thanksgiving this year, we all agreed that Americans share a new sense of togetherness in the wake of recent national tragedies. In a sense, "Dematerializing" could not be more timely. This book is an excellent starting point for anyone who wants to appreciate the simple pleasures of life more directly, without having to have the right "kit".<P>Also worth mentioning is the companion website, which contains source materials for discussion and interesting facts. An excerpt from the book's opening chapter is also available there.</span>

                    <span>Dematerializing is a must read for anyone raising kids in our possession-obsessed society. It is a pleasure to read--the writing is both clever and engaging. Dematerializing offers valuable insights into our need for possessions without being preachy or disparaging of our ingrained cultural instincts. It also offers valuable suggestions for finding satisfaction with what you've got. I highly recommend it!</span>
