                    <span>I am not reviewing this edition of the book. I am writing this because of a few unfairly negative reviews I see here. When I started learning Dreamweaver 4, Wendy Pecks "Dreamweaver 4 Weekend Crash Course" was the single best book I used for getting up to speed on Dreamweaver. I'm sure this book is very similar. It should be noted that I am a long time HTML handcoder who has started using Dreamweaver in the last year.<p>As far as those reviews who discredit it because it doesn't cover the more advanced features.... What do you expect from a crash course book. This type of book is aimed at getting beginners up to speed quickly, and it does this admirably. After that you go to on to more advanced, and in depth books. <p>I am always disapointed to see mac users give a bad review just because a book is not mac specific. The differences are minor. You have a couple of keys in the exact same place with different names on them, and you have to use two hands to do what we can do with one (right clicking). So what. How hard is that to deal with. I learned the most about the pen tool in Illustrator from a Mac book that was two versions older, (6 versus 8). This was substantially harder because menu choices had changed places in the newer version of Illustrator. It was still worth it because the author gave the best instruction I had come across on understanding the pen tool. When Apple allows me to build a computer from competetively priced hardware of my own chosing, I will think about giving the Mac OS a try. Until then I am happy building my own custom machines for less money with the setup that I want on them.<p>Wendy Peck is a very good author with a great sense of design. Check out her articles in the graphics section of webreference.com if you want to see for yourselves.<p>One last thing. Her section on liquid table design in Dreamweaver was the single best instruction I have read on the subject. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I haven't read this particlular version of the book.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book expecting to be able to find exercises that would help me REALLY learn the product. Boy, was I in for a big surprise. If you're a mac user, FORGET IT! This book assumes you're using a PC. Last I checked, many people who do web design are mac users. When I got to the first screen and saw that what was shown in the book was different than what I had on my computer, I gave up. It may be helpful for PC users, but if you're a mac user consider yourself ignored . . . yet again!</span>

                    <span>I have tried several of the 5 star rated Dreamweaver books and found them of less value than this book. You must actually work with Dreamweaver to learn it and this book forces you to do this. To really work through this book will take awhile unless you have 100% free time, but it is really better this way. You will make errors and the book has some errors (which makes you think-you can work through these) and there are a few omissions. These issues are not a big deal. Peck's writing style is pleasant and down to earth. Yes, it doesn't cover everything, but it covers most aspects of Dreamweaver (I don't have MX). Actually, this is an advantage for beginners since it is not overwhelming. After you work through this book, you will be able to construct your own website. If you want advance features like transactions and databases, you will need additional references, but you must get the basics. Templates and CSS (basic aspects) are covered. Best of all, Peck has the practical experience to give you what you really need to know.</span>

                    <span>the most exciting new features of Dreamweaver MX are related to the ability to develop dynamic web sites, rather than static HTML pages with JPGs hanging on them.<p>This book ignores the new features.<p>I recommend you ignore the book.</span>

                    <span>This is only the second tutorial that I've given 5 stars. <p>Every time I thought I caught the author at an error, I found it the error was either mine or Dreamweaver's (a couple of times, I needed to restart the program to get results). The CD and instructions were perfectly in sync. And the book was well-organized and well-written. (I caught no typos or grammatical errors.)<p>I wish the CD ROM contained the exercises at various stages of completion for those couple of times when things went radically wrong due to my misstep. As I knew the error was mine and that I really didn't need to re-do my work to understand the exercise, I would have appreciated the ability to pick up with a perfectly correct page so I could take it from there.<p>It took me more than 15 hours to get through the exercises. I'm sure with a little more concentration and a lot more motivation, I could've completed the book in a weekend. Instead, I took my time.<p>Don't pass up this book if you're trying to learn how to use Dreamweaver and are reluctant to buy this one because it's one of the first Dreamweaver MX tutorials out. It's a good book for a newbie to the program and I wouldn't waste my time waiting for the publishing of other books.</span>
