                    <span>Few students in America can get out of high school without having to read Lord Of The Flies in English class sometime during the four years that they are there.  The story is fairly easy to understand on a superficial level, but the real purpose of this novel is to understand symbolism and foreshadowing.  Items in the novel like Piggy's glasses and the conch shell have a "deeper" meaning that may not be obvious to every reader.  If the reader is keen, he'll be able to realize that the author tells the reader what is going to happen in a subliminal way prior to actually coming out and saying it.  That's called foreshadowing, and it may also be difficult for some readers to comprehend.  For these reasons, these Cliffs Notes are extremely useful.  The reader will gain a better understanding and appreciation of the novel by using this supplement while reading the actual novel.  With these notes, the reader is given the added benefit of reading commentary written by someone who has already read the book, and is capable of breaking down the significant parts of every chapter.<p>One drawback to having these notes (as is the drawback to having ANY Cliffs Notes) is the temptation to substitute the notes for the actual novel.  While this substitution may work for other novels, it isn't a good idea to think it unnecessary to read the book just because you've read the notes.  I tried that, and it didn't work.  Besides, the Cliffs Notes are just about as long as the actual book, so you might as well read the real thing.<p>The bottom line is that these notes are a good investment if you want to gain a good understand of the novel, and insight into what your English teacher might think is important.  I recommend these notes.</span>

                    <span>I chose this book because of the many recommendations I have heard through many mouths.  This novel is a very adventurous story filled with drama and action.  It is based on these plane-wrecked children who get stranded on a pig population island.  These boys are different from each individual and each has its own position as a team.  They first try to get themselves out by trying to resucue themselves from this island.  They cause many atrractions and try many times to get out but fail.  So they finally except the fact that they are stranded and they do  everything they can to survive.  There are leaders and failures in this bunch of boys that help this group survive through the wild.  They use what they have brought with them as useful tools in surviving.  From the characters, three stand out from the rest which are Jack, Piggy, and Ralph.  This story is basically like the saying, "Who let the dogs out,"  because the kids were savages trying to live their lives through this tropical island.  Golding represents these characters as individuals that can learn how to adapt to new surroundings quickly and actually survive.  If your looking for an adverturous book, I recommend this to you....</span>

                    <span>As I was reading the novel i understood the story, but did not understand the symbolism contained in Golding's work.  The Cliff Notes explain the imagery through character analysis and comments on each chapter making the novel very understandable.  It was very interesting in how the book pulled together showing a parallel of modern society, not just an adventure story of boys on an island, that Golding so ingeniously created.</span>
