                <span id="Label1">Few political memoirs have made such a dramatic entrance as that by Richard A. Clarke. During the week of the initial publication of <I>Against All Enemies</I>, Clarke was featured on <I>60 Minutes</I>, testified before the 9/11 commission, and touched off a raging controversy over how the presidential administration handled the threat of terrorism and the post-9/11 geopolitical landscape. Clarke, a veteran Washington insider who had advised presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush, dissects each man's approach to terrorism but levels the harshest criticism at the latter Bush and his advisors who, Clarke asserts, failed to take terrorism and Al-Qaeda seriously. Clarke details how, in light of mounting intelligence of the danger Al-Qaeda presented, his urgent requests to move terrorism up the list of priorities in the early days of the administration were met with apathy and procrastination and how, after the attacks took place, Bush and key figures such as Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Dick Cheney turned their attention almost immediately to Iraq, a nation not involved in the attacks. <I>Against All Enemies</I> takes the reader inside the Beltway beginning with the Reagan administration, who failed to retaliate against the 1982 Beirut bombings, fueling the perception around the world that the United States was vulnerable to such attacks. Terrorism becomes a growing but largely ignored threat under the first President Bush, whom Clarke cites for his failure to eliminate Saddam Hussein, thereby necessitating a continued American presence in Saudi Arabia that further inflamed anti-American sentiment. Clinton, according to Clarke, understood the gravity of the situation and became increasingly obsessed with stopping Al-Qaeda. He had developed workable plans but was hamstrung by political infighting and the sex scandal that led to his impeachment. But Bush and his advisers, Clarke says, didn't get it before 9/11 and they didn't get it after, taking a unilateral approach that seemed destined to lead to more attacks on Americans and American interests around the world. Clarke's inside accounts of what happens in the corridors of power are fascinating and the book, written in a compelling, highly readable style, at times almost seems like a fiction thriller. But the threat of terrorism and the consequences of Bush's approach to it feel very sobering and very real.  <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>As the sitting White House National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism on the President's National Security Council for more than eight years during both the Clinton and Bush administrations, former intelligence analyst Richard Clarke sat in the literal catbird's seat to observe as well as participate in the national security apparatus in action. As a consequence, his new book detailing the specifics of the government's progress on the war on terror both before and since the advent of 911 is provocative reading indeed. The portrait he paints so convincingly is that of a Bush administration populated by political ideologues and characterized by shooting from the hip at targets of opportunity. Thus, no one within the new administration wanted to believe in the frightening evidence of a mounting Al Qaeda threat in the weeks and months before September 11, 2001, despite the persistent warnings of advisors like himself. <P>Instead, they seemed preoccupied, as former Treasury secretary Paul O'Neil suggested in his recent book, with regime change in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Astonishingly, the morning after 911 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested attacking Iraq in the total absence of any evidence linking Saddam Hussein's regime to the attack on New York City or Washington, since Iraq represents a target-rich environment, as opposed to Afghanistan, which has so few. President Bush himself cornered Clarke and attempted to pressure him into finding a link between Hussein and the attack on the World Trade Center on 911 attack. To Mr. Clarke, the Bush administration was intent from that time on to use 911 as a convenient excuse to attack Iraq, something they seem to have desired to do from the very outset of the administration. <P>Indeed, Clarke's impression of the modus operandi of the so-called "Vulcans" such as Paul Wolfowitz, Condi Rice, and Donald Rumsfeld is one of a previously set ideological agenda, of having a predetermined objective to attack and conquer Iraq, and then attempting to use the events of 911 as justification to proceed toward that objective. Indeed, the available public record suggests as much, with not only Mr. Bush, but also Mr. Cheney and Ms. Rice, as well as Mr. Rumsfeld trotting out a garden variety of ostensible rationales for invading Iraq in the post-911 time frame, all the way from the original "Axis Of Evil" comment in the 2002 State of The Union speech to the spurious linking of Saddam with Al Qaeda to the use of nerve gas against the populace some dozen years before to failure to comply with United nations resolutions since the 1991 attack by the international coalition that deliberately stopped short of regime change due to fear of destabilizing the region. <P>Mr. Clarke has more than enough criticism to go around, and both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush find themselves seriously criticized and called to task for their lack of appropriate action, given what Mr. Clarke feels was the clear and present danger the evidence he offered indicated. So this book is no simple hatchet job against the Bush administration, as it casts aspersions on both sides of the political fence in terms of ascribing blame for our present set of circumstances regarding lapses in national security. Yet he reserves special scorn for the current administration, given its self-serving and somewhat cynical use of the 911 events to turn the political landscape upside down. What Clark describes as being tantamount to treason is the fashion in which President Bush has politicized the situation for short-term political benefit without taking serious and meaningful action to actually meaningfully combat the set of threats themselves. <P>Most surprising to Clark is the way in which the Bush administration has done so little to accomplish relatively inexpensive and yet quite effective action against the terrorist threat, such as strengthening the infrastructure or beefing up border security, while hugely increasing the administrative manpower and salaries of personnel within agencies such as Homeland Security, which do little to actually counteract terror threats. Like many observers, Clarke believes the war in Iraq is at best a distraction from the real threat, robbing the country of valuable resources with which we could much more effectively protect ourselves and extend the reach of American power to combat terrorism. <P>Meanwhile, he views the growth of terrorism and the extension of its world-wide capabilities with alarm, suggesting that our ineffective military actions as well as our inattentiveness to key details which would bolster internal security have led to increased danger and higher threat levels rather than the reverse, and wonders aloud how long it will take for this nightmare scenario to play out with potentially devastating consequences. He is utterly amazed that Bush attempts, through a cynical and self-serving media campaign, to convince Americans we are winning a war on terror we are not really fighting well at all. This is an absolutely riveting read, albeit in less than stirring prose or striking narrative. It serves as forewarning that we are on a wrongheaded and very dangerous path, and that it is high time for a course correction. I highly recommend this book! Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Read this book.<P>The media is focusing on Clarke's criticism of President Bush and missing the rest of the story. Clarke has done a great job of answering many questions about how we arrived at this place in history, drawing on his ringside seat in the Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II administrations. He outlines the thinking that led to policies that no doubt seemed like a good idea at the time and have in retrospect gone badly awry.<P>He goes back to the Cold War issues that drew U.S. attention to the Middle East and South Asia in the first place (particularly the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979). He takes us through the Reagan policies that gave us a foothold in the region, crippled the Soviet Union, and led to its fall; to Gulf War decisions in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that angered Osama bin Laden; the Clinton administration's actions and failures to act...<P>And finally the Bush II administration's pre-9/11 shortcomings (for example, after a January 2001 meeting with National Security Adviser Condi Rice at which he enumerated the danger al-Qaida posed to the U.S., he couldn't get a meeting with the "Deputies Committee" to discuss terrorism until APRIL). This was on the heels of the al-Qaida bombing of the World Trade Center (1993), horrific bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the attack on the USS Cole.<P>Clarke also writes at length about al-Qaida and bin Laden's stated (and chilling) plans, examines the Bush administration's drive toward war in Iraq, and what it all means for us.<P>Clarke's writing is straightforward and credible. He uses specifics (no fudging and no personal attacks) to make his case.<P>If you're interested in what happened in the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, add "Against All Enemies" to your "must read" list. It's a great source.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Clarke writes, "One shudders to think what additional errors [Bush] will make in the next four years to strengthen . . . al Qaeda . . . ." p. 290. I learned a great deal by reading this book. America is less secure today by invading Iraq -- "an oil-rich Arab country that posed no threat to us . . . [and] deliver[ing] to al Queda the greatest recruitment propaganda imaginable and made it difficult for friendly Islamic governments to be seen working closely with us." p. 264. We've all been hood-winked by the Bush White house - a president I regrettably voted for. We've been diverted from eliminating al Queda by invading Iraq, we've ignored our vulnerabilities to terrorism at home, we should have been dealing with the ideological threat. We've stirred-up a hornet's nest in the Islamic world by stepping on that flimsey step ladder and batting the hell out of a nest of terrorists that did not exist in Iran. We owe a debt of gratitude to Richad Clarke and so many other people like John O'Neill, etc. This is a very engrossing book. Although there are a few writing hick-ups that I blame on poor editing, this is a book that as one reviewer said you should pass on to candidates in you community. I saw a little of the debate for Senator in Georgia and was absolutely mortified at the ignorance of the candidates -- my God, they can barely talk legibly. I'm a native Georgian, and I just wanted to cry while I screamed at the t.v. I turned it off for the sake of my high blood pressure. Asking questions, critically analyzing our politicians' decisionmaking is patriotic - I don't give a damn what Bush, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, and especially Ashcroft say. Ashcroft who lost an election to a dead man. John, pursue your songwriting career. At least then we can turn you off man. Nobody who merely carries a bar card ought to be Atty Gen. READ CLARKE'S BOOK for your sake and the sake of our children.</span>

                    <span>A well written account of this nation's war against terrorism though Richard Clarke's eyes. Richard's prose is clear, is good at explaining how things work in Washington and the White House and you will come away better informed. You may also, as I did, come away with a new appreciation for how Clinton handled terrorism.<P>If you are a fan of President Bush then you will not like this book as it carefully explains the illogic of the war in Iraq in regards to terrorism and other issues.</span>

                    <span>How many Ex-Bush Administration officials have to come out with sobering memoirs that show Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld for who they are before all Americans wake up? At the time of this writing, Kerry and Bush are still neck and neck at about 45% in the polls! WTH?<P>The most enjoyable part of this book is when Clarke proves how good at counterterrorism Clinton was. All of you who have been brainwashed by Limbaugh and Hannity might not appreciate that part of the book. By the way, Clinton did everything he could to get Usama. The Sudanese were ready to hand Bin Laden over, but those who know anything about the Sudanese know they are genocidal terrorists. Therefore, we could not negotiate with them. So what did Clinton do? He tried to bomb Bin Laden's convoy. But Usama escaped. You may not remember that because the right-wing was trying to impeach Clinton because he wouldn't cooperate with their bullsh*t "Contact With America".<P>The Bush portion shocked everybody for some reason. "What? You mean he's doing a horrible job fighting terrorism? But I thought.." The reality is Bush looked tough with all those strong phrases like "smoke 'em out" and "bring 'em on" the latter being rather flippant and possibly endangering our troops.<P>The bottom line: put your political ideology -left or right- on the shelf and read a nonpartison account of our efforts - good and bad - to eliminate our greatest threat after the fall of Communism.</span>
