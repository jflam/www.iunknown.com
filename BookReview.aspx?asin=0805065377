                <span id="Label1"><div>The headlines proclaimed the 1919 fix of the World Series and attempted cover-up as "the most gigantic sporting swindle in the history of America!" First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Although not a work of fiction, Asinof establishes the antagonist, or scapegoat, in the fixing of the 1919 World Series as the owner of the Chicago White Sox, Charles Comisky. He blames Comisky and the low wages he provided as the reason the eight sold out on one of the great ballclubs of all-time. Asinof also puts the blame on the gamblers who used the ballplayers as pawns to get rich. But, ultimately participation in the scheme was the final and fatal decision that was made by 8 of the Sox. Some parts of the book, such as the post-trial, are a bit dry, but overall this is an easy-to-read, informative novel. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about such White Sox greats as Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson and the 1919 World Series scandal in which they participated</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I only knew of the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 on a superficial level. This book gives you the details of all the conversations, meetings, and actions that took place between the players, gamblers, and management which led to 8 players of the Chicago White Sox baseball susposedly throwing the 1919 World Series. Asinof has surprising detail of conversations that took place and talks about each person involved as if he knew them personally. You wonder how he received all this info in the age before tape recorders and microphones were prevalent. He certainly did impressive research and the book should be commended for that. <P>What he doesn't do is take sides and seems to write the book as a distant observer. But at the end you seem to feel somewhat sorry for some of the players involved, especially the ones among the eight (Buck Weaver, Joe Jackson) who didn't necessarily throw their games but were banned for life anyway because of their knowledge of the conspiracy. What would you have done in their position?<P>Overall, it's most likely the best summary of one of the most incredible and darkest events in sports history. It's must read for all sports fans.</span>

                    <span>Eight Men Out is both an excellent journalistic/historical account of the events surrounding the "Black Sox" scandal and a very good read. Asinof creates vivid and believable portraits of all of the protagonists while being careful to make clear when he's relating facts supporting by verifiable evidence and when he's offering reasonable but unverifiable inferences or conclusions. Far and away the best and most accessible accumulation of research into the scandal, and one of the better books you'll find anywhere focusing on sports history.</span>

                    <span>Easily one of the finest books on baseball history I have read. I saw the movie in the late 1980s and have always been fascinated by the motivations that would prompt the players to risk their careers. Although Asinof does not excuse the players he also puts a lot of blame on Charles Cominsky and other individuals -- not just the gamblers -- who either were aware that something strange was going on or tried to cover it up.</span>

                    <span>This book tells the history of the 1919 World Series. Most prior accounts have been fragmentary. No one person knew all the factors; many of the participants never met each other or knew of their existence. Asinof wove together a multitude of threads from the newspapers of that time ('Preface'). Official documents had disappeared, and most participants died before talking. Survivors refused to talk, the gambling gangster world was still around. Sources chose to remain anonymous. Many of the incidents in this book represent a composite of sources. The Introduction says this scandal was not an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished history of baseball. Comiskey cruelly exploited his peons (like others), but this did not excuse this betrayal of the fans. The April 1919 Federal court decision found Professional Baseball violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act; this must have impressed the players that year. A later Supreme Court decision overturned this (I wonder what was paid for it?). Perhaps the real scandal of 1919 was that it revealed baseball was a business, not a sport.<P>Baseball and betting were allied from the beginning, just like other sports (horse racing). Bribery and other tricks were used to fix the results (as in the 1876 pennant series). Baseball was the biggest entertainment business in 1917. When race tracks were shut down during wartime, gamblers and bookies switched to baseball. Gamblers would befriend baseball players with women and whiskey; they could control ball games as readily as horse races. Stories were hushed up for the good of the game. Bribing ball players was known, players had done this to win the pennant in 1917.<P>The heavy betting on Cincinnati lowered the odds. Rumors spread about the fix. One set of gamblers wanted Chicago to lose, but another set wanted Cincinnati to lose (p.47)! There was a thin line separating effective play from a near miss that helped the other side (p.66). When the gamblers failed to make their payoff after the second game, the White Sox went on to win. (The gamblers had them coming and going.) The gamblers said the series must be ended in the 8th game (p.113). Some people suspected something bad had happened. A pile-up of civil cases followed: all the defendants lost money betting on the White Sox. Accepting bribes now left the players open to blackmail and extortion (p.145). 1920 was a bigger year for gate receipts. The American League President sought to use this scandal against Comiskey. There was hatred among the White Sox players (p.166). Pages 170-1 tell why you should never act without benefit of counsel when questioned by the authorities (p.177). Different newspapers reported Jackson't confession in different ways (p.189). "The Front Page"? The players would not have betrayed Comiskey unless there was a cause for bitterness. The great national pastime must reflect the society it lived in, the worship of "easy money".<P>The Black Sox scandal wounded American pride and self-esteem, the image of nobility and humanity (p.197). While corruption was rampant in state and national legislatures, and show business, could baseball not be corrupt? Yet it foretold the 1920s, a decade of unprecedented crime, corruption, and immorality (p.198). Did America expect higher morals from ball players than from businessmen, or anyone else (p.243)? The ball players were charged with a conspiracy to defraud the public; but they only threw some ball games. The jury found them all not guilty; this kept Professional Baseball clean. The next day the new Baseball Commissioner announced that they would be banned for life (p.273). After you read this book you'll know why popular histories of baseball usually begin around 1921; the preceding 50 years is rarely mentioned.</span>
