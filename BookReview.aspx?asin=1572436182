                    <span>[...]You spelled MARGE Hearn's name wrong!  You had a couple of gramatical mistakes.  Chick gave a "Word's Eye View" not a "World's Eye View".  I haven't read the book yet, but I will purchase and read it even with your lousy representation of his book.  Chick Hearn was the greatest play by play announcer of all time.  He embodied Laker basketball and was the catalyst for the growth of basketball in southern California.  In my eyes and in the eyes of many fans, Chick Hearn was the greatest Laker of all time even though he never played a single minute of any game.  </span>

<br />As a lifelong Laker fan, I've felt like I've known Chick for most of my life.  He was like the eccentric uncle that explained things to you when he visited, and in Chick's case, what he explained was basketball.  
<br />
<br />If you're not a Laker fan, this book probably won't be as meaningful to you, but it's filled with entertaining stories and poignant nuggets about broadcasting, basketball, and life in general.  Some of the material I'd read about before, but a lot of it was new to me.  It gets quite emotional at times; it's not strictly about basketball or play-by-play announcing, although he looms very large in both fields.  
<br />
<br />The book is mostly a compilation of other people recalling their memories of Chick, with some first-hand quotes from him as well.  It doesn't really have a narrative, so it's a nice book to pick up and read from occasionally.  I think the structure of it really suits the subject well.  Chick was great at describing basketball and relating to people, so to a large extent the book is basketball people talking about him.  
<br />
<br />If you're a Laker fan, it's a great read.  If you're into sportscasting or basketball, there's something for you too.  </span>

                    <span>For 3,338 consecutive games Chick Hern was the voice of the L.A. Lakers. He became as famous as the best of their players. As the voice of the lakers, he essentially was the lakers to millions of fans. He brought the team, the coaches, and the rest of the organization to the millions of fans. He lived Lakers basketball, and it showed in the way he talked.<p>This book presents Chick in two ways: One is the writing about Chick, his life, his stories of the team, people, and life in general. Second is the CD included with the book that gives some of his greatest calles, along with narration by Al Michaels. Normally the voice of a sports broadcaster is a transient thing. You hear what he said, or maybe you miss it, and it's gone forever. Here are some of the best of his work, recorded forever.</span>

                    <span>I have an autographed picture of Chick and myself courtside hanging on my living room wall, so yes, I'm a fan.  I grew up listening to two of the greatest announcers in history:  Vin Scully and Chick Hearn.  Thank you Los Angeles.<p>There is no Laker in franchise history that looms larger than Chick Hearn.  He brought the Lakers into millions of fans homes.  He told the story of every game with passion and wit and honesty.  He practically invented a new language for basketball.  I can't think of the Lakers without thinking of Chick and his voice.  I haven't lived in L.A. for a few years and since Chick died, I don't miss it nearly as much.  He was abosolutely the greatest announcer the NBA has ever known.<p>The book has it all.  His life both away from and in the broadcast booth is told by those who knew him.  They are all here and they tell their favorite stories and proclaim their admiration for the man and his dedication to his family and his profession.  The CD included has some of his greatest calls and gave me chills the first time I listened to it.  Any Laker fan would be proud to own this publication.  I'll treasure it.<p>No one will ever replace Chick.  He was as important to the franchise as any player that ever wore the purple and gold.  It's fitting that a jersey with a microphone and his name hangs in the arena rafters alongside the other Laker greats.  There will never be another Magic Johnson and there will surely never be another Chick Hearn.</span>

                    <span>Chick Hearn truly was one of a kind Broadcaster.He had a way of presenting the game&also vibing with the players. there is nobody else quite like Him. I feel His spirit is watching over the Lakers.D-Fish's Shot in San Antonio or Kareem Rush hitting those Big 3's in  Game 6 versus the Timberwolves.He touched many lives with His take on the game&overall vibe.RIP to a Great Talent&down to earth Man.</span>
