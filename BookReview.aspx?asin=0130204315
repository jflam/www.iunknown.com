                    <span>This book is a more concise, better organized version of the DDK documentation, minus the reference material.  It does a good job of painting a picture of driver architecture and gets you familier with the terminology involved.  However, it does not provide much insight or real-world tips, and in fact the regurgitation of Microsoft definitions and propoganda gets a little tiresome.  This book does not go into much detail and is not a reference book.  After you've read most of this book you can easily rely on the DDK documentation and never flip through these pages again.
<br />
<br />A couple specific gripes: 1) If the reader has never written a driver before, they've probably never worked in kernel mode before, so more general information on kernel-mode programming issues would have been appreciated. 2) Though this book does not go into much detail, the forward did promise a chapter on USB and IEEE 1394 available on the book's website.  I was not able to find any such chapter on the website, and haven't received a response to my email requesting the information (to be fair I've only given him a couple days).

                    <span>It's a great BEGINNER'S book on NT device drivers. There's no better book to START FROM. It's a noticeable improvement over the previous edition, it's cleaner, corrected, it's updated for Win2K, it's better made, easier on eyes, pictures are better too.  There's practically nothing negative I can say about this book.<p>Some reviewers complained that it doesn't cover this or that (network drivers, for example.) Well, it's an INTRODUCTORY book. It sticks to the core NT driver area (and as such, it'll be sufficient for 90% of what most people have to deal with.) Here I'd like to stress that I don't mean it's too shallow, it's fine, rather, it's not all-encompassing. But an all-ancompassing book would probably take 10,000 pages while you want to start small so as not to be swamped. Check the DDK out -- and it's not all-encompassing either -- it's a 5-piece book set! (And I wouldn't call it very readable :-) So, yes, the book is somewhat limited in scope, but within its scope, it's plenty profound.<p>Therefore, my very strict evaluation goes thusly: it's a good book, the best one to start from, and it's one that is good to have in general, whether just starting or not. Kudos to the author, with this edition - especially to Jerry, who, after reading both editions I feel, did the bulk of updating.</span>
