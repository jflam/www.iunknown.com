                <span id="Label1">Is "System Administrator" Just One of Your Job Titles?  <P>For every Microsoft Certified System Engineer (MCSE) managing a Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition network within the dust-free confines of a  "Network Operating Center," there is a non-MCSE admin managing a Windows Small Business Server 2003  network under far less glamorous conditions. Their job is to keep the network up and running no matter what, with very few resources available. "How to Cheat" is written for these unsung heroes; the last line of defense in most small enterprises.  <P>Create an Installation and Recovery Plan for Install, Upgrade, or Migration <BR>Every hour of planning results in a net savings of four hours on the other end. Fixing, re-doing, and troubleshooting will ALWAYS chew up more time.  <P>Secure Your Server <BR>Securing the server includes physical security, configuration security, and software security. It&#146;s always easier to keep a server clean than to clean it up after a disaster.  <P>Demystify Disk Management <BR>If you have trouble processing the differences between Boot, Primary, System and Extended Partitions, you are not alone.  <P>Effectively Manage File Storage <BR>Configure and Troubleshoot Disk Quotas, File Encryption Management, Disk and File Compression, and Shadow Copy.  <P>Painlessly Add and Configure Users and Groups on your Network <BR>User accounts and groups provide the framework for security and organization in the Small Business Server network.  <P>Set Permissions so that your Server is Both Secure and Accessible <BR>Harness the Power of Group Policy, Administrative Templates, Software Setting and Windows Settings to  Apply Changes to User, Group and Computer Permissions.  <P>Connect Client Computers to the Network <BR>Everything You Need to Know about IP Addresses, DNS, DHCP, Domain Access and Login.  <P>Answer THE Most Frequently Asked Question: "Why Can&#146;t I Print!" <BR>Printers can be connected either to client computers, servers, or directly to the network; and they can be configure by either Windows or Your Printer Vendor&#146;s Software.  <P>Prepare for the Worst <BR>Bad Things Sometimes Happen to Good Network Administrators. You need to know exactly what do when things go very, very wrong.</span>

                    <span>With few exceptions, this book simply instructs the reader to accept default prompts and reiterates the choices offered by dialog boxes. I suspect the book has two target audiences: 1) small business owners who don't want to know much about SBS and just get it running, and 2) those who need to get it running but also want to learn about the program. For the first group, I suggest you save the time you would spend reading the book and do whatever it is you do to make money and use it to pay an IT professional to install and configure SBS. For the second group, I suggest you buy another book that explains SBS in greater detail.</span>

                    <span>Susan Snedaker's superbly organized and presented instructional guide, How To Cheat At Managing Windows Small Business Server 2003, is a recommended pick for any Microsoft system engineer managing a Windows Server 2003 environment: it tells how to overcome common problems and time drains that Exchange Server creates, such as handling user permissions and security settings, and it also covers group policy, installing printers, managing client computers, and more. The disaster planning portion is particularly well detailed.

                    <span>I recently installed Windows Small Business Server 2003 and used this book as my guide. The book's clear, direct approach to each of the planning and installation tasks helped me get through the installation without a hitch. Although I'm familiar with many aspects of the Windows Server environment (I had been running Windows 2000 Server before), the SBS software contains features new to me. Snedaker's concise treatment of the new features and how to best work with them saved me time and effort. Although the book doesn't contain every single detail related to SBS 2003, it contains enough of what you really need to know and helps point you in the right direction if you run into problems. The straightforward language of the book is definitely refreshing, and the approach is excellent. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone installing or maintaining a Windows Small Business Server 2003 system. Excellent from cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>Snedaker takes a pragmatic approach to the sysadmin tasks described in her book. She does not attempt to give a comprehensive discussion of all that is in Small Business Server 2003. For that, you can turn to Microsoft's official documentation. But a problem with the latter is that it is voluminous. Snedaker aims this book at someone who may not have the time or inclination to go through the latter.
<br />
<br />So she describes what to her are the key issues you are likely to face. For these, she speaks as plainly as possible about how to solve them. You get enough information to (hopefully) perform your tasks. There is no elegant description of the structure of SBS. But do you really care?
<br />
<br />The book can function as a good front end to the Microsoft documentation. You can try using it first. Then, for more detail, refer to those.</span>
