                    <span>Given that there are not many books in the area of stochastic programming  Birge et al have written a book that will be a necessary reference for the  time being. The first third of the book does provide a good introduction to  the basics of SP but after that a level of formalism dominates that makes  one wonder if she is reading from an arcane optimization journal. The later  two thirds of the book is really nothing more than an amalgam of results  pulled from the literature (journals). As such, little motivation is  provided for the major results that are for the most part just juxtaposed  on after another. One wonders why such a journalistic style would be used  for an introductory text. After all the subject should not be presented as  a springer-verlag MATH text in a field like algebraic topology where a  theorem-proof format is legimate.  Thus, until a better introductory text  comes along that blends more of the practical engineering aspects with the  theory we must be content with the current state of the art.</span>

                    <span>Introduction to Stochastic Programming is a must own book for anyone working in OR, IE, MS, etc.  As stochasticity becomes more and more important in the field, this book becomes increasingly valuable.   "Introduction" is a bit of a stretch.  It starts from ground zero  of Stochastic Programming, but is very heavy on the math.  If you aren't  solid with your LP and probability, then a brush up is definately in order.   This book is not for the faint of heart.  Nevertheless, Birge and Louveaux  do an OUTSTANDING job.  The examples are clear, easy to follow (assuming  you're not math phobic) and very relevant.  They go through different  formulations of stochastic programms (recourse, chance constrained, etc.).   The book discusses formulation, algorithms, and applications. There are not  many books out there on Stochastic Programming...and this is really the  only one you need to own.</span>
