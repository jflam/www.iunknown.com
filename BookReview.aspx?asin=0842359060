                    <span>Dr. Peale's ability to put a lot of valid, life-changing material in a small book is demonstrated eloquently in this work. He wastes no words in getting straight to the point of how to improve your life. The first attitude he addresses is to approach problems from the proper persepctive, i.e., not from the mindset of a victim, but of an overcomer! Problems are temporary. They help mold character.<p>We're reminded of ultimate reality as Dr. Peale writes, "in the last analysis, only the God-directed life can attain true and basic success." The work ethic is stressed also. These truths are doable, time-tested, and not bound by any culture. They work if you work them.</span>

                    <span>This book is truly packed with so much helpful information.  Don't let the size of the book fool you.  Although it is pocket size, it is jampacked with so many lessons for all to lead their life by.  I often refer to this  book when lost or confused. I just can't seem to keep a copy for myself!</span>

                    <span>This tiny little book contains more wisdom than you might think.  Revealing more about yourself and how to tap into your God given gifts to become a winner.  From daily life circumstances, business, work, how not to  worry, how to deal with loneliness, inferiority complex, sorrow, to   personal development and happy family life. I would recommended it even for  teenagers as a required reading for their school book lists.</span>
