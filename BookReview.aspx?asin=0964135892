                    <span>This book should have been titled "Interviews with the masters of sheet metal fabrication" instead. Very little content to show the uninitiated how to achieve a particular goal or effect in sheet metal-work. It consists predominantly of interviews with different practitioners of particular approaches to sheet metal shaping, with the bottom line being: "You could do this w/ hammer & dolly, or any of several other methods, but this is the faster approach I prefer..." It was an interested read, but not something worth keeping as a reference. I wish I had saved my money.</span>

                    <span>This book and the author not only answered the questions that no other books on metal shaping could, but it also draws upon interviews and information from renowned masters.  It touches the heart and soul of the revival that is occurring in metal shaping and discusses all (English Wheel, air/power hammers, etc.) of the fancy and wonderful tools while showing you how these techniques can all be done with nothing more than patience, skill, a hammer or two and a tree stump.  For the price, this book can't be beat! The only improvement I would ask for in the next printing is a more complete index but I plan to read this book enough times that I won't even need it.</span>

                    <span>Hi My names Dave. I own a company that makes custom motorcycle parts, DC Fabrications of North Charleston SC. (843) 529-0095. I found this book to be a great source of info and ideas. I would reccomend this book to everyone in my industry, or anyone intrested in sheetmetal fabrication.  Dave.</span>

                    <span>Until I find a better one, this book deserves the 5 star and "Bible" rating and title.<p>No other book covers the use of the English wheel and shrinking techniques so well.  I am building a fiberglass Cobra Replica and want to duplicate the body in aluminum.  The process of forming curved metal shapes and moving metal around as it is shaped is covered in text and in photos very, very well.<p>My potential partner in the aluminum body venture was greately excited and will buy the book.  A co-worker who specializes in antique car restoration (profeshionally) nearly had a seizure when he skimmed through the book.  It is just what he was looking for.<p>I intend to build my own English wheel and accessories which was covered very well in this book.  Companies selling the English wheels purposely make their photos vague to prevent copying.  As a Tool Designer and Welding Engineer this craft has far less mystery about it now that I have this book.  It will go to the head of the row of crafting books I have been accumulating.<p>Well done Tim Remus - when will you write a sequel, we want more?</span>

                    <span>This book seems to be a good introduction to metal shaping.  Though, not being the most thorough, it gives a good starting point as to figuring how some shapes are made. Some of the techniques dont seem to be explained the greatest through a book. It is primarily geared towards building car bodies. However, with a bit of imagination the techniques can be applied any where one would use curvilinier three-demensional forms. Overall, I found this book useful.</span>
