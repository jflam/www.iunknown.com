                    <span>Overall, this is an excellent book for compilers.  It covers a broad range of concepts. On think that I like is that the authors didn't take the very popular approach of "hey, let's write a small subset of Pascal".  They actually only covers the concepts. So, this is not a beginner's book.<p>Algorithms are written in "english pseudo-code" and, altought I tought it'd be a good idea, it ended up being harder to read than the "usual pseudo-code" (like in the Dragon book).</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as an introduction to Compiler Design and to that end I have found it quite useful. The material is dense, so expect to have to re-read chapters quite often.  Also, I have found it necessary to supplement this book with additional resources to fully understand what Grune is attempting to explain, particularly with chapter 3, which covers attribute grammars.  The book's english can be poor sometimes so expect to have to back-track over convulted sentences.  Overall, however, this book succeeds in being useful as an introduction to the theory.  The authors skip implementation details, so if you are expecting to be able to actually write a compiler when you are done, you are going to be needing additional sources.<p>Pros: 1)great introduction to theory and maintains enough detail in each section to keep you interested. 2) Book is organized well. Each chapter represents the next step in compiler design. 3) This book covers theory, not implementation...it does not bind itself to one particular language<p>Cons: 1) Expect to check-out or buy additional reading to supplement this book. 2) The english often leaves something to be desired. 3) The excercises at the end of each chapter were obviously just "thrown-in" at the end. They are quite poor.</span>

                    <span>This is the textbook my class used for the compiler design class, and I must say it is excellent. Every technique is well expained, and its a lot easier to follow than "the dragon book". Best book I've read on the subject, it will get you from the start of languages design to a working interpreter in no time. You must have a solid base in coding and computer sciences tough, the book loose no time with petty issues.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for a first book on this subject then this is not the book for you.  Instead get the dragon book on Compiler Design published by Addison Wesley.  This book is very good at filling in implementation details, but you may get lost if you don't know the buzz words already.<p>At the end of the book there is a good introduction to the theory parallel compiler design.</span>

                    <span>Don't buy this book if you're looking for an introduction to compilers.  I've purchased or borrowed 5 books on compiler design and this and Dragon are the least well written.  This book does not suffer from the organization problems of the Dragon book, but it never provides simple overviews/explanations of a topic before diving head first into it.  And it takes a heck of a lot of words for the authors to say anything.   It is a chore to read.  It is not the depth that is a problem.  Intro to Algorithms and Advanced Compiler Design are as rigorous as this text, and yet I found them to be a lot more succinct and enjoyable.<p>If you have already read an introductory book on the topics it covers, you should be OK with this text if you can stand the high word to concept ratio.  After trying to stay awake for the first few chapters and not understanding the treatment of lexing and transition tables at all, and after skimming through some of the later chapters, I can say for sure that I will only use this book when I can find no other reference.  It does cover topics not found in any other text - which is the only reason I'm keeping it.<p>If you are starting out, then buy "Programming Language Processors in Java: Compilers and Interpreters" by Watt, Brown and Brown.   It is far more appropriate for anyone not versed in basic compiler theory.  Also, "Constructing Language Processors for Little Languages" is a pretty good introduction.<p>For advanced reading, I much prefer "Advanced Compiler Design".</span>
