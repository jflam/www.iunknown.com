                <span id="Label1">In this seductive account of a long, luxurious dinner at the venerable Paris restaurant Taillevent, Andrew Todhunter is both the American abroad sharing a rare gastronomic adventure with his wife and the apprentice-cum-reporter who has spent several months working in the restaurant&#8217;s celebrated kitchen, learning what goes on behind the scenes. As Todhunter describes it, Taillevent&#8217;s highly orchestrated kitchen is &#8220;less an atelier than a gun deck on a ship of war, a place of shouts and fire.&#8221;<br><br>On the other side of the kitchen&#8217;s double doors, in the warm light of the nineteenth-century dining room, the American couple surrenders to the sensual  pleasure of a beautifully wrought and meticulously served dinner&#8212;from the <i>amuse-bouche</i> (a warm cheese puff to &#8220;amuse the mouth&#8221;) and the <i>cr&#232;me de cresson</i> soup, with its sunken treasure of lobster tomalley, to the crowning glory of the<i> fantaisie. </i>In the spirit of A.J. Liebling&#8217;s <i>Between Meals,</i> Todhunter layers mouthwatering descriptions of French dishes and their preparation with reflections on his American childhood (when food, like sex and money, was not to be discussed at the table), dips into culinary history and philosophy, and entertains with asides on everything from olive oil and chestnuts to the science of viniculture and the chemistry of chocolate. Between courses, Todhunter brings us back to the sanctum of the kitchen itself, where he has probing conversations with <i>chef de cuisine</i> Philippe Legendre and pastry chef Gilles Bajolle, both major figures in the French culinary pantheon, and their assistants. Through these great chefs and their impeccably trained brigade we gain a unique glimpse into the heart of French cuisine and the love of fine food. Is cooking more an art, a craft, or a science? Are great chefs born or made? Why are there so few women chefs in France? What is the greatest danger for a chef at the top of his game? How is a new dish developed? What is the future of haute cuisine in France and in the world at large? When we cook for others, for love or for money, what do we give of ourselves?<br><br>As richly satisfying as the five-hour meal it describes, <i>A Meal Observed</i> is a delightful paean to the French and French cuisine, and to the universal love of the table. <i>Bon app&#233;tit!<br></i></span>

                    <span>Can't put the book down. Very interesting book about a dinning experience in France at one of the 3 star establishments. The only critisism is that the author tends too sway from the subject at hand. Overall I would recommend this book to one interested in knowing about the French proffesional kitchen and some of the personalities that make up the "brigade". This book has led me to others of similiar subject matter. I just skim the many pages of diversion to continue with the main account.</span>

                    <span>In this slim volume (about the size of a Zagat guide), freelance journalist Todhunter recounts a luxurious meal that he and his wife enjoyed at the world-famous Taillevent restaurant in Paris. It is no ordinary dinner, with numerous courses served over four hours, but what makes the story so compelling is Todhunter's behind-the-scenes insight into its creation. He spent three months as a reporter-apprentice, investigating every detail that makes Taillevent so special, from the precisely timed appearance of the staff to the evolution of its signature dishes over the last 50 years. Throughout, he divulges information about the inner workings of the kitchen and digresses upon details such as the chemistry involved in pastry or the history and development of salt and pepper as we know it. This splendid account from a nonfoodie (his previous books are on extreme sports) is recommended for most public libraries and any collections with an emphasis on French culture and cooking.</span>

                    <span>This was my first exposure to Andrew Todhunter's writing, and I was pleased to the extent I was able to learn about him, not just his dinner at Taillevant. He does veer off from the subject of the meal, but I thought that enhanced the reading experience. I also enjoyed his behind-the-scenes descriptions of the kitchen, which added an extra dimension. If you have ever had a meal in a restaurant of similar distinction, this book will allow you to relive that delicious experience. All-in-all, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in food and its professional preparation. And, if you are like me, it will act as an amuse bouche, making you want to read Todhunter's other books.</span>

                    <span>Todhunter, apparently at ease on towering rock faces, diving in frigid lakes, and storm kayaking, walks somewhat anxiously into the 3 star French restaurant Taillevent for a full course meal. He recounts the meal in such a way that one feels one is sitting at the table with him and his wife watching a time-honored and sacred ceremony take place. It is the ritual of haute cuisine performed meticulously by the world's best chefs, sommeliers, and servers, and described in wonderful detail by the author. Todhunter worked in the restaurant and interviewed many of the principal chefs. His treatment of the various views of cooking as art and the exploration of the contentious politics within the kitchen and between the chefs and servers is fascinating. I haven't enjoyed a personal essay on dining this much since Liebling's "Between Meals".</span>

                    <span>You think you're going to read a book describing an incredible meal at one of the world's finest restaurants with some tasty insights about what goes on behind the scenes in the kitchen. Instead you get -- ugh -- filler. Todhunter likes to go off on rambling tangents about, for instance, the history of salt. Feels like padding to me. I have dined at this caliber of Paris restaurant and have also worked in a three-star kitchen there, and there is so much more that could have been said. Save your money.</span>
