                <span id="Label1">The 2003 American invasion of Iraq was contentious, not just in the arena of global public opinion, but within the tight-lipped world of the George W. Bush White House. As Bob Woodward reveals in <I>Plan of Attack</I>, Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were part of a group leading the charge to war while Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and others actively questioned the plan to invade a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks while war in Afghanistan was still being waged. Woodward gained extensive access to dozens of key figures and enjoyed hours of direct contact with the President himself (more time, seemingly, than former Bush administration officials Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill claim to have had). As a result, he's able to cite the kind of gossip you won't find in a White House press release: Franks calls Pentagon official Douglas Feith "the f*cking stupidest guy on the face of the earth," Powell shares his alarm over how the cautious Cheney of the first Bush administration had transformed into a zealot, and Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar seems to enjoy significantly more entr&#233;e and influence than most anyone would have thought. Bush is shown as a man intent on toppling Saddam Hussein in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and never really wavering in his decision despite offering hints that non-military solutions could be achieved. Light is also shed on CIA director George Tenet, who insists that the evidence that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction was "a slam dunk" only to later admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing. But the book's most interesting character is Powell. A former soldier himself, who finds himself increasingly at odds with the agenda of the administration, Powell rejects evidence on WMDs that he sees as spurious but ultimately endorses the invasion effort, apparently out of duty. Upon its publication, the Bush administration roundly denied many of the accounts in the book that demonstrated conflict within their circles, poor judgment, or lousy planning, but the Bush/Cheney reelection campaign nonetheless listed <I>Plan of Attack</I> as recommended reading. And it is. It shows alarming problems in the way the war was conceived and planned, but it also demonstrates the tremendous conviction and dedication of the people who decided to carry it out. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>Normally I don't read anything by Bob Woodward since he is one of the pioneers of journalism's modern ipse dixit syndrome. Ipse dixit is an unsupported assertion, usually by a person of standing. Woodward has specialized in this brand of 'journalism" since his "All The President's Men." The unidentified source whom we are to accept because Woodward (and at that time, Carl Bernstein) say so. Oviously that approach can lend itself to all manner of mischief, if not duplicity. In "Plan Of Attack," Woodward relies on attributed interviews with some of the primary players, including President Bush, but he also relies upon 75 unattributed sources whose veracity is unprovable, except for Woodward's claims of truthfulness. Ipse dixit: we are supposed to trust Bob Woodward alone. Sorry, but in my view, that's gossip; not history, not journalism.<P> The mainstream media attempted to play up this book as yet another in the parade of anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War books. Woodward, to his credit, denied that such was his intent, despite the words The New York Times and others attempted to attribute to him. (Ipsedixitism gone wrong.)<P> Woodward has actually produced a worthwhile, informative oral history of the path to the decision to invade Iraq. His biases are clear: this man is no Bush partisan and he is willing to bend the truth when it comes to protecting the reputations of his beloved Democrats. Early in the book, Woodward whitewashes the Bay Of Pigs disaster by calling it a CIA failure. In fact, it was a failure on the part of President John F. Kennedy who essentially betrayed the Cuban resistance with his last minute cancellation of air and other support. Not many pages later, however, Woodward spares little detail in describing President George H. W. Bush's failure to provide support to Iraqis rebelling against Saddam in 1991. Woodward does indeed have his axes to grind, though he does not make a big show of it.<P> Woodward's "Plan Of Attack" will not make Bush-bashers happy. He portrays the lead up to the decision to attack Iraq as an ultimately well reasoned process in which few stones were left unturned in a quest to resolve the issues without resort to armed force.<P> One may disagree with the motivations of the Bush administration; one may in hindsight criticize the inteligence failures that produced claims of WDM for many years prior, but in Woodward's description of events, one would be hard-pressed to find fault with Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell or any of the other key players in the Executive Branch. These were serious, intelligent people faced with a serious problem that had to be resolved: the neutralization or removal of Saddam Hussein or for that matter, any hostile government that might rule Iraq with its oil wealth and potential for creating trouble.<P> The invasion of Iraq may, in coming years, truly be viewed in perspective as a mistake. But opponents of the President and his policies will find no comfort or support for their views in Woodward's "Plan of Attack." What one will find is a revealing portrait of intelligent people, recognizing a threat to their nation (among many other threats) and approaching it with honesty in circumstances where not all the facts are or could be known.<P> It's a worthwhile early history and, for any serious student of world affairs, a must-read.<P>Jerry</span>

                    <span>The only FREE PRESS we have left is the individual author and researcher like Woodward, who makes us think and evaluate our biased corporate-media feed and mal-nurtured minds. As a life long moderate Republican, I cannot let my ideology and prejudices obscure the fact that our President is the most ignorant, deceitful, flippant, embarrassing, and shameful President during my lifetime. I'm 60+ and have voted Republican since Eisenhower. Infringement of our Constitution and Bill of Rights all under the guise of National Security does not bode well for the US and our children's future. <P>The author clearly knows his facts and can prove them. He outlines and reveals the massive lies, propaganda, and deceit of Bush and the neo-cons leading up to the Iraq war. An un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly. All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay, combat pay, and Veterans benefits. Not to mention the billions he cut from the Veteran's Administration budget, denying aid to newly disabled veterans. Shame on them, but mostly shame on our President.<P>The frantic, blind, and zealous followers of King Bush, (King because he was appointed by the Supreme Court and not elected), <BR>Rant and Rave that this is yet another lying assault on their hero. If this is a book of lies, then why does President Bush endorse the book on his re-election site? Perhaps because, our "Republicant and donut read wells." (Sorry, my attempt at humor)<P>Seems like the standards of Presidential excellence; the ability to orate and write brilliantly, the deep understanding of history, politics, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights, have died. Shamefully this President has the lowest IQ of ANY President in the history of our country. Several independent studies have evaluated his IQ or lack thereof. It appears a President can start an illegal war, invade a foreign country based on outright lies and deceit, and be a hero to about 50% of Americans. What does that say about that particular segment of our citizens? People who refuse to find and seek the truth and act on it; people who value bluster, bragging, showing off, insincerity, lying, passing the buck, and puffery over intellect, truthfulness, and fairness. Read Woodward, and astute, intelligent, logical author with actual facts. <P>Woodward, Clarke, Dean, and the list goes on; are heroes, even if I don't always agree with them, they all have one thing in common. They give us different points of views, decent, alternative arguments, which make ourselves objective and aware. Soldiers, firemen, and policemen are heroes because the risk their lives for us every day, usually unappreciated and underpaid. Why has my president dishonored my fellow American Veterans by not having time to attend NOT ONE funeral of a soldier from a war he started. Yet he's taken more vacations and spent more time at home than ANY President in history. You cannot discount Woodward, he is a savvy Washington reporter and insider who can back up his FACTS, FACTS, and more FACTS! <P>On other conspiracies: if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Alien Rapture, by Edgar Fouche, which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program 'insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's 'Deception Point,; and 'Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's; 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which N-NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews.</span>

                    <span>A previous review states the oft-repeated lie that Joe Wilson "disproved" that Saddam tried to buy uranium: <P>"For example, when former ambassador and Africa expert Joseph C. Wilson is sent to investigate the rumor that Saddam had tried to buy weapons-grade nuclear fuel from an African nation, he comes back from the war-torn continent with the unambiguous conclusion that the rumor was unfounded."<P>Now, in fact, we know that Joe Wilson was partisan liar, and Bush was telling the truth all along: Multiple intelligence agencies and sources have been reviewed, the evidence confirmed (eg the Butler report) and determined that it was well-founded: Saddam was indeed tryng to buy uranium from Niger. <P>Lesson? Dont buy Joe Wilson's book. And dont believe the phony mantra of him and others on the left, bashing Bush as a liar.<P>More and more facts show that in fact Bush acted in good faith. Indeed "Plan of Attack" clearly backs up that thesis. This was about assessing and defeating a threat to United States. Nothing about oil, kowtowing to saudis, or some neocon rule the world plot (sorry mikey moore you're full of it). Just Bush and his team trying to protect national security in a post 9/11 world, with many uncertainties and assumptions that necessarily entails.<P>So the real lying partisan liars are in the anybody but Bush brigade yelling 'Bush lied'. They are wrong.<P>Woodward's work? It's a good book. Dunno if its a "slam dunk" though. :-) Take some of the 'private conversations' with grain of salt.</span>

                    <span>I'm surprised by the other reviews for this book. After reading it, I got a much better idea of why the decision was made to go to war with terrorists and to start with Iraq. This book made my support for President Bush and the decision to go to war even stronger than it already was. Anyone reading this, even those of a liberal bent, should be able to see how this book added strength to the case to go to war. If they can't see it, then they're obviously those liberals who are blinded by hatred, who wouldn't see somethign if it was right in front of them, and, sad to say, nothing much can be done for those types. The fact that people in the administration had different ideas about various aspects isn't some staggering new invention. People do that in any administration, business, or group. The fact that those who pressed to be more cautious, then turned around and agreed with the final decision, shows how well they can work together for the protection of us all. The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 is because Woodward has a tendency to write one thing and then say anouther when he's in an interview discussing the book. If he actually had written this book the way he makes it sound like when he discusses it, then I wouldn't have liked this book as much as I did.</span>

                    <span>"Plan of Attack" is as comprehensive an account as we're going to get during our lifetimes (those of us in late middle age or better, anyway) about the events, opinions, arguments, disagreements, office politics, ideology, plans and preparation that led up to the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq in March of 2003.<P>Reading this book is a bit like watching sausage being made; it's a tad revolting. After finishing Bob Woodward's opus I walked away with the troubling impression that G.W. Bush is not the strong leader he keeps telling us he is. He's more the spoiled, insensitive, self-centered, stubborn, hyperactive little boy with attention deficit disorder who likes to play cowboys and indians. <P>Bush is often out of touch and out of the loop, partly because of his inability to grasp complex (and sometimes even simple) issues and partly because of the control, by the people who surround him, of the flow of information that actually reaches the president. There's a line about Colin Powell's observation that no decion gets made until the president has met alone with Vice President Dick Cheney. This and other parts of the narrative serve to raise questions about who is really in charge in this administration. (Members of the 9/11 commission have recently expressed serious doubt that Cheney's order to shoot down hijacked airliners that day actually came from the president, as Bush and Cheney both testified in their joint closed-door session with the panel. A major reason for their disbelief is that the commission found no record of this alleged Bush-Cheney communication, though established protocols require that such contacts be recorded).<P>Secretary of State Colin Powell and his deputy, Richard Armitage, are the lone voices of reason straining to be heard above the cacophony of trigger-happy madmen. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz comes up with a plan to overrun and seize Iraq's southern oil fields, with the expectation that the Iraqis will rally around U.S. forces and rise up to overthrow Saddam's government...the Bay of Pigs assumption. Powell, shaking his head, keeps saying "this is lunacy". In his opinion, "it was one of the most absurd, strategically unsound proposals he had ever heard."<P>General Tommy Franks was initially another figure who questioned the idea of going into Iraq. When asked to develop a war plan for invading that country, he was incredulous. They were in the midst of one war, Afghanistan, and they wanted detailed planning for another, Iraq? "Goddam," Franks said, "what the f___ are they talking about?"<P>But the headlong rush to war, vigorously promoted by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Rice, (Saudi prince/embassador) Bandar, and others, picked up momentum and reached the point of no return. Despite clear indications that a resolution to invade Iraq would not pass muster in the U.N. Security Council, and despite the overt opposition to the adventure by France, Russia, Germany, and a host of other countries, Bush ordered the unprovoked invasion of a sovereign state.<P>It's my impression that there's a subtle undertow, barely a hint, that sinister forces might have been at play in Bush's decision to go forward with the invasion. For example, when former embassador and Africa expert Joseph C. Wilson is sent to investigate the rumor that Saddam had tried to buy weapons-grade nuclear fuel from an African nation, he comes back from the war-torn continent with the unambiguous conclusion that the rumor was unfounded. Based on Wilson's report, a line referring to Saddam's attempt to buy fissionable materials is deleted from an early draft of the president's upcoming State of the Union address.<P>But the sentence mysteriously reappears in the final speech that makes it to the teleprompter for Bush to read to the world. (Wilson later [July 6, 2003] published an article in the New York Times titled "What I Didn't Find in Africa", which opened with the question "Did the Bush administration manipulate intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs to justify an invasion of Iraq?" As punishment for daring to speak out, Wilson's wife was "outed" as a covert CIA agent, effectively ending her career and placing her life, and the lives of her overseas contacts, in jeopardy.)<P>It's hard to fathom how Bob Woodward managed, with the cooperation of this famously secretive administration, to gather all the intricate details revealed in his fascinating tome. The book is replete with candid takes of the principals and other participants in this not-very-pretty story of how the U.S. got into the sticky, bloody mess from which it may never completely extricate itself. I suspect that Woodward exploited the good will he created when he presented Bush, et al, as couragious heros in his previous book, "Bush at War". The cynic in me says that he wrote that book in order to gain the confidence of the Bush gang, laying the groundwork that would allow him the access to people, documents, and other resources essential to the preparation of the current book, a hard-hitting indictment of a dysfunctional administration. <P>"Plan of Attack" is a very instructive must-read for those interested in government, politics, history, organizational behavior, military strategy, international relations, diplomacy, covert operations, hanging with the big dogs, the making of sausage, and perhaps most importantly, the importance of voting intelligently.<P>***</span>
