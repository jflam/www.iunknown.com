                    <span>Alan Weiss is taking advantage of his readers by essentially taking a pamphlet worth of information and stretching it into a hard back book.  Most the the essential information was imparted in one of his first consulting books (Million Dollar Consulting) which had value. Read that book and you are set with much of what he has to offer.</span>

                    <span>While Alan Weiss's eternal best-seller "Million Dollar Consulting" remains the most valuable book overviewing consulting practices, this book takes the reader into the actual mechanics and philosophy of value based fees. The transition will be worth six figures annually, because it's been worth it to me. The single negative review claiming this book repeats "Million Dollar" is far off base as far as I'm concerned (or the reviewer didn't read this book). For example, Value Based Fees deals with converting hourly clients, setting up retainers, combatting the competition's lower fees and a wealth of detail that the more primary book doesn't touch. Get this book today, because you're leaving money on the table every day it's unread.</span>

                    <span>This book is a MUST read not only for those consultants who have to submit proposals but should be required reading for all professions who charge by the hour - YES doctors, opticians, dentists, accountants and lawyers as well!! <p>This book gives a sound theoretical basis for charging value based fees instead of hourly fees (everyone in the world ONLY has 24 hours in a day so this approach makes absolute sense).<p>BUT the Coup de Grace is the fourth chapter  "If you only read one chapter....." which sets out exactly how to structure value based fee proposals and gives a live example.<p>I have long been charging value based rather than time based fees but this chapter raised my fees to a new level.</span>
