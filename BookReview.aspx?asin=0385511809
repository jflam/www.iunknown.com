                    <span>This book will be read 100 years from now for insight into the mindset of post-9/11 Western thought.  Capturing an eventful day in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne, the book beautifully addresses daily life in the 21st Century -- a man's joys as well as the fears -- in a world of terrorism.</span>

                    <span>Dozens of hours of boring people talking about their boring lives. Who cares! I stuck with the audio CD version for too long, could not bear it any longer. Life is too short. Have fun, get the new Elmore Leonard.</span>

                    <span>I really liked Atonement and Amsterdam, but I could not get into Saturday. Ulysses takes place in one day and so does Saturday, and even though McEwan does not pretend to emulate Joyce, I couldn't help comparing the two books. In the comparison, Saturday comes out as a tired, limp sister. It also seems pedestrian, more like something from a mainstream hack like Jeffrey Archer than a literate whiz like McEwan. I expect his next book to be much better than this one!</span>

                    <span>"SATURDAY" at its core is about how we live today, in today's world, under today's political climate. This is no social commentary; "SATURDAY" is a novel - and a fine novel at that. Yet author Ian McEwan's keen wording and brilliant subtlety paint a world of muted brilliance, contrast and compliment. I am such a fan of well written books, it makes such a difference. "SATURDAY" is in the realm of "THE DA VINCI CODE", "MY FRACTURED LIFE", "GLASS CASTLE" and even the "HARRY POTTER" series, not because of any similarities between the diversity of genres, but because of what they are at the core. "SATURDAY" is just a fabulously well written book. </span>

                    <span>So often I come across a book I want to read and think to myself, "Is this journey really going to be worth the effort and money?"  So often I am disappointed, especially after spending hours alone, delving into some hyped and over-touted book, only to find that the critics were wrong when they came to praising it.  Not so with SATURDAY.  Riveting characters make this book more memorable than most and I felt it moved along with more edge than ATONEMENT or even the much suggested CHILDREN'S CORNER by McCrae, which was recommend at the same time.  If you want a book that won't disappoint, this is it.</span>
