                <span id="Label1">It ought to be just a game, but basketball on the playgrounds of Coney Island is much more than that &mdash; for many young men it represents their only hope of escape from a life of crime, poverty, and despair. In The Last Shot, Darcy Frey chronicles the aspirations of four of the neighborhood"s most promising players. What they have going for them is athletic talent, grace, and years of dedication. But working against them are woefully inadequate schooling, family circumstances that are often desperate, and the slick, brutal world of college athletic recruitment. Incisively and compassionately written, The Last Shot introduces us to unforgettable characters and takes us into their world with an intimacy seldom seen in contemporary journalism. The result is a startling and poignant expose of inner-city life and the big business of college basketball.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The writer follows several players, including a budding high school freshman named Stephon Marbury through a year of heights and falls in the Coney Island Project. This book takes a good hard look at big college recruiting, the myriad of camps and summer leagues for players, and the pressure that the world is putting on even our youngest athletes. Never far from the surface is the brutal poverty and crime of the New York projects. The writing is vivid in describing people and places. The dialouge is real and intense. I found myself unable to put the book down at times because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Includes an epilouge to tell you what happened in the years after high school to the boys that the book follows. A great book. Well-written and thought-provoking</span>

                    <span>This book really expresses what it's like to live in the Coney Island projects, with nothing but a dream to live by. In between poverty and stardom, education is a long-term key that these boys don't focus on enough, because they know that basketball is what is gonna get them out of the streets, and into college (or maybe even the big time NBA, for a selected few) But the association between grades isn't emphasized at all. These guys show a great passion and desire for the game. Proud to string up shining white nets on the playgrounds, proud to have gotten snap-back rims for dunking. The game is all about desire, pride, passion, and also slightly important: skill. This book by Darcy Frey shows all of these by by just describing Russell, Tchaka, Stephon, and all the others.</span>

                    <span>I found this to be an interesting story and a pretty good book. I thought the descriptions of the coaches' recruiting antics were very enlightening and well written. Being able to use some of the real names, particularly very well known ones such as Stephon Marbury and Jim Boeheim, added a lot to the credibility of the book.<P>Where I found this work to be lacking was in the descriptive writing. Really good writers construct word pictures that are vivid and allow the reader to better experience the story being told. I didn't find the writing quality in this book that would have made me rate it a 5 star effort. This author's style seemed to me to be more like a newspaper reporter's - limited to a fixed amount of space and more focused on the basics than the aesthetics. Outstanding books also need to deliver the aesthetics in the form of well painted word pictures. I wish this book had been stronger in that area.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's not just another stupid basketball book -- it's really an in-depth look into the lives of 4 inner city kids trying to reach success by way of a basketball scholarship. The author follows their high school team around for about 9 months, and chronicles his experiences and conversations with each kid (one of whom is future NBA star Stephon Marbury). This book will fascinate you with true stories and inside looks at the often-crooked nature of amateur sports, but what I found most compelling was the way their own education system and support structure often failed them.</span>
