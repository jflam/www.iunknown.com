                <span id="Label1"><b>If I Live to Be 100 is</b> a remarkable book, beautifully written and elegantly wise, that takes us inside the world of the very old and invites us to learn from them firsthand the art of living well for an exceptionally long period of time.<br><br>Neenah Ellis always wanted to live to 100, and her fascination led her to interview centenarians from all over the country about what life was like at the very beginning of the century, and how things have changed over time. Ellis, a producer for National Public Radio, spent an unforgettable year traveling with her tape recorder and listening to the stories of America&#8217;s oldest men and women. She met a couple who courted by horse and sleigh in Vermont during the winter of 1918, and she spent a week with the oldest living black lesbian in America. She visited a nationally known expert on dyslexia who published a book at 96 and whose great-great-grandfather was a colonel in Washington&#8217;s army; and she met Anna Wilmot, the row-boating centenarian from New England who captured the hearts of thousands of NPR listeners with her confession that she swims in the buff only &#8220;when it&#8217;s foggy and there&#8217;s no fisherman around.&#8221;  <br><br>Originally conceived as an American history project, Ellis&#8217;s year of interviews became much more, a personal journey of growth and transformation. After two decades of acting as the reporter and inquisitor, Ellis finally shifted gears and was able in the process of these conversations to start really listening. Once she had put away the exigencies of her cusp-of-the-millennium life&#8212;her deadlines, the intense focus on current events, the endless e-mail and ringing phones &#8212;she began to learn the kinds of things that we do from much older people. She started to connect in her conversations with them, and to see the virtue of looking forward, as the centenarians did, not backward. They reminded her that the moment&#8212;this very moment that we&#8217;re in right now&#8212;is precious and fine. And that the true richness of life is to be found in each other&#8212;in our marriages and friendships, in the intellectual life that we share with each other, and in the ways that we become connected. Their stories add up to a course in living well, with lessons and inspiration for all of us.</span>

                    <span>I work in healthcare; specifically with geriatric patient's, so this book was of great interest to me when I heard it was coming out. Neenah Ellis worked for NPR News in the past, and this was the other reason I wanted to read this book. It's basically a compilation of stories about 100 year olds, their lives, and what makes them "tick". Overall, I really enjoyed this book and Ms. Ellis' writing style. But, I was hoping for a bit more of "how" these people got to be 100. What was their secret for longevity? She was able to ascertain this from some of the centenarians, but not everyone. I also thought she covered a wide variety of individuals, from a very funny lesbian to a conservative Christian. Still, it was an inspiring read that gives anyone hope for life after retirment.</span>

                    <span>Ellis produced a program for National Public Radio for which she interviewed people who were a hundred years old or older. She interviewed a wide variety including Margaret Rawson (a world-renowned expert on dyslexia), Ruth Ellis (the oldest living lesbian), Sadie and Gilbert Hill (married for over eighty years). At first, Ellis is focussed on the historical aspects of their lives, but soon finds herself on a personal journey of her own, where she connects to them as individuals alive in the world and begins to see how looking forward, not backward, is a secret to longevity, as is living in the here and now. More of a story of Ellis herself than the centenarians she met, "If I Live to Be 100" is a surprisingly luminous memoir that charms the reader and opens the mind to what it means to be really alive.</span>

                    <span>Based on the title, I was truly expecting to read the "wisdom of the ages." Unfortunately, other than a few snippets and a couple of generalizations, the majority of this book is centered on the frustrations of obtaining the knowledge being sought and the process by which the author was able to acquire some patience with the elderly. To the author's credit, she mentions that this is how the book will transpire early on. To the author's discredit, she never changed the title appropriately. Kudos to the power of marketing and a lesson for those considering this title, "Read the reviews."</span>

                    <span>When I met Neenah must have been the morning after she had camped under Anna's window. I too was awake early the August morning, waiting for Anna to come home from her morning row. It was the day after one of her many birthday parties, and I wanted to tell her how nice she looked on the tv. I hopped on my boat just as Anna was nearing the shore and cruised my way over there before she started up her hill. <BR> Anna introduced me to Neenah, saying that Neenah was going to share my dear Anna with the rest of the world. And after reading this book, I'm here to tell you that Neenah has truly captured the real Anna. <BR> I'll admit I originally only bought this book to read about my friend, but I found myself drawn to all of the Centenarians and the stories they had to share. In the mean time I learned things about Anna that I never knew. I never knew Anna's husband Fred. He had died before I was born! Anna was my favorite babysitter (when she was 70 something, and I was in grade school).<BR> She is still in fine health all though her hearing is going and her knees are bad. She often calls me up to find out how my love life is going. Anna has promised to dance at my wedding, and I'm going to hold her to that. But she has told me that she's getting tired so I better get to it!!!<P>And just remember this....<BR> Don't eat the fish!!!</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading this book very much. It is filled with stories about interesting people who have lived incredible lives Neenah Ellis is a journalist who spent an unforgettable year travelling the country listening to the stories of people who have reached the age of 100 and beyond for a National Public Radio series. I truly believe now that the secret to a long happy life is to stay active either mentally or physically. The people in this book can all attest to that. This book profiles educators like Margaret Rawson who published a book about dyslexia and her work in the field at the age of 96. Abraham Goldstein is a dedicated professor who has taught law for 70 years. I loved the story of Anna Wilmot who stayed active by paddling a rowboat and going skinny dipping.<P>I also enjoyed the story of Ruth Ellis who was the oldest black lesbian. She was an accomplished public speaker and gay activist who made 100 appearances in a 1 year speaking on college campuses and gay functions all over the country. Ruth Ellis achievements have not gone unnoticed as a film has been made about her life. The story of Louisiana Hines is interesting because her grandfather was a slave. She can vividly recall how blacks were lynched for preaching about equality in the early years of the 20th century.<P> Roy Stamper became a successful horse trainer He also developed a love for preaching despite having only 4 years of formal education. Roy Stamper proved that it is never too late to fall in love, because he got married at the age of 101. <P> Sadie and Gilbert Hill were married for an amazing 81 years. The secret to their long marriage can be summed up in one word together. They did everything together from cooking to shopping to dancing. This couple even worked together as farm caretakers milking cows and herding cattle. I loved the story of Harry Shapiro whose life has been prolonged and enriched by his passion to paint. If I live to be 100 is a wonderful book.</span>
