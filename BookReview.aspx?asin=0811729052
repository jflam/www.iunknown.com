                <span id="Label1">Real war stories told by real soldiers for readers who want to know what it was like to be in the thick of battle. These are riveting combat narratives about the weapons and warriors of some of history's bloodiest conflicts. Each book is a gritty, action-oriented account of life and death in the heat of battle. Original titles as well as long out-of-print gems will explore conflicts ranging from the blood-soaked fields of the Civil War to the current war on terror and everything in between. The books are published as high-quality and affordable trade paperbacks, making them terrific editions for all who are interested in military history.  <P>The Waffen SS were considered the elite of the German armed forces in the Second World War and were involved in almost continuous combat. From the sweeping tank battle of Kursk on the Russian front to the bitter fighting among the hedgerows of Normandy and the last great offensive in the Ardennes, forever immortalized in history as the Battle of the Bulge, these men and their tanks made history.  <P>Illustrations: 32 b/w photos; 15 drawings; 4 maps</span>

                    <span>Panzer ace Willi Fey survived the war having earned the Deutsche Kreuz in Gold for his actions in Normandy and fought in the final battles for Berlin. This cheap reprint of the Fedorowicz classic is a translation of Fey's original German text Panzerkampf im Bild first published by Munin Verlag. As a fund of personal accounts from Waffen SS tank commanders it provides unrivalled reference material, from the hot spots of the Russian front and the battles for Charkov in early 1943 to an account of Jagdtigers in action in the final days of the war..<BR> Fey had transferred to the Waffen-SS from the Heer and was posted to Schwere SS Panzer Abteilung 102. The Tiger crews enjoyed great success in Normandy & France as a static defensive vehicle, a role it was forced to perform due to Allied air superiority. The static defense also took away mechanical unreliability from the tanks & conserving valuable fuel without taking away the advantage in firepower. <BR>The actions for which Fey won his German cross in Gold are recounted in detail here and are typical of the type of material presented by individual SS tank commanders in the book. <BR>By the beginning of August 1944 the German lines in Normandy were crumbling. On 8 August as Allied forces crept towards Vire, west of Falaise, Willi Fey as an SS-Unterscharführer from the 1st Company of sSSPzAbt 102, launched an attack, supported by the 1./Pioneer Btn 600 under Oberleutnant GAUL, on a column of 15 Shermans and gun carriers from the 23rd Hussars/11th Armoured Division, sighted approaching down the valley from the direction of the hamlet of Houssemagne. Opening fire at a distance of 600 metres, 4 Shermans are rapidly put out of action. Fey's Tiger «134» is disabled by a number of hits. Kommandeur Pz. Ab 102 Obersturmbannführer Weiß orders Fey to blow up his Tiger. Fey continues firing at the Shermans accounting for 14 off them in a 30 minute action. His Tiger is towed back to German lines later that night. Weiß recommends Fey for the Deutsche Kreuz in Gold following this action and the award is presented by General II Panzerkorps Bittrich on 15 September 1944...<BR>It should be stressed that there is little in the way of documentary evidence for the accounts presented here ( certainly British records do not record the loss of 15 Shermans on the day in question ) but the book works fine on a purely descriptive level..herein are the sort of personal accounts that Tim Ripley's works on the Waffen SS Panzer arm so lacked..<BR>Despite individual Tiger actions like this, disaster befell the Tigers at Falaise with 102nd SS-SPz Abt " DAS Reich " losing all its Tigers although claiming to have knocked out 227 tanks in 6 weeks. The 101st LSSAH claimed over 200 including Wittmans tally at Villers-Bocage. However not many Tiger I's crossed the Seine after Falaise. <BR>Post war, Willi Fey achieved high rank in the Bundeswehr ( Federal German armed forces..)<BR>Once again, thanks to Stackpole for this fine re-print..</span>
