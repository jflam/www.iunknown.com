                <span id="Label1">Major League Baseball's 30 stadiums--each with its own distinct ambience and dimensions--greatly affect both a fan's devotion and a team's specific style of play. If not for the familiar sun- and beer-drenched bleachers and vine-covered walls, why else would fans perennially flock to Chicago's Wrigley  Field to support yet another losing season? And, in St. Louis and Kansas City,  Missouri, where the "grass" never needs mowing, why not assemble rosters with  speed in mind? <p> Ahuja's <I>Fields of Dreams</I> is a baseball stadium tour guide, including both stadium logistics (tickets, concessions, parking) and profiles of each Major League town (lodging, restaurants, and attractions). But the book's strength lies in its ability to capture what it's like to be a fan in each Major League city, including past stadium heroics (slim for some hapless clubs) and descriptions of parks from home plate to foul pole. The author, who moonlights as a baseball tour guide, describes venerable Wrigley as "a great baseball park in a great neighborhood where you can see the game the way it should be--up close and personal." Montreal's Olympic Stadium contains "everything there is to dislike about a modern-day ballpark," but its "nightlife is absolutely incredible--unlike anything I've seen since visiting New Orleans." <I>Fields of Dreams</I> also includes Tropicana Field and Bank One Ballpark, the respective homes of 1998's expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks. <I>--Rob McDonald</I></span>

                    <span>This book proves to be mildly informative about the main subject matter, the baseball stadiums of the major league. However, I believed that the author spent too much time being a tour guide of the city of each stadium instead of the stadium itself. I wanted a lot more information about the stadium of each city instead of the city itself. I can find other books on the city if I need to. I don't need to read about it in a book I thought would be about major league baseball stadiums.
<br />
<br />Each stadium is given a very short review and rest of the chapter centered around the sights, sound and places to stay. I really wanted to know bit more about the stadium, best seats, worst seats, food, and that sort of thing.
<br />
<br />I got the 2001 edition and it does feel dated already. I think this book have been effectively replaced by "The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip" book that came out this year and contain a huge wealth of information about each stadium and its suroundings. But in that book, the stadium and baseball remains the main focus; in "Fields of Dreams", it seem to be the city. In many ways, "Fields of Dreams" should have read like the "The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip" but the author wasn't ambitious enough to do it right.
<br />
<br />Overall, it does have useful information but they are rather minor and its dated. The "other" book have effective replaced it so I don't see why any one wants to buy this book any more.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up as a gift for someone who has talked about traveling to visit all ballparks over the next few years.  Enjoyed reading about some of the ballparks that I have recently visited, but was disappointed to see that while this book was reveised in 2001, he did not visit BOB in Phoenix.  The information is all pre-opening and is even written as if the park is not yet opened.   Good discriptions of Pac-Bell and Safco field both which opened after BOB.</span>

                    <span>Like other reviewers said, much of the information is outdated, but I like what the book tried to do: collect both baseball and nonbaseball information in one volume. The 'closest major league city' section are a  nice touch for someone planning a road trip, and the top ten lists  scattered throughout the book are a nice touch</span>
