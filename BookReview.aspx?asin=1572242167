                    <span>This book doesnt tell you much of how to overcome social anxiety.
<br />The writer just says to see a therapist. Or take medication. Well,I knew that.
<br />
<br />Author Markway says she has social anxiety disorder. It has to be a mild case. She is married. 
<br />
<br />I am 43 and (cant) never dated.

                    <span>I was trying to think of a way to help everyone out there who has been dealing with the same feelings that I have been.  I have tried everything that people recommend for social anxiety, many exposures, going to programs, numerous therapists.  If I had known even two months ago that today I would feel at ease in many situations I never would have believed it.  The two books that will change you noticably and permanently are both "Feeling Good", and "Psycho-cybernetics".  I had tried everything out there I could get my hands on, and then these two books were a godsend.  After a week into "Feeling Good" you will actually start feeling like the person you want to be, and a month into it you will feel SO much better.  I recommend that after that go directly into "Psycho-Cybernetics".  The introduction says that he thought his book would never sell because nobody would believe his claims that he can give you the personality you want through visualization, and I thought it was hype.   Then after doing it for a few days I was amazed.  I have only used this book a week, and am already very much better.  You dont need the therapists, drugs, alcohol or the bible to feel better, just get these two books, be committed to them.  Give them a month, and if you change half as much as I have you will be very glad you did.  You dont need to sit inside worried, these books will make you the person you want to be.</span>

                    <span>This workbook is a great resource!  It is great that the authors, who are published researchers in the area of social anxiety, can describe their methods in an easy to read, easy to follow workbook.  I especially found the section on getting to know your social anxiety helpful in breaking down something broad and formless (shyness) into a road map for making change.   <br>If you are serious about making some changes in your life with regard to shyness and social avoidance, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>A truly excellent resource! This book is full of valuable exercises for challenging the irrational thoughts and avoidance behaviors that fuel social anxiety. I particularly appreciated the creative examples of how one can confront and overcome social and performance fears in a gradual and manageable fashion. Of all of the resources that I've come across to date, this book has been the most helpful to me in terms of offering realistic and practical strategies!</span>

                    <span>I have been a shy and anxious person for years.  I recently started a job that requires me to speak up in meetings and even do some public speaking.  These are things I have always avoided...but this was a job I really wanted.  Antony & Swinson's book has been a huge help to me.  I've found the exercises and tips to be very helpful.  I do a lot of public speaking now with pretty minimal anxiety and also feel much calmer when casually socializing with new people that I meet. Thanks!</span>
