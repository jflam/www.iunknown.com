                    <span>	George Orwell's 1984 is a crowning achievement of the negative utopia novel, bringing forth oppressment  and totalitarianism in a strict society in which all men are slaves to the Party.  Orwell's use of symbolism and foreshadowing are fantastic, bringing forth all the elements of lost humanity which he wishes to bring about in the novel.
<br />	The symbols in 1984 are striking and disturbing, but completely impressive.  The entire idea of Newspeak is well used.  It is a symbol of the deteriorating of humanity through simplification and the use of force by Big Brother.  Also prevalent is the vanishing of people.  People vanish not because of a clear violation of laws, but because they are turned in by others for a violation.  Often there is no trial and no chance for a people to save themselves from being killed.  This shows the complete deterioration of all human freedom as we know it.  People are killed for mere suspicion with no definitive proof of wrongdoing, all so that society can go on smoothly.
<br />	The foreshadowing throughout the novel is also very effective.  Orwell uses Winston's dreams to show events that come to pass soon thereafter.  His dream in which he hears the voice tell him "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" ironically foreshadows Winston's being in a prison cell full of light, rather than a triumph over the darkness of the times as Winston first sees it.  Also well used is "2+2=4" foreshadowing his change after the conditioning that "two and two make five."  All of this foreshadowing really works to create a sense of destination for Winston.
<br />	Th novel's use of foreshadowing and symbolism coincide to create a sense of terror and impending doom.  They work perfectly and the end result is one of the greatest warnings from literature ever.

                    <span>I would never have come to the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four was going to be as it was - frightening, thought provoking and ultimately distressing. To think that a work of fiction from the 1940s could so accurately discribe elements of life today is amazing, and almost unheard of. 
<br />This book speaks about a guy by the name of Winston Smith. He seems like a pretty cool guy in the story in the story. He started out with thoughtcrime. He graduates through a series of misdemeanors and even plans to overthrow the government that took him in as an orphan. 
<br />It is a book that makes you aware because your every move is watched and where the media is controlled.  This book has it's own language, a twisted corruption of English, which can in part be seen today. It is easy to imagine that a camera is on you all the time, that people can look inside your head. This book makes you wonder about things like that. Like what if somebody can come into my mind and read my thoughts and what if somebody is watching me all the time and I never sat down to think about this. To me the book was very good I think if you just give it time and really get into the book you would really enjoy yourself. It is kind of scary, but hey so is life.

                    <span>"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."
<br />
<br />	So goes the slogan of the Party, the oppressive totalitarian regime depicted in George Orwell's nightmarish and depressing vision of the future circa 1984. Enter Winston Smith, our tortured protagonist, who spends his days rewriting the past to coincide with the present and his nights scrawling rebellious thoughts into an illegally kept diary. The increasingly desperate Smith longs to escape a world in which all thoughts are controlled (courtesy of "Big Brother", the ever-watching leader of Oceania who may or may not exist) and concepts such as individuality, passion, and love are unheard of. Winston finds his solace in Julia, an eccentric and free-thinking woman who shares his angst. They soon become revolutionaries by having a love affair and taking walks in the countryside. Together, the two join a resistance force known only as The Brotherhood, dedicating their lives to the destruction of the Party. However, Winston and Julia soon discover that the eyes of Big Brother are not so easily blinded.
<br />
<br />	Reading 1984, I was literally chilled by how accurately the novel parallels both our current times and the probable future. Not once did I doubt the credibility of Orwell's predictions; the police state he creates is utterly believable from introduction to conclusion. The author unflinchingly illustrates true evil and cruelty, and the entire book emanates a sense of helplessness and despair. Eric Arthur Blair ("George Orwell" was, in fact, merely a pseudonym) saw a world in which all traces of humanity have been stripped away, and the majority of the population is composed of automatons devoid of the will to think. It is this world that we will be seeing decades from now unless vigilance is kept. With freedom comes responsibility, and we cannot sit idly by as our rights are taken away from us.
<br />
<br />	In fact, we may already be seeing this type of society in many facets of our culture, albeit on a much subtler level than in this work. Orwell's masterpiece has often - and logically so - been used as a political tool by the left wing. Numerous are the uncomfortable similarities to the world we are now living in. "WAR IS PEACE," etc. can easily be made to spell out the Bush Administration's philosophy. The telescreens installed in every civilian's home - used for surveillance and propagandizing - prompt the reader to reflect upon our own major news sources, all owned by large corporations with agendas of their own and vast ability to "alter" the truth. The Party's license to spy on anyone and everyone with no justification is terrifyingly reminiscent of the Homeland Security Act passed by Congress in 2003. It all gives you a fresh appreciation of your ability to analyze what you're told and discern lies from fact.
<br />
<br />	I would recommend this novel to anyone who treasures freedom and needs a reminder of what we could become if our guard is let down. Orwell was a political prophet, a seer, and the consequences of ignoring his warnings could be very dire indeed. To any Republicans reading this review (hopefully the previous paragraph didn't alienate you), please don't regard this as a "liberal" novel. 1984 is much more than an anti-Bush cliché. The book's themes are universal, and all proponents of liberty and justice can appreciate it.</span>

                    <span>i have read this book over and over. it never bores me
<br />no matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live in
<br />politicians never change and always practice the art of deception.
<br />people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.
<br />if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely</span>

                    <span>Winston Smith is a middle aged man livin in the superstate of Oceania.  There are three superstates, Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia.  They all have almost the same type of economy.  Also their always at war witheach other.  The year is 1984 and Big brother and the thought police are always watching you through their telescreens which are located in almost every corner.  You can't even think something against the party or else you'll commit a thoughtcrime.  There are three types of people in the scoiety, proles, lowest, outer party, middle, and inner party highest.  The superstate of Oceania is run by four sections, Ministry of truth, Ministry of peace, Ministry of plenty, and Ministry of love.  Winston smith is part of the outer party.  He has a harsh feeling of hatred towards big brother.  He starts to write a journal, which is a thought crime and SHOWS HIS HARSH HATRED FOR bIG bROTHER.  He hears of a underground organization which tries to bring down this system od unjust.  Men and women are not allowed to marry unless the show no affection for each other.  Winston was once married.  Winston starts to think a man he sees at work is against big brother.  Winston starts being followed by a young girl.  He soon found out from a note that she loves him.  They start meeting each other every couple of weeks.  Winston rents a room from a man named Mr. Charrington that was suppose to have no telescreen in  it and was supposedly completely private.  The girl Julia and winston start meeting there frequently.  Soon O'brien approaches Winston and gives him his address.  Winston and Julia go to his house together and tell him they want to be part of the brotherhood with Goldstein, the leader of this group against big brother.  They join it but learn that they'll never meet Goldstein and will die for the cause and do anything except split apart.  O'brien tells Julia and winston says they must read a BOOK on the brotherhood by Goldstein.  When Julia and Winston meet again in the room from Mr. Charrington to read the book they are caught by a telescreen which was hidden behind a picture and they find out Mr. Charrington was not who they thought he was.  The thought police surround them.  Winston and Julia are taken away and kept in cells.  Will they be sent to room 101, executed, or will someone arrive that Winston knows?  To find out read this book.  I felt this book was awesome and scary.  I'd reccomend it to everyone.  I couldn't imagine being in a world where history kept being changed and people could be arrested for thinking things.  Hopefully our world never turns out to be like this.</span>
