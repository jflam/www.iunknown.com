                <span id="Label1">"The nude has always been a source of inspiration and one of the main themes of photography." The introduction to this small brick-format book&#151;the shape alone already makes it conspicuous&#151;briefly and concisely describes the special quality of this title. Various perspectives of the naked body are presented to the observers&#146; eyes, representing the diverse interpretations of photographers from all over the world. The motifs Man, Woman, and Pair open up a world of the senses that has much more to offer than just a nude that one can touch. This artful feast for the eyes is a must for everyone.</span>

                    <span>This book gave me a bone. Unfortunately, some of the pages now stick together and the only pictures I can still get to are the gay ones. That sucks. Are any of these chicks in videos?</span>

                    <span>I came across this little book during one of my frequent trips to the photo section of my local Borders and had to pick it up. Mainly due to is very small size.<BR>I was soon trapped flipping through the hundreds and hundreds of pages of beautiful nude photographs, unable to put the book down.<BR>The only text in this book is a bit at the beginning and end and then the name of each photographer before you see their work. Thats it. No rambling text, just great nude photos. <BR>This collection feature many of the worlds best nude photographers and is broken down into three sections. Female nudes, Male nudes, and couple nudes. It really cant get much more simple that that.<BR>The book is printed on good gloss heavyweight paper, as you would expect to find in photo monographs and has a sturdy hardback.<BR>Although a great collection of photos and printed well, I am a bit disappointed in the book size. It only measures about 3inches by 3inches, and because of the large number of photos inside, the weight of the book tends to deteriorate the binding fast if viewed a lot. Also, I have found it hard to find a good place for this tiny book on my shelf. It just doesnt fit in very well. But becuase the book is so good and the downfalls are few, I only took one star. <BR>I still feel that all nude photography fans should purchase this book for their collection at its very cheap price.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The first 60% of this book consists of photographs of women. The next 20% is of males, and the final 20% are couples (gay, lesbian, and straight).<P>The vast majority of the photographs are black & white and consist of young and beautiful models. There is such a variety of different images, and the same model is rarely used twice. Sexual overtones are definitely apparent throughout the book, along with a few closeups of genetalia.<P>It is a short book (in terms of height) but it is also quite thick. The photographs take up each entire page and the only text is the artist name at the beginning of each new group of photographs.</span>

                    <span>For such a small book -- it measures just over 5"X5" -- this holds a whole lot of great pictures. From the ordinary to the sensual, this book is worth looking at. It really made me want fruit (see pages 28 and 29)! <BR>However, for being a book based solely on perusing, the small size is rather off-putting. It's not the detail that gets lost in translation, but the impact. However, the perfect price for this lets me wholeheartedly recommend this title for those that are interested in photos of nudes.</span>
