                <span id="Label1">Monique Ryan distills nearly two decades of experience counseling athletes on their nutritional needs into this comprehensive yet accessible book. She discusses both general principles &#151; useful for endurance athletes in any sport &#151; as well as specific guidelines for those involved in triathlons, cycling, mountain biking, swimming, distance running, and more. The book&#146;s three sections cover the basics of building a healthy diet, training nutrition, and sports-specific nutrition. Including photos, charts, tables, appendixes with sample menus, shopping lists, vegetarian information, and much more, this book provides a detailed up-to-date guide to the nutritional needs of endurance athletes.</span>

                    <span>This book is by far the best source of nutritional information I have found for endurance athletes. It's great because it maintains the focus and isn't jammed full of useless information. It has great charts, sample menus, different information tables, and specific sports nutritional guidance. I read it cover to cover, re-read it, highlighting along the way, then shoved it in my backpack to use as a quick reference and as a silent coach. Having this book is as important to me as having the right shoes, bike or clothing.</span>

                    <span>Having been in the fitness industry for twenty years as an exercise physiologist and lecturer, I've read most of the nutriton books that have made the circuit. I found Monique Ryan's book to be one of the most satisfying sources of well researched information available. Monique's book is short on fluff and big on information. It's refreshing to find a well organized, conscisely written nutritonal manual for athletes who want to maximize their training methods with facts rather than hype. I make it required reading for the athletes that I work with.</span>

                    <span>As a 43-year old beginning triathlete, there were lots of things I needed to know to ensure success in my sport and knew early on that proper nutrition would be key. I read the book from cover-to-cover and found almost every paragraph provided valuable information. Not only did the author explain in detail what I needed to know, she explained all the whens, whys and whats -- when to eat, why particular foods are better for training that others and what foods work best for the MY training. I used the book as a bible and, on my way to reaching the best shape I've ever been in, lost nine pounds and went from 22% to 12% body fat. And although I faced challenge after challenge along the way, by following what I learned in the book, nutrition was never an obstacle.</span>

                    <span>I am a cyclist and purchased this book to help educate myself more about how I need to fuel for cycling. I race at a high level and train 15-28hrs per week. Monique Ryan clearly explains the theory behind certain nutritional requirements, then gives keypoints on how to achieve those, and finally gives sample menu's and various information on the nutritional values of foods. Definitely a good book to keep going back to as a reminder of what you need to be doing.</span>
