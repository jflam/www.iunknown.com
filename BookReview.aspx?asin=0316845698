                    <span>If you are into understanding yourself and your relationships with others, you will love this guide. <p>After decoding myself (ISTP), I decoded everyone I know well, and it helped me to understand how and why each of my relationships differ. I shared the book with my ESTP boyfriend and we laughed so hard we nearly cried, because the book described our relationship SO EXACTLY it was scary.  <p>We all communicate and make decisions differently. This book explains how YOUR type and THEIR type interact, and how to avoid common pitfalls. It's not only helpful, but very eye-opening and fun.</span>

                    <span>I'm a huge MBTI nut, and I've read about MBTI book out there, including those from Britain, etc!  This book is truly unique b/c it matches every type w/every other type, to show you the joys, pitfalls, and helpful suggestions.  What should an ENTJ know about his/her INFP spouse?  This book has very specific and personalized answers.<p>The best thing is, this isn't just a gimmick.  It's VERY well done.  The insights are superb and will tell you something new about not only your romantic relationships, but other important relationships as well.<p>My spouse & I have a wonderful relationship - over 10 years of wedded bliss - and we've also done a ton of Myers-Briggs analysis together.  So I was shocked and delighted when my spouse read the piece comparing our types - and said, Hey, there are several things in here I want you to read!  There were indeed "hints" that I needed to take to heart, things I never would have guessed but that did truly come from our type interaction.</span>

                    <span>First, it's important to know I have been a believer in the validity of the personality test upon which this book is based ... from my own experience in the 15 years since I first took the test as required for one of my science major classes in college, and because the test has a good reputation among professionals. The more people I persuade to take this test, the more impressed I am with the accuracy and validity of the test and the accuracy of several other books based upon the test. That's important information because this book can be no more accurate than the personality test upon which it is based. Secondly, the authors are internationally recognized experts in the application of the test results. <p>Having established that, in my opinion this particular book is more valuable than any of the other books I own based on that personality test because it presents the various personaly types in a more practical manner: exactly how each of the other types is compatible or incompatible with you, and specifically how to interact with each of the other types in order to minimize conflicts. I'm well into my second marriage now and am astounded by how accurately the good aspects and areas of conflict for both marriages were pinpointed in this book ...same goes for every other intimate relationship in my life where I knew the others' type .... it's like the book was written about me, for me! This book is priceless for those of you in the dating scene screening for Mr or Ms "Right for you" and not wanting to waste any time getting to the altar. Or if you think you're in love but are afraid it won't last, wondering what marriage to them would be like since 50% of marriages these days end in divorce. Or for those already married who want to strengthen their relationship and reduce conflicts .... it couldn't be spelled out more clearly and concisely exactly how to go about it for your individual relationship. This book helped me to get the clearest perspective on how others see me...to see the truth of how each relationship is more than just the sum of it's parts or partners, but that two individuals each effect how the other is in the relationship,... and taught me specifically how I can adapt for each of the various individuals in my life that I'd like to get along with better. More than any other book I've read about relationships, (and that's LOTS of books)this book gives pertinent advice tailored specifically for you and each one of your individual relationships. Other books speak generically to the masses based on "the majority" of people researched. My personality type is less than 1% of the population, yet this book still has a lot of accurate information and specific advice relevant to my individual needs. I think this book is the best money I ever spent and my praise doesn't get any better than that! I can see why the authors are internationally recognized experts in the application of this personality test.</span>

                    <span>There was good information on how different types can have great relationships but I felt it was a bit repetitive.  Also, the authors made one big mistake in the book.  They claim boys and men have more options where actually it's women and girls who enjoy more flexibility to be themselves.  <p>A good example is children who play with toys associated with the opposite gender (ie, girls who like trucks and boys who play with dolls).  Generally we don't worry about girls who like traditionally "boy" activities such as sports, trucks, or chemistry sets.  However, if boys like to play with dolls or other "girl" toys we jump to all kinds of hysterical (and usually false) conclusions about how their masculinity will be hurt.  Further, most public schools approve of traditionally female behavior more than of male behavior.  Why do you think boys get punished more in schools than girls, usually for the same offense?  Boys are also more likely to be shunned or harrassed by their peers for liking "girl" things more than girls who are "tomboys."<p>Another example is the adult workforce.  While it's true that certain occupations are dominated by one gender, women can be more easily found in traditionally male occupations than vice versa.  In other words, you can find a woman doctor easier than a male nurse.  Also, women have more leeway in how they can dress and act at work than men.  Men are far more likely to be disciplined for politically incorrect behavior than women are.  Don't believe me, well, I have real world experience as opposed to everything I read in books.</span>

                    <span>I found this book absolutely invaluable, but not for reasons having to do  with romantic relationships. Having struggled for nigh on 50 years to  understand why my mother and I had such a difficult relationship, it was as  though the clouds that had cast such a pall were suddenly lifted and the  son shone through and revealed, with crystalline clarity - through the  magic of personality typing - the simple but elusive truth: We were totally  different personality types with no functions in common. Her ESTJ  directness and criticism cut to the quick of my INFP sensitivity. I had  never understood why she wasn't warm and loving and felt that I was somehow  to blame. Now I know better, thanks to this wonderful book! Vive la  difference!</span>
