                <span id="Label1">The first guide to creating the word-of-mouth magic that breaks through the skepticism and information overload of today's consumers, and drive sales--and profits--to new heights.<br><b><br></b>As <i>Newsweek</i> recently proclaimed, "Buzz greases the great conveyor belt of culture and commerce, moving everything from movies to fashions of the body and mind faster and faster."<br><br>Now available in paperback, <i>The Anatomy of Buzz</i>, written by former marketing VP Emanuel Rosen, pinpoints the products and services that benefit the most from buzz and offers specific strategies for creating and sustaining effective word-of-mouth strategies. Drawing on interviews with more than 150 marketing executives who have successfully built buzz for major brands, Rosen describes the ins-and-outs of attracting the attention of influential first-users and "bigmouth" movers-and-shakers, and discusses proven techniques for stimulating customer-to-customer selling&#8211;including how companies can spread the word to new territories by taking advantage of customer hubs and networks on the Internet and elsewhere.<br><br>Recent surveys show that 74 percent of young people rely to some extent on others when selecting a car, that 56 percent of moviegoers follow the recommendations of friends, and that 65 percent of the people who bought a Palm Pilot were inspired by the enthusiasm of others. With <i>The Anatomy of Buzz</i>, business leaders have what they need to reignite excitement about an existing product or service or turbocharge the launch of a new product.</span>

                    <span>First a disclaimer. Mr. Rosen offered to send me a copy of this book, based on my review of Gladwell's The Tipping Point. I didn't receive the copy, but purchased one after he spoke at a local bookstore. That said, this is a great marketing book. By honestly looking at the phenomenon of word of mouth, Mr. Rosen draws some valuable conclusions (see the other reviews for very indepth analyses). His case studies are very supportive of his thesis and I can say that the ones on Yomega, Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, and Magic the Gathering are factual (I used to work at a game store and a game distributor and watched these items gain momentum). The look at Powerbar shows how marketing can drive a product's life (another place I got to see the inside of). This book is the positive side of effective marketing (good buzz) and should be tempered by reading Rushkoff's Coercion, but Mr. Rosen goes a long way in promoting good marketing practices that add value to a product and makes the market more aware of quality offerings.</span>

                    <span>Think about it. How many times have you been asked "Seen a good movie lately?" or "What's your favorite Italian restaurant?" or "Where can I get the best deal on an air conditioner?" The single most powerful but least understood form of marketing is word-of-mouth and yet, until now, no one has devoted to it the attention it deserves. In the Foreword to this book, Everett M. Rogers observes, "New products and services spread among the consumer public through interpersonal communication networks. These networks are for the most part invisible. They often operate in mysterious ways.. Thus we are largely blind to this very powerful marketing process. No wonder that we fail so often in our efforts to diffuse innovations." He's right.<P>Rosen explains how to create effective word-of-mouth marketing with material organized within three Parts: How Buzz Spreads, Success in the Networks, and Stimulating Buzz. It is important to stress that Buzz results only in combination with a superior product or service. As Jeffrey Gitomer correctly points out, "customer satisfaction" is achieved only on a per-transaction basis; the objective is to achieve and then sustain "customer loyalty." It is not only possible but common for a new product or service to generate Buzz initially but if the quality is not sustainable (preferably enhanced), what I call Positive Buzz can become Negative Buzz. (Even under Rosen's personal supervision, no matter how much perfume you pour on a pig, it's still a pig. The only buzz it generates will be provided by insects.) The "interpersonal communication networks" to which Rogers refers can just as effectively (and probably more quickly) "get the word out" about a defective product or unsatisfactory service. Obviously, no Buzz is preferable to Negative Buzz.<P>Rosen is talking about Positive Buzz. He explains HOW to take full advantage of the marketing opportunities it permits. In Chapter 16, "Buzz Workshop", he asks and then answers a series of very basic but profoundly important questions. (All by itself, this final chapter is well-worth the cost of the book. I strongly recommend that this chapter be re-read on a regular basis. Competitive marketplaces do have a way of changing, don't they?) Once having read the book, the reader is well-prepared to select and then implement those concepts, strategies, and tactics which are most appropriate to her or his own situation.<P>This book will be especially valuable to small-to-midsize companies with limited resources but the success of any marketing efforts (Buzz or otherwise) will still depend upon the quality of the product or service offered. All of us now actively involved in marketing owe a substantial debt to Rosen. Revealingly, the quality of his thinking and the originality of his ideas created Buzz long before his book was published. The acclaim he continues to receive is richly deserved.</span>

                    <span>Emanuel Rosen's 'Anatomy of Buzz' has some worthwhile stuff about what he calls 'information hubs,' those people who seem to know more about certain subjects and make it their business to pass the word to the rest of us. However, Malcom Gladwell dissected this phenomenon in great detail in his outstanding work, "The Tipping Point." Gladwell tells us that the Hub persona is actually comprised of three different indivduals: mavens, connectors and salesmen. You don't really get down to that level of detail here.<P>Not to say Rosen's book is without merit. I was fascinated by Gladwell's research and thought 'Buzz' would be a good complement to that. With those expectations, I enjoyed the book and found it to be a worthwhile read. I'll keep it on my bookshelf (for me, that's the litmus test of a book's worth).</span>
