                    <span>I am surprised to see such positive reviews of this book.  While the historical element of the text was enjoyable, I felt that the book was heavily weighted to support a certain opinion.  While I typically consider myself and Independent I got a little tired of the liberal rhetoric that appeared again and again in every into.  In addition, I do not feel that the articles were chosen to represent what was actually occuring during the 60's but rather to paint a very deliberate picture.  To portray the U.S. as being so black or white (good guys and bad guys) is a disapointment and it ignores the complexity of us as individuals.  My biggest complaint is the portrayal of the Vietnam War and veterans in general.  To ignore the soldiers who fought believing in a "nobel cause" is an injustice.
<br />
<br />Again, I do not support either side but feel that this is a misrepresentation as a whole...I hope that if you do read this book that it is not the only one that you read on the sixties.  </span>

                    <span>This book is an anthology of numerous primary source statements, manifestos, and letters concerning events in America during the 1960's. "Takin it to the Streets" turned out to be very helpful for a class I took on this time period. There is so much here and that it boggles the mind. Almost all viewpoints are represented in some respect or another, although some might be missing or not as well represented, as one of the other reviewers of this book pointed out.<p>What you will find in this book are excerpts from the Port Huron Statement, conservative viewpoints on the anti-war movement, the platform for the Black Panther party, accounts of sit-ins during the civil rights struggle in the South, feminist statements and a million other things. It must have been difficult at times to put this book together, as deciding what to include (and what not to include) would be extremely difficult. Chances are whatever you're looking for is probably here in some form or another. Very helpful as a guide through this tumultuous time and essential for a student trying to get the feel for the times.</span>

                    <span>This over 600 page book consists of primary documents from numerous sources, as well as succinct and helpful introductions by the editors that help to identify the selections and put them in context.  It should be a  valuable resource for scholars and non-scholars alike, though an index  would have made it somewhat more user-friendly.<p>The book mostly consists  of selections from the leftist and counter-culture movements of the 60s,  though there is a token pro-Establishment section with items from the likes  of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.<p>Due to my own personal interests, I  would have appreciated seeing more selections from the nonviolent elements  of the 60s movements-the pacifists, nonviolent anarchists, Gandhians,  conscientious objectors, etc.  Certainly the book does not neglect these  elements entirely, but they are not as well represented as I might have  liked.<p>Many things struck me in reading this book.  I found the  idealism--and what some would dismiss as naivete--of some of the early  civil rights activists and of the Free Speech Movement leaders among others  to be quite appealing.  On the other hand, many of the selections serve as  useful reminders that the factionalism, the bitter strident rhetoric, the  simplistic ideologies, the in-fighting, the condemnation of anyone not  accepted as a co-victim, etc. that I tend to think of as mostly  insignificant excesses that arose late in the game after years of defeat  and frustration were actually present all along.<p>What you won't find much  of is the cynicism, apathy, smugness, defeatism, etc. of more recent times.   Whatever is objectionable about some of the people you'll encounter in  these selections, at least they had a sincerity about them, a desire to  make their society and their world a better place, and a willingness to  take action in accordance with their ideals.  A few of them and their  ideological descendants in the politically correct crowd have surely done  more harm than good, but on the whole, they were on the right side of the  vast majority of the issues they fought on, and even their quite limited  successes have left us with slightly more freedom and justice, and slightly  less war-tolerance than before they came along.</span>

                    <span>Probably the best collection of primary documents relating to the period that's yet been published.  An invaluable collection that's of use not only to scholars of the era, but to anyone with any interest at all in the  1960s, the political and social changes wrought during that decade, and the  imprint they've left on today's consciousness.  Bloom and Breines's  selections and introductions are excellent.  Highly recommended.</span>
