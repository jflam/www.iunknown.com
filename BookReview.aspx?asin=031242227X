                <span id="Label1">There is a passage early in Augusten Burroughs's harrowing and highly entertaining memoir, <I>Running with Scissors</I>, that speaks volumes about the author. While going to the garbage dump with his father, young Augusten spots a chipped, glass-top coffee table that he longs to bring home. "I knew I could hide the chip by fanning a display of magazines on the surface, like in a doctor's office," he writes, "And it certainly wouldn't be dirty after I polished it with Windex for three hours." There were certainly numerous chips in the childhood Burroughs describes: an alcoholic father, an unstable mother who gives him up for adoption to her therapist, and an adolescence spent as part of the therapist's eccentric extended family, gobbling prescription meds and fooling around with both an old electroshock machine and a pedophile who lives in a shed out back. But just as he dreamed of doing with that old table, Burroughs employs a vigorous program of decoration and fervent polishing to a life that many would have simply thrown in a landfill. Despite her abandonment, he never gives up on his increasingly unbalanced mother. And rather than despair about his lot, he glamorizes it: planning a "beauty empire" and performing an a capella version of "You Light Up My Life" at a local mental ward. Burroughs's perspective achieves a crucial balance for a memoir: emotional but not self-involved, observant but not clinical, funny but not deliberately comic. And it's ultimately a feel-good story: as he steers through a challenging childhood, there's always a sense that Burroughs's survivor mentality will guide him through and that the coffee table will be salvaged after all. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>Burroughs absolutely, no doubt, hands down for sure had one of the weirdest childhoods I've ever read about. It elevates the word 'dysfunctional' to a whole new level. For scary, surreal, and sexual, Running with Scissors (what a great title) takes the cake.<BR>Starting with the divorce of his wacko parents, an already violently bad situation only gets worse when Augusten is sent to live with his mother's psychiatrist (who treats his mom's problems with visits to a motel), a wildly bizarre egomaniac. I mean, hello? Most of the remainder of the book documents his years spent with the shrink's family, including his initiation into homosexuality by a family member who's 20 yrs older than he is.<BR>It's hard to find a single word to describe this book, so I'll go for a string of single words: scatalogical, sexual, bizarre, scary, depressing, hilarious, pathetic, hopeful, illuminating - and really, really interesting.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The writing and characters in this book are amazingly done, and it captivated me from beginning to end. Even if some of the subject matter goes well over the edge (and may not appeal to some readers), this author's brilliance is how he presents even the most bizarre situations with such matter-of-fact, concise descriptions that the twists and turns of these strange characters, while utterly shocking, absolutely fit into the story.<P>The book follows Augusten through early childhood, overshadowed by his parents' doomed marriage and his mother's psychotic episodes, and then into the oddball world of the Finch family where nothing is out of bounds. Everyday Finch events range from Augusten and Natalie Finch testing their performance abilities by singing You Light Up My Life on a mental ward to a summer of living on furniture in the yard after initially moving unwanted items outside to sell then deciding to take off the tags to create another "room" of the house. It kind of takes your breath away each time these people take another step down the road of astonishing psychosis and obsession.<P>The reason this book may not appeal to everyone is the graphic story of Augusten being molested at thirteen, then becoming involved in a sexual, not to mention manipulative, relationship with this older man for several years, another extraordinary twist being it's teenager Augusten doing the manipulating. Additionally the language from most members of the Finch household was continuously crude.<P>One criticism about this book is the abrupt ending, with very little explanation about how Augusten came to his final realizations. It seemed the book was motoring along, picking up speed, then suddenly quit from nowhere. Despite the ending, the author has an uncanny ability to be hilarious, insightful and imaginative. One of my favorite lines from the book was his description of his mother's new lover Dorothy, whom he believed to perfectly complement his mother's imbalance: "If my mother was odd enough to crave a bubble bath at three in the morning, Dorothy was inventive enough to suggest adding broken glass to the tub."</span>

                    <span> &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;This is one of the best Memoir/Autobiographies I have read. Fits in with other memoirs I have read such as NIGHTMARES ECHO and DRY. The interior is filled with emotional ups and downs. There is tears and laughter. The look inside the self as to why someone does the things they do. to be brought up in an-for lack of a better word-Eccentric life is at times abusive and yet this author finds humor in his own unhappiness. Great memoirs that each tell a story. &#60;br /&#62;</span>

                    <span>The memoirs do have it this year, and "Running With Scissors" is no exception. It details a troubled life, addictions and the turning point (the determinationa nd courage) to turn your life around when it would be so much easier to fall in to the pitts. &#60;br /&#62;This authors other books: "Dry" and now "Magical Thinking" are excellent books to read as well. he is a superb writer. Along those lines of good memoirs/Biographies to sink your teeth in to and learn about the real world and what goes on with in it (wether rich or poor) are books such as "Nightmares Echo", "If I Knew Then" and Sickened". All highly rated books &#60;br /&#62;</span>

                    <span> Yes this author tells his story with humor. But, underneath the laughter lies the pain of living through a difficult childhood. Mr. Burroughs did well in telling us his story in 'DRY',and as with 'DRY', you still know the life he led that took him through the addictions he suffered. It made me understand all the more another book I read called 'NIGHTMARES ECHO'. In that book the author details that though you see the addict,prostitute and homeless person-don't just assume they want to live life that way. There may be underlying reasons. Mr. Burroughs points that out as well in showing us his side of the story and the pain along with his humor. One of the best books I have read.  </span>
