                    <span>This is American Sailing Association textbook for beginning sailors and closely tied to the ASA certification program.<P>Why should you consider certification? Many people don't want to own a boat and prefer to charter. This is more economical than boat ownership. <P>To have the freedom to charter anywhere in the world you need to be able to prove to the charter companies that you know what you are doing. That is where certification comes in. <P>An ASA certification is a big plus when you are in Hawaii on vacation and want to rent a keelboat for a couple of hours. Or if you want to charter a big boat in the British Virgin Islands for a week. Try to do that without a certification! The major plus of this book is that it teaches you how to sail with all the information you need to learn in the proper order you should learn it. There is an advantage in learning the material in a time tested manner. This book gets the benefit of tried and true, tested, proven methods of sailing instruction that work. The material is presented in the order in which you should learn it<P>Reading the book and then taking the course will give you a jump start on your sailing skills. <P>Most sailors have knowledge like Swiss cheeze--with lots of holes. The books will give you knowledge like American cheeze--no holes.<P>Buy the book--you won't regret it. Read it and take the course for maximum effectiveness. <P>This is the path to skill, safety, and confidence on the water.</span>

                    <span>I recently got a copy of this book to take my ASA sailing certificate. Unfortunately, this book is really poor. The information is good, but it's poorly organized. It's completely full of typos (like the page where they were talking about "boast" instead of "boats"), sentences which end in the middle, pictures of knots that are incomplete (and therefore, not knots), and my personal favorite, instructions on folding a sail where the pictures start with a folded sail, and end with an unfolded one. If you looking to buy a book on sailing, look elsewhere. Try the Anapolis Book of Seamanship.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most disorganized and poorly edited books I<BR>have ever read. There are sentences that get truncated from one<BR>page to the next, concepts that supposedly will be explained "in<BR>the next chapter" and never are, totally unrelated topics that<BR>are jumbled together, material that is repeated without a clear<BR>reason, obscure and/or poor illustrations/photos, etc. <BR>Some radical editing could probably turn this book into <BR>something useful, but as is I would recommend that the beginning<BR>sailor turn to one of the many introductory books on sailing <BR>that are better written and illustrated.</span>

                    <span>I have owned a sailing school and taught sailing for 25 years. In 1983 I was putting together a basic sailing book to be used by schools, when I discovered ASA and Gary Jobson's Sailing Fundamentals. I thought it was a terrific book and adopted it rather than finish my own book. I liked the organization, completeness and casual conversational style. Also I liked the illustrations, particularly the wind circle and points of sail in the later (present) edition. We have taught thousands of people to sail and are still using this book.</span>

                    <span>For the last 20 years, my student feedback has been very good. They like the pictures, the pace, and the level. The self tests at the end of the chapters help them get ready to take a very comprehensive written exam. By using this textbook, my pass rate on this exam is above 90%. Then they use and enjoy the practice water excercises to develop their water skills. Prior to using this book, my students felt very intimidated by the sailing mystic. This book is user friendly. Of all the textbooks that have been written on sailing, the US Coast Guard Auxillary picked and approved this text to be used in their courses. I believe their seal on the front cover says alot about the quality of the contents.</span>
