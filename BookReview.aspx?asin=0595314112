                    <span>More than just a book on riding. Daniel's stories reflect a way of life and living it. Personally, I think he's right on target. I can't get enough of his writing. His style borders on Indiana Jones meets ghandi, a good mix, with a flare toward the dramatic (the magic) an inspirational combination that lights a fire in his reader to follow their dreams rather than fall into complacency. For me the motorcycle has been a valuable tool to find my place in the universe, experience peace and live. This book backs up what I have always known - discover it for yourself, See you on the road... </span>

                    <span>As a rider who enjoys reading about riding, I found Daniel Meyer's first book to capture something essential about the need to ride a motorcycle.  Even his tales of driving from one Denny's to the next, in search of hot fudge sundaes, were humorous in a quiet, warm, and homey way, and so I eagerly picked up this second book hoping for something of the same experience. I was disappointed. While some of the stories in the first book strained credulity, they still brought a smile to my face.  Too many in this collection strayed so far from the believable that they made my eyes roll instead.  The author can be forgiven for his quasi-mystical take on life and riding.  There is certainly a tradition for this in motorcycle books.  But harder to take is Mr. Meyer's need (more in this book) to tell tall tales which unabashedly position him as couragous, heroic, and the object of feminine desire. Rather than capturing the sweetness and "magic" that is often so much a part of ordinary motorcyle riding and the people in it, these stories seem to reflect another kind of ordinariness-- the tendency of some authors to devolve into writing that is theatrical, pseudo-philosophical, and blantantly self-aggrandizing.  If Mr. Meyer writes another book I will buy it,(I like motorcycle books) but I will hope for more warmth and less narcissism.</span>
