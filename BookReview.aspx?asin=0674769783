                    <span>If I could give this book zero stars, I would.  Higginbotham is not the feminist scholar she once was, and her writing needs more perspective.  The book suggests that she's spent too long in the ivory tower.  Too much post-modern psycho-babble in this volume.</span>

                    <span>Evelyn Higginbotham shows us that this is not a man's world anymore with her book on the role of women the Black Baptist Church. Her writing is fluid and detaied, and she provides various examples to illustrate her points. This is the definitive text for learning about the roles that the Black Baptist church in African-American society.</span>

                    <span>Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham asserts that southern black women, through their participation in the National Baptist Convention fostered agency, activism, women's rights and racial dignity during the post-Reconstruction  era of Jim Crow. Intrisic to her thesis is that while black women utilized  the Baptist church as a support stucture against racism and poverty, they  also worked to raise the status of the black race as a whole and black  women specifically. One of the most important insights in this book, is an  in-depth analyiztion of the feminization of religion. However,while  Higginbotham's thesis is stong and engaging, altering the hereto academic  focus away from prominent black Baptist activists to a wider, regional  phenomenom of group participation, ultimatley her study contains a few  theoretical holes. There is little critical analysis of the opposition that  black women faced in their endevores, such as the creation the Womens  Convention, a subsiderary of the larger National Baptist Convention. Also,  there is no sense of the black "masses," consistantly refered to  as such, that these women tried to help. "Masses," in this case  indicates a monolith rather than an increasingly diversified group of  people.  Ellaboration on both of these points would have greatly improved  the complexity of Higginbotham's study, as well as left the reader a great  deal more informed. Over all, Righteous Discontent is a valuable source for  anyone seeking information on race, gender and relgion at the turn of the  century.  Higginbotham's treatment of the subject is tactful and engaging,  uncovering a little known but important facet of African American history.</span>
