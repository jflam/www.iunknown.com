                <span id="Label1">Whether you are using Windows Forms to build rich-client business applications or the ASP.NET framework to build powerful web applications or web services, the use of well-designed graphics will greatly enhance their usability, impact, and visual appeal. This book provides a comprehensive guide to the use of GDI+ in .NET applications and aims to provide developers with all the information they need to build effective custom controls.  <P>The opening section of the book investigates the .NET Framework classes that implement GDI+. It covers all of the classes, methods and techniques needed to create, manipulate, and display precise graphics in a form, a page being sent to a printer or an image.  <P>On this foundation, the second section describes how to design and build effective custom controls for use in a business environment. Topics covered include building composite controls, implementing keyboard navigation, and enhancing design-time support.  <P>The final section of the book explores the use of GDI+ and ASP.NET to build custom controls that can provide reusable, GUI components for web projects and to deliver customized graphics over the Internet.</span>

                    <span>The book was useful, but if you download the file of source code that covers all chapters, some examples are missing. At least for the middle chapters, you'll find the missing projects in the smaller downloads that cover only a few chapters. I didn't think of that possibility until chapter 12, so for a lot of the code in earlier chapters I couldn't make the comparisons I wanted to when I needed them. Other than that, if you already know GDI fairly well, you'll be able to burn through the material pretty quickly and pickup a good knowledge of GDI+. If you don't, I think this would be a pretty good place to start. It moves right along without a lot of hand-holding but seems to tell you everything you need to know for basic GDI+ and custom controls.</span>

I am very pleased and highly recommend this to all who wish to learn GDI+.<p>If you are moving up from GDI, you will find that GDI+ is about 50 times slower, but 50 times easier to program.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>One of my first .NET ah-hah experiences back in 2001 was creating an .aspx file that I could reference as a graphic (!). The .aspx file received two query parameters which informed it of the file name of the jpg and the width that the returned image was supposed to be. So then in an IMG tag, I would simply put src="ShowPicture.aspx?file=product1343.jpg&width=100" and it would display a thumbnail of that picture 100 pixels wide and proportionally high. This is an excellent way to produce dynamic pictures as well as protect your online photographs (show thumbnails to visitors, full sized pictures to members), and the .NET GDI+ classes are straight-forward and easy to use. Ever since then I have been looking for a book which goes into deeper detail of creating graphics in .NET with the GDI+ classes. Wrox has finally produced this book! In chapters 1 through 10 you get the basics: pens, brushes, texts, fonts, image manipulation, paths, regions and printing. Then in the rest of the book you learn how to make custom controls which create custom graphics (I love books that teach two things at a time -- great for developers who do four things at a time). If you read this book, you will think about graphics differently, namely, as dynamic objects which your application, the user and the environment can manipulate at run time. Very exciting.</span>
