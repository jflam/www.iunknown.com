<h3 class="title">Hello Movable Type!</h3>

<p><p>After more pain than I thought that I would go through, I finally finished converting my old <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">CityDesk</a> site over to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. The pain was largely due to two fairly major problems that I encountered along the way. <br />
<p>The first problem was due to the way that Movable Type wanted to maintain my entry archives. I used the individual entry archive option, which results in the generation of archive entries like "000001.html". However, I wanted to make sure that I didn't break any external links to my existing archive entries which had names like "http://www.iunknown.com/Archives/fog0000000030.html". To map between the two, I used an Apache .htaccess file to map the old URL's to the new URL's.<br />
<p>While I only have 257 entries in my weblog, I really didn't want to create my .htaccess file by hand. To solve this problem, I needed to write some code that would let me export the existing URL's for my archive entries from CityDesk. I wrote earlier about <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2003/01/03.html#converting_from_citydesk_to_movable_type">Brian Cantoni's</a> excellent script for exporting entries. I had to modify Brian's script somewhat (for example, I export my entries by ascending date/time since I wanted my weblog entry to be "000001.html" and not "000257.html"). Also, I needed to generate XML in my export script since I would run over that script using a C# app that I wrote to solve nasty problem #2. Here's the CityDesk script that generates an export file called entries.xml:<br />
<p><pre><br />
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?><br />
{$ setDateTimeFormat "English" "MM/dd/yyyy" "hh:mm:ss tt"$}<br />
<entries><br />
{$foreach x in (folder "Weblog") SortAscendBy .filedDate$} <br />
&lt;entry><br />
  author>John&lt;/author><br />
  &lt;title>&lt;![CDATA[{$x.headline$}]]>&lt;/title><br />
  &lt;date>{$x.fileddate$} {$x.filedtime$}&lt;/date><br />
  &lt;status>Publish&lt;/status><br />
  &lt;link>{$x.link$}&lt;/link><br />
  &lt;body>&lt;![CDATA[{$x.body$}]]>&lt;/body><br />
&lt;/entry><br />
{$ next $}<br />
&lt;/entries><br />
</pre><br />
<p>The second problem had to do with my comments. For my old site, all of my comments were managed by <a href="http://www.haloscan.com">Haloscan</a>, who for over a year provided me with comments on my web site. Unfortunately, they don't currently offer an export option to dump all of my existing comments out as an RSS file; I had to write some code to screen-scrape their existing site. Fortunately for me, <i>most</i> of their comment pages are valid XHTML, so I was able to do the requisite screen-scraping using XPath. Unfortunately, they don't correctly escape "&" and a few other characters so some of my comment pages didn't migrate automatically over. I still need to manually migrate those comments over to MT.<br />
<p>If you're interested in the code that I wrote to manage my migration, you can <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/Class1.cs">download it here</a>.<br />
<p>One final note: I posted this entry using <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a>, which is quite a nice offline editor. One thing that would really improve w.bloggar would be to use Microsoft's DHTML editing component as the editor within w.bloggar, much like what CityDesk does already.</p>
