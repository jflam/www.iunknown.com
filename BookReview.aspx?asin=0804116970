                    <span>Excellent read for those interested in this particular conflict.  The author is quite discriptive in his narration.  He is able, somewhat, to give the "feel" of the circumstances..if that is even vaguely possible through the written word.  The author has a tallent for enabling the reader to actually visualize the situation...sometimes rather difficult to accomplishe when addressing military movement on the battlefield.  Again, I recommend you add this one to your collection.  I makes a very nice reference book along with being a very good read. </span>

                    <span>Books about war can be so dramatically different even if they are essentially dealing with the same subject. It's less about "which war" and rather more about how one registers the whole experience on a psychological level. Also important is if and what kind of an agenda one carries with him.
<br />
<br />   In "Colder than hell" we're offered an account from the eyes of a lieutenant who fought at the Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War. The main difference with other military history books is that the author, having been there, describes things through a spectre that i could best describe as "uninvolved". Books about the Vietnam war, for example, have that unmistakable political aspect to them which is obviously attributed to that very charged epoch they deal with, even if their authors were also direct war participants.
<br />
<br />   In this one, what immediately struck me was that from the very first pages the author takes the possibility of being in a war not only almost naturally but seems to eagerly anticipate it. He doesnt ask any difficault questions, doesn't wonder why he's going to wind up some 1000s of miles away from home fighting people he hardly knows the culture of (and vice versa), but instead seems to consider this as a task that one approaches with questioning it at all.
<br />Sign of times radically different than what followed the Korean War? More than certainly. That is perhaps an element that strikes as very intriguing in this book but it's left lingering somewhere in the beginning and the author doesn't touch it again.
<br />   Still, it goes to show what dramatic changes took place after those years.
<br />
<br />    Lieutenant Owen (the author) gives a morbid and incredibly vivid description on the events that happened in the Chosin Reservoir as the American Marines fought an almost face-to-face battle with their Chinese counterparts. 
<br />   
<br />    In a mountainous terrain and in bitter winter conditions with temperatures more than often below zero, sometimes under-equipped clotheswise, with very little time to rest or even be allowed to be under blankets and with frostbite claiming almost equally as many victims as the bullets and the mortars, Owen and his batallion fought (as any soldier ultimately does) their enemy, the elements, and themselves. Owen, keeps hitting the reader with honesty as he doesn't omit to mention his everpresent fear at the prospect of death looms nearer every day that goes by.
<br />
<br />   He survived, but his accounts of those that fell next to him are given in a cold almost cynical manner, the way it actually happens when bullets are zipping over your head and you dont have time to ponder on the person dying next to you in agonising pain but only time to stay alive yourself.
<br />
<br />   Most of the book is written in that manner, as if he's describing things live from the scene. Long emotional passages are not to be found here and this actually makes "Colder than hell" an ultra realistic description of the horrors it deals with.
<br />
<br />   This will get more credit from you as you read it than i could possibly give here because it is, undoubtdely, a very gripping book.
<br />
<br />    Heavily recommended for avid readers of military history.

                    <span>I listened to the audio version but it was unabridged. The audio version has a fantastic narrator. The book itself is well written and a gripping story. If you want a 'you are there' tale of Marine combat in the Korean War (or just infantry combat in general) this book is for you. It pulls no punches and gives it to you straight as the author saw it. The story is very much a study of combat leadership and low-level infantry combat and does not dwell on the other larger aspects of the Korean War (either military or political).</span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for any legitimate military history historian. It illustrates the changing perspective of the European concept of war in which human life has at least some meaning to the concept of war with an Asian opponent in which human life apparently is not that important. Although still very important, the "one shot, one kill" concept as applied to masses of troops for that often required "reach out and touch someone" 1,000 yard shot, must of necessity give way to the concept of a "one shot, many, many kills" concept of modern day warfare with this kind of opponent. <p>It also illustrates the "how" of the "unexpected" Chinese ambush of the American forces. Both the Army's and the Marine's outdoor enthusiasts knew that they were there, although not in what immense strength, but military headquarters in Japan refused to believe them.</span>

                    <span>There are essentially two ways to approach an historical review of a compaign, either as an historian who was never there (reviewing documents, etc.) and the personal viewpoint. The latter gives you a good overview of the whole campaing, whereas the former provides a very focused view.<p>Naturally, it is best to view all options, but I prefer to read the first-person accounts for some real perspective. This is what you get--the unvarnished look at how one company dealt with the catastrophe of Chosin, turning it into a victory (no matter what the Chinese reviewer has to say). That one division, the 1st Marine Division, was able to survive against ten Chinese division, and survive intact as a fighting force, speaks volumes of the men in that division.<p>When you read how Owen and his men coped, you can appreciate the fighting capabilities of the American soldiers--particulary when they are put in unprepared situations by idiots like MacArthur and his so-called intelligence officers in Tokyo fighting by remote-control. Owen showed how the men in the field could see the train-wreck coming, but were never listened to. This is where the first-person account deviates from the outside approach with the old "we told you so" and can prove it.<p>I would also like to mention that I have met Owen and Chew Enn Lee, when they gave a talk on the book. You could not imagine two more opposites in personality. Lee, who goes by "Karl," is still to this day highly respected by his men. They have petitioned the Department of Defense for Karl to receive the Medal of Honor for leading part of the breakout. No matter how much they petition on his behalf, it just falls on deaf ears. I think this is just the continuation of the we-know-better-than-you that permeates the rarified air breathed by higher ups. When you see what Bob Kerrey did for his Medal of Honor--and not taking anything away from him--you wonder why Karl Lee walked away with less.</span>
