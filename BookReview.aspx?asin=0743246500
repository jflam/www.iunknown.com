                <span id="Label1"><P> If you have to be naked, you had better be buff.  We are entering an extraordinary age of transparency, where businesses must for the first time make themselves clearly visible to shareholders, customers, employees, partners, and society. Financial data, employee grievances, internal memos, environmental disasters, product weaknesses, international protests, scandals and policies, good news and bad; all can be seen by anyone who knows where to look. Welcome to the world of the naked corporation. Transparency is revolutionizing every aspect of our economy and its industries and forcing firms to rethink their fundamental values.  <P> Don Tapscott, bestselling author and one of the most sought after strategists and speakers in the business world, is famous for seeing into the future and pointing out both its forest and its trees. David Ticoll, visionary researcher, columnist, and consultant, has identified countless breakthrough trends at the intersection of technology and business strategy. These two longtime collaborators now offer a brilliant guide to the new age of openness. In <I>The Naked Corporation,</I> they explain how the new transparency has caused a power shift toward customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders; how and where information has exploded; and how corporations across many industries have seized on transparency not as a challenge but as an opportunity. <P> Drawing on such examples as Chiquita's total turnaround on matters of ethics, to Shell Oil's reinvention of itself as an environmentally focused business, to Johnson & Johnson's longstanding and carefully nurtured reputation as a company worthy of trust -- as well as little-known examples from pharmaceuticals, insurance, high technology, and financial services -- Tapscott and Ticoll offer invaluable advice on how to lead the new age, rather than simply react to it.   <P> <I>The Naked Corporation</I> is a book for managers, employees, investors, customers, and anyone who cares about the future of the corporation and society. A new age is upon us, and you can either work with it and thrive, or fight it and die.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book which has opened my eyes into looking for companies that are honest and transparent with their customers, shareholders and employees.  This book calls companies to stop hidding behind secrets that destroy corporations (Enron and others) and start being transparent, by providing informaiton to your customers, shareholders and employees.  Companies need to show that they are responsible to the environment, to their stakeholders and other corporations.  This book is calling companies to be ethical in their daily transactions and gives example after example of corporations who have fallen because they tried to hide the truth.  This book shows that we need strong ethical people to run todays corporations and we as investors need to reward companies who are starting to become transparent.  At the same time we need to punish companies who are not taking responsibility for their actions and wrong doings.  This book also points out that most investors are blind with their investments and don't even realize what their largest investment is invested in (for most people their largest investment is their pension plan, and I admit I don't know what mine is invested in).  This is a very good book and has opened my eyes to at least see what's going on out there and provided me with the tools to do some research and make sure I reward companies that are making an effort to save our environment and be honest with employee's, investors, stakeholders, and customers.  The one question I have is are we raising a generation that will be able to have the<br>qualities needed to run the corporations of tomorrow...  Great book...</span>

                    <span>Obviously, The Naked Corporation was a difficult book for Tapscott & Ticoll to write.  Perhaps their best book yet, but most likely the book that will attract fewer readers than one would expect.  Why? - because The Naked Corporation describes a significant shift in business.  Many companies will fear or try to ignore the shift and a few companies will embrace the shift.  The Naked Corporation is a must read for executives and managers of performing/troubled/transitioning companies. Tapscott & Ticoll provide a compelling prescription for business success.  Reading The Naked Corporation, I identified 24 "gems" (actions) to improve corporate performance and competitiveness.  If you can't find at least 24 "gems" for your company to improve performance and competitiveness, then I suggest you ask Tapscott & Ticoll to help you, or get them to write a followup!  Good luck and good business!</span>

                    <span>Tapscott and Ticoll have written another very detailed, practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely.  At the heart of The Naked Corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster, which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge.  In other words, perhaps the old adage "there's one born every minute" needs updating.  They're still being born, but hopefully now only a few per hour?  Corporations "getting naked" can't be good news for marketing departments.  Their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image; companies and products must be the image - for real.

                    <span>This book explains how transparent and open the world has become.  But better than that, it articulates why it is benificial.   With so much information at our disposal, it is at times overwhelming, is it not?  This books will show the way to cope in the jungle of infomation.</span>
