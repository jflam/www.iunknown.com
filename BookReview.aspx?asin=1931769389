                    <span>This is a book about what C++ has to offer and how to best take advantage of it. It will be most useful to people that already know C++ language. This book is an excellent tutorial and reference. Hackish C++ is useful for new and mature programmers. </span>

                    <span>I'm ashamed to say I bought this book.  I read it in about an hour.  He has a few tricks to teach us about how to make windows components dance around, dissappear, change etc.  So what?  Where is the meat of C++ programming in this book.  He knows his way around the Windows API, so what.  He knows how to freak out his co-workers.  So what.  Where is Scott Meyers when you need him?  Where is Andrew LaMott ( <== spelling? ) ....I was expecting to see some C++ tricks and was disappointed.  TCP/IP is great for sending/receiving stuff.  So what.  Where is the C++ stuff in this book.           Look around for another book to show you some C++ stuff.  This ain't the one.</span>

                    <span>You will find many interesting. If not, maybe you should consider writing your own book.
<br />
<br />The problem with this book is that it's too short and the only thing you can wish for when you finish it is "More Pranks and Hacks with C++".
<br />
<br />This is a fabulous book for learning the advanced capabilities of C++ and Windows API. I've really waited this book so long...

                    <span>I think every C programmer must read it more than once,every single line is valuable. Simple, quick, to the point, and easy to refer to in the thick of battle. The authors are experts in the network programming. I have two copies of this book in case I loose one.

                    <span>This book attracted me because of the high sales ranking and the reviewer ratings. But after reading these reviews, I thought that they are all liars.
<br />
<br />If you read the reviewers' other reviews, you won't find any. Think first before you buy this book.</span>
