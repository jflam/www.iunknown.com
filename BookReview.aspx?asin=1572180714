                    <span>Great book, bought it for my husband, but was very disappointed with the forms on the cd rom. They seem to be for beginner contractors as change orders and estimate checklists tend to be already used by seasoned contractors. The forms were nothing new to us. I was under the impression that the cd rom had sample contracts and was sadly mistaken. However, the book gives great advice. If one wants to purchase the authors' contract software system, be prepared to shell out $200.00 at his website. No wonder this book was inexpensive.</span>

                    <span>I am a general contractor in the commercial/public works market. This book is meant for the residential market. The author is well versed in that arena, but makes various references that these methods can be applied to the commercial market. That is best decided by the individual, but this is a residential construction book.</span>

                    <span>Written by a contractor for contractors, this book provides very sound business advise for many who are considering starting various types of small businesses. Contractors must charge appropriately for their services. This book will tell current and future contractors how-to establish job costs and an appropriate markup rate to increase the opportunity for long-term success. In addition, the author provides very sound advise on business/customer service best practices. The advise on properly communicating the value of services provided is very good. Lot's of other great information and the CD-ROM has some good forms to get you started. I highly recommend this book to all small general and specialty contractors, and especially to all contractors who are having problems making ends meet.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the best I have read on the subject. Plenty of good street smart advice that covers more than just the title subject. Mr. Stone has come up with a book that will help both those new to the industry, and those more experienced (see the section on the difference between new home construction and remodeling, and those who attempt to mix these business models.) <BR>Should be required reading for those attempting to get into this business.</span>
