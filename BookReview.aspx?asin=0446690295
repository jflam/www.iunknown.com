                <span id="Label1">Few events are more thrilling than the discovery of a buried treasure. Some years ago, when scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was leafing through an auction catalog, he noticed a listing for an unpublished, clothbound manuscript thought to date from the 1850s: "<i>The Bondwoman's Narrative</i>, by Hannah Crafts, a Fugitive Slave, Recently Escaped from North Carolina." Gates realized that, if genuine, this would be the first novel known to have been written by a black woman in America, as well as the only one by a fugitive slave. He bought the manuscript (there was no competing bid) and began the exhilarating task of confirming the racial identity of the author and the approximate date of composition (circa 1855-59). Gates's excited descriptions of his detective work in the introduction to <I>The Bondwoman's Narrative</I> will make you want to find promising old manuscripts of your own. He also proposes a couple candidates for authorship, assuming that Hannah Crafts was the real or assumed name of the author, and not solely a pen name.<p>  If Gates is right (his introduction and appendix should convince just about  everyone), <I>The Bondwoman's Narrative</I> is a tremendous discovery. But is it a lost masterpiece? No. The novel draws so heavily on the conventions of  mid-19th-century fiction--by turns religious, gothic, and sentimental--that it does not have much flavor of its own. The beginning of chapter 13 is a close paraphrase (virtually a cribbing) of the opening of Dickens's <I>Bleak House</I>. This borrowing seems to have escaped Gates, although he does quote the assessment of one scholar, the librarian Dorothy Porter Wesley, who had owned the manuscript before he acquired it, that "the best of the writer's mind was religious and emotional and in her handling of plot the long arm of coincidence is nowhere spared." Although not a striking literary contribution, <I>The Bondwoman's Narrative</I> is well worth reading on historical grounds, especially since it was never published. As Gates argues, these pages provide our first "unedited, unaffected, unglossed, unaided" glimpse into the mind of a fugitive slave.  <I>--Regina Marler</I></span>

                    <span>As background for this slave's narrative, we are introduced to John Hill Wheeler, writer, who had published HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF NORTH CAROLINA, 1584-1851), who served as assistant secretary to the U. S. President Franklin Pierce (always one of my favorites) in 1854.  There is a good photograph of Wheeler and a painting of his wife, Ellen, with her two sons by Thomas Sully who made the youngest look like a sleeping angel.
<br />
<br />There is also a photo depiction of the abduction of his slave, Jane Johnson with her family, off the Steamer Washington on July 18, 1855, in Philadelphia "by force" by a gang of Negroes led by an abolotionist.  Since he was unable to locate and reclaim his servants, Jane was subsequently replaced by Hannah -- who escaped in the Spring of 1857.  He must have been a hard taskmaster.
<br />
<br />One interesting thing (for me) was a mention of John Brown's (of Harper's Ferry, West VA fame) hanging in Charleston, VA.  It was observed that he died as he lived, "game."  He certainly was no coward.
<br />
<br />I found too much redundancy in the introduction by Henry L. Gates, Jr., and the narrative itself.  Absorbed in finding and preserving black culture in written form, he spends a lot of effort propounding on his conclusions, instead of the facts.  Like a local writer involved in uncovering ancient history, he uses too many "that's" proving he is not scholary.  To me, it shows a definite lack of education and too much emphasis on self promotion, so that whatever is printed will be thought or taken as the truth, the whole truth and nothing else.
<br />
<br />As with all autobiographical material it is hard to tell what is fact and where the fiction begins.  An old acquaintance now deceased who had been in the Merchant Marines in his younger years and received much enjoyment in bewildering strangers with his detailed stories, told me how he manufactured "truth."  Add a few relevant facts which can be substantiated and names of real people and presto! it's history -- not fiction.
<br />
<br />As with science, the individual authors are expounding on their own theories, not facts per se.  It's the same in any field and any "case" history.  Mr. Gates wanted to prove this narrative was authentic; therefore, he spent more effort with his "proof" than the slave's account itself.
<br />
<br />Something that old can never be proven beyond a doubt.  Now Clifford Irving's bogus biography of Howard Hughes was ill-timed.  Had he waited until after the person's demise, there would always be doubt and nothing to prove he was a liar.
<br />
<br />I don't believe a slave would know some of the words used by this writer.  By including family background and descriptions of events, it is taken as the authentic tale of a real Hannah Crafts.  He did too much surmising "what if's" to have run down the actual writer to New Jersey -- to have been the runaway slave from North Carolina.
<br />
<br />I found the marked out words and phrases to be distracting (also detracting).  It would have helped to have the edited parts left out; the 21 chapters would have sufficed without so much explanation and additions (in brackets).  Instead of making this clearer, it befuddles the story itself.
<br />
<br />I'm not a user of the word "that" which is grossly overused in newspapers today.  About ten years ago, I typed the lengthy "memoir" of my ex-husband, a college English professor, and edited at intervals throughout.  Of course, he proof-read every page before having the entirety copied and bound to distribute to members of his family.  Sometimes, he agreed to my "clarifications"; at others, he'd say, "but we didn't talk that way."  Growing up in a tiny hamlet between Shelbyville and Chapel Hill (where he'd been born) in Middle TN, and being about fifteen years my senior, he'd experienced things and feelings totally opposite to what I had in Knox County (East TN).  My reasons to "edit" were for the benefit of those who'd be reading his memories, not to change events -- and he finally agreed with me.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I should have left things exactly the way he expressed them, no matter how grammatically incorrect they were, as now that is what I am wishing Mr. Gates had done with this manuscript.  The things he marked through seemed inconsistent vocabulary for such a young, uneducated woman confined in "the peculiar institution", and I'd have preferred not to have to think about them.
<br />
<br />The textual annotations did not add to the story and were a bit too detailed.  You can analyze a situation "to death."  Some things are better left to the reader's imagaination.
<br />
<br />This story is as old as the hills.  Didn't he see the similarities between characters of this narrative and those in SHOW BOAT?  Sad but true.  Life is not always easy for those without power or money.</span>

                    <span>This book may have great value as a historical document, however, I evaluate it from the 'fun to read' point of view.  I did not find it a greatly enjoyable read.  It is written in the old novel style- "Perils of Pauline" comes to mind.  Neither did I find that I learned much about it was like to live like a slave during that time.  I am now reading a historical novel in which there are a few pages describing a slave market in the USA during the Revolution; which gave me a much clearer picture than Bondwoman's Narrative did.  The description of how the field hands lived left me wishing to read more about that, and in fact, I felt I did not even get a good picture of how the house servants lived.  There was quite a bit of philosophizing during the entire book so the author came across as an intellectual.  In this respect, her comments about the death of a fellow runaway slave towards the end of the novel were very interesting to me.</span>

                    <span>Written in the 1850s by Hannah Crafts and edited for a modern readership by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., The Bondwoman's Narrative is the only known novel authored by a female African American slave, and perhaps the first novel ever written by a black woman. Describing the story of "passing" as a young slave treks toward freedom, The Bondwoman's Narrative is an enthralling legacy which is especially recommended for university African-American literature collections and community library large print fiction shelves.</span>

                    <span>I didn't think there was anything I didn't know about slavery in America but I was wrong.  As an African American, there was times I had to put the book down because of simmering anger over the harsh institution of slavery.  Hannah says on more than one occasion she seen no worth in slaves marrying only to be sold away from each other or to promote slavery by having more children produced from the marriage.  Never before had I put the two together in thought, marriage and slavery. I finished the book and consider it good reading and excellent research notes.</span>

                    <span>In THE BONDWOMAN'S NARRATIVE Hannah Crafts eloquently details the experiences of a light skinned female slave in the South in the decades preceding the Civil War. Discovered in the form as an unpublished manuscript by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. it is believed that this is the first slave narrative written by an African-American woman from only her perspective. Gates provides thorough scientific and literary evidence in both the forward and appendix proving its authenticity. I give Gates the benefit of the doubt that this manuscript is authentic as I am not an expert to judge otherwise. Regardless, THE BONDWOMAN'S NARRATIVE is a thoroughly enjoyable book that kept me reading far beyond my original intentions. I especially enjoyed the sections describing her accounts of running away from her master and mistress to freedom. Also admirable are her depictions of the evil slave speculator Mr. Trappe. What a hateful man he was to totally disregard the well being of slave for the sheer enjoyment of monetary profit. Hannah has the ability to make these characters come alive and does a good job at representing this painful time in American history. I applaud Gates for publishing the manuscript therefore enabling others to enjoy and sympathize with the life journey of Hannah. Enjoy!</span>
