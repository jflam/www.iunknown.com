                    <span>I'm looking forward to the other Arthur Morris books (ie. I've got his Shorebirds book which I think is AWESOME). This book, however offers very little value if you are a digital photographer. It's poorly printed, has little useful information for a budding bird photographer, and isn't (to my simple ways) very useful. That said, I think there are other things out there by Mr. Morris that are useful. Compare this book to Bird Photography by Steve Young - that's a book that inspires, coaches, and educates - which I believe Mr. Morris does a great job of in his own classes.
<br />
<br />In short, avoid this book unless you're a film buff, but do buy other Arthur Morris books.</span>

                    <span>This book is small enough to carry in your camera/gadget bag and is full of essential information which can be referred to in a hurry. <p>This, together with Arthur Morris' newly available "pocket guide to evaluative metering", are worth their weight in gold. Both are light and convenient enough to carry around with you, until the information stored in these items becomes second nature to you.<p>What Arthur Morris doesn't know about bird photography and exposure can be written on the back of a postage stamp. <p>Happy shooting.</span>

                    <span>An amazing amount of useful information packed into a booklet not much bigger than the average camera manual.<p>This is one book that is to be found permanently stashed in my camera bag while out in the African  bushveld.<p>Particularly noteworthy are the chapters dealing with lenses,  exposure, film types and composition. When in the field, I find myself  often referring to the chapter on exposure, which is one of the clearest  most concise expositions I have ever seen on the subject.</span>
