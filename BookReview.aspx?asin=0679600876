                <span id="Label1">Augustine's <I>City of God,</I> a monumental work of religious lore, philosophy, and history, was written as a kind of literary tombstone for Roman culture. After the sack of Rome, Augustine wrote this book to anatomize the corruption of Romans' pursuit of earthly pleasures: "grasping for praise, open-handed with their money; honest in the pursuit of wealth, they wanted to hoard glory." Augustine contrasts his condemnation of Rome with an exaltation of Christian culture. The glory that Rome failed to attain will only be realized by citizens of the City of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem foreseen in Revelation. Because <I>City of God</I> was written for men of classical learning--custodians of the culture Augustine sought to condemn--it is thick with Ciceronian circumlocutions, and makes many stark contrasts between "Your Virgil" and "Our Scriptures." Even if Augustine's prose strikes modern ears as a bit bombastic, and if his polarized Christian/pagan world is more binary than the one we live in today, his arguments against utopianism and his defense of the richness of Christian culture remain useful and strong. <I>City of God</I> is, as its final words proclaim itself to be, "a giant of a book." <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

                    <span>I'm a nonbeliever, but I became aware of Augustine and Aquinas when taking Philosophy 100C and Philosophy of Religion at UCLA for my BA in Philosophy.  What I enjoy most about Augustine in this work is that he often sounds very rational and open-minded, indeed, almost modern in his frank discussions of human behaviors.  For example, he says things about sexuality that you might not expect a Doctor of the Church to say, like sex, being created by God, is not evil but it is lust which is sinful.  This work also contains his famous quote about time "If no one asks me what time is, I know.  If someone asks me, I do not."  I suppose that is the mark of a great author, in that they transcend the times they live in and have something to say to all generations.  At over 1000 pages, this book definitely requires a time committment on your part, but is certainly worth the investment.</span>

                    <span>What can I say about this book?  That as a Pagan, I consider it the ultimate insult to all human beings?  After all, it was written at a time when the Christians were starting on a major campaign to slaughter Pagans and bring us into the Dark Ages.  
<br />
<br />I could say that Diogenes searched far and wide for an honest man.  And that I too have searched far and wide.  For a stupid man.  And that now I've finally found one in gus, the author of this book.
<br />
<br />I could tell about how the author felt that if torture were appropriate for those who broke the laws of men, it was even more appropriate for those who broke the laws of god.  I could say that gus had no sympathy for Roman virgins who were raped by the Goths (he said they asked for it).   I could say that I am totally outraged by and fed up with folks like gus who tyrannically tell the rest of us how to worship.
<br />
<br />But I think I'll stop here.  </span>

                    <span>This is one of the great statements of Christian thought. It is the work which will define for many throughout the generations the fundamental Christian way of thinking about the world. Unfortunately this means it too is tarred by a fire- and- brimstone replacement theology which ruled Christian thinking in regard to the Jews for close to fifteen hundred years afterward. 
<br />The work sets up the basic contrast between the Good and the Evil, those who are part of the City of God( whether on Earth or in Heaven) and those who are in the City of sins, condemnation, and death. Augustine is a great teacher of doctrine, and his doctrine divides the world into the saved and the damned. If you are not going to be with the Church then you are not going to live. His idea in short is an absolute idea, and his great intellect argues to support a way of understanding the world which is total and complete. 
<br />The intellectual challenge presented by this book is great indeed. And in it one of the great minds of religious history expounds his fundamental teaching. 
<br />As one who belongs to a people and religion condemned in this book I cannot simply sing its praises. But it is impossible not to recognize the great scope and power of the mind at work here. </span>

                    <span>I expected City of God to read like any faithful Baedeker would; charming descriptions of quaint, exotic inhabitants; fanastically woven descriptions of alluring locales; perhaps even a tip on where to take in some fine cuisine. To this end, my expecations were most pleasantly vindicated. If you want to know how to make the most out of your holiday to the City of God, I recommend giving more than a careful perusal to this fine tome. </span>

                    <span>Saint Augustine (354 - 430 AD), was born at a time when the Roman Empire was in its nadir, a situation quite antipodal to the heydays of the glorious times of the philosopher emperor Julius Caesar and a few others that, for the glory of Rome, spread the wings of the Roman conquest to the borders of almost all the civilized world, from Britain in the West to the occidental limits of the Persian Empire in the East. The barbarians hordes were already knocking at the gates of Rome and many other important cities and eventually got there invadind Rome  trough the auspices of the Germanic barbarian Alaric, who, along with Atila the Hun, was one of the cruelest of his kind. The "Civitatis Dei" was written a few years after the first sack of Rome, a thrilling background to and the starting point of many of Saint Augustine ideas concerning God's attitude toward the city and its citizens. Despite the impending fall of the Western Empire, Christianism was steadily gaining ground as the official religion vis-à-vis Paganinsm, which began to suffer all the burden of (unofficial) persecuted by some Roman emperors. But Paganinsm still had strong adherents in many important places, specially in the Senate,  and the purpose of Saint Augustine was to counterpoise the ascending fortunes of Christianity.            <p> Augustine, born in the north of Africa in the city of Hippo, was one of the most important theoreticians of Christian doctrine of all times, a great thinker in his own right, who could be compared to great Catholic thinkers as Saint Thomas Aquina and Saint Paul, being one of the true founding fathers of the Catholic tradition and religion along with the Gospel four Evangelists. His written output is impressive, even outstanding, both from the point of view of its quantity as from the point of view of its inner quality. His most important works, written in Latin as usual at the time, are "The City of God" (Civitatis Dei) and "Confessions", the former an impressive book of 1,100+ pages of teachings concerning various aspects of the lives of Christians and pagans in the V century he lived. <p> The book's lenght notwithstanding, it is a very pleasant and easy reading, not losing the elegance it should have in Latin, with all the quotations necessary for the full understanding concerning some allusion of Augustine to the recent or remote history of Rome, ROman and Greek mythology and philosophical citations from authors renowned at the time but almost unknown today. A good introduction to the life and work of Saint Augustine is also provided.<p> TO sum it up, the book is a very good one and an essential reading to anyone interested in the importance of the philosophical thinking before the Middle Ages, most certainly influenced by Plato instead of Aristotle. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</span>
