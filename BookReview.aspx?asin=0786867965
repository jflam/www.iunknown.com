                    <span>I chose to read this book because I thought that Ms. Wiinstead was going to write about the slayings of the Civil Rights Workers (Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney, and Michael Henry Schwerner).  She did, but a little less than 1/3 of her book was actually about their slayings and how her great uncle was involved with the slayings.<p>I was really very disappointed.  She talked mostly about her racist family that lived in the state of Mississippi and the 'N' word was used way too much.<p>If you haven't purchased this book yet, good..if you did...oh well!!!<p>Hint (If this book was so good, then why are so many people selling theirs?)...<p>Thank You.</span>

                    <span>I found Back to Mississippi a book that was hard to put down, unexpectedly so.  From the beginning of the book you know that the story to be told is of the murder of three civil rights' workers and a family's denial of those murders.  At the same time this is a personal story of discovery and loss that really pulls the reader in.  There are three themes in this memoir:  the writer's Catholic upbringing in the north, the delightful discovery of a warm and loving family in the south, and the historical record of the bitter civil rights struggle in Mississippi.  As the book progresses there there is an increasing feeling of foreboding of the connection between the family stories and the brutal murders of the civil rights' workers.  This foreboding, good stories, and pertinent historical detail made this book more than worth the read.  Also, it left me wanting to know more about this period and the concealment of the violence perpeptrated then.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book to learn more about the 1960s civil rights movement and ended up with much more.  Winstead's stories about her childhood and family experiences were delightful bringing to mind many long forgotten memories - her mother's housework, delicious food prepared by southern relatives, happy times with cousins, to name a few.<p>Winstead's accountof her family's involvement in the deaths of civil rights workers is engaging and powerful.  <br>A wonderful first effort.  Buy this book!</span>

                    <span>Back to Mississippi is suspenseful even though you already know the ending.  Starting out to pass on stories of her father's south to her children, Mary Winstead found herself taking a good look at what is family loyalty when it comes up against something as shocking as murder.  She uses specific personal memories of the same time period growing up in Minneapolis, a mostly white, segregated northern city, a childhood journey to Mississippi to meet her father's family, and recent research into the murders of Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner in her father's home town in Mississippi, to delve into themes of discovery.  As she describes swimming across a dark-watered lake in Mississippi as a child, worried about where the bottom was and what was down there, she is also describing swimming on the surface of family relations, worried about the depths.  Most people know that civil rights workers were murdered in the south in the 1960s; some even know that the murderers have not all been tried and convicted.  Winstead's book takes you through her discoveries of who Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner were, why they felt compelled to go to Mississippi, and their murders when they arrived.  Who these three young men were is important to her story because once she understands who they were and that her aunts and cousins to this day believe the three young men were "trash" she has to decide what family loyalty means.  I found the book riveting and Winstead's willingness to push for family truth daring.</span>

                    <span>The sight of a large man sitting in a baby pool, a beer in one hand, a Pall Mall in the other, regaling his neighbors with "down home" stories had me laughing until tears.  Mary Winstead's characterization of her father "Windy" was simply fabulous.  This book is worth reading if only to take in characters such as the "Lind Girls", Uncle Aby, and Winstead's Matriarchal southern aunt.  I was impressed by the contrasts that were drawn between such bright family pictures and one of the darkest events in the Civil Rights movement.  My last thought was of that little girl praying for beauty in a darkened Church.  Took longer than she would have liked, but to me looks like your prayers were answered.</span>
