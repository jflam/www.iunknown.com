                <span id="Label1">Authoritative, international and up-to-date, The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia is arranged geographically and combines maps and photographs with information on all wine-growing areas, profiles of distinguished producers and assessments of individual wines. The book's easy-reference style, and wealth of practical advice, make it an unrivaled source of information for all lovers of wine -- from the occasional drinker to the connoisseur.   <P>Wines of the World. Distinguished wine authority Tom Stevenson examines the viticultural history of each wine-making country, discussing its wine-producing regions and the current reputation of its wines. He analyzes the factors affecting the taste and quality of each region's wines -- location, aspect, soil, microclimates, grape varieties, and methods of viticulture and vinification -- before assessing its appellations, the individual wine producers (chateaux or wineries), and, of course, the wines themselves.   <P>Enjoying Wine. Tom Stevenson provides practical guidelines on wine tasting, while an "author's choice" chart at the end of each section lists the very best wines. A star-rating system identifies the finest producers and highlights those offering the best value. A "taste chart" explains how to identify the flavors in a wine, and a "troubleshooter's guide" spots common wine flaws.   <P>Whether you are a newcomer wanting to explore the pleasures of wine or a wine enthusiast looking for inspiration, The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia is the book to consult again and again.</span>

                    <span>This book gives a fair treatment on Bordeaux and American wines, in which it gives a general review on each major chateau or producer. Although a tasting review on each vintage for those producers will make it even better. For other wine regions, including the great Burgundy, Rhone, Italy and Spanish wines, it only briefly review each appellation, without much useful information on producers, which is a great key in selecting those wines.</span>

                    <span>I'm a professional of wine working in Shanghai. I purchased this book in Amazon after the advise of a friend. I found the book to be interesting and a complete work, but I think his view sometimes lacks actuality. Although the author's mastery in wine tasting is out of discussion, his presentation of tasting is outdated: nowadays nobody can asses the origin of a wine just by tasting: the examples the author proposes are valid just in a ideal world without Australian Shiraz-Mourvedre, South African Cabernet-Merlot or Californian Zinfandel (otherwise rightly commented in his book).<BR>I can't help but bring here the review of "Toro" wine growing area. The author dispatches this area with few words, the last of them to tell us "among the many dirty cellars I have seen in my life, this one in Toro is the filthiest". This is the only comment he makes about wine cellars on that area. I bought also "The Oxford Companion to Wine" and Robert Parker's sixth edition of Wine buyer's guide. In "The Oxford Companion to Wine", edited by Jancis Robinson, in this region "a small number of producers have fostered a move away from the heavy, bulk reds of recent times, notably Manuel Farina, Vega Sauco and Frutos Villar". Concise and accurate, like all the rest in this excellent book.<BR>Mr. Parker has tasted the wines more carefully: this region" has adopted modern technology, and the results have been some rich, full-bodied, deeply flavoured, southern Rhone-like wine from wineries like Farina. They taste similar to the big, lush, peppery wines of France's Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas, and they represent astonishing values..." He found one of the wines produced there to be outstanding, and several others to be good. <BR>Nobody would expect from a wine taster to have the last news from every piece of vineyard on the world, but the word from such a well-known, reputable professional is too heavy to be delivered so lightly.</span>

                    <span>I bought the 1997 (or brown covered) encyclopedia a few years back (which I love by the way) and decided to purchase the updated version to find new and updated information such as new wineries or ones that were upcoming and warranted coverage in the new book. I am so dissapointed. The only change I could find is a box containing information on wine quality from 1997 to 2000. Tom Stevenson didn't even change one word in his cover letter! Even the page numbers in each book have the same information! The winery ratings didn't change - or not from what I could tell. Unless I can actually see what's inside the next version, I will never purchase an version again. If you own an earlier version, do not purchase this book - it's a waste of money.<br /><br>I rated it 2 stars, not because of the content, but because it is not updated as the cover indicates (see red circle). I do however question just how much Tom Stevenson puts into research with each book edition if nothing c</span>

                    <span>In the "wine-drinking" countries (which excludes the US, by about a<BR>factor of 10 per capita), a knowledge of wine at the casual level is<BR>pretty widespread. When people want to know more, they turn to<BR>an expert. This is typically someone who has spent his or her life <BR>in some part of the wine trade and therefore whose livelihood has<BR>depended on ability to satisfy, and accurately advise, customers.<BR>There are even highly respected standards such as the British <BR>Master of Wine examination that will establish whether a person<BR>genuinely knows the subject and can also smell and taste all of the<BR>nuances that he claims to. (The MW exam is notoriously revealing<BR>and would undoubtedly depopulate overnight the ranks of the<BR>self-appointed US wine pundits, which may be why many of them<BR>pointedly avoid reference to it.) In the US, which lacks most of<BR>these traditions, any musician or sportswriter or lawyer can claim<BR>to be a wine expert and there's a fair chance they'd get a Following,<BR>self-perpetuating on the basis of popularity.<P>Fortunately in the US, relying on such writers is not (yet) compulsory.<BR>It is possible to get books by English-language writers of very high<BR>caliber and experience, who mostly are in other countries (such as<BR>Clive Coates, Serena Sutcliffe, Remington Norman, and Michael<BR>Broadbent). Stevenson comes from this tradition, and although his<BR>book is not as specialized as those of the other authors I've just<BR>named, it is compensatingly broad. There is a desperate need for<BR>accessible one-volume introductory wine books. Blake Ozias's "All<BR>About Wine" served this need in the US, 25 or 35 years ago, but it<BR>is badly out of date (not to mention out of print); it was a thin book<BR>you could absorb in a few evenings. Stevenson's is different, it is<BR>a genuine encyclopedia, combining succinct overviews of all kinds<BR>of wine-making regions (including Texas and Mexico) with further<BR>depth on producers and labels in the larger regions. The compact<BR>snapshot on Beaujolais, for example, is superb, first laying out the<BR>history and styles, then illustrating many producers that you will in<BR>fact encounter in the shops. It distinguishes the deep, complex<BR>wines that the region can make from the bubble-gum style that has<BR>become more common recently. More generally, if you found a<BR>random bottle of wine that you were interested in, there is a decent<BR>chance you could look it up in Stevenson and learn much more.<P>This is the best single-volume general wine reference I'm currently<BR>aware of. I have recommended it to several people who wanted to<BR>learn more about wine and all of them have been very satisfied.</span>
