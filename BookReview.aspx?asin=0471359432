                    <span>I first used this book as a text for a graduate course in Integer Programming. At first it seemed to be a very poorly organized book, but as I read it and grew familiar with the subject, I realized that this is a hybrid textbook-handbook. Though the title says "Integer and Combinatorial", the authors go a step ahead and present topics in advanced linear programming, computational complexity, polyhedral theory in a fashion appropriate to the learning of this subject. The exercises are challenging and it has a very good list of references (only up to 1988). Our professor had to supplement the text with recent papers to cover the latest advances. My only complaint is that model formulation could have been dealt with in more detail. You might want to use HP Williams' "Model Building in Mathematical Programming" to look up good Math Prog models.<br>Though this is an excellent book in all respects, I would recommend Papadimitriou's older book on combinatorial optimization for a good discussion of P, NP problems and decision / optimization problems.</span>

                    <span>Nemhauser is a great professor and this book is text book for IP. But this book requires that you are familiar with Linear programming. So read this book only after you had LP. Bertsimas book is really good for Lp. Or even Bazaara's book is a goo start.<p>This book starts with the mathematical basics behind linear programming and develops on these introducing new techniques like Bender's decomposition, various cuts, etc. The way the mathematics is dealt is flawless but I thought the methods required more examples for better understanding. But ofcourse the book had to be concise....<p>I have no opinion on the combinatorial optimisation part.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the title fools you.  This book goes beyond Integer and Combintarial optimization. While there are many books talk about NP and proof, this book makes you "understand" it! Still, I agree with others that this book is a reference tool for Integer and Combinatorial optimization.  I'm so glad this book published in paperback so it will be more affordable for others.... still expensive though :(</span>

                    <span>Nemhauser and Wolsey named this book as Integer and Combinatorial Optimization.  To me, this is an extreamly great book of Advanced Linear Programming and I love it!.  If you're looking for a great pointer for  Integer programming or Combinatorial Optimization, this is the one.  If you  want to know something more beyond your Linear Programming class, don't  miss this book!</span>
