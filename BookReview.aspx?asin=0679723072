                    <span>Stampp's aim in writing this book was not to provide the complete and comprehensive last word on the subject of the American enslavement of Africans and their American descendents, nor to empathize with the oppressed slaves, nor to apologize for slavery, nor to echo the "voices" of slaves, nor to place it in the context of slavery around the world throughout human history (all of which are worthy topics which have been (and continue to be) addressed by other historians.
<br />
<br />Stampp's aim was to provide information lacking (in 1955, and still scant fifty years later) as to the nature of the institution itself, AS an American institution (which it certainly was up until its final (and sloppily inefficient) dismantling beginning 1863 (in the midst of the civil war).  The "Peculiar" Insitution (so dubbed by slave owners themselves, in secret (and embarrassed) acknowledgement of the sheer hypocrisy    of this institution.  Stampp does not attack the morality of slavery, nor does he "witness" the evils of slavery through statements of slaves or abolitionists (he is not writing a polemic); instead he provides us with something far more useful:  empirical data on just what the institution was, how it worked, what its practices were and what putative justifications were offered by its proponents for its existence and nature.  In doing so, Stampp gives his readers a far more damning criticism of slavery than any other writer I have encountered since reading Stampp's book for a high school history class in 1969.  Stampp expertly strips the subject of the emotion and bias (on both sides) that has obscured the facts (history is distinct from myth and propaganda to the extent that it is about *facts* assembled through valid inferences) about slavery.
<br />
<br />Some trite but persisting claims about slavery debunked by Stampp are:
<br />
<br />(1) the myth that all (or even a majority) of Southern whites owned slaves.  [A white family had to be fairly well off even to afford owning even one slave; a huge proportion of whites were scarcely better off financially or in terms of workload than were many slaves.]
<br />
<br />(2) the myth that the institution of slavery was in fact predicated upon "bettering" the lot of Africans, or even "taking care of them"(the view that blacks were incurably biologically, poltically, socially or otherwise "inferior" to whites.  [Even thoough these arguments for various policies concerning the treatment of slaves were often argued by defenders of the Peculiar Institution, the facts of the actual practice of slave belie both of these claims.  Adding up the actual "benefits" slaveowners offered blacks, the fact is that blacks were not subjected to any sort of "improvement". (Bible study, as Mark Twain -- still a key observer of the *realities* of slavery! -- served to entertain and enculturate slaves -- even subjugate them  as a "lower class", NOT as moral or social improvement. Policies (actual practices, whatever the rhetoric) toward slaves did NOT  lead towards freedom or citizenship at all.  (Facts may be cold, as one review pointed out -- but they tend to outweigh rhetoric or sentiment) -- and they are far harder to dismiss or impeach.  ]
<br />
<br />(3) in connnection with (2), Stampp's collection of data belies the claim that the typical slaveowner had any education or insight into the "care and feeding" -- much less mental and moral development -- of Africans.  The chapter on the theory and practice of diet and health as applied to slaves alone (a section guaranteed to make the reader physically queasy) says more about not only the awfulness of the institution slavery, but the incredible -- beyond incredible -- ignorance and poor (one could say "inferior") judgment of slave owners.  The myth that slaves were "bred" (or even captured or bought (usually bought) in Africa) and "fed" and cared for with even the insight one needed to raise cattle is dispelled by Stampp. An typcial African in Africa, left to fend for his food and health in "the uncivilized jungles" of the "dark continent" stood a far bettter chance of living healthily and to a ripe age than the typical American slave (I am not even considering the most highly exploited slaves of the very deep south (or in the "island") who were literally worked to death -- even "well treated slaves" were raised and fed and cared in compliance with white superstituions that rivaled any African mystical practices. 
<br />
<br />(4) One of the biggest myths addressed by Stampp is the myth that the slave economy was even a viable alternative to free enterprise (even in the most rudimentary and primitive sense of 'free enterprise' in which the free worker struggled to get work, do work, and earn enough to stay alive.  Even if one writes off slaves as having absolutely NO value whatsoever as human beings to society (a direct and flagrant contradiction to the claims of pro-slave moralists -- but that's one of the many "peculiarities" of the Peculiar Institution!) Stampp provide data to show that as far as economic develop in America was concerned, slavery could be considered at best a poor alternative to other economic systems (not only "free enterprise, but even to "utopian closed-and-regulated societies, of which there were many then as now), a crutch to be abandoned at the earliest opportunity possible, not a "way of life", even for white slave owners, much less poor whites (who did NOT benefit from slavery economically, and only generated a sort of class resentment against African-American slaves.)
<br />
<br />And there are plenty of other insights to be found in this half-century-old book that make it still worth purchasing and reading.  This book is rich with balanced, documented facts -- conspicuously missing or undervalued in today's "subjective viewpoint historian" arguments.  A subjective viewpoint -- even one as twisted as that of the advocates and defenders of "the Peculiar Institution" -- is not easily or effective refuted by another subjective viewpoint.  Facts speak for themselves, and Stampp does an excellent job of providing facts which completely undermine the romantic notions (pro and con) of slavery, and showe it for what it was, an inept, ill-conceived, irrational, contradictory, absurd, manifestly unproductive and unfair institution which, if subject to the sort of review institutions these days are accountable to, would never have passed the initial blueprint stage.
<br />
<br />Two final comments:
<br />
<br />(1) RE comments other reviewers have made about this book.  The use of the word "negro" (critized by one reviewer as antiquated) in Stampp's 1955 preface, was NOT antiquated in 1955, but a term accepted (even preferred) by most African Americans.  Given Stampp's meaning and use of the term, it is still acceptable by all but those persons (of any race) who can some how manage to read through the account of one of the most unbelievably sickening, savage and idiotic institutions in human history and only take offense at the use of the term "negro", and at a writer who has portrayed a remarkably faithful, accurate, insightful and *useful* look at "the land of the free" 's most infamous institution, the negative effects of which we (all of us) still feel today.
<br />
<br />(2) For the would-be reader still not convinced a book of this nature (neither a polemic now an apology, but an empirically based handbook on the pathology of slavery) is good or useful, I highly recommend this book as a useful good in examining the claims of modern-day oppressors (a large number, even if one restricts one's scope to the continent of Africa and the mid-East alone(!) ) that their nations or subcultures are "for the greater good", despite their differences from present-day American  "culture".  Stampp's book provides a methodology for evaluating such spurious claims the would-be sociologist, political scientist, anthropologist or other "critic" of contemporary human culture is seriously and truthfully and conscientiously attempting to evaluate.

                    <span>Kenneth Stamp's work demarcates a position in Black and White Studies regarding the efficacies of American slavery.  The problem with this book is that it does exactly what slavery did to Blacks: it objectifies them.  Rather than examining the human aspects, or the lack thereof, the book takes an exactingly empirical and utilitarian view of slavery.  But that is exactly the problem. Slavery was justified by the Neoclassical ideologies of the so-called Enlightenment which was supposed to be ratinoal and pragmatic but the Enlightenment made more problems than it ever solved.  Slavery is one such problem and while Stamp examines the necessity of slavery, suggestions that it "evolved" rather than was consciously constructed are a complete msireading of the book and of slavery.  Stamp's book is a useful piece in the total picture of slavery but it is by NO MEANS the most significant or even the most current.  As such, Stamp completely neglects to examine racism, the thinking that justified slavery and still exists depsite the fact that plantation slavery no longer exists!  For God's sake, the 1955 preface still uses the word "Negro"!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is written in a style similar to "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire", "The Wealth of Nations" and "The Origin of Species"--That manner is the machine gun-like statement of fact after fact.  Stampp intends to and does limit his discussion to the impact of Black slavery upon Blacks in an
<br />Anglo-Saxon world.  He does not venture much into arguments that slavery or serfdom existed until the 19th century in Eastern Europe as well as in Africa itself and some of the Arab world.  Nor does Stampp tell anything of the great harm done the greater society.  He does go into the economics of slavery a bit- enough to see the future.  It is quite evident that slavery was on the way out and the Civil War pushed up the date perhaps 10 or 20 years.  He does not go much into the moral ambiguity among the White civilization.  Thomas Jefferson believed the presence of the Blacks in North America was a mortal danger. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps Stampp has done the best thing in leaving unsaid the 
<br />tragedy visited upon Western civilization in favor of the tragedy visited upon the slaves, with some small discussion of the "why" of Black presence and the "why" of Black slavery.
<br />His attention placed as it is lends greater purity to the history.  The weakness of the book is any attention to happiness which slaves, perhaps a minority of slaves, enjoyed.
<br />This absence tends the book toward a work of propaganda rather than an history.  Stampp's book is worth reading.  It should not be taken as the whole story, not by a long shot!    </span>

                    <span>One of the main reasons I picked up The Peculiar Institution was to learn why a nation that was founded on the basis of a popular government would then turn around and aggressively import African slaves. The book tells of the creation of the institution of slavery in the New World as something that evolved, rather than something that European settlers consciously constructed.<p>It also does a good job of discussing the demographics and economics of slavery. Only a small number of white people in the south owned slaves, and those that did usually owned just one. Yet, because ownership of the vast majority of slaves was concentrated in the hands of a few, most slaves lived on huge plantations. Because slave labor was so cheap, business managers would frequently choose to buy or lease out slaves for work. This forced free labor to compete with the slaves for jobs and wages declined.<p>These portions of the book are utterly fascinating, and I couldn't put the book down. However, there was a bit more than I really cared to know about the average diet of slaves, and it seemed to belabor the rather obvious fact that free whites were usually able to commit violent crimes against black slaves with impunity. In these sections the book dragged a bit, and I felt that the author would have done the reader a favor by cutting a few of the 400+ pages.</span>

                    <span>I agree with other reviewers that this book is good.  Good, but not to be taken, in my opinion, as the final authority on the subject.  Prof. Stampp does not give enough detail concerning his credentials on this subject, and the other thing I object to in general is not that this book exists, but that, like so many others, it concentrates on the institution in the South, and glosses over the role played by our Northern brethren (who btw had much more racist opinions of blacks than southerners at that time as evidenced by their restrictive laws - and why the underground railway ended in Canada and not in a northern state) in buying and transporting these poor souls for profit and fortunes (all of which they and their heirs got to KEEP, not like in the South where all was lost), and the roles played by just about every nation at the time, not to mention the 500 years of slavery the black man suffered under the Islamic rule.<p>Anyone really interested in the subject should be required to read Rawick's 'The American Slave' based on the Slave Narratives which are interviews taken from actual former slaves during the 1930's.  This is hearing it from the horses' mouth, so to speak, for the good and bad aspects.<p>Personally, my studies have brought me to believe that if handed the situation of slavery (which of course I would never have permitted in the first place), that immediate freedom ultimately was a great injustice to blacks.  Given the situation at hand, blacks today would be much better off had slavery first been regulated so that it could have been gradually phased out in an organized and deliberate manner instead of people being 'turned out to pasture like cattle' with no education, no way of livelihood, and at a time when the entire South (even whites) were hard pressed to make a living.  I, myself, could write a book on this subject, but suffice it to say that this is why I believe we have suffering today among blacks that are the result of parentless or fatherless homes, lack of education, lack of respect, and lack of culture.  It has only been about 4 or 5 generations since the end of slavery, and the first 3 of these not much progress was made because everyone was living poorly.  This is not that long of time to right such a terrible wrong, and  the correct and best way of righting it might not have necessarily been to seek the fastest and most immediate.</span>
