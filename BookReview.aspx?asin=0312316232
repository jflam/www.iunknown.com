                    <span>This is the first and only book I've bought concerning social phobia. Perhaps because I had already researched this subject on the web, a lot of the suggestions in this book were common sense and obvious. Too much was devoted to explication (e.g., what causes anxiety, nature vs. nature, what are SSRIs, etc.) vs. providing actual suggestions which I thought was a waste.
<br />
<br />Was I expecting too much? I don't know. There weren't any revelations in this book. Even the anecdotes were a disappointment, I wished the author fleshed them out more. This book may be useful for those comletely NEW to this topic, but I suggest you look elsewhere if you want to delve deeper. </span>

                    <span>I would like to thank the Markway's for writing such a wonderful book.  This book is full of information in helping one deal with social phobia.  This book not only helped me deal with my own issues with social phobia, but it has given me great ideas on how to help my daughter who suffers from Selective Mutism.</span>

                    <span>This book effectively taught me how to deal with SA. I really like the author's communication style.<br>The topics that helped me most were about what to/what not to  focus on and how to conduct yourself, how to face your core fears, and how to relax. <br>It gives a good framework to build a practice out of.</span>

                    <span>Like many other books on the subject, this is yet another great resource to deal with a real problem many people (inlcuding myself) suffer from.  It's sad that people like Darin review the book without any knowledge of the disease first- hand.  His review was a bit confusing, but I think he's trying to claim this isn't a real disease.  Let me tell you- it is.  It is NOT shyness...shyness does not even do justice to the ordeals we go thru everyday, just to do the simplest tasks that anyone with this disease takes for granted.  Is going to the grocery store or the drive thru bank window a troubling experience that causes fear in the average person? Of course not...it is for me tho, so,common sense says this IS a real problem...it IS a disease, it's not just a personality trait.  It's a shame to see ignorance people like Darin give off in the reviews of such a good book.  By the way, contrary to what Darin says- if you suffer from the disease, you're hardly a loser.  Atleast that's what I got out of his poorly written review.</span>

                    <span>Wow.  I think maybe that last reviewer had some problems other than just being painfully shy.  I don't usually write reviews but I like this book and have found it helpful.  Most books dealing with this subject seem to be more specific to social skills-- how to be assertive, how to win friends and influence people, etc.  I like this book because it deals more generally with how to be comfortable with yourself in social situations.  It's clear and easy to read and has interesting examples.  It also has helpful exercises to try.</span>
