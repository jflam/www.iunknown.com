                    <span>The basic concept observed by the author is untrue.  It would be great if it was true, but its not.  I was going to attend one of his seminars in Sedona, Arizona so I ordered all his books after hearing his underlying testing technique used by the Power of Intention author, Duane Dyer.  When extrapilating his conclusions, I realized the technique, if it were true, would make me a fortune in Vegas, I decided to check Quack.com to see if his theory held water.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.  You can make a lot of money using the technique, but you have to sell books to do it.  If you buy the book and you feel like you don't understand much of what he is saying, there is a reason for that, but don't assume that its because you lack intelligence or understanding.  Not using an adequate double blind from which all is hidden (a pun on the title), was the downfall of the underlying research.  Also, anyone who uses "Who's Who" as a reference raises a red flag in my opinion.  I love it, the author even rates his own books using a flawed rating system:  "Power vs. Force" rates a 850 and "Eye of the I" calibrates at a 950"  I didn't see any real professionals recommending his work on his book, did you?  I bought his books, shame on him, but at least I didn't pay go to his seminar.  950! in a pig's eye!</span>

                    <span>Certainly not for the "spiritually timid". It truely is the word of God. I would suggest reading Power vs Force and The Eye of the Eye first, but I wouldn't say that it is a necesity. 
<br />The radical Truth of "I" speaks to one's soul and alter's one's experience.

                    <span>I have been told that it's good to listen to those who are searching for truth and to avoid those who have found it. In the case of this book and its predecessor "The EYE of the I", I would say that these are a good example of such a saying. I read Power VS force, and enjoyed the thoughts it provoked. I love the effect of provocative literature as it expands my awareness, and widens the view of my subjective conscious world. The more convinced the author is of the matter at hand the better I like it. Although there are several yellow sticky flags poking out from the page edges of both "Eye" and "I", which will draw me again to a particular thoughtful point, my impression after reading these books is that Mr. Hawkins would rather not have been born a human. Do you remember how the Data character of Star trek and the Andrew character of The Millennium Man were an "android that would be man"? Then you will understand what I mean when I say that this author is a "man that would be android". It bothers me that he has something so strongly against being human. This makes me doubt his agenda toward me as a human. It also bothers me that he so completely surrenders his analytical abilities to an unseen entity. God's TRUTH, as read through the muscle spasms of only the most innocent among us--Ask a question, push against someone's outstretched arm, get the truth! I don't know about you, but this... making me doubt my own decision-making ability bothers me a whole lot. If Kinesiology becomes the next religion, I hope I'm not around when it happens. These unseen forces, if they're mostly malevolent, will have a field day tricking us with half-truths just as other religions do. Pass these two up, but enjoy Power VS Force as the real gem of this trilogy.</span>
