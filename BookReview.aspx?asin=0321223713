                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Got 10 seconds? Download an album! That's the kind of magic Apple's new iPod digital music players afford. That, and enough storage space for more than 7,000 songs; a slim, super lightweight design (weighing less than two CDs!); and access to the iTunes Music Store and its 200,000 or so songs. And these represent just the tip of the iceberg!  To get the inside skinny on all you can do with the latest iPod models, you need this fun, practical, thoroughly updated volume from popular Mac columnist and author <b>Christopher Breen.</b> A reengineered, all-touch interface; customizable menus; on the-go playlists; support for more (and better) audio formats; a new travel alarm clock; wired remote control; an elegant and convenient charging and syncing dock; and a trio of fun games are just some of the new features covered here. You'll also find hints for accessorizing and protecting your iPod, tips for maximizing its storage capabilities, and troubleshooting advice for when it refuses to cooperate. </html></span>

                    <span>At first glance this might seem a good choice for iPod owners. But upon further examination, the author leaves out too many critical subjects. For instance, he ignores widely reported iPod flaws, such as the useless battery indicator, and the third generation unit's bad habit of rapidly draining the battery even when turned off. The question is, why should there be "secrets" about a simple device that should be properly documented by the manufacturer? Breen, like so many computer industry authors, profits from the poor product support that is too typical of the industry. These authors are also too cozy with the manufacturers to be able to dispense much-needed criticism of the products they write about. If you discover a genuine iPod "secret" it is probably a manufacturing defect, and you should contact Apple Computer.<P>P.S. Contrary to the author, whose hypersensitivity leads him to post a falsely accusatory response to my review, I have read his book. If he relied less on his faulty intuition, his writing might have more value. A technical writer should be more careful if he wants to be taken seriously, and no author should be unable to withstand criticism.</span>

                    <span>If you can't make it to one of Mr. Breen's iPod/iTunes seminars which I highly recommend, this is the next best thing. Everything you need to know and more about your new iPod. First off, the iPod is a mini hard drive music player run by cool software. It does a great job. It is not a walkman or radio, it is a sensitive appliance. I own two and I found it's fairly intuitive and got it up and running in minutes. For those who want get into the innards, voila! Mr. Breen to the rescue!</span>

                    <span>Mr. Martin is back to his old tricks. I'm the author of Secrets of the iPod and also a moderator of Macworld magazine's forums. Mr. Martin and I had a disagreement and he was eventually banned from the forums for trolling. He chose to express his frustration by writing a negative review of my book (a book he has never read).<P>When my first remarks appeared revealing the true nature of his review, he edited his review to be positive in the hope that I would then be forced to change my remarks. <P>His review read:<P>"This work is so informative and so well written that it works on every level, and for both beginners and experts. Without doubt, Mr. Breen is the most trusted iPod expert, and has produced the "bible" for iPod users. You can't go wrong with this book."<P>Yet when my remarks were removed at my request, Mr. Martin changed his review yet again to the negative screed you now see. How could the same book (and its author) be so wonderful one day and wretched the next? Such is the logic of the trollish world Mr. Martin inhabits.<P>I'm sorry that Amazon's customers must be subjected to Mr. Martin's childish antics but until he's eventually prohibited from venting his spleen in such a fashion, there's nothing for it but to expose him for the kind of person he is. <P>That said, I would disregard anything Mr. Martin has to say about my book -- positive or negative -- as it's difficult to write a useful review of a book you refuse to read.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book was great! Finally, I have found a book that answers some of the nagging questions I have had about my ipod, for example hidden files. I had done research on the internet for answers to some of my questions with no luck finding detailed answers, until I discovered "Secrets of the iPod", by Chris Breen. I recommend this book to anyone who owns an iPod and wants to know how it "really" works.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book completely ducked the most controversial aspect of owning an iPod: the limited number of recharges (and ultimate battery replacement) that each and every iPod owner faces. Instead, Mr. Breen choses to talk about how to prolong a single battery charge (turn off backlighting), and not how to extend the limited life of the Apple-provided battery. For example, is it good or bad for an iPod to be left plugged into its dock, after it has fully recharged? Also missing was advice on replacing the battery with internet available kits, use of non-Apple replacement battery services, the value of Apple's own AppleCare warranty, etc. Overall, the book had a few useful tips (available for free on many web sites), seemed very out of date for Windows versions and on any 2003 iPod releases, and generally felt like a poor value. I also felt that Amazon.com's advertising made it sound current, when in fact it is not. I am sorry that I purchased it from Amazon.</span>
