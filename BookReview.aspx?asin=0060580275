                <span id="Label1"><p>A stunning new voice in American fiction, Sara Gruen makes a masterful debut with a novel of family, tragedy, rebirth ... and the breathtaking love of something wild.</p> <p>As a world-class equestrienne and Olympic contender, Annemarie Zimmer lived for the thrill of flight atop a strong, graceful animal. Then, at eighteen, a tragic accident destroyed her riding career and Harry, her beloved and distinctively marked horse.</p> <p>Now, twenty years later, Annemarie is coming home to her dying father's New Hampshire horse farm. Jobless and abandoned, she is bringing her troubled teenaged daughter to this place of pain and memory, where ghosts of an unresolved youth still haunt the fields and stables -- and where hope lives in the eyes of the handsome, gentle veterinarian Annemarie loved as a girl ... and in the seductive allure of a trainer with a magic touch.</p> <p>But everything will change yet again with one glimpse of a red and white striped gelding startlingly similar to the one Annemarie lost in another lifetime. And an obsession is born that could shatter her fragile world.</p></span>

                    <span>This lovely novel is so well written and maintains your interest so well I read it in an afternoon. I didn't want to put it down to eat. The plot is captivating but not too complicated, and it reads so fluidly you'll never once stop and wonder what the heck is going on. The characters have their own personal flaws and struggles, but are realistically believable. Information regarding the horses is correct and knowledgeable, without being overly detailed or confusing to a non-rider/horse owner. The romance is real and touching, withough being overdone or graphic, and the mother-daughter relationships are dynamic and well developed. Most importantly, Sara Gruen succeeds in conveying the magnetic draw to a horse, which if you have not experienced, is difficult to explain. This is a wonderful book that I highly suggest whether you are a horseperson or not, but if you share a love of horses, you will enjoy this even more.</span>

                    <span>Riding Lessons is a genuine two-hankie tear-jerker. It is the story of Annmarie Zimmer, an olympic equestrienne whose career comes to an abrupt halt in a tragic accident that kills her horse and leaves Annmarie seriously injured. The story picks up twenty years later, when Annmarie's physical injuries have healed, but her emotional life is in shreds: her husband has left her, her father is dying, and her rebellious teenaged daughter Eve looks like she's heading downhill fast. This book takes off at a whirlwind pace and draws you in immediately. The harrowing first scene is reason enough to read the book, but there is more than that to hold you here-- careful characterizations abound, but the portrait of Annmarie is so recognizably human that you'll find yourself rooting for her until the end. Love women's fiction? Love horses? Either or those will do. Move over Jane Smiley and Rita Mae Brown. Shove your copy of the Horse Whisperers over on the shelf. Riding Lessons by Sara Gruen is a new classic.</span>

                    <span>Although this is Sara's first novel, I feel that she has outdone herself. She has written an impressive novel that combines romance with very real life drama, intrigue, mystery family dynamics and the harsh realities that life sometimes dishes out. She has also addressed two very important issues; the role of equine rescue groups and the controversial subject of a person's right to choose to die.<P>The main character in this book is very courageous and endures many hardships throughout her life. Because she endured these hardships, she goes on to become a more powerful and stronger woman. This book will give anyone who reads it a powerful hope, that no matter how hard life is and how many tragedies a person may endure, there is still hope and happiness to be had!<P>I could not put this book down. Sara went flawlessly from one subject to the next smoothly and it was so well written I felt like I was there. Whether you are an experienced rider, a horse lover or someone who just likes a great read- I highly recommend you JUMP into this book, you will not be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>The cover of this book caught my eye as I was going through an airport, and I picked it up thinking it was going to be a fluffy piece of genre fiction to fill my flight. Also figured the horse details would be off because they usually are in books, especially ones that tease you with covers like this. Boy was I wrong! From the very first scene Gruen pulls you in and doesn't let go. I was upset when the plane landed because I hadn't finished the book yet. I spent most of my first day on vacation finishing it and I was sad to see the end. Hard to believe this was a first effort. I hope Ms. Gruen has another book coming SOON. Maybe a sequel?? Horse lovers need more books like this!</span>

                    <span>Normally it takes me two weeks to get through a book but I read this one in two sittings. I blame Gruen for making me burn my stew! If you've ever loved a horse, you've got to read this book. Even if you don't have horses but want to know what it's like. Gruen captures the special relationship between a horse and a person perfectly. Also all the pitfalls that happen in the relationship between mothers and daughters. I eagerly await her next book.</span>
