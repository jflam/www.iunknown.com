                    <span>I like the part when "Bill" - David Carradine - is making that sandwich.  I mean, he is REALLY into making that sandwich - the sandwich bread, the mayonaise, everything all perfectly laid out.  I swear, I have never seen anyone spread mayonaise with such precision in my life - all while holding an intimate conversation about life and death.  It was such effortless, graceful sandwich making - they practically made themselves!
<br />
<br />I can tell you, I was ready to eat that sandwich when it was all done, but sadly, he made one for himself and his kid, and I never got any.
<br />
<br />I never understood why it took Mia Farrow 45 minutes to an hour to kill each of Bill's underlings.  But then she killed Bill himself in like 5 seconds, all while never getting out of her patio seat.  Lamest ending ever.</span>

                    <span>Remember (if you're over 22 or so, I guess) when there were no CDs and no burning CD programmes, so you'd make somebody a mixed tape? (see the movie "High Fidelity" for a better explanation_ they have it here at amazon)
<br />Well, all of Tarantino's movies, specially this last Kill Bill, ARE mixed tapes. And I'm not talking about the soundtrack. 
<br />It's interesting how even the first Kill Bill gets a track or two in this one...
<br />And, by the way, both Kill Bills are KILLER tapes. The type you need a lot of inspiration to pull. The only reason I gave Kill Bill vol.2 four stars and not five is the Emilio thing (go see the movie). Twisted! What was the scriptwriter trying to do (errr... just remembered that'd be Tarantino, too), get us to hate her? 
<br />All hands up for no one under 10 in the next Tarantino movie.

                    <span>Usually sequels leave a lot to be desired, but this one got it right. Most of  the questions left over from Vol 1 were answered, including my favorite, What happened to Elle's eye? I knew there was a good story there, and I wasn't disappointed.
<br />Since most of the technical praise has already been given by other reviewer's, and much better than I could, let me just say that I thought the actor's, all of them, gave outstanding performance's. It's too bad the Academy doesn't award movies that were just meant to entertain. This is a very good movie, well worth watching... but you have to put your serious side in the closet for awhile. Highly recommend this film and Vol 1. </span>
