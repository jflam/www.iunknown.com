                <span id="Label1">"MASTERFUL."<br>--The Washington Post Book World<br>"RIVETING . . . UNFOLDS LIKE A DETECTIVE STORY."<br>--Los Angeles Times Book Review<br>In July 1991, nine skeletons were exhumed from a shallow mass grave near Ekaterinburg, Siberia, a few miles from the infamous cellar room where the last tsar and his family had been murdered seventy-three years before. But were these the bones of the Romanovs? And if these were their remains, where were the bones of the two younger Romanovs supposedly murdered with the rest of the family? Was Anna Anderson, celebrated for more than sixty years in newspapers, books, and film, really Grand Duchess Anastasia?<br>The Romanovs: The Final Chapter provides answers, describing in suspenseful detail the dramatic efforts in post-Communist Russia to discover the truth. This unique story, written by Pulitzer Prize winner Robert K. Massie, presents a colorful panorama of contemporary characters, illuminating the major scientific dispute between Russian experts and a team of Americans, including Drs. William Maples and Michael Baden--fiercely antagonistic forensic experts whose findings, along with those of DNA scientists from Russia, America, and Great Britain, all contributed to solving one of the greatest mysteries of the twentieth century.<br>"AN ADMIRABLE SCIENTIFIC THRILLER."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>"COMPELLING . . .

                    <span>Nicholas and Alexandra is the definitive book about the last rulers of Russia, and Robert Massie's The Romanov's: The Final Chapter is a fitting sequel to this venerable book. N & A ends with the execution of Nicholas and his family, but we discover in The Final Chapter that much has happened since the original was published in 1967. Lots of new information has become available due to perestroika, the fall of the Soviet Union, the opning of many long-sealed records and archives, and a renewed interest in the monarchy. All of these changes make us realize that there are many more chapters to the Romanov story, and this book is filled with mystery, tragedy, science, bickering, intrique, and above all, a profound sadness. <P>We read about the discovery of the Romanov remains and how and why this was kept secret for so long. We learn about the DNA testing to determine the authenticity of the remains and the subsequent fighting over that. Of course, there is the problem of the two missing skeletons and the controversy this causes. We are introduced to a number of Romanov imposters including Anna Anderson. We learn about the fates of the true surviving Romanov's and their battle over who should be claimant to the throne. We also are informed of the destruction of the Ipatiev House by Brezhnev so that it wouldn't become a monarchist shrine. And finally, we hear about the rumors of a vast Romanov fortune that is supposed to be in foreign banks and has never been found. <P>Since this book has been published, the Romanov remains have finally been reburied in St. Petersburg. But even this could not be accomplished without the bickering of the surviving Romanov's (as characterized in The Final Chapter). Some of them even boycotted the event. It is not always a pretty story.<P>The Final Chapter is also filled with fascinating tidbits of information. For instance, Prince Philip (husband of Queen Elizabeth) provided blood samples for DNA analysis as his grandmother was the Empress Alexandra's older sister.<P>All in all, this is a fabulous book! Those who expect this to be a boring, dry history will be pleasantly surprised. No author has told the Romanov story with as much style, passion and completeness as Robert Massie. It is no wonder that the story of Nicholas and Alexandra refuses to die, and why new generations of readers become enthralled with this tragic story--even 85 years after their deaths.</span>

                    <span>The Romanovs: The Final Chapter is an excellent book. It is written in great detail and begins with the death of the last Imperial family of Russia. I recommend reading Nicholas & Alexandra and then this if you are just begining to learn and read about them. Nicholas & Alexandra begins a little bit before Nicholas II took the throne and continues with their personal and political lives. The Romanovs: The Final Chapter provides scientific evidence to back up what you are reading. It is a detailed look at the death of the Romanovs, the finding of their bodys in the 70s, the refinding of their bodys in 1991, and the famous Anna Anderson theory. It doesn't provide an explantion to who Anna Anderson really was, but it provides facts to make your own conclusion (mine - Anna Anderson is not the Grand Duchess Anastasia). The Romanovs: The Final Chapter & Nicholand and Alexandra are seriously the two best books to read about the Romanovs. Also, the movie (based on the book) Nicholas and Alexandra is a wonderful movie. I recommend all of these for anyone who is new at learning of the last Imperial family, or who has read tons of books and wants more information.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful edition to any Romanov/Russian History/Grand Duchess Anastasia/Anna Anderson Libary. This book scientificly proves that Anna Anderson was NOT Her Imperial Highness, The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna, but more of the simple, mentally deranged, and wanton Polish peasant, Franziska Shankowvska. It speaks of Tzar Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tzaritsa Alexandra Feodroevna (Princess Alix of Hesse), Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria (Marie, Mashka),and Anastasia Nikolaievna, and Tsarevich Aleksey and of course Anna Anderson/Franziska Shankowvska. It speaks of the many men and women who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia and Tsarevich Alexei and the other, less over publisized Grand Duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and Maria.)</span>

                    <span>Robert K Massie is a marvellous historian. Anyone who has read "Dreadnought" which concerns the lead up to World War I would probably concur. It is a master epic of naval history.<P>"The Romanovs: The Final Chapter" is a very different book to "Dreadnought". It seems to be a means of cashing in on the current interest in European aristocracy and the ongoing mystique of whether Anastasia Romanov died with her parents and siblings in Ekaterinburg in 1918 at the hands of the Bolsheviks. However, while being a very different style of book, it is also a much less readable and significant piece of history. The reader seems to be on an endless journey through the minutiae of the Russian royal family and all the crackpots who claim a part of their heritage. It is not a read that is pleasant or easy to follow.<P>I am unable to recommend this book to other readers. The Romanovs are no longer of any modern day relevance. This book, if it has one redeeming feature, is to confirm their irrelevance.</span>

                    <span>Massie wrote an excellent and very detail book on the quest to find and identify the last Romanovs. The book began with the finding and identification of the bones and then went into the Anna Anderson mystery. Massie is a great writer which he nonetheless proved in this book.</span>
