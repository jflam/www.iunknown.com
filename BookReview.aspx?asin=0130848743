                    <span>As a note to A reader from LLNL, CA., yes this book covers DCOM (which is out of date),BUT it is primarily about building DISTRIBUTED applications using COM with Visual C++ 6.  <p>I'm just about to start a five year iterative project for a client in Visual C++ 6 (believe me many, many clients who regard safety as paramount will wait quite a while yet before jumping to .Net), and as someone for whom Visual C++ is a second (or third) lanaguage, it's a great book.</span>

                    <span>Micro$oft is famous for its ability to push out new development technologies. The reason behind this planned obsolesence is obvious, every time they come out with something new people will have to open their wallets to "keep up."<p>DCOM is just another disposable technology. As such, it was a complete failure; one that the marketing folks at M$ have tried to bury as quickly as possible under an avalanche of .NET hype.<p>DCOM was hard to port because, like COM, it is based on a binary standard (i.e. a standard that changes when you leave x86 and go to 64-bit RISC). Not only that, but DCOM doesn't support distributed transactions. Worst of all, DCOM is a very, very complicated technology to use. Three strikes... YOU'RE OUT!<p>The half-wit MBAs at Micro$oft realized their mistake and have abandoned DCOM, leaving it forever in the backwaters where the only record of its sorry existence are stupid books like this.<p>I have no idea why someone would want to buy this book. Folks, this is a dead technology. It is no more. It is an ex-techology. If you buy this book, you are lying to yourself. This book will sit an gather dust, unless you can find more productive uses for it...like burning it to stay warm.</span>

                    <span>I have read multiple books relating to COM/DCOM topics and I find that most of them tend to be very hard to follow/comprehend.  Jim tends to re-emphasize his points so that you don't have to turn back the page to continue following along.  In my mind I am asking a question and low and behold the answer is on the next line.  <p>Jims video store n-tier example is excellent.  Many books throw in many examples that tend to be non-related; therefore, confusing the reader.  By using an expanded example throughout the book makes reading and comprehension simple.  <p>I don't write many reviews (as a matter of fact none), but I felt that while I was online looking for other books written by Jim Maloney I would give him some aknowlegement for a book excellently written.<p>Congrats...</span>

                    <span>This book is a gem.  Every member of our development team has their own dog-eared copy.<p>The justifications for a stateless middle tier running under MTS as well as an optional stateful object model that runs client-side are very clear and well thought out.  Maloney also gives a strong argument for why every middle tier component needs an accompanying VB test app that demonstrates the use of each component method.<p>Finally, kudos to Jim Maloney, the author.  He has been VERY responsive to questions I have emailed him about the book.  His responses have been quick and informative.<p>Standard disclaimers apply.  I'm not affiliated with the publishers or author of this book in any way outside of buying/reading the book.</span>

                    <span>Perfect for someone like myself transitioning from VB to C++. Clear examples of how to create ATL .dlls with ADO or OLEDB. Excellent example of creating simple hierachical object models and custom collections. A good  chapter on integrating MTS and proper exception handling. <p>If you already  know the Microsoft DNA framework and want to dive into C++ implementation  quick, this book is made to order.<p>I was churning out ADO .dlls within a  week.  I can't emphasize the simplicity and clarity of this work. I read 6  other MTS/Database/C++/COM books and hands down this one is the most  focused. The Nathan Wallace MTS book (MFC and ATL) is a good companion to  this one if you desire reinforcement, some wordier examples, and both ATL  and MFC variations. <p>Only caveat: One of the strengths of this book is  its weakness. This book does not cover C++ programming language basics so  if you can't read procedural code or understand objects in a general sense  this could be a little steep. On the other hand, if you don't want your  examples cluttered up with a lot of business logic and procedural riff-raff  this book is tremendous.</span>
