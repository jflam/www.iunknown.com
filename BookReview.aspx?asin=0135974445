                    <span>The title of this book belies much of its content. While agile development practices are espoused, much of the content is concerned with the application of design patterns in accordance with Robert's OO design principles.<P>Robert does a wonderful job of explaining each design pattern, demonstrating their use through code, and placing them within the context of his design principles. The examples are numerous and, with a few exceptions, well written.<P>Robert's OO design principles are real gems. His pragmatic approach combined with codifying the principles he's derived over the years makes for a very enlightening read. He articulates those things that most experienced developers have a gut feel for but have difficulty putting in to words.<P>My only criticism is the need for a proofing scrub. There are inconsistencies between some of the class and method names used in the narrative versus those used in the accompanying diagrams and examples. In some cases, this is a bit confusing.</span>

                    <span>As a developer new to OO programming I have struggled (and still continue to) to wrap my head around the power of objects.<P>How do I construct well designed OO software? How do these design patterns work? And how do I wrap some sort of process <BR>around my development to ensure that I produce the best software I can?<P>One answer is to hire Robert C. Martin but failing that you can get a virtual Uncle Bob in the form this book.<P>Robert has managed to impart so much in one text. John Vlissides describes it best I think (on the back cover) as a <BR>weaving of agile methods, patterns, and principles of modern software development.<P>I particularly liked the sections describing the OO design principles and the use of design patterns. I found the code <BR>examples excellent. It would have been nice to have them ALL in Java but that just meant that I had a few exercises <BR>to do :-) <P>Robert's writing style makes this book very easy to read but it is by no means light in content. Questions that came to <BR>mind as I read were frequently answered as I turned the page. (And if you still have one that is unanswered, you can <BR>always ask Robert via comp.object)<P>In fact anyone who as ever submitted a question to comp.object is probably already familiar with Robert C. Martin and if <BR>you do follow this newsgroup you've just got to read "A Satire of Two Companies" in the appendix section.<P>In summary this book has provided me with so much great stuff on good OO design and the use of patterns that I am <BR>constantly referring to it and will no doubt be re-reading many chapters.<P>I am not sure if there are many "must have books" on the market but this is definitely one of them!</span>

                    <span>The bulk of this book describes OO design principles. They're presented in a readable, useful, and well-organized way. Often they just clarify and put a name to something you've probably been doing anyway. The standard Dependency Inversion Principle is there, for one. (I'm glad to see that other people have trouble with the name. By today's reckoning, there's nothing inverted about it, but the name dates back to less enlightened times.) Others, like the Interface Segregation Principle, are less well known but reinforce lots of other good practices, such as data hiding and prevention of "interface leakage".<P>The "Agile" section is blessedly short, and doesn't much contaminate the otherwise good presentation elsewhere in the book. There's a lot of good to be extracted from the agility movement, but there's a lot of rabid dogmatism too. Martin managed to keep it well under control. He presented the Manifesto (ugh) early on, but that was the worst of it.<P>A few points marred the book, but only slightly, The drawings came across as "cute" - unprofessional and tangential to the topics at hand. Semi-fictional conversations in books like this always seem fatuous to me, and Ch.6 was no exception. The technical content managed to withstand this presentation anyway.<P>This book has lots of good ideas. It relates those ideas well to common and useful design patterns. A few aspects of the book tried to be funny, but came across as more annoying than anything else. That was only a few, though - the meaningful content of the book came through despite those flaws. <P>I recommend this book to any serious student or practitioner of OO design and implementation. I really mean "any," since even project-scarred veterans are likely to see some of their hard won knowledge set into clear text and into the context of other ideas.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after attending a conference and meeting Uncle Bob himself. If you ever have the chance to see Bob in living color (and remember to ask him why we see the colors we do) don't pass it up. In order to get the most out of this book you need to be open to his philosophy and have some experience. I say this, because I feel it's only after you can say to yourself "I know exactly what you're talking about", or in my case, "Geez, I'm guilty of that", that you understand the principles Bob is trying to get across and the applicability, or lack there-of, of patterns.<P>Bob does an excellent job of setting up the material and then showing an example (a believable one at that) of how to apply the concepts. For example, he will introduce a set of patterns and then provide a case study that applies those patterns. This book is not only useful for those new to the material, but the format is also very good to be used as a reference.<P>While his explanation of the different patterns is very good, I believe it's his principles and test-driven-development philosophy that are the real gems in this book. These are principles and practices that every developer should be familiar with. In fact, this is a great approach for junior developers so they can become disciplined. In a world where everyone seems to be an "Architect", I'm amazed at how many don't convey and don't practice similiar thoughts. If you can't open yourself up to the "model your idea up on a white-board, erase, code test case, code logic" mentality, then it will be very difficult to see the intuitiveness of Bob's writing. Bob has provided a job-aid to all of us and we'd be in a lot better shape as software professionals if we followed just a few of these principles.</span>

                    <span>This is really two books; one is on agile development. The other is on design pattern examples. Unfortunately, it fails to be really tremendous at either.<P>The agile development part lacks much of the pragmatism of more recently published books on agility, espousing principles quite nicely, but avoiding all of the tricky issues around larger teams, products where the architecture -- as well as the product itself -- is a deliverable, etc. <P>The design pattern examples were pretty reasonable, but there are already more comprehensive tomes available online for free. The examples provided were just large enough to obscure the reading of the patterns themsevles and inhibit browsing (unlike the GoF book, which treads that line quite nicely).</span>
