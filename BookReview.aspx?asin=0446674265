                    <span>I'm not a great conservationist although as a scientist giving talks at public forums and meeting with people professionally and socially I have to be reasonably effective. This is one of three books I purchased to brush up on my conversational skills. I must say this book is a sore disappointment and complete waste of time (never mind money). The book is full of tautologies such as liking people is a great plus, be comfortable in one's own skin, etc. The so-called "advice" in the book reduces the difficulties associated with making good conservation to equally (or more) difficult traits that, if you could easily solve, would transform you into a new person. One gets a strong sense that RoAne and her pals (she lists so many folks in the book, many of whom she interacted with at events where RoAne was a keynote speaker) are the modern equivalent of snake oil merchants, peddling books by padding them with misleading reviews. I have two more books to go, but my recommendation is never to buy a book written by this person again. Unless you can peruse it at an airport bookstore which is what I would typically do for self-help type books. Regrettably not in this instance.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite books.It is easy to read and teaches the reader what to say in every situation. I met Susan 15 years ago and frankly she is best networker I have ever met.
<br />Go out and buy this book today- it will help you in every social situation - and certainly help you in business as well.

                    <span>Thanks tothis great book by Susan Roane, I went from being shy and aloof to being assertive and amiable. I have more fun at parties and social activities. I always know what to say to everyone. before people avoided me because I appeared to be aloof. Shy people always seem that way, but in reality, just need a break.<p>Sue Roane even gives you tips on what to say at funerals. This is the kind of techniques that top CEO's use. A must for anyone in networking or has a social life. Which I presume includes everyone but the 1 star reviewers.</span>

                    <span>"What Do I Say Next" is a book filled with practical tips for improving conversational skills.  Although the book is not really designed for the super introvert, it will help typically shy folks to become better conversationalists.  It also provides much needed direction for the outgoing but rude.  Perhaps the best word to describe Susan Roane's approach is "balanced."<p>Unlike some books about conversation which are highly manipulative, this book is designed for both business and social conversation.  Its direction is useful for almost any situation.<p>The book is written casually.  Although it is not disorganized, its casual manner with numerous case studies (these are great stories illustrating specific points) means you can pick up a paragraph here or there and find a complete thought.<p>Much of the material in this volume sounds like common sense.  After many of Roane's suggestions, readers might think,  "Of course. That's obvious. Why didn't I already know that?"  She offers practical, down to earth, and realistic advice.<p>The author reinforces her main points with a helpful synopsis after each chapter.  For shy people, she encourages them with studies that show 75 per cent of good conversationalists consider themselves shy.  Her solution: use the "OAR" approach (Offer an observation, Ask a question, and Reveal your thoughts, ideas, or opinions).  But do not drive people crazy with a barrage of questions, she warns us.<p>It is this kind of sensibility and balance that makes this a useful book.  It is a practical self-improvement book, not a detailed analysis.  Good conversationalists will find a useful pointer or two, weak conversationalists will be overwhelmed with a wealth of advice (and will struggle as to what to do first).  Although I did not agree with the author on every point, I recommend this book heartily.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book provides lots of common sense tips which we easily forget during daily life, e.g. use 'and' instead of 'but' when disagreeing with people; ask 'how' instead of 'why' to make questions sound less demanding.<p>However, certain areas like the topic on cross-cultural communication, the auther seems to write only to fill the pages.  There is no real practical common or in-depth advices.  For someone who has been living in 3 continents and 5 countries in the past 26 years, this chapter is definitely very superficial.<p>Also, the book seems to start repeating itself half way through, and remedies are only offered only in areas that the author has some opinions.  For those she does not have too much to say or anhy clue, it is either skipped or non-value-added opinions were offered.<p>Other than the above mentioned, I do recommend the book, esp as either a 'refreshing course' or a 'crash course' in social skills.</span>
