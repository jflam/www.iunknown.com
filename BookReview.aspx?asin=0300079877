                    <span>This is a very useful, well researched, largely descriptive survey of how Western culture has viewed Jesus Christ. It's not a work of theology, it's not an inspirational work--it is what it is, interesting with its limitations. There's much that Pelikan faithfully records that's nonsense, such as Thomas Jefferson's breathtakingly vain and obtuse pronouncements about what Jesus really said. There are also some staggering transitions, such as the discussion on Emerson that suddenly veers into Dostoyevsky's The Grand Inquisitor from The Brothers Karamazov (the greatest novel ever). It's worth a read, particularly in paperback, but understand that it won't bring you much closer at all to an answer to Jesus's own question, Who do men say that I am?</span>

                    <span>This book was interesting and informational, but the prose is dry and academic.  I'm a regular non-fiction reader, including the fruits of academia.  I couldn't get into this.  I've been able to read only half.</span>

                    <span>The eighteen chapters of this book roughly correspond to the 20 centuries of the history of the catholic church.  One can use Pelikan's images to reflect on the meanings of Christ to the peoples of history and reflect on their meaning in present times.   The images Pelikan give are all applicable today and can be helpful in understanding our relationships to God now.  For example: how we as Christians can conduct a "just" war when we have an image of Jesus as "The Prince of Peace."  Or, how we can better understand the middle East peace process with our image of Jesus as our rabbi. Or, how we can approach our busy, packed lives using the image of Christ as the perfect monk. This is a useful book to persons with varied educational backgrounds in theology or with just a desire to be able to relate the historical Jesus to their every day lives.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Pelikan's book looks at how Jesus has been viewed over the last 2,000 years, beginning with Jesus the Rabbi during his lifetime in Galilee and Judea. The author chooses to devote each chapter to an aspect of Jesus' place within the culture of a specific period, so the discussion can be somewhat restrictive - for example, the overview of "just war" theory within Christianity is conducted only in the context of the medieval and Reformation eras and ignores the many later theological developments. It is, however, a rich and enjoyable work, tracing the evolution of how Jesus has been seen from Jewish rabbi to deity to liberator.</span>

                    <span>This is an unbelievable book.  Pelikan does a wonderful job of looking at Christ's changing face throughout the last 2000 years.  This book displays Christianity as it has been embedded in culture- dealing with issues such  as christianity and scholasticism, the crusades, etc.  Pelikan proves  himself truly a great intellectual.</span>
