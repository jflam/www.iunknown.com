                    <span>After 10 years absence of training I've started again 2000. My personal best on 10 000m is 31:30 (-87) and I'm now at a level of 39 min and I've set an ambition to decrease my time by 2min per 10K per year. <BR>During my "come-back" I sketched on a training program based on my previous experiences. But to get some external input to my training program I ordered Jack Daniel's "Daniel's Running Formula" and I found it very valuable. It explained things and I found especially the VDOT tables very usefult to base my training pace upon. I would like to say: -it's all about speed when it comes to training. Not as fast as possible, but the RIGHT speed. Jack Daniel's explain why and what the right speed is. <BR>After reading this book I can clearly say that I know *why* I should perform the particular intervall and at what speed, etc. <P>It all makes sence!<P>/Lars<BR>PS. I can also recommend "Road Racing for Serious Runners" by Pete Pfitzinger, Scott Douglas. DS.</span>

                    <span>Jack Daniels is recognized to be one of the world's leading authorities on distance training. This book encompasses the bulk of his wisdom, with a detailed approach to training for all races between 1500m and marathon distances. Daniels focuses on utilizing periodization training, with blocks of about 4 weeks dedicated specifically to repetition, threshold, interval, or aerobic training. The blocks are arranged according to your long-term season, resulting a very serious and demanding training program. <P>While extremely detailed and effective, Daniels' book is clearly oriented toward the serious runner with the ability to plan out his or her season and make regular visits to a track. Daniels provides specific workouts for each type of training (repetition, threshold, interval, or aerobic) and offers sample training programs for various distances. He devotes a good portion of Daniels' Running Formula to the physiological mechanisms of faster times, as well as racing, training conditions, taking time off, etc. <P>Ultimately, it is his extensive approach to periodized training that truly stands out. Complete with detailed explanations of each kind of training and effective workouts for serious runners, Daniels provides the kind of coaching that the elite use. Nevertheless, the specificity and dedication demanded by his training program is clearly oriented toward intermediate/advanced runners, and beginners would be at a loss with this otherwise exceptional book.</span>

                    <span>Coach Daniels presents a clear guide to training with stated reasons for each type of run that I have not seen else where. He definately has a good track record as a coach. He allows the reader to prepare running schedules with a definate purpose for each week and each run. Not as simplistic as most books on running. Highly recommended among running books.</span>

                    <span>It is amazing how many bad books on running are out there. This book is one of the better ones I have read. It defines various types of training speeds and their purposes. They are E(easy), T(Tempo), I(Interval) and R(Repetition). It goes on to tell you exactly how fast and how long to train at your current fitness level. The premise behind this is that you should try to get the most for your training, and you can do this by training at the correct intensity and duration. This is useful for training efficiently and preventing overtraining. Even casual runners like myself can benefit from this book.</span>

                    <span>My running library contains more than 20 books and I rate this one the best. It offers a truly scientific way of training. Each and every point is thoroughly explained. A book like this is an absolute delight for the thinking runner who not only wants to know what to do, but also why. The book is very practical too, as the instructions are distilled into just a few tables - all easy to use. You will learn Daniels' proven methods to improve endurance, lactate threshold, VO2Max and mechanical running speed. The real beauty of this book is that it can be used by elite runners and slow beginners alike; the tables accommodate all runners and tell us exactly what to do based on our recent race times. If I could choose only two books on running, it would be this one and The Lore of Running by Dr Tim Noakes.</span>
