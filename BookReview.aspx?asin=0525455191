                    <span>Just 5"X6" this charming little book, inspired by A.A. Milne, makes an excellent gift. It has delightful illustrations and lots of sage advice from the beloved dreary donkey.  Have a copy on hand for yourself to read on those days when you're feeling a bit sorry for yourself and are on the verge of becoming a whiner. It always makes me laugh at myself and there's nothing like a laugh to lift the gloom...but don't tell Eeyore. If you don't like this book just remember what Eeyore said, "Don't blame me."</span>

                    <span>...doesn't mean you're going to get any honey." That's kind of how I felt. This book, overall, wasn't quite as witty as I had anticipated. But then, don't the teachings of Eeyore the wise prepare us for such a  moment?:) There were a few very cute quotes, but most of it was fluff. The  art was most enjoyable, though, and I loved the book despite the fact that  it fell short of my expectations.   I wouldn't recommend Eeyore's (Gloomy)  Little Instruction Book to just anyone. But the artwork and the few really  good quotes, not to mention the beautiful binding and quality paper, make  this book the perfect gift for every Eeyore fan; indeed, their library will  not be complete without it!</span>

                    <span>If you love Eeyore you'll love the Eeyorisms in this Book. The pictures go along with every page of Eeyore Wisdom. I am sure anyone who buys this Book will treasure it--I Really recommend getting Eeyore's(Gloomy)Little  Instruction Book.</span>

                    <span>This small book makes an appropriate gift for anybody who appreciates a nice laugh while reflecting on life.  Each page takes you through some of the adversity and fortuity that Eeyore encountered in the A.A. Milne books.   Cute quote:  "When someone says `How-do-you-do,' just say that you  didn't."  It's remarkable regarding the optimism that comes from our  beloved little donkey.</span>
