                <span id="Label1">Established early in the last century as a memorial to O. Henry, throughout its history this annual collection has consistently offered a remarkable sampling of contemporary short stories. Each year, stories are chosen from large and small literary magazines, and a panel of distinguished writers is enlisted to award top prizes. The result is a superb collection of seventeen inventive, full-bodied stories representing the very best in American and Canadian fiction. And in celebration of this distinguished literary form, Prize Stories 2001 a Special Award for Continuing Achievement is presented to Alice Munro.<br><br>FIRST PRIZE<br>MARY SWAN<br><i>The Deep</i><br><br>SECOND PRIZE<br>DAN CHAON<br><i>Big Me</i><br><br>THIRD PRIZE<br>ALICE MUNRO<br><i>Floating Bridge</i><br><br>FRED G.

                    <span>The seventeen stories in this collection evidence that good writing in North America has not been forgotten. The story that I most enjoyed was David Schickler's enchanting "The Smoker" with its character evolvement and startling twist. The first prize winner, Mary Swan's "The Deep" holds magnificent writing that presents images that will remain with you for days. Stories of humor and fantasy are represented by Pinckney Benedict's "Zog-19: A Scientific Romance" and George Saunders's "Pastoralia". Alice Munro, T.C. Boyle, Joyce Carol Oates, Antonya Nelson, and Ron Carlson maintain their renown with their short fiction in this collection.</span>

                    <span>Unlike many volumes claiming to have the best short stories of the year, this one may actually be able to claim it. Of the 17 stories here, only three weren't very good (unfortunately the first prize my Mary Swan is one of those three). The rest were good, and there were three that stood out as phenomenal: T. Coraghessan Boyle's story of a young couple throwing their child away; Joyce Carol Oates's story of abduction, rape, and abuse; and David Schickler's story "The Smoker" which is so bizarre and so good that I will pick up his first collection of stories, which this one is included in. Most of the stories in this anthology are of a darker nature, but they are also very well written.</span>

                    <span>Since I live in NYC and most of my read time is on the subway, i prefer to read anthologies. This is the first in a long time that i have enjoyed all the stories for various reasons. Especially David Schickler's "the Smoker." (I was so engaged in this story, i ordered his current book). The stories in this book are well written with likeable characters. And there are also some surprises in store.</span>

                    <span>As usual, "Prize Stories" is full of gems and surprises. The use of a panel of judges helps to ensure variety, unlike other yearly short story anthologies. I found this year's edition disconscerting, however, as three of the stories were anything but short. They were novellas. Not that there is anything wrong with longer works of fiction, but it is a different style of writing and not what I was looking for when I forked over the money for this book. Granted, these three stories are excellent and deserving of notice, but not between the covers of a "short story" anthology.<P>In all fairness, I must admit that in the books introduction, the series editor, Larry Dark, discussess the inclusion of these stories. He claims that he has (I am paraphrasing) grown weary of short stories, having seen so many. My suggestion is that he find something else to do, then.<P>OK. That wasn't nice. Sorry, Mr. Dark. The truth is, ultimately, that he has once again managed to compile a collection of some of the greatest writing printed in North America in the past year. Most noteworthy, I thought, was Alice Munro's "Floating Bridge," which took third place. Ms. Munro was also given a well deserved special citation award for her work over the years. She has been included in "Prize Stories" on several occasions and usually places second or third.<P>Aside from the quality of her work, Ms. Munro caught my attention simply because she is so regular. However, it would take me all day to discuss each story because every story in this anthology is simply fantastic. Deciding which ones were best must have been an extremely frustrating experience. I highly recommend this book if you are a lover of short stories. Because of the length of some of these stories, the number of stories included in this volume has been reduced from 20 to 17. These are 17 of the best examples of short story (and novella) writing I have seen yet. Enjoy!</span>
