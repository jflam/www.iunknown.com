                <span id="Label1"><p>Edward Abbey called The Monkey Wrench Gang a "comic extravaganza," which it is, although one with a clear, serious message: to protect the American wilderness from the forces of commercial enterprise. The story centers on George Hayduke, an ex-Green Beret and Vietnam vet, who returns to the Southwestern desert after the war to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a whitewater rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with three others who share his indignation and want to do something about it: feminist saboteur and Bronx exile Bonnie Abzug, wilderness guide and outcast Mormon Seldom Seen Smith, and libertarian billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D. Together they venture off to become eco-raiders, waging war on the strip miners, clear-cutters, and the highway, dam, and bridge builders who are turning their natural habitat into a wasteland. The misadventures of this motley group make for an uproarious blend of chaos, conflict, and comedy.</p></span>

                    <span>I happen to live very near where this book is set and I enjoyed going out to these places and envisioning Hayduke, Doc, Abbzug, and Seldom Seen traipsing through the boulders and the scrub brush, tearing up bulldozers. Abbey brings the reader into the story well and keeps you there with rowdy chases and funny anecdotes from the slightly insane Hayduke.<P>More than that, he begins to make you care for his cause. Having seen the devastation in the desert by the Highway dept. and others, I can understand where the motive for the book comes from. Abbey speaks out the only way he knows how, through irreverence, humor, and a whole lot of craziness.<P>The writing style, while distinctly Abbey, put me off a bit. He starts off with a bang but it takes 100 pages before you really get into it again. His writing style is a little difficult to get through at times but the result is well worth it.<P>The book is a joy to read and fun. I recommend it to anyone who can step outside of their common sense for a while and just enjoy a good story with a worthwhile moral.</span>

                    <span>Don't trust any of the reviews that give either five or one stars. Most of the reviewers were judging the book on its political/ecological merit. _The Monkey Wrench Gang_ is an enjoyable novel, but a pretty mediocre one. Good points: Abbey is great with details and is brutally honest about sensitive topics such as the American Indians and the way modern industry treats the environment as commodity. The story alone will is compelling enough to keep you reading 'till the end. Bad Points: I haven't read any other of Abbey's work, but TMWG is badly written. Abbey's style is like that of an eager freshman-level creative writing class student. He beats us over the head with his pulpy prose. He could have made a great living as a "Penthouse Forum" writer. Also, he sucks at character development. His characters are, at best, two dimensional; and his attitude towards women gives me the uneasy feeling that at the time of writing THMG, Abbey hadn't been laid in a long, long time.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book. Edward Abbey was an amazing writer, and despite some tense shifts, he was stylistically incredible and very unique. I would recommend this book to anyone -- it's interesting environmentally, but also well-written.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading Monkey Wrench Gang for the second time. The first time, in college I didn't care for it, skipped through it, thought it was low grade schlock that wasn't worthy the effort of my philosophical, overly cerebral mind.<BR>Then 9 years of life happened and man, I now realize this is one of the best books ever written because it meets the two basic criteria:<BR>1) entertainment<BR>2) convey an idea<BR>I don't read as much anymore because frankly, the history channel and discovery channel are just as informative without putting me to sleep. But this book is paced to move and the characters are actually worth getting to know. Also, Abbey spends time on descriptions of a landscape as big as the sky but doesn't fuss with pages of set-up or description of inane, everyday things. His characters live in a world that moves and they move through it.<BR>And the message is there too. Abbey says you can be concerned about the environment, live on the land, and get the subtle vibe of Mother Earth without pooping in a PVC tube. People who like shlitz can have high ideals, pick-up trucks aren't meant to be washed (much), and people who are offended by Abbey's lack of PC protocol probably wouldn't survive in the environment he loved so much. And you gotta love the fact that the only female character in the book is the composite of a 13-year-old boy's female fantacy.</span>

                    <span>After reading "Fool's Progress", I began to become interested in Edward Abbey's other books. So I read "Monkey Wrench Gang", probably one of his better known ones, and I came away from it quite disappointed. Yes, I know it was the 70's, when it was written, but did we really need a stereotypical J.A.P feminist and a flat ex-Green Beret, who loves violence and to litter. The sentiments that the dam at Glen Canyon ruined the Colorado seem right, but that was the book's only strength. By the time I got to the end, I didn't care what happened to the characters, although I give it credit for not being a "hollywood" ending.</span>
