                <span id="Label1">In the tradition of <i>Iron and Silk</i> and <i>Bicycle Days</i>, comes the story of a young woman's self-discovery in a foreign land.  <br> <br>At the age of twenty-two, Jamie Zeppa, raised in a small Canadian town by her grandparents, engaged to be married, never having left the North American continent, decided to embark on one great adventure before settling down for a happy, if conventional, life. She sought a place at the outer reaches of the globe and the outer limits of her imagination and ended up in Bhutan, a tiny Buddhist kingdom closed to the West for centuries, an unspoiled land of Himalayan peaks and lush valleys.  <br> <br>Jamie Zeppa went to Bhutan as a teacher on a two-year Canadian government contract. During her early weeks of hardship and disorientation, this neophyte traveler was on the verge of packing it in. After a few weeks more, however, the country and its people worked their alchemy on her; she canceled her trip home for Christmas and requested an extension of her contract. In time, she broke off her engagement. After two years, she was not only in love with the country but also with a young Bhutanese man.  <br> <br>From the pristine, heart-crushing beauty of the landscape to the celebrations and sorrows of its people, Zeppa conjures and captures the true spirit of her unforgettable pilgrim experience. Stirring, poignant, funny, and full of joy, Beyond the Earth and the Sky is at once a classic tale of discovery and adventure, and a love story--between a woman and a country, a people, a man. </span>

                    <span>I purchased this book without knowing what it was going to be about, and it turned out to be one of the best books I've read. Since I know nothing about Bhutan, I found the author's descriptions fascinating and imaginative. Without knowing anything about the culture or the area, I found that I could picture both the landscape and the people of Bhutan. It is more of a personal story about a young woman's travel into an unfamiliar area and the challenges she faces along the way, in terms of her own cultural background, values, and beliefs, than a story about the Bhutan itself. <P>A friend of mine was in the Peace Corp and until about a year ago lived on a remote island in Micronesia. While I wrote to her often, it was hard for me to really understand what it would be like to live in a culture so different from one's own. Her correspondence revealed changing attitudes about the culture she was now a part of, her own cultural background, and the way she viewed herself. While reading this book, I felt I could better understand the feelings and attitudes my friend wrote to me about from Micronesia. I think this book would be very helpful for anyone with friends or family living or working in similar situations. I would think it would also interest people who are living overseas submersed in another culture.<P>As someone who has never lived or spent a great deal of time outside the United States, I felt that I could identify with the author. I appreciated her honesty and ability to convey her feelings and emotions, as well as effectively describe a place totally unfamiliar to me. I would suggest it to anyone!</span>

                    <span>This book is a remarkable tale of one person's courage to make a hard decision about dropping a conventional western life for a remote teaching position, and then having the fortitude to stick with it during the first couple of miserable months, despite coming very close a couple of times to giving it all up and returning to Canada. The author provides us with a very admirable snapshot of her feelings while she is going through all of this, and I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is considering moving to new surroundings or customs.<P>I originally read this book because I thought it would be more of a travel book about Bhutan, which is hard for foreigners to get into. The book does a reasonable job of providing a description of the terrain, landscape, people, culture, and climate. I also liked the descriptions of the political conflicts that are happening within Bhutan, and hearing about her students' voices about it.<P>But this book isn't just about Bhutan, it also has an ongoing theme about the author's relationship with her back-home boyfriend and new ones in Bhutan. I guess this was part of her personal story in her Bhutan experience, but I had trouble shifting back to that throughout the book, given the larger scope of the book: a western teacher in a hidden and remote country.<P>Overall, very good and recommended.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps I am influenced by a period of childhood spent in the Himalayas, but this book took me out of a life that is filled with stress and the feeling of never having done enough. Jamie Zeppa showed such love and appreciation for a culture so different to her own, and had the courage to go alone into this new world, where she had the sensitivity to understand rather than to criticize. she brought this world to me, and having been an immigrant myself I know how hard a new culture is. More people in this country should read it and understand about a different culture and the delight it can inspire.</span>

                    <span>I've never been to Bhutan and have no plans to go. A friend handed me the book as I left on a vacation. I could not put it down. It's beautifully written. Read it even if you're not about to leave for the Peace Corps.</span>

                    <span>This book is a terrific journey that is not only rich in detail, but in reality. Being a young girl from a Northern town, I found I could see myself being shocked by the differences in this simplistic, uncomplicated country. The way that Zeppa wrote this book it is both a love story with the country and a coming of age. Readers watch her grow into a more solid self sure woman as she finds her place in this wonderfully magic land. It was such a joy to read, it's easy to see that Zeppa enjoyed writing it.</span>
