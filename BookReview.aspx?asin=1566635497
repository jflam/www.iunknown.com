                    <span>In his second player diary, pitcher Jim Brosnan describes his day-to-day participation as a member of the pennant-winning 1961 Cincinnati Reds.  Brosnan writes with the same wit and amused irreverence he used two years earlier in his superb initial diary, THE LONG SEASON.  Here we get an insider's view of star teammates like Frank Robinson (that year's MVP), Vada Pinson, Jim Maloney, manager Fred Hutchinson, etc.  Readers will enjoy hearing about now-forgotten players in long-gone ballparks like Crosley Field, Shibe Park, Forbes Field, etc.  We also get the tension and thrill of a pennant race.  Unfortunately, the author omits spring training, and he ends the diary on the last day of the regular season, before the Reds played the Yankees in that year's World Series - thus I gave the book just four stars instead of five.   
<br />
<br />Brosnan was a college-educated player who gained recognition (and notoriety) for his writing.  PENNANT RACE is as readable and charming as its predecessor, and once again landed Brosnan in some hot water with baseball's establishment.

                    <span>Pennant Race and its companion book, The Long Season, are the best baseball books ever written. I enjoyed Ball Four, written ten yeras after The Long Season, but it is a pale imitation. Brosnan's style and  perspective are unique; his blend of candor and cynicisn unmatched; his  writing subtleties are brilliant. I have read hundreds of baseball books,  and these two, which I basically consider one volumne, are unequaled.</span>

                    <span>Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception:  right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it  affords the reader.  Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the  game of baseball is.<p>I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one  of my favorite books on any subject.<p>One note:  this is one of the only  baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author.  Brosnan had  no ghostwriter.</span>
