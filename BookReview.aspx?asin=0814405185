                    <span>As a former executive MBA student of Dr. Sherron Bienvenu, I know she brings an impressive background of knowledge and experience to the task of training great presenters. In her Trainer's Guide: The Presentation Skills Workshop, Dr. Bienvenu has delivered a comprehensive, yet very usable resource for the busy executive or manager. She asks the right questions and gets to the real issues without wasting time on academic rhetoric. Her real world training methods are focused and effective.<P>As Dr. Bienvenu states in her introduction, a great presenter must have both an appropriate skill level and personal confidence. The Presentation Skills Workshop can assist you in acquiring both. Dr. Bienvenu's book will truly help professionals develop and deliver great presentations. A "must own."</span>

                    <span>As a former student of Dr. Bienvenu's, I know that everything in this book is right on target for success in the real world. I took everything she taught me in school and use it in my career, and my presentations looked top-notch professional from the very first day. Now I'm using this book as a training guide--and as gifts for my colleagues.<BR>Dr. Bienvenu is direct and to the point, yet she leaves nothing out. As I read this book, I feel like she is still with me as my professional coach.</span>

                    <span>I work with a small group of engineers who give sales and technical presentations to a broad spectrum of audiences. Our customer and distribution base is global, therefore presentations span the gamut from live groups of 6 - 300 to internet webinars broadcast live the world. I prepared a small workshop for our group to enhance our presentation skills in delivering the content and constructing the visual aids with MS Powerpoint. <BR>I purchased seven books on the subject to prepare this workshop and "The Presentation Skills Workshop" is the only source that really provides a useful format to put together meaningful content quickly and easily. I was thrilled that I did not need to read 300 pages of text and then start from scratch to organize the content into the presentation for my group. I especially like the flexibility in constructing a half-day, full-day or comprehensive week long format.<BR>Thank you for a truly useful resource.</span>

                    <span>If you are going to be teaching a workshop on this subject for any but the most inexperienced group, look elsewhere. Although well-intentioned, this material will work only for a novice audience, one which has never given too much thought to presentations or meeting management. The "communications skill model" -- around which this book is based -- is self-evident and signals that the reader will be directing his or her workshop to an unsophisticated audience. Actually, I am not even sure this stuff will work for ANY audience. It is just too simplistic. You likely already know what is being presented here -- and that to my mind is not good news.</span>

                    <span>Bienvenu covers everything the presentation skills trainer needs from how to sell the training to management to exactly what to say in class. I had some experience presenting and training, but when I had to prepare a presentation workshop, this book saved my life! I got it right--with confidence! I recommend this book for trainer and presenters alike. Thanks for a great book!</span>
