                <span id="Label1">In 1999, Peter Jenkins and his family left their farm in Tennessee to live in Alaska for a few seasons, eventually renting a house in Seward, Alaska (pop. 2,830) on the Kenai Peninsula. The principal aim of the trip was for Jenkins to write a travelogue, but he also saw it as an opportunity to end a period of personal stagnation. It appears to have worked, for <I>Looking for Alaska</I> is filled with a vibrancy that can only come from one with a fully charged battery. Recognizing that "This giant place is filled with people determined to live as free as possible of others' intervention," he employed the same low-key approach to research that made his bestselling book <I>A Walk Across America</I> (1979) so engaging--he made friends wherever he went and allowed people to share their stories in their own way and in their own time. Part of Jenkins's charm is that he never pretends that he's figured the place out; he readily cops to his outsider status and invites readers to experience his sense of awe and surprise with him. During his 18-month stay in the Last Frontier, Jenkins spent time with wildlife rangers, recreation guides, native whalers, fishermen, and dogsled mushers, all of whom showed Jenkins and his family glimpses of their own private Alaska. (They also shared their bear stories; it seems nearly everyone in the state has had at least one run-in with the giant predator). "No one is ever the same after coming back from Alaska," he writes and after reading his book, it's easy to believe him. <I>--Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>Just as Peter Jenkins did in his "Walk Across Amercia", he has made one feel as if they had taken the journey with him. When I read his first two books, it seemed as if I had walked across America and knew all of the wonderful characters he told about. This time he has taken me on a journey, along with his family to the last frountier. I enjoyed learning about real Alaskans from all walks of life. Some natives, others were transplants, and they were all discribed in a way that made me feel that I now know them personally.<BR> I enjoyed most the areas of Alaska that I have never visited. The trip to Deering where the young Dean and Eric taught school in a village of 150 people and Cardova, the town on the Prince William Sound with no roads in or out, were among my favorites.<BR> I would recomend this book to anyone that enjoys Travel or Human Intrest stories.</span>

                    <span>If you've never read any of Peter Jenkins' books before, this would be a great place to start. Looking for Alaska is filled with the types of things you would expect from a book about Alaska--the bears, moose, glaciers, mountains, sled dogs, salmon, majestic scenery, whales--but this book is so much more than that. Like his previous books, this one is populated with remarkable stories of decent, hard-working people. Mr Jenkins has an extraordinary talent for revealing the heroic nature of ordinary people. These characters are familiar to most of us. We recognize our friends, our families, ourselves in them, and because they are cast in the positive light they deserve, we come away with a warm feeling. When so much of what we read and hear is focused on what's wrong with America (and with you and me by extension), it's nice to occassionally see someone concentrate on the positive. In keeping with his tradition, Mr Jenkins has illustrated Looking for Alaska with excellent color and black and white photographs, a practice that has become increasingly rare. Mr Jenkins' daughter, Rebekah, contributed a couple of segments that are downright poetic. I can't say enough about Looking for Alaska. I highly recommend it.</span>

His books keep your attention and put you right beside him in his daily activities and new surroundings.<BR>I envy him for his courage to expand his life so dramatically.<BR>Looking for Alaska, like all his other books, actually make you feel as if your in this wilderness and you can feel his every thought.

                    <span>While half-way through reading "Looking for Alaska", I was on my way there in the summer of 2003. This superbly written story made a major difference in how how I viewed everything about this fantastic place and the wonderful diversity of Alaska's people. Peter Jenkins masterfully weaves a very personal story of his travels and adventures throughout the vast reaches of the state. He shares the remarkable encounters with nature as well as many heartwarming stories of people from all walks of Alaskan life; from Hydaburg to Barrow and all across the trace of the fabled Iditarod. He brings it all to life in a compelling read that is informative to would be travelers coupled with some hair razing stories and spiced with humor in just the right spots. Jenkins continually highlights the unmatched beauty and spirit of our 50th State. As a Marine Officer I had the good fortune of seeing some amazing regions of this planet, but nothing has struck me like my brief experience in Alaska. Peter Jenkins captures it all in "Looking for Alaska". Throughout, he shares many encouraging lessons about following one's heart and not giving up on our dreams. Included are some wonderful passages regarding his family relatinships laced with heartwarming experiences with his daughter Rebeka during their travels. So taken by this book, I am now listening to the Audio version. An unforgetable read for old and young alike. Don't miss it.</span>

                    <span>Being close to Peter's age, I read his first two books soon after they were written and loved them. When I saw that he had written a book about Alaska, one of my dream destinations, I had to buy it. I decided that I would read this book before making any concrete Alaska travel plans. I've almost completed the book and have had a hard time putting it down. It truly fuels my desire to see the REAL Alaska. In fact, I just told my husband yesterday that we need to not only visit Alaska in the summer, as most everyone does, but in the winter also. Being the Florida sun-lover that he is, of course he thought I was crazy. But I would love to have taken the 1 1/2 year adventure that Peter took. He has a way of drawing you into his stories so that you feel you've been there, too. I was totally amazed and inspired by the grueling and dangerous lifestyle choices made by many of the individuals and families that Peter met. I recommend this book to anyone with a sense of adventure and desire to learn about life in wild places.</span>
