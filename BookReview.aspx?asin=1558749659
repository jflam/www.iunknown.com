                    <span>this book was very inspiring. The stories are all well written and ammussing. I haven't read any of the other books in the series and I don't plan on reading them either but I really enjoyed this one though and I recomend this book to all baseball fans</span>

                    <span>Chicken Soup For The Baseball Fan's Soul is one great book. The stories are about personal experiences, humor, sportsmanship, life lessons, and the fun that baseball provides. <P>Some of the stories are actually written by the athletes themselves with others by journalists who have covered the games with their views on the game and the players, and other stories by the everyday sports fan just like you and me. Some of the stories are very humorous while others touching. Before each chapter are very inspiring quotations. Added between some of the stories are baseball comics that will make you laugh. <P>Every story in this book is well worth-reading from the humorous to the serious stories. This book made tears swell in my eyes and laugh out loud in some stories as a baseball player. This book will inspire the true baseball player or fan. This book is easy to get into it and want to keep reading for a long time, but is also a great book to read one story at a time.<P>This book really shows how hard you have to work to get better at baseball or any sport and how it can pay off. This is a must-read book for any baseball fan who wants to enjoy a great book about a great sport.</span>
