                    <span>I am using the tape in my car to learn vocabulary and find the pronunciacion clear, and definitely useful as Nepali sounds are different enough from English that it is difficult to know how to read a word correctly. I like to learn many words, then phrases at the beginning of my study of a language, and this tape has been helpful, even in it's limited nature. 4 Stars because it is good - and accurate to it's title</span>

                    <span>I put this tape in my car stereo and listened to it about 100 times before my trip. When I got to Nepal I found that I had developed an "ear" for the sound of the language (a Nepali native speaker reads the words)but was pretty weak in vocabualry and grammar. As advertised, the phrases are oriented towards trekking-- hiring porters, asking directions, buying supplies, things like that-- so it's not quite the same vocabulary you need for social chit chat. However, in conjuntction with the vocabulary and grammar in the back of "Nepal Handbook" by Kerry Moran, I had a good foundation for very basic converstaions. Learning a little Nepali truly enhanced my trip since it made me stand out from the thousands of other tourists. I was glad I had taken the time to listen to this tape since it definitely helped me be able to pick up vocabulary faster once I was in Nepal, however, it's not quite sufficient to stand alone as the only source for learning the language.</span>

However, in conjunction with the vocabulary in the back of "The Nepal Handbook" by Kerry Moran, I had a good foundation for basic communication. I spent six weeks in Nepal and learning a little bit of language really made the trip a whole lot more fun even though you could get along fairly well there speaking only English.
