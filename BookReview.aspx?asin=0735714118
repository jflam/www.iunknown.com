                <span id="Label1"><P>This update is so important, because if there was ever a version of Photoshop that was aimed at digital photographers, Photoshop CS is it, and "The Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers" by Scott Kelby (Editor of Photoshop User magazine) once again breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers that's never been done before&#191;it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly "how to do it." It's not a bunch of theory; it doesn't challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure it out on your own. Instead, it shows you step by step the exact techniques used by today's cutting-edge digital photographers and retouchers, and it does something that virtually no other Photoshop book has ever done -- it tells you, flat-out, which settings to use, when to use them, and why. </P><P>If you're looking for one of those "tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter" books, this isn't it. You can grab any other Photoshop book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade that today's leading pros use to correct, edit, sharpen, retouch, and present their photos to some of the most demanding clients on the planet. You&#191;ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective they are&#191;once you know the secrets. </P><P>LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT Each year Scott trains thousands of professional photographers how to use Photoshop, and almost without exception they have the same questions and the same problems -- that's exactly what Scott covers in this book. You'll learn: <UL><LI>The secrets of how the pros retouch portraits </LI><LI>How to color correct any photo without breaking a sweat (you&#191;ll be amazed at how they do it!) </LI><LI>How to unlock the power of Photoshop CS' new features for digital photo pros </LI><LI>Amazing digital body-sculpting techniques</LI> <LI>How the pros use CS' File Browser (it's much more powerful than you think)</LI> <LI>Tricks that can send your productivity through the roof </LI><LI>The sharpening techniques the pros really use (there's an entire chapter just on this!) </LI><LI>How to deal with common digital camera image problems </LI><LI>Removing noise, avoiding halos, and protecting your images </LI><LI>How to use Match Color, The Color Replacement Tool, and other amazing CS tools. </LI><LI>Masking techniques for photographers</LI> <LI>The most-requested photographic special effects </LI> <LI>and much more! </LI> </UL>Photoshop CS is THE tool for digital photographers, and this book show you exactly how to put it's power to work for you today. </P></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I don't usually bother w/Amazon reviews but I read the two first comments and had to speak up. I teach a course on digital photography, I've been using the first version of this book (called "The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers") and it's the best book of it's kind I've ever seen. I'll upgrade to using this CS version as soon as the class begins covering CS. The "misrepresentation of content" reviewer seems confused or something--does he have the older version of this book?--because the copy I have clearly has "CS" all over the place: front cover, spine, back cover, all over the inside. I did notice that the image of the cover on the Amazon page is wrong, because the real cover is teal and white, not red and black like the first one was. Not sure what's up with that. At any rate, it's been my experience that once some people get to a certain advanced level of experience, they can be pretty choosy about exactly which details they want out of a book. All I can say is that for 95% of the rest of us, this book teaches digital photography through the lens of Photoshop better than any other. As for his writing style, I've seen Kelby give a seminar on Photoshop, and he writes like he talks... it's hard to fault him for that, and the 400 people in the room that day seemed to especially appreciate his informal teaching demeanor.<BR>Not to beat a dead horse, but the other review seems confused, as well, since both versions of Photoshop (Mac and PC) are identical and have been for some time. I teach using my Apple iBook and a projector, in a lab that uses Dell machines, and this has never been an issue. I mean, on page xvii in the front of the book, Kelby even addresses this, saying "the keyboard on a PC is slightly different from the keyboard on a Mac, so any time I give a keyboard shortcut in the book, I give both the PC and Mac keyboard shortcuts." What more do you want?<BR>As for some of the other snipes about workflow and weak examples, speak for yourself. I happen to agree with what Kelby writes most of the time, and when I don't, it's because at some level we eventually have our own opinions on best practices. Like Kelby writes in the introduction, this is a Photoshop book, not a digital photography book. Every photographer has their own ways of doing things, and this book doesn't try to preach about those issues. That's one of the reasons it's so good.<BR>Anyway, enough of the rant. This book is rock solid, the first two reviews seem more like confused nitpciking (with all due respect to the people who wrote them), and I'd recommend Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers in a heartbeat.</span>

                    <span>I just got this and am finding it very useful; it's full of practical and easy to follow tricks that I've wondered about for a while. <P>Well worth the price if you are serious about post processing. Scott has a dry quirky wit and it provides for interesting reading. He is also a master with CS and has collected many awesome tricks from a wide network of professionals.</span>

                    <span>Recently I read four of the books currently available for Photoshop CS . This book was one of them and it was the weakest in terms of both the style of writing and content.\\<P>The author points out that he wrote the book "because not one other book he reviewed covered digital noise". I do have to give him some credit here because digital noise is not addressed in most of the other books. The problem is this is the only issue that I found to be unique to this book.<P>Overall, I guess in an attempt to lighten up the subject you are subjected to endless silly little joking followed by very simplistic techniques for handling various digital imaging problems. <P>This book my actually be fine for a beginner or someone that does not want to really understand the subject. For me it was a dissapointment.</span>

                    <span>I had been playing around a little in Photoshop Elements for a few months and then took advantage of a GREAT upgrade price to Photoshop CS. I had read where others used CS and LOVED the curves feature and actions... all these things and while I was trying to figure out what made them great, I was not getting the professional results I wanted.<P>I opened this book and immediately did some incredible stuff in Photoshop CS and I am basically new to the program. He has a great writing style...does not bore you with the stuff that bogs you down in other books to the point you feel like you aren't getting anywhere. He gives you initial settings so you can see fast results then teaches you how to customize if you want to go there.<P>Just a great book!!!</span>
