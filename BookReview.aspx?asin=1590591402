                    <span>Excellent spiral approach to custom controls. This book hits
<br />the ground pushing best OO practices and use of the helper
<br />classes and methods from the API.  Examples build toward
<br />very professional code. Prose is lucid, clear and friendly.
<br />Flow is fluid and well paced. What more can you ask for?</span>

                    <span>Guzel bir kaynak. Bana degisik gelen bir yontemle konulari anlatiyor. Bu sayede bir derste birkac konuyu ogrenebildim. Dogrusu hos da oldu. Ornegin WebControl sinifindan miras almayi anlatirken aslinda Style sinifini anlatarak konuya baslamis. Degisik alternatiflerle Control ve WebControl siniflarini kiyaslamis ve denetim yazarken ne zaman hangisini miras alacagimizi da guzelce aciklamis. Bu benim icin biraz puslu bir nokta idi. Diger yandan sablonlu denetimler konusundan da basari ile cikmis. Sablonlu ve veri bagli denetimler benim icin tam bir karmasa idi. Bu konudaki MSDN makalesinin (RssFeed) hakkini da yememek lazim. Sonucta artik sablonlu ve veri bagli denetim yazabiliyorum, simdi tasarim zamani ile ilgili bolumlerdeyim. Bu kisma kadar bile olsa kendisini ispatladi. Kutuphanemde saygiyi hak eden bir yer edindi.</span>

                    <span>Server control in ASP.Net is not so much documented. Each "professional" book have only 1 or 2 chapter on client control and server control. Client server are easy to create but are not versatile like server control. In this book, the author's take time to explain every aspect to create rich and smooth server control with OOP in mind. They explain Event and Delegate like real teacher. Not like professional programmer!!
<br />Style, validation, client script and much much more are explain in detail. 
<br />But this book is not for beginner programmer. Intermediate programmer with some basic in ASP.Net and C#,Java, VB.Net or C++ will, with no problem be able to understand and appreciate this book.  
<br />
<br />Good reading. Take in mind that in 2005, we will have to read another ten to twelve books to understand Vs.2005!!!!
<br />For no more money in the pocket... </span>

                    <span>Very bad book. Deeply disapointed, because i didn't learn one singel peace of information. i started to read the book and very soon realised this is at least not for me. I think this book is for someone who already know anything about the subject. the book is confusing, i can't understand it, there is no order, to me is just a big bag of chaos. i'm about 4 years in computer world and i think that this book will be understod of someone who is 50 years in the bussiness. okey, not 50, say 10 years.<p>if you want to learn how to code ordinary and powerfull asp.net server controls this is definitly not the book. if you want to code server controls which composes of 4 hyperlinks! and if you want to get bored to death and if you want to hear a bit of philosofy lessons and if you want to get frustrated this is definitly book for you!<br>what a waste of money..<br>This book will be useful if you already know everything about the subject and you want to hear somebody elses point of view on the subject and get what is going on behing the scenes of the subject you have been working with in months and years.<br>And also, why does this book have 800 pages, it's comletely overkill, i scanned every chapter and underchapter and it's always the same. if you, i don't know, look in the chapter 7 e.g and chapter 2 or 3 you ask your self 'what's the difference?'..<br>Maybe i'm wrong but this is precisely the way i experienced the book..i red the first and bit of next chapter and rest of the book i have just scanned but i pretty sure about what i'm talking about.<p>sincerely<br>anonymous</span>

                    <span>I really like this book.  Chapters 1-3 are rudimentary in that they explain the different types of server controls (html controls vs. web controls, and user controls vs. custom controls).  Towards the end of chapter 3, however, you get into the real work that pays dividends. You create a custom web control that inherits from System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox.  Great stuff!  Then the authors provide a quick overview of design-time attributes since these are found in the automatically generated code when creating a new web control library.<p>The remaining chapters, 4-14, are progressively more advanced and discuss custom control state management, adding events to your controls, data binding, mobile controls, validation, and design-time support (among other topics). You gradually learn how to create very sophisticated custom controls that reduce your need for any 3rd party components.  This book is simply a must for anyone serious about leveraging the power of inheritance to implement very useful - and ultimately time-saving - custom controls.<p>The authors also explain concepts in a clear, straightforward manner and assume little regarding the reader's knowledge of controls.  Rob told me in person that he put a lot of effort into this book, and his hard work is evident by the quality of what's written in Building ASP.NET Server Controls.  Buy it today and watch your code benefit from it.</span>
