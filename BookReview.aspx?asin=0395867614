                    <span>The Battle of Gettysburg was one of the, if not THE turning point of the American Civil War. Fought in the span of 2 days in a small town in Pennsylvania, the battle was the climax of 2 years of relentless & bloody struggles in the Eastern Campaign of the conflict. General Robert E. Lee's huge & decisive gamble to bring the war to Northern soil for the second time culminated in a clash which determined the course of the war & American history forever.
<br />                             
<br />Stephen W. Sears, author of several acclaimed works on the Civil War, brings his writing talents to the page once again in this riveting page-turner. He narrates with verve & clarity the numerous events which led to the great campaign, the complexities involved, & the battle itself, leading to it's aftermath. He shows how the war-addled South needed to adopt a different strategy to alter the course of the war, despite it's shattering but inconclusive victories to that point, the reason which prompted Lee to move North, hoping to assuage the burden of Southern farmers off the war while relying on gaining European recognition with a victory on Northern soil. He contrasts the shambles that the Southern high command had turned into after the death of "Stonewall" Jackson, with the efficient coordination of Union leadership. He seamlessly blends the strategic & tactical events with soldier's & civilian's narratives, giving a fine overview of the entire conflict. Instead of the usual smattering of numerous photos that frequent many books of this era, the volume contains more sketches by soldiers who were involved in the battle, & a few from civilian eyewitnesses, giving the work a warm, charming, & authentic feel. Good maps help the reader follow the course of units & the battle.
<br />
<br />There is a Northern bias in the text, which the author manages to balance to a respectable degree. The maps are good, but could have been better in being more comprehensive, as several places mentioned in the text are not included in the maps, making it impossible for the reader to follow track-by-track the sequence of events.
<br />                           
<br />Published in the 140th anniversary of the battle, "Gettysburg" is a worthy tribute & an addition to the huge canon of work that this period justly deserves. A stellar & very well-written tome that serves as a good introduction & overall coercive read, "Gettysburg" shows, in this current time of hostility, that sacrifices & triumphs of great men in history serve as an inspiration to us to transcend the mistakes of the past for the maturity & betterment of the future.</span>

                    <span>I have been a Civil War "buff" since I was in middle school, but never really got into studying Gettysburg.  I've read a couple books on the subject, but never found it all that compelling.  Sears' book is different.  While I am still not a person that will read every little detail about Gettysburg, this book really opened my eyes to the importance of the individual soldier at the battle, the importance of one move of a brigade by a general.  Sears writes in a way that makes you feel as if you are right there.  Unlike some other history works, it is an entertaining, and yet still informative, read.  
<br />
<br />Something else I enjoyed about this book was Sears was not afraid to give his opinion.  Now, this is true of most historians, but Sears was actually willing to criticize anyone and everyone, not just popular targets like Dan Sickles.  Sears pointed out mistakes by R.E. Lee, James Longstreet, O.O. Howard, A.P. Hill, and others.  Sears also did a good job of giving credit where credit was due, but it did not come off as idol worship.  Often times, historians go out of their way to sing the praises of certain generals, especially at Gettysburg, but Sears does not do this.  He writes up the battle as it occurred and points out the good and the bad, but never dwells on it or lets it detract from the overall picture.
<br />
<br />In closing, this book is certainly a good introduction to the battle.  It is highly detailed, but is still a good read and moves along.  I am a fairly slow reader, but even I got through this pretty quickly because it really is a page turner.  It also features some helpful maps which I often relied upon.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book ever written on the battle of Gettysburg.  The only book that is close is Trudeau's more organized book on the battle.  But, what this book lacks in organization, it more than makes up in human interest stories and in just plain generating interest level in the story.  Sears is a good writer, a somewhat poetic and passionate writer.  Examples are: the best chapter title of: "A Simile of Hell Broke Lose", the numerous positive names for Hancock, emphasizing his great leadership and his presence.  (Yes, as one critic mentions, Sears is biased but towards the better Generals and leaders).  The human interest stories are there: like the deaths of three brothers named Thomas in a South Carolina regiment in the Wheatfield, the two men from a Pennsylvania regiment who won the medal of honor because they carried their comrade to safety (who later died), and the deaths of Weed and Hazlett who were close prior to the battle and died next to each other.  The prose is very powerful, poetic, and leads you to want to continue with the story.  Also, the details are covered like Trudeau but in a less organized way (who can beat chapters and maps based upon time of day for organization).  The story is down to the regiment level and chronicled based upon the right timing and location but not in as structured a way.  Consequently, I found myself drawn into a story.  And, what a story it is.  Sears tells with feeling and beautiful, poetic prose.  When Sears book first showed on the market, I had just finished Trudeau, and thought, this can not be better.  But, it is.  A well written book for a most important event in our history.</span>

                    <span>The contemporary Civil War historian is truly limited with respect to new revalations concerning most of the major struggles...it becomes the author's challenge then to present a fresh perspective while covering the "same old ground". The 1863 battle at Gettysburg meets or exceeds this challenge...no other ACW struggle has been covered as completely or as comprehensively as Gettysburg. So why does the renowned Stephen Sears offer us another one volume narrative on something that has been covered completely before? It's because Sears can WRITE and he surely realizes (and thus the general reading public must also realize) that under his talented pen, he can still offer much to the literary cache that is Gettysburg and provide a useful and meaningful new study for modern readers.
<br />
<br />Sears's approach is refreshing in that he does not try for revisionist history...he uses his abundant talents to tell the story honestly and comprehensively and in the process, he gives yet another keen perspective to this battle that should be read by all ACW and Gettysburg readers. Starting with R.E. Lee's decision to invade the North in light of his recent victory at Chancellorsville (another excellent Sears study by the way...) and the seemingly imminent Confederate defeat at Vicksburg, Sears recounts the details and tactics that led to the battles at Brandy Station and Winchester and the invasion details that almost led to the Confederate taking of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Sears gives a clear account of these sometime complex manueuvers and expertly sets the stage for the ensuing three days battle.
<br />
<br />Troop movement and high level military strategy abound as the battle begins on July 1st...beginning with judicious biographies of the key 1st day players (John Buford, John Reynolds, Henry Heth and Richard Ewell...), Sears lays out the results and discusses the "might have beens" had certain key elements moved differently. The Federal attainment of the high ground south of town clearly gives the Union the advantage and Sears shows how all parties more or less come to this same conclusion. The second day struggles are shown to be an offspring to the strong disagreement in the Sr. level of the Confederate leadership as James Longstreet and Lee vehemently disagree on that day's battle strategy...Longstreet proves to be right, of course, and this assertion no doubt enhanced his career as far as history is concerned. Sears maintains that had Longstreet's plan been enacted, this would have been a very different battle. Regardless, Sears is deft at descrbing the action that actually took place as he gives glowing accounts of the battle action at the Rose Farm (and villifies Dan Sickles in the process), the Wheatfield, Devils Den and of course Little Round Top where any Joshua Chamberlain fan will be impressed with Sears coverage. The expert analysis is continued with the third day events as Pickett's Charge is described in as clear and concise terms as I've ever read. The two day struggles for Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill are interspersed with this main line action and Sears completes his impressive work with the cavalry action both at the beginning and the end of the main fighting. Finally, the Confederate retreat back to Virginia and the inevitable explanations for the Union (George Meade) in-action at pursuit are given a fresh look and Sears's discussion puts a different and (in my opinion) more realistic spin on this important period post battle.
<br />
<br />So given the rich amount of available works on the battle at Gettysburg, why would anyone want to buy this new one? Again, Stephen Sears is an expert writer, historian and researcher and when someone like this publishes a full-length study of such an important period in American history, it's almost the history reader's duty to indulge...my point here is that if readers take this approach, they will not be disappointed.

                    <span>Stephen W. Sears continues to hold his position as one of the most readable of ACW authors.  Able to inform and entertain at the same time, Sears catches the reader and never lets go.  Some will question the need for "another" book on Gettysburg.  Others will point out that this could be considered a rewrite of Coddington's work.  I have not tired of Gettysburg books nor of Sears' work.
<br />
<br />This is an excellent book.  Those that say nothing can be done with Gettysburg need to read this, Sears proves them wrong.  He bring a very fresh and intellgent view to the Lee/Longstreet confrontation of the Second.
<br />
<br />If you enjoy reading about Gettysburg and want a new book on the campaign, this is the one!  </span>
