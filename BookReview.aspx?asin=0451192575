                <span id="Label1">In <I>Donnie Brasco</I>, FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone tells the story of working so deep undercover in the Mafia that the truth of his identity became blurry even for him. For six years, Pistone posed as jewel thief Donnie Brasco in order to pull off one of the most audacious sting operations ever.  Because any small detail could blow his cover, Pistone adjusted his personality and habits to earn the trust of Mafia soldiers, connected guys, captains, and godfathers. He was so successful that many FBI surveillance teams assumed that he was yet another Mafia guy. This memoir paints a vivid portrait of the underworld of wise guys by revealing their code of honor, their treacherous dealings, their relationships with their wives and mistresses, and their lavish money habits. The suspense in Pistone's story builds as he unfurls his experience of life on the edge of good and evil and on the verge of death.</span>

                    <span>Before you run out and spend $3 bucks to rent the movie from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video, read this book. It starts off simple enough: an agent sent to infiltrate the Mafia in NY/NJ area in the late 70s. But "Donnie Brasco" is a much more complex novel than some man faking his identity. Joseph Pistone (Donnie Brasco) was forced to use his street wits, common sense, and just plain luck against ruthless killers, thieves, crooks, addicts, and other general degenerates. Pistone was forced to abandon his family (wife and children) for months on end, and be on assignment for the FBI. He made friendships and forged alliances, posing as jewel thief Donnie Brasco in order to ingratiate himself into the inner workings of the Mafia. Brasco became so close to many members of Bonnano families and their wiseguys, that when it came out that Brasco was an FBI agent posing as a wiseguy, many were in disbelief. One Bonnano affiliate in particular, Sonny Black, was fond of Brasco and thought of him as a son. He allegedly said that he had no ill feelings toward Brasco, because he was just doing his job. (Months later, Sonny Black was found murdered in a trunk. His hands had been cut off--a symbol that Mob security had been violated.) Pistone takes the time to explain in such a way without sounding boring or grating. He explains the slang, the situation, the characters as if you were there standing over his shoulder. This has to be one of the best Mafia books out there. Don't sleep on this one.</span>

                    <span>Donnie Brasco must have ice water in his veins to pull off some- thing like this;he is a step away from becoming a "made-man", but the only thing holding him back is his career, F.B.I. deepcover agent! He actually made certain members in the mob have bowel movements once they announced who he really is. What the movie fails to tell you is that although he and Lefty Two-Guns Ruggiero are friends, but after Carmine"Lilo"Galante gets whacked then they whack out Sonny Red Idelicato which puts the Bonanno crime family under Sonny Black Napalitano as the street boss while the real boss Philip Rastelli is in prison. He actually shares an apartment with this Sonny Black, that is how good this Pistone is I mean, he really started the Mafia decline, and the Bonanno's happened to be the first. Again, you learn more about each of the characters;Pacino's portrayal as Lefty, made me literally sick & I don't know who happened to be the casting director of the film but if you read this book before you happened to see the movie, they should be fired, c'mon Pacino as a chump,washed up father of a junkie son, whose only respect he gets is from "Don the Jewler" . I know some people who rather see the movie first then read the book in order to get a more in depth, better understanding of the film, well in this case, you were probably more confused than at the begining! Again I say reading is much better than seeing a movie, in that order, this is my perfect example of my theory.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book and it was worth it. I love non-fiction, and this is a great true story of an FBI agent who successfully infiltrated the Mob for 6 years in the late 1970s to early 1980s. Joseph Pistone aka Donnie Brasco, took his time, and slowly but surely, got to know characters in organized crime and moved up in the hierarchy. He had some close calls along the way, and it amazes me that he never got whacked (mob term). Pistone even took the mobsters on a nice boat ride on a boat owned by the FBI - his partner Lefty later found out about the boat - and yet Pistone/Brasco was able to talk his way out of it! Amazing. This guy was so quick on his feet. Talk about guts - this guy was something else. But also, Lefty and Sonny Black, another mobster, really liked Donnie Brasco. Reading this book showed me that being well liked by at least two influential mobsters could go a long way to save you from being whacked.<P>Even though I know what these guys were, thieves, liars, killers, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Sonny when he tells Donnie Brasco how much he trusts him - trust him more than anyone in his crew - how much he liked him. The reader knows Brasco is the last person Sonny can trust. Maybe I shouldn't care, but if you really trust and like someone, it hurts so much to be betrayed. And Sonny, who Pistone/Brasco really liked in spite of everything, doesn't have a pretty ending.<P>As a woman, I couldn't help but notice that Pistone never talks about women he saw or dated. In reality, he was married with children, but he was pretending to be a swinging bachelor. Lefty even accused him of wanting to lie on a beach and be a playboy. Hello! Playboy - that's a red flag word if I ever heard it. From what I can see of him in pictures, he was not a bad looking man, but from his book, you would think the mobsters never saw him (except here and there at first) with another woman. He would just say he was going to New Jersey to see his girl. I can understand keeping anything about other women out of the book since he was/is a married man, and his wife read this book I'm sure. But do I think he went six years without getting involved with another woman - and Lefty calls him a playboy? Oh well, if he pretended to be a mobster, I guess he could just pretend to be a playboy.</span>

                    <span>In this gripping read, Joe Pistone's story reminds us that there are still true heroes in our society, and that he is one of them. In the past two and a half years, the FBI has come under unrelenting scrutiny, mostly concerning the 9/11 attacks (with everyone looking to blame solely the big bad FBI). While there is no doubt that there are some structural problems that need the be resolved, I feel that the Bureau has been unfairly portrayed as a completely corrupt and ineffectual organization. Donnie Brasco reminds us that these people are, for the most part, true heroes, who only took on this dangerous job having the best interests of the country at heart. Not to mention this is an amazingly entertaining and fasciniating read, a wonderful foray into the life of an undercover agent. It also effectively destroys any notion that the mob is glamorous, revealing the mob for what they really are: greedy, pathetic losers. I was constantly amazed by Mr. Pistone's wit, courage, and fast-thinking in the face of emergencies. A must-read for anyone and everyone interested in the Mafia, the world of undercover agents, or simply the story of a hero. 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>This book is valuable because it does not glorify those who engage in organized crime. Unlike the Godfather series and, to lesser extent, The Sopranos, Donnie Brasco paints these people for what they really are: criminals, hoods, bums, evil people. And, for the most part, dumber than a red brick. <P>A great story, enjoyable tale, terrific reading. Just don't go out and whack anybody afterward!</span>
