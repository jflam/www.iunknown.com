                <span id="Label1">The HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. All web programmers, administrators,  and application developers need to be familiar with the ins  and outs of HTTP in order to work effectively.  The <i>HTTP Pocket Reference</i> not only provides a solid conceptual foundation of HTTP, it also serves as a quick reference to  each of the headers and status codes that comprise an HTTP transaction. Most people use the Web every day without  knowing anything about HTTP, but for those who need to get  "beyond the browser," this book is the place to start.</span>

                    <span>This is a nearly perfect book both for learning HTTP and for an HTTP reference. HTTP is a small, simple protocol, and this is reflected in this book's small size. Great sequence diagrams illustrate the basic HTTP transaction which is detailed in less than ten small pages. And you will probably soon find yourself with several post-it bookmarks or dog-eared pages.<P>The book could use an explanation of HTTP proxies and gateways and a list of common user-agents. But any more and it would be too long.</span>

                    <span>If you develop your own web applications then this book is invaluable! You don't realise that you need it until you know what's in it. An overview of HTTP headers, client methods and server response codes along with URL character and media type tables makes for a great pocket reference!<P>The O'Reilly pocket references are so concise that they are not really meant for someone who is totally new to the subject. They can however be the ideal way to provide an overview to anyone who wants to know the basics of the topic.</span>

                    <span>The praise of other reviewers is well met. Overall, this is a very good book and every CGI programmer and anyone else doing Internet programming should buy it.<P>My only complaint is that it doesn't group information based on servers and is missing some server-specific items that are important, although they are not part of the Spec.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the smallest and shortest book I have probably read since first grade. I did not realize it, at the time of ordering, that this is actually a miniature book. It actually does fit in your pocket. <P>The HTTP specification is relatively small and simple. This book covers it all. I was able to complete it in two hours. It was refreshing to have such a brief and concise reference available. This book certainly did not fall into the trap of elaborating to the point of irrelevance. I fully recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I bought two books on HTTP. This one and a very forgetable doorstop of a book. This was by far my favorite. It is only about 70 pages or so, but contains everything I need. I wish I could say this about every book I buy.<P>If you are planning to work with Java Servlets or CGI, you should get this book.</span>
