                <span id="Label1">In her international best sellers, PRINCESS and PRINCESS SULTANA'S DAUGHTERS, Jean Sasson vividly depicted the harsh restrictions endured by Saudi women. These books described the lives of women who live in a society where they have few rights, little control over their own lives or bodies, and have no choice but to endure the atrocities perpetrated against them.   <P>Now, in response to readers' tremendous outpouring of interest and affection for Sultana, as well as her works on behalf of oppressed women, Jean Sasson and the Princess continue to expose the outrageous human rights abuses suffered by women in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  <P>When Sultana's niece is forced into an arranged marriage with a cruel, depraved older man, and a royal cousin in revealed as keeping a harem of sex slaves, Sultana's attempts at intervention in their various plights are thwarted. But when her nephews are caught committing an unspeakable act against a 12-year-old girl, Sultana is galvanized into action. Risking her personal status and wealth, she takes a stand against the complacency of her male relatives over the child' fate. Ultimately, Sultana and her siters vow to form a circle of support that will surround and shelter abused women and girls.  <P>As with PRINCESS and PRINCESS SULTANA'S DAUGHTERS, the reader is compelled to read just one more page, one more chapter, once they begin reading PRINCESS SULTANA'S CIRCLE.</span>

                    <span>I ran across this book while living in the Middle East. Always facinated by the secret life of Saudi women, I eagerly devoured the book. Jean Sasson was given privy to the inside life of Princess Sultana and what she faced on a daily basis. The princess comes off as a woman who strives for justice and equality for her countrywomen but is silenced by the harsh rules set forth by the men. She tells many heart breaking stories of brutality by the men, including rape and physical abuse but of course they are not punished. She is completely powerless unless she manipulates males including her husband to get her way. On the other hand, she speaks of such wealth in the families and their extravangant lifestyles which include many vacations in their various homes and of shopping sprees that only one can dream of! in the end, all the money in the world cannot buy freedom and peace of mind.</span>

                    <span>I found this third book in the Princess Trilogy to be even more riveting than the first two. Again, Jean Sasson is able to tell not only the story of an incredibly wealthy yet enslaved royal princess, but to weave into her factual, historical account the atrocities committed against other women throughout Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Princess Sultana's Circle also nicely wraps up the three stages of life of this bold and courageous princess. We've already been introduced to her youth and young adulthood. This time we get a much more reflective look at her life as a mature adult and how she continues to cope with a lesser degree of conferred human dignity, but the resolve to fight on.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very shallow. Princess Sultana's circle is an overindulged group of royal females who recognize the Arab woman as abused and degraded. They consider themselves helpless in saving their fellow woman in a nation driven by the superior male. She travels in private jets to different countries, spends $328,000.00 at a time at Bergdorf Goodman's in New York, and sucumms to alcholism. Her heroic feat was to stop a rape, and take the vicitim to a doctor. Princess Sultana has alot more work to do before she should consider herself a hero.</span>

                    <span>This last book of Jean Sasson's is every bit as fascinating as the first two. I only wish that Jean Sasson and Princess Sultana would continue to collaborate and produce their writings on a more frequent basis. Just when I think I have an understanding of the Saudi Arabian culture, Princess Sultana gives us even more of an eye opener. Amazing detail, with sometimes subtle humor. Not to mention sometimes very disturbing examples of cruelty to women.</span>

                    <span>My first impression from this writing is that it is more of a fiction than a reality. As there are many parts of this story that seem contradictory and do not make sense. Whether this text is fiction or fantasy is debatable; but what is certain is the known truth of the utter disregard and violations of women's rights in the Middle East. From having met and spoken with a few friends the confessions are much the same; their subjection to being a secondary class citizens. In many cases animals have more rights than the women there; the preceding statement may sound very insensitive; for which I apologize. It is something that we should expect from a closed society where all issues are buried in the hearts of people. On the whole I found it an entertaining read as it opens ones eyes to the conditions faced there.</span>
