                    <span>Of all the Founders, John Adams is simultaneously one of the most enjoyable and the crankiest. He liked virtually nothing that was taking place in the political scene of his day, and he would certainly have disapproved of nearly everything taking place today. For instance, though he is considered a conservative, he would rail and rant against those on the Religious Right who want to claim that God especially favors the United States (he felt the notion of any Divine Favor on the US was an utter delusion). He would be outraged by the increased role that the economic elite play in today's political process, while at the same time rushing forth to point out that he had predicted its inevitability. He would further be outraged that the president, the part of the government he placed what little hope he had for a more democratic form of government, was not only refusing to fight the economic elite, but fighting for an expansion of its privileges. On the other hand, Adams might take some solace in the end of slavery. But on the whole, he would point out all the ways that the selfish passions of human beings had intruded into American political life. 
<br />
<br />Joseph Ellis, who is the finest popular historian of the Founding Generation currently at work, wrote this exceptional character sketch of John Adams several years before his similar sketch of Jefferson, his group portrait FOUNDING BROTHERS, or his excellent biography of Washington, HIS EXCELLANCY. If one has read FOUNDING BROTHERS, one knows that Adams is possibly Ellis's favorite of the founders. All of the other major Founders remind us more of statues, he points out, than real live flesh and blood human beings. One never makes that mistake with Adams. He is all flesh and blood and more than a little vitriol. Though arguably the most intellectual of the Founders (though Franklin was a practical genius, he wasn't nearly as literate as Adams; in fact, Adams's closest competitor, as in so many things, is Jefferson), he was a man of intense and always expressed passion. He could summon his formidable powers of reason, but only in a cause that inflamed his emotions. 
<br />
<br />Ellis does a great job for the most part of exploring Adams's fascinating character. He is guilty, in my opinion, of minimizing Adams quirks. For instance, Adams was incredibly grudging in any praise of Benjamin Franklin, veing one of the very few people of his age not impressed by the Sage of Philadelphia. Ellis hints at this, but doesn't dweel on it, but the almost pathological need that Adams possessed to denigrate Franklin and others is a major clue to his personality. Ellis dwells more on Adams need to elevate his contribution to the Revolution, or at least to make sure that his very real contributions were not forgotten or underestimated, as they most assuredly have been for most of the past two hundred years. 
<br />
<br />Ellis also does a good job of showing Adams's importance as a political thinker (though I would recommend even more highly John Patrick Diggins's short biography of Adams in this regard--Ellis is more of an historian, while Diggins is a political theorist, and is stronger in this regard). Adams is one of the great political critics in American history, though it is not often appeciated that he was, as so many other political thinkers are (one thinks of Marx or Nietzsche in this regard) better on attack than in contructing. Adams offers a host of trenchant and accurate analyses of the underlying dangers to democracy or any form of government, but despite his wealth of insight offers virtually nothing tempting in the place of what he criticizes. He was brilliant at seeing how things shouldn't be, but a bit vague on how things ought to be. Ellis mentioned but doesn't make graphic just how awful Adams is as a writer. I own and have struggled to read the collection THE POLITICAL WRITINGS OF JOHN ADAMS, edited by George W. Carey. Though I have read Hegel and Spinoza and Heidegger, I found much of this much, much harder going. Adams is frequently a terrifically uninteresting writer. He can lace monumentally dull and impenetrable material with passages laced with terrific insight. All this changes, however, when you turn to the Jefferson-Adams correspondence. Here he comes alive. Ellis does a good job of bringing this out. 
<br />
<br />Ellis makes the mistake, as so many do, of characterizing Adams as a conservative. Given the fact that he would detest virtually every aspect of conservatism today I find this characterization to be incomprehensible. I think he was a conservative by accident. Had the predominant trend of the day been conservative rather than Jeffersonian, I think we would have seen an impassioned Adams rising against what he perceived as the many mistakes of the conservative cause. I honestly don't believe that any government, conservative or liberal, radical or revolutionary, would have contented Adams. I've seen Thoreau characterized as a coyote, too wild for civilized life, destined to howl on the edges of society. I think that fits Adams as well. 
<br />
<br />I thoroughly recommend this biographical sketch (for it is not a true biography) by Ellis, though I would hasten to add that I perhaps like Diggins even briefer book a bit more. Though Adams was neglected for most of the period since his death, these days he has regained much of his deserved stature. Anyone not familiar with him needs to be. Next to Franklin he is probably the most likable of the Founders, and none of them anticipated the dangers facing our republic better than he.</span>

                    <span>Joseph Ellis does an excellent job at giving life to the internal mechanisms that were at work inside of John Adams as he formed his political opinions.  Focusing almost exclusively on the retirement years of Adams and his writings from his home in Quincy, Ellis makes sense of a man that hated the mythical makings of the Revolutionary generation and yet desired for his own name to be admitted to the pantheon that George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were already sharing.  The only shortcoming is that Ellis hasn't quite worked out the fluidity of the language as he has with more recent works (i.e. Founding Brothers) In spite of the occasionally dry wording this is still a good place to start for someone interested in this intriguing character.</span>

                    <span>I thought the energy, mischevious wit and intellectual excitement of Adam's mind was wonderfully brought to life with this book. Though not an A to Z life story - it generally focuses on his later life - it still manages to give you a sense of the whole man and the challenges of his times. I wish Ellis would have written a more comprehensive life story, perhaps he will yet.</span>

                    <span>When John Adams began to compile notes for an autobiography, he prefaced his material with a warning to posterity: "[T]here is no reason to expect that any sketches I may leave of my own Times [will] be received by the Public with any favour, or read by individuals with much interest" (61).<br>         Adams wrote more out of a typical self-effacement than modesty, but his prediction has proved accurate.  Succeeding generations of Americans have paid relatively little attention to this cantankerous Founding Father.  Compared to some of his contemporaries, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, Adams has enjoyed only small bursts of notoriety.<br>         In his new work, Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams, historian Joseph J. Ellis explores why Adams "remains the most misconstrued and unappreciated `great man' in American history" (12).  In his work, Ellis explores the last twenty-five years of Adams's life, spanning from the time he left the White House to the day of his death on July 4, 1826.  According to Ellis, it was in this final period that Adams, free from political and social restraints, was able to express fully his personality and reveal his deepest thoughts.  It was also during this time that Adams himself began to analyze and comment upon his own role in the American Revolution and the establishment of the United States government. <br>         Readers should bear in mind that Ellis's work is not a biography.  Those looking for a chronological account of his life and accomplishments will not find it here.  Instead, Ellis structures his narrative episodically. Each chapter explores a different facet of Adams's personality, revealing his character and thoughts through his friendships, correspondence, intellectual habits, personal reflections, and hopes for the future of his country. <br>         A consistent and entertaining theme throughout Ellis's book is Adams's belligerent yet likeable personality.  Adams was never more productive than when challenged; he thrived in the face of conflict.  Ellis describes how much in his element Adams felt when, as president, his policies lost him the favor of the Federalist Party: <br>[Adams had] placed himself in the most attractive position imaginable, at least for a man of his disposition: a leader without a party, whose independence [was] unalloyed and whose virtuous motives [could not] be attributed to a crass craving for popularity. (36)<p>Adams even took this personal combativeness into his library.  He was an aggressive reader, scribbling furious notes on the pages of his books as a means of debating with the author.  This habit is indicative of his mode of intellectual operation: "[Adams's] marginalia....constitute dramatic illustrations of the way he defined his own elemental ideas in conflict with opposing versions" (89). <br>         It was typical of Adams to identify his views according to opposition. Ellis employs this same method of identification to reveal Adams's ideological mindset.  He devotes a significant amount of his text to the famous correspondence between Adams and his colleague, Thomas Jefferson.  Citing Benjamin Rush, who once dubbed Adams and Jefferson, "the North and South Poles of the American Revolution," Ellis juxtaposes the two Founders, demonstrating how Adams sharpened his opinions by pitting them against Jefferson's (134).  It was within this context of private communication that Adams was best able to articulate his views: "the episodic character of a conversation matched nicely with his impulsive, hit-or-miss...mode of thinking" (144). <br>         While the structure of Ellis's work is refreshing in its originality, it suffers at times from rough transitions.  He divides his analysis so sharply into different categories that some chapters read like independent essays.  This lack of structural unity requires him to repeat information, unnecessarily burdening the reader.  Twice, for example, he discusses Adams's criticism of Mary Wollstonecraft's writings (101, 185).<br>         The lack of connection between sections also produces an aesthetic imbalance in Ellis's work.  Some chapters, such as the one dwelling on Adams and Jefferson's correspondence, are full of delightful anecdotes; others, such as Chapter 5, "Erudite Effusions," are sufficiently heavy with political theory so as to alienate readers in search of lighter fare. <br>         However, for Adams enthusiasts, Ellis's analysis provides a fresh and original look at an oft-neglected Father.  Ellis's heartfelt treatment conveys an unusual appreciation for the Sage of Quincy.  By portraying Adams transparently-warts and all-he succeeds in conveying to readers a sense of the Founder's humanity.  "In effect," says Ellis, "though [Adams] belongs on Mount Rushmore, we would need to devise a way to replace the granite with flesh and blood" (6).</span>

Instead he opens the vault of evidentiary material (i.e. quotes and the ability to weave together the paterns of Adams life) to give us John Adams the man. The intellectual, the tornado, the intuitive man of insight to whom we owe so much.</span>
