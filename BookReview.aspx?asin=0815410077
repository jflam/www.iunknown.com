                    <span>Like Albert Speer and Walter Schellenberg, Whilhelm Canaris is one of those enigmatic figures who emerged from the Third Reich. Hohne's book, 'Canaris: Hitler's Master Spy,' is a penetrating look at Hitler's head of military intelligence during World War Two. Hohne traces the rise of Canaris from his days as a lieutenant in World War One to his tenure as head of the Ahwehr and finally to his ultimate downfall at the hands of the Gestapo. The narrative does sometimes go off on tangents (notably the chapters on Canaris's role in the murders of communist leaders in the 1920's,) but also provides amazing insights into German foreign intelligence and the military conspiracy against Hitler that culminated in the July 20th 1944 bomb attempt. For anyone interested in World War Two espionage, the inner-workings of Nazi Germany, or deeper matters of conscience, Hohne's book will more than delight.</span>

                    <span>This is a non-revised paperback version of a biography which first appeared in the late 1970s. The author spent six years working on the archives and the result is a very detailed treatment of Hitler's master spy. Canaris emerges as a Janus or two faced figure. Early in the war, he undoubtedly achieved a number of spy coups. However, he also had to take responsibility for several "botched" expeditions such as the unsuccessful attempts to land German spies in the USA. Following the death of his erstwhile friend Heydrich, SS leaders such as Kaltenbrunner tried to break up Canaris' spy network and place it under Gestapo control. Canaris was dismissed in March 1944, but retained faith that Hitler would rehabilitate him. He was eventually hanged for alleged complicity in the July 1944 plot to kill the Fuhrer. Canaris certainly had links with anti-Hitler factions, but his actual role is still ambiguous. His conscience and loyalties prevented him from being in the forefront of opposition. Author Heinz Hohne is meticulous but is not an easy read. Nor does he offer a chapter of conclusions on this enigmatic character.</span>

                    <span>I have read many fiction WWII spy stories and thought it would be neat to get the real story on Canaris. This thing kind of reads like a difficult history book. I would suggest you get this ONLY if you are REAL serious about learning about him because it gives tons of trivial details, etc.</span>
