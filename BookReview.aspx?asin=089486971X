                    <span>I must admit that Lucinda Bassett's program (15 week taped program) and Dr. Bourne's "Anxiety and Phobia Workbook" are remarkable...but I feel that this book "Embracing the Fear" was the last "pill" I really needed to help in my recovery from agoraphobia. Once housebound, I have read many books on the topic. This book is wonderful... I have underlined and highlighted almost the entire book. THIS is the first book that talked to me about MY fear--not fear of dying like so many other books describe but fear of the TERROR of a panic attack. I KNEW I was not dying...I was just avoiding my life trying to protect myself from having one of those dreaded attacks away from home. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I am currently finishing up my master's degree in counseling and will definitely use this with my anxious clients. I can't tell you how much this book has helped me. It is like my second Bible.</span>

                    <span>I have consumed every book out there on this subject.  This is the best book for helping the patient cope and understand the condition.  It has more helpful coping strategies than any other book on the market.  It is upbeat and give you the sense that you can handle this, and you are going to be fine. I love their attitude.</span>

                    <span>I have read and or purchased over 10 Anxiety books and this one was definiately a book worth reading.  I hate the fill in the blank what did I do today to make me better garbage?  I want general advice or a cognitive plan that works.  I've suffered with my illness for more than 6 months, been on many different meds.  (Still taking them) and tried many things.  To me this book is better than any therapy I've had so far.  This book will not cure you, but it will teach you how to "Cope" with attacks instead of fighting them.   It also teaches you that self-talk is not always a good thing.</span>
