                <span id="Label1">The war on terror has created near unanimity on many points, at least within the American press and political leadership. One essential point of agreement: al Qaeda specifically and radical Islamism in general are stirred by a hatred of modernity. Or as President George W. Bush has articulated repeatedly, they hate freedom. Nonsense, responds the nameless author of this work and 2003's <I>Through Our Enemies' Eyes</I> (the senior U.S. intelligence official's identity became an open secret by publication date). Indeed, he grimly and methodically discards common wisdom throughout this scathing and compelling take on counterterrorism. <I>Imperial Hubris</I> is not a book that will cheer Americans, regardless of their perspectives on the post-9/11 environment. We are, the author notes, losing the war on terror. Hawks will squirm as the author heaps contempt on U.S. missions in Afghanistan (too little, too late) and Iraq ("a sham causing more instability than it prevents"), but opponents of Bush administration policies may blanch at Anonymous' suggestion that what's needed is for the West to  "proceed with relentless, brutal, and, yes, blood-soaked offensive military actions until we have annihilated the Islamists who threaten us." Quoting the at-all-cost likes of William Tecumseh Sherman and Curtis Lemay on one hand and contending that unrelenting military measures be accompanied by concessions to the ideology of the militants on the other are unlikely to curry widespread support from either side of the divide. And how will readers conditioned to references to Osama bin Laden as a deranged gangster or simple-minded fanatic with deep pockets digest the respect accorded "the most popular anti-American leader in the world today"? <I>Imperial Hubris</I> clearly wasn't written to win friends, though the author believes it's essential that his words influence people at the top. Whether it will is debatable, but that this blunt, forceful, urgently argued polemic recharges the discussion is a foregone conclusion. <I>--Steven Stolder</I></span>

                    <span>I didn't like this book, because it portrays all Muslims as one monolithic entity (they all love the Koran, they all hate Israel, they all are against the U.S.). As we see in Lebanon, Iraq, etc., there is a broad spectrum of Muslims, and to lump them all together the way the author does is not what I would expect from a CIA analyst with all that experience. It would be like saying in 1944, the Germans are all just nazis and can never change. </span>

                    <span>This book isn't perfect, but it certainly is a worthy contribution to a national conversation and self-examination that is badly needed.  Other reviews ably critique the book, so I'll just defend it from a few criticisms that are off base.  
<br />
<br />First, someone claims it involves "Bush bashing," which is baloney.  Other than a few mentions of the book, "Bush at War," the name "Bush" is never mentioned once, and the book makes it obvious that the shortcomings in US foreign policy extend back over several administrations, both Republican and Democratic.  I don't think the leaders of either political party have the moral courage and intellectual integrity needed to get beyond the standard simplistic and convenient analyses.
<br />
<br />"Respect and understand your enemy" is always good advice, which unheeded will only lead to more disasters.  But some readers are offended because the author seeks to go beyond demonizing bin Laden to explain why he is so popular in much the world.  If we resist trying to understand why people feel that way, then we will continue to make stupid mistakes.  
<br />
<br />Finally, the few pages in the book critiquing our unquestioning support of anything Israel does, even to the dismay of our closest allies, inevitably brings forth the usual charge of anti-Semitism.  I am so sick of that knee-jerk bullying, which, along with the above mentioned "head in the sand" examples, prevents us from having having a national discussion that goes beyond sound-bite sloganeering.  </span>

                    <span>This book was an informative but dry read.  You must take this author's view with a grain of salt, as it is quite clear that he generalizing about the Muslim faith.  I am an avid reader, particularly about politics and International Relations/Affairs, but it took me more than a year to get through this one.  Be prepared for a very dense read that makes unfounded, unfair sweeping generalizations about a faith that includes more than a billion people worldwide.</span>

                    <span>This book was written by Michael Scheuer who worked for 22 years in the CIA and was responsible for the Bin Laden Station as part of that role collected information on El Qaeda.  In a recent article in the Boston Phoenix it was suggested that the book started as a manual using unclassified material so that it could be used in training CIA staff. The limit of the book to unclassified material potentially allowed serving members to take it home to study. 
<br />
<br />Broadly the book is a criticism of not only current US policy but also US perceptions of the threat faced by Bin Laden. Some commentators have argued that Sept 11 has resulted in the disgust felt by conservative Muslims at US society its moral looseness and free enterprise tradition. Scheuer effectively shows that this is piffle and the real motivation behind Bin Laden's movement is that of a defensive Jihad. He has been able to convince the Muslim world that America has meddled and continues to meddle with the freedom of those who believe in Islam. Scheuer argues that the United States unquestioning support of Israel, its support of corrupt non democratic regimes in places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia are the issues which have galvanised terrorists rather than mini skirts and re-runs of Sex and the City. 
<br />
<br />Scheuer seems to be a conservative who admires Reagan and his criticism of the Neo Cons who have supported the attacks of Afghanistan and Iraq reflects America's isolationist history rather than do good leftism. (He quotes historical thinkers who argued against America being caught up in crusades and suggest that foreign policy should be limited to national interest)  Scheuer thinks that the suggestion that a democratic regime can be established in Afghanistan is a fantasy. In fact he thinks that both the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq have been huge propaganda wins for Bin Laden. 
<br />
<br />The problem with a lot of what he says is that it is largely speculative. One of the most repeated beliefs of the author is the assertion that America will find itself in the same position that the Soviet Union did in Afghanistan. There are a number of arguments advanced to suggest that this will happen. The first is that the American sponsored invasion to remove the Taliban succeeded but it destroyed only a small number of Taliban fighters and none of the leadership. That the leader who has been supported by America is secular, is supportive of women's rights and supports an American notion of representative democracy. The majority of Afghans are deeply religious, they do not support western secularism and apart from those who live in the capital none have much of an affinity for the rights of women. Lastly the majority of the people of Afghanistan are Pashtans. The Taliban was a Pashtan dominated organisation but the current rulers of Afghanistan are members of minority tribes who formed the Northern Alliance. Now it may well be that the Taliban leaders who survived might be able to mount a successful insurgency based on resentment by the majority of Afghans about the imposition of a secular state by the Americans. On the other hand maybe it will not happen. The fight against the Soviets was bankrolled by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US. Weapons were paid for by the US and supplied through Pakistan. Large numbers of Arab volunteers many from Saudi Arabia travelled through Pakistan to fight against the Soviets. In the war which saw the Taliban achieve dominance Pakistan supplied weapons and " volunteers" which enabled them to win. 
<br />
<br />The current climate is unlikely to see any of the major powers support the remnants of the Taliban with weapons and logistical assistance. One thus wonders if a resistance is possible. The reality is that rather than speculate it is more appropriate to look at what is happening on the ground. However this book contains little information about the level of insurgency which is going on in Afghanistan at the moment and the book remains a theoretical work. As such it is hard to say that the book has supported the assertion that the West is losing the war on terror. The book does however present a compelling case to say that the war on terror has become sidetracked by the invasion of Iraq and the focus on terror rather than on Islamic insurgency directed against the US is counter productive. Suggesting that terror is the problem rather than one form of insurgency has shackled the US to supporting Russia and China in two dirty domestic wars. Other writers have suggested that following the Sept 11 attacks the United States set in chain the location and breaking up of El Qaeda Cells. Across the world arrests were made not only by the US but by the British, German and French Governments. Safe houses were closed down, bank accounts frozen. It would be interesting to know how the tide is going and whether Bin Laden has the same ability now that he had in 2001. This book does not convincingly suggest that he has more.
