                    <span>I've only heard audio portions of this book so far and I've enjoyed it immensely. I'm a huge Yankee fan and I love the way Joe manages them - and George Steinbrenner for that matter; calm, clear, focused, patient. However, I just wanted to respond to Bill from NY, who said that Joe Torre can not write and  that the book wasn't very "inciteful". <br>Note to Bill: buy a dictionary before you "right" off a review in haste.</span>

                    <span>This book offers good advice for managers of most professions. It may be simplistic to say that the baseball industry strategies will apply to all areas, but one of the first things you learn IS that it will apply to most areas -- because it deals with one long-time commonality -- people. Joe Torre shows that his insight and respect for others really does work and that it is NOT just money.</span>

                    <span>Read JOE TORRE'S GROUND RULES FOR WINNERS: <br>12 KEYS TO MANAGING TEAM PLAYERS, TOUGH BOSSES, <br>SETBACKS, AND SUCCESS by Joe Torre with Henry <br>Dreher . . . Torre, in case you're not a baseball fan, is the manager <br>of the New York Yankees . . . this book tells how he has<br>applied commonsense principles to become perhaps the<br>sport's best top skipper . . . nothing overly profound here,<br>but it all did make sense to me . . . and I liked how he related<br>baseball examples to business, family and life situations.<p>There were several passages I particularly enjoyed; among them:<br>* In any business, workers up and down the hierarchy want nothing<br>more than to be treated fairly, to feel that they aren't getting<br>the short end of a manager's stick. My second baseman in 1966, <br>Mario Duncan, once was quoted as saying about me, "He doesn't<br>play favorites. All twenty-five guys are his favorites." It was kind of<br>him to say, and I believe that it's true. Managers who make it <br>their business to keep personal preferences to themselves, to <br>show regard for all employees, and to be scrupulously fair about <br>opportunities, promotions, and perks, will be rewarded with a <br>bunch of highly motivated team players.<p>* During my eight years as a player with the Braves, I was fortunate<br>to hit behind baseball's all-time home run king, Hank Aaron. One<br>day, Hank and I were talking about batting slumps when he made <br>a comment that's stayed with me ever since: "Each at bat is a<br>new day."<p>* "I hang pictures," is a phrase I've used whenever I start a new<br>job. . . . When I first managed the Mets in the late 1970s, Boyer, <br>then the Cardinals' manager, visited me in my clubhouse<br>office. Kenny noticed all the personal pictures I had hanging on <br>the walls. "Wow," he exclaimed. "You expect to be here for a <br>while?"  <p>"When I start working somewhere, I just assume that I'm going<br>to be there forever," I said. "It's the only way I can do my job."</span>

                    <span>Coaches not only bring winning teams to victory, but they influence the team and individual to aspire to their highest potential. The art of coaching sculpts people into personal success with the clay of trust, encouragement, insight into individual psychology, and a thorough knowledge of the activity coached. Joe Torre, the manager of the New York Yankees baseball team who brought the players to championship at the World Series, weaves together these factors to show how business people can reach the same level of personal success. His wisdom applies to any activity that relies on an individual's extra push to succeed.<br>"How do you make it happen? As an individual, you work relentlessly on the fundamentals of the game-whatever you game may be," he notes in the book. The mechanics of the game or business lay the groundwork, but the variables of talent, interaction with coworkers, attitude and relationship skills count even more. "In order to build teamwork, you must acknowledge each individual's worth, letting him know that this role, no matter how seemingly minor, is a vital cog in the team's efforts," he writes.<br>In today's work environment, where getting to know fellow workers may be subordinate to getting the job done, and where the focus is on production rather than people, Torre's ground rules of knowing the people who work with and for you may seem radical. But, he says, they are essential.<br>His blend of common sense, experience and psychological insight make this book a productive and instructive use of time for managers or anyone wanting to succeed in business. He shows how the complexity of mind, emotion, heart and talent work together to build success, and he emphasizes the power of the mind and attitude on performance. The dreams and goals deep within the individual can win out, he insists. He encourages bravery and persistence to carry on in a world that can make it easy to douse the flame of a dream for the banality of safe routine. In the end, success in business and in life have meaning to the individual because of the struggle to get there. "(O)nly you know how many small triumphs and snarls went into that big victory, how many months, years, or decades of sweat and sorrow preceded that breakthrough. That's baseball, and that's life," he notes.<br>And that's Torre's attitude in a book worth reading.</span>

                    <span>Joe Torre distills his management and "team player" philosophy into twelve keys. These insights elegantly deal with ways to inspire critical qualities, including trust, commitment, optimism, resilience, excellence, patience, integrity, respect, leadership, teamwork, and camaraderie. Torre illustrates his beliefs and advice with pertinent anecdotes told in a detailed, witty, heartfelt style. Torre, who has won four world series titles as manager of the New York Yankees, draws on his experiences as a player, manager, and leader. He includes the lessons he learned when he reported to a demanding team owner. The book delivers what it promises and offers an engaging behind-the-scenes look at professional baseball. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers and employees at all levels in any kind of business. Since it never relies on macho clichés, both men and women will find it satisfying and worthwhile.<br /></span>
