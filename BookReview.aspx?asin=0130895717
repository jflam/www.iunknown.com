                    <span>I used C++ How to Program, 2ed, in my first 2 years at University and I found its explanations of the concepts and techniques excellent. I have Stroustrup's "bible" on C++, but I find it sometimes very dry and difficult to interpret. Deitel&Deitel has not disapointed me yet. I thoroughly recommend it, it is money well spent.</span>

                    <span>I was introduced to the "How to Program" books a few years ago as a text for a C++ class. It was a hard book to read, not because of the writing style, but because of the complexity of the topic and because this was my first introduction to an Object Oriented Language. I found though, by focusing on the book and studying the details, that this was by far the best software book I had ever read. The example excerpts have allowed me to understand the the concept of the topic in contrast to other texts which tend to gloss over the details or write short obfuse sample code without dwelving into the details. In other words, the Deitel and Deitel books are explicit and the exercises are complete rather than "left to the reader to complete..." By understanding the concept of the topic, I can apply this knowledge to solve similar computational challenges. I was used to the O'Reilly collection "...in a nutshell," but I found (although well written) that they didn't have the attention to detail and depth of information that these books have. I found such affection for the C++ book, that use other Deitel and Deitel books as a reference for computer subjects/languages that I study. This is also rare for me to do, but instead of cashing in your old addition for the latest addition, that I also keep the older additions as well. One of the books is so worn that I used epoxy to re-glue the binding. I haven't tried the training courses yet, but I am sure they will also be extremely comprehensive. I pay my respect to the Deitel and Deitel products for outstanding quality and attention to detail.</span>

                    <span>I am studing computer science and I was a little lost in my class. That was when I decided to buy this book and it has help me a lot. Its easy to understand and it have very good examples. This book guide you from the easiest codes to the more complicated. I really recomend this book for the rookies and all the people who want to learn to program. Buy it, you wont be sorry.</span>

                    <span>Having used other C++ texts, the Deitels' C++ How To Program, 3/e, is the best I've seen and used (no, I haven't examined the 4/e). This book goes from the very basics to pretty advanced C++ OOP concepts and applications, and the authors do an excellent job presenting the material. A working knowledge of C is very useful, in my opinion and experience, depending on how in depth you want to know C++.<P>This book was recommended to me by a CS professor at a college where this book is used, including an advanced OOP course. This book was absolutely worth buying. More importantly to me, I ended up enjoying the C++ programming language after I switched to using this book.<P>The Deitels go out of their way to load this book with portability issues. There are so many ways to point pointers to pointers, e.g., and get a program to work on one computer yet crash on another. Portability is a very important issue, especially if you plan to program for a living! <P>Technical authors tend to excel at some subjects but not others. For this book, particularly if you're a <BR>"self-starter/learner," I would recommend supplementing this with a C++ data structures book, or taking the time to print out header files and spending time studying "live code" from the links from the included disc. <P>The Deitels seem to know their strengths, and the C++ How To Program, 3rd edition, is the best C++ book I have or have seen. The "Cyber Classroom" is not a requirement, but it is a welcomed addition to my library. <P>For any C++ programming, whether or not you take C first, "The C Programming Language, 2nd edition," Kernighan/Ritchie, is a must for the libraries of all C and C++ programmers.<P>Nothing is perfect, but I've seen books go through multiple editions and still contain the same errors in them. I gave this book 5 stars because it's excellent. It's over 1,000 pages, contains a great deal of code, and I really appreciate that, although the book comes with an intro version of ms vc++, the book shows errors generated by the Borland C++ compiler, too. MASM 6.0 is the only ms s/w I ever liked, so they stopped making it, LOL! I use Borland's C++ Builder, so this is really an added bonus for me.</span>
