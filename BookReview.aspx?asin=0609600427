                <span id="Label1">As elegant as his bestselling <b>How to Know God</b> and as practical as his phenomenal <b>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</b>, this groundbreaking new book from Deepak Chopra contains a dramatic premise: Not only are everyday coincidences meaningful, they actually provide us with glimpses of the field of infinite possibilities that lies at the heart of all things. By gaining access to this wellspring of creation, we can literally rewrite our destinies in any way we wish.<br><br>From this realm of pure potential we are connected to everything that exists and everything that is yet to come. &#8220;Coincidences&#8221; can then be recognized as containing precious clues about particular facets of our lives that require our attention. As you become more aware of coincidences and their meanings, you begin to connect more and more with the underlying field of infinite possibilities. This is when the magic begins. This is when you achieve the spontaneous fulfillment of desire.<br><br>At a time when world events may leave us feeling especially insignificant and vulnerable, Deepak Chopra restores our awareness of the awesome powers within us. And through specific principles and exercises he provides the tools with which to create the magnificent, miraculous life that is our birthright.</span>

                    <span>I agree (now) with the editorial review, but I had to see for myself, since I am a Chopra fan. Editor said "Although Chopra's theories are expressed in a confusing and repetitive manner, the techniques he advocates may prove interesting to those who enjoy his humanistic, if convoluted, approach to self-help." Yep. <P>There are better books on the market, including one I just finished from a NDE survivor who educates without the confusion, and theres two chapters on technique that humans can understand! Psychic Gifts in the Christian life by Tiffany Snow. Other books you should look at is the (not kidding) "Idiot" series, which lay a good foundation for several disciplines, like "Meditation for Idiots" or "Psychic Awareness for Idiots," etc. The Power of Coincidence is a bit flat.You expect an author to generate a shift in consciousness, and excitment and method of beneficial change. This book didn't do it. I hope his next one is better. I see him on TV, etc, and I know he's getting better at marketing, but what about the writing? Maybe he's just too busy now for us regular people. Where is the old Chopra I knew? I want him back!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this and the "Celestine Prophecy" by James Redfield the same day. Great companions! The "Celestine" is a parable story of the stuff Deepok is speaking about. Each gives you a deeper understanding of the other. I purchased Deepok's on tape and listen to it in my car and the "Celestine" in bookform and therefore am studying both, slowly, together. This was not planned, but, may I say, a coincidence. These were the only two items I picked up in the bookstore that day, one audio and the other in bookform, perfect! <P>If you are concerned of Deepok's book being too dry, buy the "Celestine" first. If it sparks an interest, then go on to buy Deepok's for a deeper and more complete understanding of the why's, mechanics and science behind coincidences.</span>

                    <span>No book is for everyone ... no book can reach every person in the infinite variety of lives we live. But THIS book was precisely what I was looking for when I found it. I've referred to it over and over and over again and it has proven to be of invaluable assistance to me as I've worked to change my life from the inside out. <P>As I first read the book, and was blown away by how perfectly it filled in the gaps in the picture of life that was forming within me, I also realized "this book isn't for everybody". Read the other reviews and follow your instincts. If it sounds like something that you've been searching for but haven't been able to find ... then I think you'll be delightfully pleased. If it sounds like smoke and mirrors to you, then look for something else. If you're in the mood for an apple, why eat an orange and blame the orange when you're done?</span>

                    <span>Wayne Dyer is better(most of his books). Tiffany Snow is better (all of her books). Some of Chopra's earlier works are better. Many books are better than this, this one just repeats most of what we already know, so why bother?</span>

                    <span>A worthy insight into probable meaning of daily happenings. It is absolutely fantastic. Dr. Chopra has done it again. It can change your thinking.........and your life. If you find the book flat (as an earlier reviewer did), all you need to do is actually read the book and you will find the treasure that it is. 5 stars all the way.</span>
