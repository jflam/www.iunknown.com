                    <span>Don't buy this book if you have a good, working knowledge of Fireworks MX. The lessons are very basic and will not serve you if you are looking for advanced web graphics design. To the publisher: Add a "search inside this book" synopsis! It would have saved me the hassle of returning it to Amazon. </span>

                    <span>I came here to give the book a five star after finishing it this morning. After reading "joe reader's" review I'll just agree with him except, if your new to Macromedia, don't plan on absorbing this book in one day. It is thorough. What Patti does as an author is to make things easy with a nicely written step by step walk through of very powerful program. No mistakes or surprises that I could see. You will learn Fireworks and further you'll learn how powerful Fireworks is as a stand-alone program and as a front-end/companion to Dreamweaver. </span>

                    <span>As a 10-year Photoshop veteran, I was always wary of Fireworks. But it has some amazingly nice features and (much as I hate to admit it) blows Photoshop/ImageReady out of the water with web productivity features.
<br />This book has 11 chapters which tutor the reader by developing a simple web site. The accompanying CD has all the image assets, as well as all the assignments from the preceding chapter (so those of us too impatient to do as directed and save our files as we work, or who improvise during a lesson, can start with an up-to-date version of where the design should be).
<br />The last chapter gives a basic walkthrough of integrating the Fireworks design into a Dreamweaver site.
<br />The language is clear and concise, the exercises are realistic, and there are plenty of tips and shortcuts sprinkled throughout.
<br />So much of Fireworks is similar to Photoshop or Flash, that I was able to complete all 11 chapters in less than a day at a comfortable pace.</span>

                    <span>An excellent addition to the training from the source series. The lessons are very effective and informative. I have several years experience with Photoshop and I was lost with Fireworks until I picked up this book. Fireworks MX 2004 is a very powerful program.</span>
