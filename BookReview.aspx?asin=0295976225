                    <span>This is a fabulous book on sea kayaking.  I loved reading it because of the very useful information and mix of serious and humorous writing styles.  A must read - and you'll want to read it several times to soak up all the great information.  Highly recommended for any kayaker.  His exploits are impressive and inspiring.</span>

                    <span>There are a number of good books on kayak technique, but Dowd's is the  bible of the sport, and with good reason. He's been kayaking for over  thirty years, and he's done some of the most difficult voyages in kayaking  history. He's specific in his recommendations, but open minded, too. He  favors feathered paddles, but he understands the advantage of unfeatehred  paddles, and allows how they may be superior in many conditions.<p>Dowd's  advice isn't based on theory, but on experience. He's not afraid to admit  his own mistakes, and in this latest edition, he desribes how he's changed  a lot of his opinons on the rescue techniques he's taught in the past. He's  realistic, and realizes that not every kayaker is going to develop a  bombproof roll or be able to perform the Borze's paddlefloat rescue; he  endorses alternate techniques like he (somewhat contentious) Sea  Wings.<p>What it boils down to is this: Whatever other books you may own,  whatever lessons you may have taken, whatever your level of experience- you  need this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I first read his 1988 edition as I was just getting into sea kayaking.  I have since built 3 singles and a triple and have done week-long trips in Prince William Sound, Puget Sound, Sea of Cortez, and New Zealand.  So I'm  now fairly experienced and yet still learn (relearn?) new information and  techniques when I reread it.<p>I especially appreciate Dowd's emphasis on  self-rescues as opposed to assisted rescues.   So many rescues that work in  a pool with an unloaded boat are impossible in 38F water, 3-foot seas, with  150 pounds of gear in your touring kayak.  And yet that is when you really  need a solid rescue technique.<p>His references to some of the epoch,  historic and recent, long-distance expeditions are inspirational.  When  you're slogging 5 miles back to camp against a 15-knot wind, it helps to  remember that people have paddled across the Atlantic and that your task is  doable.<p>Be safe, go see cool places, happy paddling.  -David Thomas</span>
