                <span id="Label1"><P> Imagine that you could <I>really</I> understand the Bible...that you could read, analyze, and discuss the book of Genesis not as a compositional mystery, a cultural relic, or a linguistic puzzle palace, or even as religious doctrine, but as a philosophical classic, precisely in the same way that a truth-seeking reader would study Plato or Nietzsche. Imagine that you could be led in your study by one of America's preeminent intellectuals and that he would help you to an understanding of the book that is deeper than you'd ever dreamed possible, that he would reveal line by line, verse by verse the incredible riches of this illuminating text -- one of the very few that actually deserve to be called seminal. Imagine that you could get, from Genesis, the beginning of wisdom. <P> <I>The Beginning of Wisdom</I> is a hugely learned book that, like Genesis itself, falls naturally into two sections. The first shows how the universal history described in the first eleven chapters of Genesis, from creation to the tower of Babel, conveys, in the words of Leon Kass, "a coherent anthropology" -- a general teaching about human nature -- that "rivals anything produced by the great philosophers." Serving also as a mirror for the reader's self-discovery, these stories offer profound insights into the problematic character of human reason, speech, freedom, sexual desire, the love of the beautiful, pride, shame, anger, guilt, and death. Something as seemingly innocuous as the monotonous recounting of the ten generations from Adam to Noah yields a powerful lesson in the way in which humanity encounters its own mortality. In the story of the tower of Babel are deep understandings of the ambiguous power of speech, reason, and the arts; the hazards of unity and aloneness; the meaning of the city and its quest for self-sufficiency; and man's desire for fame, immortality, and apotheosis -- and the disasters these necessarily cause. Against this background of human failure, Part Two of <I>The Beginning of Wisdom</I> explores the struggles to launch a new human way, informed by the special Abrahamic covenant with the divine, that might address the problems and avoid the disasters of humankind's natural propensities. Close, eloquent, and brilliant readings of the lives and educations of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob's sons reveal eternal wisdom about marriage, parenting, brotherhood, education, justice, political and moral leadership, and of course the ultimate question: How to live a good life? Connecting the two "parts" is the book's overarching philosophical and pedagogical structure: how understanding the dangers and accepting the limits of human powers can open the door to a superior way of life, not only for a solitary man of virtue but for an entire community -- a life devoted to righteousness and holiness. This extraordinary book finally shows Genesis as a coherent whole, beginning with the creation of the natural world and ending with the creation of a nation that hearkens to the awe-inspiring summons to godliness. <P> A unique and ambitious commentary, a remarkably readable literary exegesis and philosophical companion, <I>The Beginning of Wisdom</I> is one of the most important books in decades on perhaps the most important -- and surely the most frequently read -- book of all time.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Leon Kass does a marvelous job reading Genesis. What a wise and wonderful companion to reading the first book of the Bible. The sections regarding the creation story and the episodes concerning Noah were particularly fine. The close reading of the only recorded conversation between Abraham and Isaac was wonderful. Such insight into the stories about Joseph! Altogether, a marvelous book. Please write another one like this about Exodus, Mr. Kass. Thank you!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After two decades of studying the Bible and consulting books about the Bible, I can honestly say that I have never read anything as lucid, informative, thorough, illuminating, and critically relevant as Kass's book on Genesis. <br>It is unlike any other commentary I am aware of, in that, rather than being set up as a standard verse-by-verse exposition, it follows the ideas and the storyline of Genesis in a coherent, chronological format. Nothing is omitted from discussion, or avoided, every verse is treated, but always in a way that lends itself to a greater understanding of the integrated whole of Genesis. Kass's expert interaction with the text is a result of his twenty years of teaching a seminar on Genesis, and his commitment to the premise that "to discover the meaning, a text must be studied in its own terms." (p.14).<br>What we need is "a disinterested and philosophic pursuit of the truth" (p.2). By disinterested Kass means a pursuit without an agenda, without a bias (without prior assumptions, religious or otherwise) and by philosophic, simply "wisdom-seeking". And by truth, well, to me that is one of the great things about the book... the author believes that there IS such a thing as truth, and wisdom, for that matter. A seemingly rare position to hold, among today's modern academia.<br>He says that there are three methodological assumptions on how to read Genesis. The first is to read thoroughly skeptically, in which case the reader would most likely want to quit reading after just a few pages. Secondly, entirely by faith, by which the reader already believes everything even prior to reading the first few pages. Thirdly, the way of "thoughtful engagement", by which the reader suspends his/her disbelief and has an earnest desire to simply let the text speak for itself. Much as we would do with other literary works, even novels. This third method is the one Kass advocates as being his own, and encourages all readers to adopt.<br>In doing so, he presents an assessment of Genesis that is quite different from what I may have heard in my own seminary education, but it is one that I regret not having adopted sooner.<br>For I have learned more in reading this book, than in all of my previous years of formal instruction.<br>As another reviewer has pointed out, here we see the biblical characters as they really were... not just Bible Superheros, not infallible demi-gods (as they are often portrayed) but as real live people who made as many bad judgements as good, and were not always as pious or Godly as we readily assume.<br>Aside from all of this, the book is readable. By that, I mean, it is not pedantically smudgy nor needlessly polysyllabic. It is clear, it is so wonderfully readable and clear-headed, and laced with footnotes, often describing how the source of his findings came not from himself, but from his students and colleages.<br>He states his purpose clearly. "First, to demonstrate by example a wisdom-seeking approach to the Bible that attempts to understand the text in its own terms yet tries to show how such an understanding may address us in our current situation of moral and spiritual neediness. Second, to recover in their full power the stories of Genesis as tales to live with, as stories illuminating some of the most important and enduring questions of human existence. Third, to make at least plausible the power of the Biblical approach and response to these questions, with its emphasis on righteousness, holiness, and reverence for the divine." (p.13).<br>Does the book succeed, regarding these goals?<br>Yes.<br>Is there a better book on understanding Genesis available today?<br>No.<br>Could this book in itself be any better than it is?<br>No.</span>

                    <span>Leon Kass is one of the most lucid and intelligent writers I have ever read.  This book is perfect for the unbelievers as well as the religous.  I savored every paragraph.  His opening paragraph in the preface could be used as a reference standard in any writing class.  Enjoy this book. It is truly delicious.</span>

It's ironic, actually, that the book starts by stating the way to seek wisdom is to read Genesis within its own context, in the way it was meant to be read, that the search for knowledge without God is why Eve failed in the Garden, then it continues to seek wisdom through human reading consulting Kant and others, and failing to take Genesis into context at all.<p>For this author, Adam and Eve didn't fall, the "rose," they became human. Thus, the author throws away then entire Genesis account in his attempt to destroy the religions based on the account of the Garden, while keeping Genesis viable for the modern gnostics.<p>I would only recommend this book as a lesson to those who claim you can't read the Bible in your own wisdom, as this book does, and then attempt to read it in their own wisdom, as this book does.</span>
