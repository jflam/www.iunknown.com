                    <span>I don't write many reviews on here, but this book has had such a profound impact upon my life that I want to add my voice to those below: The Now Habit is, hands down, the greatest self-help book I have ever read. <P>Like many of the reviewers below, I've had great success in school and life when I've actually applied myself, but have sold myself short for my entire life by never putting in a consistent effort.<P>I read The Now Habit about a month ago, and applying its suggestions has literally revolutionized my life. Keep in mind that I've read self-help books and listened to motivational tapes for years: Zig Ziglar, Anthony Robbins, Brian Tracy, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Earl Nightingale, etc. These materials were always helpful and made me feel great and motivated, but after reading The Now Habit, I realized that the majority of them told me the same thing: discipline yourself, have a positive mental attitude, and just do it.<P>That never worked to my satisfaction, though. I found myself having streaks of success and positive thinking, but then I would fall into a rut and get behind on everything in my life through procrastination. I always felt guilty about spending nights out with my wife rather than studying, or would find myself playing computer games for hours, putting other things off, and never TRULY enjoying it. All of my play time was guilty play time. I had tried to adopt the mantra of the salesman Tom Hopkins, "I must do the most productive thing possible at every given moment," and found myself miserable in trying to do so.<P>This book helped me to realize the importance . . . no, the absolute **necessity** of PLAY TIME. In its words, you have to play hard to work more productively.<P>At the time I read The Now Habit, I had been procrastinating on applying to dental school for almost a year. After reading it, I applied within a week, and actually enjoyed the process! I've caught up with ease in all of my school classes, and have been enjoying my play time more than ever before. It's been incredibly easy to start on projects early, and I actually look forward to a big chunk of work time, since I get to play after every half hour!<P>I know what I'm saying sounds sensational, but I'm really quite sincere about it. There is some very powerful psychology in this book. Maybe it won't work for everyone, but it's probably worth $15 to at least give it a shot.<P>Take the negative reviews below with a grain of salt: this book is well-written and easy to follow. It is written in a very compassionate and understanding voice, and offers stories of fellow procrastinators that give hope.<P>I was somewhat skeptical at first, but seriously: this book can change your life.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book! For years, I have had serious problems with procrastination. I have read numerous books on the subject. Each time I have re-dedicated myself to being a better, stronger, less lazy person. But I always wondered if there wasn't a better explanation for my behaviour than laziness. The Now Habit has answered this nagging doubt in a productive and valuable way. I now have an explanation for my choices and behaviour. More importantly, The Now Habit has provided me with the tools to change the way I work and live. This book has significantly altered my life. Thank you Neil Fiore!</span>

                    <span>I consider myself a chronic procrastinator, I frequently find myself almost literally paralysed by procrastination and over the years it has cost me a lot in all areas of my life. If you are anything like me you have probably berated yourselves over your procrastination and are exhausted from the weight of unfinished tasks you mentally carry. <P>I have to say I really enjoyed this book. First it made me understand why I procrastinate, what the psychological drivers are behind it. The techniques are brilliant in their simplicity, so simple you'll wonder why you didn't work it out before. I have got through more work this week than the last month using them. But more importantly I've really enjoyed the time I have had off for the first time in years. <P>I also have adult ADD and find that procrastination is often the symptom of the larger issues of ADD. For those that are dealing with this debilitating behaviour on a day to day basis I urge you to buy it. A habit like procrastination is not developed overnight and I doubt that it will go away overnight either. The techniques you'll find in the book will immediately get your working on the right path and I for one have really felt for the first time that I can beat this wretched behaviour and really start enjoying life.<P>Order it now! :-D</span>

                    <span>This book just might change your life. It changed mine. I had read every other book on procrastination before finding this book, including the others mentioned in these reviews. This is, quite simply, the BEST book; completely different from the rest. It is quite possibly the best self-help book I have ever read. It may also be one of the best books ever written on anxiety and on achieving one's goals in life - subjects which I have learned are all connected.<P>Five years ago, I worked at an office job I didn't like much. Since reading Neil Fiore's book, I have written and published two well-reviewed children's books and realized my life-long dream of studying medicine. At the age of 35, I started medical school with no science background or training and in 5 months, I will graduate as an MD. This book allowed me to follow my dreams (thirty minutes at a time) and to acheive them. It can help you do the same.<P>Do not be fooled by books with flashier covers; it's what's inside that counts. Anyone who procrastinates will recognize themselves in these pages; they will also recognize the feelings of being overwhelmed and paralyzed before even starting a project, and the disappointment in themselves that results from chronic procrastination.<P>This is a book that actually teaches you to understand yourself, to take care of yourself, and to help yourself develop simple habits that can change your life. This is truly an easy and non-scary program, proving that you don't have to turn your life upside down to turn it around! The words in this book have stayed with me for years, and I carry a little card with reminders from it in my wallet. This program works. Believe me - I learned medicine thirty minutes at a time! And, most importantly, I had lots of time left over for fun.<P>Stop berating yourself! You don't need more willpower. You don't need a new daytimer. What you need is the NOW HABIT. So scrap that scary to-do list. If you do only one thing this week, make it this: order this excellent book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a clunky, poorly designed, uninspiring book filled with cliches that put one to sleep. It seems written for bureaucrats and corporate clones. Instead, wake up, and delight yourself with The Procrastinator's Handbook!!! Much much much better. Refreshing, beautifully designed if that matters to you, not ponderous and redundant like The Now Habit. Says it all, in fewer, better written words.</span>
