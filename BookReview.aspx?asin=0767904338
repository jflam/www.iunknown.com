                    <span>It's great to see a different perspective on Jobs.  So many books are either too nice to him, or too mean.  This one is much more balanced than most, and has testaments from all sorts of people in Steve's life, and covers the bases as well as is possible without Steve participating.  The best part is that it really focuses in on a portion of Steve's life that is often ignored in stories about Apple and Steve- NeXT and Pixar.  </span>

                    <span>The author's writing style is atrocious.  He doesn't make Jobs into a fun character to read about, instead he's annoying and the book is annoying to muddle through.  It's a real shame because it could have been a blast. Thank God it had a story about Bill Gates prank calling Jobs or it would have been a total waste.</span>

                    <span>The Second Coming of Steve Jobs is a balanced representation of Steve's struggle to reclaim the popularity and wealth he once had. This book depicts his struggles with his company NeXT, the evolution of Pixar, and his journey back to Apple to turn around his troubled child. The Second Coming depicts Steve as a charismatic business man that sought perfection and would stop at nothing to achieve it. Through his struggles with Pixar and NeXT, Steve always had a vision of how his achievements would fall into place. This book is inspiring to those with entrepreneurial interests and is a great glimpse into one of the "Hollywood like" celebrities of Silicon Valley. Steve Job's effect on people and the representation of his life at home is inspiring and one of a kind. Steve Job's acquirement of Pixar turned out to be yet one of his best inventions. His passions for computer hardware and his love of computer software is what made him one of the found and leading fathers of the computer industry in the present day. This book is highly recommended to those with interest in Apple Computer, Pixar, or Steve Job's himself. The Second Coming remains an easy read and is informative in explaining the events that took place that are documented in favor or against Steve in the media.</span>

                    <span>Steve Jobs is a powerful man with a tight grip on his image. The fact that this book was even written is a testament to Deutschman's dedication. I heard that Jobs even leaned on the press to avoid publicizing the book. <p>After the reading the book, I don't even know why he was pushing so hard. Yes, there's some dirt about his love life, but most of the story is generally good news about a hard working guy with a knack for finding great designs. The chapters about Pixar are a great addition to the history of that company and an important reminder that Jobs helped build two world-class companies. <p>I read it with pleasure.</span>

                    <span>I am unabashedly one of the (until recently) Macintosh Faithful, having at one time printed my own business cards with "Mac Evangilist" as my title.  I would approach customers in the Macitosh section of CompUSA or Computer City and see if they had questions (only while i was there already, mind you!). I have waxed lovingly on the virtues of Macintosh to all my friends and family, and longed for a NextStation, if only as a hobby machine.<p>Needless to say, I am a died-in-the-wool Steve Jobs fan.  In all fairness, the amount of information out there about the MAN is thin and disreputiable.  His charm, 'reality distortion field' and his public dressing-down of employees are the stuff of legend, but little concrete has been found about the MAN.<p>A few years ago I read another biography, called (i think) "Steve Jobs and the NeXT Best Thing".  It was a one-sided, blistering account of every failure Jobs made with his founding of Next, and seemingly NO good choices were made.<p>Picking up this book, The Second Coming, I was expecting more of the same.  What I found was a fair, inciteful, and only slightly more vague than it could have been.  The writer does seem to set the reader up as to many of Steve's strong points, and then makes a point to tear down Steve and portray him as almost an unfeeling monster.  The narrative is a gentle roller-coaster ride between these two extremes, giving the impression that Steve is either a child, or possibly suffering from multiple personality disorder.<p>One thing to note is that Steve Jobs does not approve of this book, and as I understand sued to stop publication.  Needless to say, HIS point of view and interviews with him are not part of the makeup of the book.<p>Overall, I find this to be an excellent, information packed book on one of the FEW businessmen I would consider a 'hero' to me.  However, without Steve's direct input, this book comes across VERY strongly as a coloring-book picture colored from the OUTSIDE up to the outline of the man, not filling in the man himself.</span>
