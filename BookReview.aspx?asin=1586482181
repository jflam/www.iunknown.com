                <span id="Label1">Retired General Wesley Clark's follow up to his insightful, detailed memoir of NATO's victorious Kosovo campaign begins as a concise analysis of the 2003 military invasion/occupation of Iraq and wends its way to a troubling yet ultimately hopeful examination of America at an unprecedented domestic, economic, and geopolitical crossroads. Clark's keen intellect (he was a Rhodes Scholar and graduated first in his class at West Point) and refreshing gift for intelligent plain-speaking often call attention to salient observations too often overlooked in the daily jumble of selective news and political spin. Our conflicts with Iraq have not been two distinct wars, but an unceasing, 13-year-long military campaign; the ambitious Pax Americana envisioned by Bush administration neocons is not only unsustainable, but a redundant anachronism, America having long ago created a "virtual empire" by dint of its interlocking international business relationships, cultural lure, and (ideally) moral leadership. His critics may label it the political manifesto of an ambitious  presidential contender (a charge he quickly addresses in his introduction with a pre-emptive strike that is, given the subject matter, a bit ironic), but Clark's vision of an engaged, enterprising America leading the world instead of dominating it is rooted in an objective understanding of history, our nation's own longstanding philosophical ideals, and no small amount of refreshing horse sense (are we fighting terrorism by <I>creating</I> terrorists? And how safe is a country that starves its very security apparatus with unsound economic policies?). Ever loyal to the armed forces he served with distinction for 33 years, Clark also never passes up an opportunity to praise our nation's best and bravest, the men and women who are the cutting edge of America's sword, be it yielded with restrained wisdom or reckless abandon. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I></span>

                    <span>A friend of mine just returned from a year long depoyment to Kuwait gave me Wes Clark's most recent literary effort. I had read his earlier work that described his efforts as SACEUR and head of NATO's military. Gen. Clark, of course, was in charge of the successful "war" in Kosovo and was subsequently fired ignominiously by SecDef Bill Cohen at the behest of Bill Clinton. This book, "Winning Modern Wars", was obviously written as a prelude to Clark's bid for the Democrat nomination for president in '04. Having said that, I felt that General Clark presents a fairly balanced account of Bush 43's invasion of Iraq and the nuances of the decisions that led up to it. I got the impression that one of the author's sources in the White House was another Clarke(with an "e") whose book on terrorism has achieved more notoriety than this one. The first three chapters of this short (200 pages) tome are devoted to a recapitulation of Gulf War 2 from Gen. Clark's vantage point as a CNN consultant. As a student of military history this represents a concise summary of the combat and "post-combat" phase. Chapter 4 is an exploration of terrorism and how "success" should be defined in the nebulous war thereon. The fifth chapter "Flawed Arguments, Flawed Strategy" is probably the most valuable part of this book. Clark closes with a final chapter on his vision for "A New America" clearly the platform for this Rhodes' Scholar's presidential bid. The last sentences of the book sum it up: "Our actions matter.And we cannot lead by example unless we are sustained by good leadership. Nothing is more important." Overall, a good quick read that summarizes what led up to the war in Iraq that is still being fought (despite the Bush administration claims to the contrary) and the consequences of our actions.Just as we have had American troops on the line in Korea for over 50 years, we had better get used to the idea that we will have "boots on the ground" for at least as long in Iraq.</span>

                    <span>In his book, "Winning Modern Wars", Gen. Wesley K. Clark lays out his thoughts on war, diplomacy and the current state of our country. Although this book was written before he publicly announced his run for the Democratic nomination, it sounds like he has known for some time where his political affiliation lies.<P>The firs couple chapters discuss the war in Iraq and it's successes and failures. Clark says that, while the military did their job very well, Bush and his administration failed when it came to planning for the post-war situation. Clark also takes the Bush Admin to task for failing, or not trying hard enough, to get broad international support for the war. While we could have easily won the war in Iraq by ourselves, Clark feels that the burdern of rebuilding Iraq is going to weigh on America for years to come.<P>The next couple chapters discuss Clark's thoughts on the direction of America's foreign policy. He thinks we need to concentrate more on building alliances with countries, who will help in the war on terror. According to Clark, the Bush Administrations war on terror will fail because they are targeting "nation states". This will fail because the terrorists will just keep moving and spreading around. We need to develop and implement ways to end the recruitment of new terrorists while finding and capturing the current ones.<P>The last chapter covers the current direction of America's domestic condition. Clark feels that the large Bush tax cuts were the wrong thing to do during a time of war and recession. He also is disappointed with the current political climate in which Republicans attack anyone who dissents or disagrees with the "war on terror" (quotes are mine). Clark's presidential campaign is calling for a "New American Patriotism" in which love of country and dissent are both welcomed.<P>Highly Recommended!</span>

                    <span>When I first heard this author was putting out a book it was around the time we was dropping hints that he was going to run for President. I thought, wow his campaign really is on the ball with the "This is why I am running" book out before the candidate has even announced. Then the book comes out and it looks to not be the typical campaign book so I gave it a shot. The one thing I noticed right away is that either the author hired a better ghost writer, spent more time with the editor or worked on improving his skills because just on the basis of the writing, this book is much better then his first. It flowed very well and was easy to read. The issues I have with the book are the content and what the author tried to cover.<P>The author had four sections to the book, a review of the Iraqi war, a discussion on what the Bush team did to sell the war, a brief history of American and it's foreign policy in relation to warfare, and lastly a section on everything that the Bush team is doing to ruin the country. Any one of these areas could have easy been a full book, two in one book would be tough to get more then a review. Having all four topics in your book meant that magazine articles have more depth. To be fair, the first half of the book is the review of the war and I got the feeling after reading the book that is what the author originally meant to cover. The campaign process must have started about half way through the writing of the book and he needed to get his book out the door with something to differentiate him from Bush Jr. What ends up happening is that no one area is covered with enough depth and it makes the full book come across to me as either a rush job to cash in or a view into a very shallow man.<P>I do not want to sound all-negative because there were sections of the book I enjoyed. The review of the war was a nice, quick overview. The discussion of the lead up to the war and the selective truth telling played out by the Bush administration was interesting if not light. The book was written in an easy to read manner. It was just as a whole the book was very lacking, I wanted more on every topic. A constant theme could be said about the book - time. The author did not spend enough time on any one topic, the author did not have the time to dig deep into the topics of the book, and the reader does not need a lot of time to finish the book. I don't even think the book is remotely good at introducing the man as a candidate. Overall the book was disappointing to me, the required detail was not used to make the book useful and important. If you are looking for newspaper headline type reviews of the subjects then you will enjoy the book.</span>

                    <span>The first part of this most interesting book written by the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe describes the buildup and conduct of the war in Iraq. General Clark provides a map and recalls operations and gives a detailed strategic look at how the war was won. Then on page 83 he begins his critique and analysis of the "victory" in Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is here that the book becomes most interesting and most enlightening.<P>Clark finished this book sometime early in the fall of 2003 before the full extent of the Bush administration's failure in postwar Iraq became clear. Nonetheless Clark anticipated the failures, and his critique is devastating. When one adds it to some of the other criticisms that have come from distinguished military experts--the latest of which was General Anthony Zinni's appearance on Sixty Minutes (May 23, 2004) in which he said that had he made the mistakes in planning that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld had made, he would be compelled to resign--one is forced to recognize not only failure but premeditated and deliberate ignorance and incompetence.<P>While the old saw that "war is too important to be left to the generals" is still viable, it is equally true that to ignore or to go against the advice of those most experienced in such matters is foolhardy. Imagine yourself as President of the United States being told by your most experienced and senior generals such as Wesley K. Clark and Colin Powell--just to mention the two most prominent--that an invasion of Iraq would be unwise, counterproductive, and very expensive both in terms of monies spent and lives lost. What would you do?<P>What Bush did was to ignore the experts and to go with the neoconservative ideologues in and around the White House and people like Rumsfeld, and to do it without thinking the consequences completely through. As Gen. Clark so calmly and convincingly points out, the invasion of Iraq was a military success and a reconstruction failure of the most obvious and predictable sort. He writes, "Destruction of enemy forces on the battlefield creates a necessary--but not sufficient--condition for victory." (p. 88) More specifically, the planners failed to anticipate "various contingencies...including the possibility of postwar Iraqi resistance." (pp. 86-87) It is amazing to realize that the Bush White House apparently thought that the scattered Baathist elements and the Shia faithful would turn into flower children and hand out daises to the occupying soldiers.<P>Perhaps the simplest and most telling criticism is that "decisive operations (how to defeat Iraqi forces) had taken priority over the postwar plan (how to achieve the real objectives in Iraq)." (p. 89) However Clark's most important criticism is this: "the Administration raised the costs and risks of the mission by preventing our use of the full array of tools available to win modern war" by being "unwilling to exploit the international legitimacy and support from international institutions like the United Nations and NATO." (p. 92)<P>Now in May 2004 as I write this, Bush is practically begging the UN and anybody else who will listen to help us extract ourselves from the quagmire.<P>As to Bush's motive for invading Iraq, Clark asks, "if a primary but unspoken purpose of the campaign was to demonstrate the skills and courage of the American armed forces, then surely... [the military invasion] was a success." (p. 101) What he is suggesting (in a larger and less sanitized sense) is that we showed the world not only the awesome power of our weapons but our willingness to use them. I think that this was the real purpose of the invasion of Iraq. An easy victory against an overmatched (and evil) opponent in which the "shock and awe" of our military might could be displayed for all the world to see was what Bush had in mind. One cannot help but observe that such a scenario (successfully constructed) would work toward his becoming a two-term president and would fit well the mind set of a mediocre man whose personal advantages had allowed him many easy victories in his personal life.<P>Another "unspoken" reason for invading Iraq was to draw attention away from the fact that we had not caught Osama bin Laden and that the Bush administration really did not (and does not) know how to go about doing that. Let me make a suggestion: use the $200-billion plus that we have squandered in Iraq to persuade the tribesmen and warlords of Afghanistan and the government of Pakistan to help us find bin Laden. What Bush has accomplished in Iraq amounts to a giant recruiting poster for terrorists. Indeed the boots on the ground in Iraq serve as training targets for a mushrooming terrorist population.<P>Clark also addresses the larger theoretical issues, that of preemptive wars (he's in favor of them but only as self-defense on a multilateral basis) and the delusion of an American Empire. He points out that the word "empire" no longer has any real military or economic meaning. The US in fact, through globalization, has in effect created an economic empire, the maintenance of which requires a lot more than military might. Clark calls this the "virtual" American empire, and I think that is insightfully apt terminology.<P>There's a lot more to this book than I can discuss here, but let me add one more thing. Clark makes the astute observation that one of the tactics of terrorism is entice governments into instituting "repressive security measures...and so lose the support of its citizens" (p. 106) We can see the beginnings of such measures in the United States with the Patriot Act. One hopes that we do not fall into this trap, the ancient one of allowing the ends to justify the means on our way to becoming our enemy.</span>
