                    <span>This is a highly readable look at the American GI's that fought in Europe from beaches of Normandy (June 1944) on through victory in Germany eleven months later.   Author/Historian Stephen Ambrose (1936-2002) interviewed many veterans to write this moving narrative.           
<br />
<br />Ambrose makes us feel as if we are right there alongside the infantry as they trudge forward, dig foxholes, gripe constantly, and on occasion fight like demons.  The author had enormous respect for these front line "Willies and Joes" as GI cartoonist Bill Maudlin called them.  We meet farm boys, school dropouts, teachers, factory hands, engineers, and others who fought less out of hatred of Nazism than from a desire not to let their buddies down.  These men seldom confessed their patriotism, being more concerned with clean socks, decent chow, and a warm place to sleep.  This book should give readers an understanding of post-traumatic stress, and a respectful realization why so many veterans never speak (or spoke) of their wartime experiences.    
<br />
<br />Ambrose interviewed thousands of U.S. veterans to write his many narratives on the combat veterans of that horrific conflict.  His approach provides an engaging look at the front lines, although for a detailed look at the "big picture" one may need to look elsewhere.  Still, this is a very engaging look at the war from those who manned the front lines.

                    <span>Ambrose does an excellent job retelling the heroic experiences by those who were actually there: veterans of both the Allied and the German armies. As I read the account, I got the feeling I was talking directly with the veterans at some parts, not reading a book about it.He strings the stories together so they go in perfect succession, and at the same time keeping each individual experience concise, yet elaborate. After reading but a paragraph, you get to hear an inspiring story of wartime heroism while at the same time not having to read through the paragraphs of unnecessary descriptions that accompany some retellings from other non-fiction novels. Ambrose spends a decent amount of time discussing those who disgraced our armed forces in addition to those who served it with distinction. Specifically, he wrote one chapter about these men called "Jerks, Sad Sacks, Profiteers, and Jim Crow". This is the best chapter in the book by far because it presents a view I have not seen anywhere else. This book will make people realize for generations to come the sacrifices made by the brave men and women that helped make the greatest war the world has ever seen come to an end.</span>

                    <span>Steven E. Ambrose's Citizen Soldier is an exhaustively researched and prepared book on the battles from Normandy to the fall of Berlin during World War II. 
<br />
<br />Includes information and collected stories from the soldiers (from Privates and NCO's to Colonels and Generals). Extremely riveting and well organized. A must for military history buffs. But it provides any reader insight into how and why men manage fight and survive in even the most horrid situations and condtions. It portrays personal acts of heroism, cowardice, and just plain struggles to endure and survive. I have yet come across a reader who regretted reading it. 
<br />
<br />Citizen Soldier is probably better to listen to it on tape...14 tapes...but each hour is well worth it!

                    <span>Okay, let's get the negative out of the way first:  This book is so full of grammatical and typographical errors that I honestly wonder if anyone proof read it before it went to print.  Simon & Schuster, and who ever edited the book, should hang their heads in shame.  And Mr. Ambrose, despite his monumental and life-long research, is anything but an accomplished writer.
<br />
<br />BUT!!!  The content of the book, the endless stories of bravery and heroism, the research that went into the writing, the colossal knowledge of WWII that one gains...  All these elements combine to create a book that is so pervasively moving that you will never be the same after reading it.  It should be required reading for every World History class.  Anywhere.  
<br />
<br />What this book isn't:  An up-close and personal story of one solder's (or even one Company's) adventures in the war. We never get to know and become intimately familiar with one soldier in particular.
<br />
<br />What this book is: The collective work of Ambrose's life-long pursuit of WWII research. He spent a lifetime interviewing enlisted soldiered, petty officers, and senior officers on both sides of the European conflict.  The result is a complete picture of the war from D-Day at Normandy to the German surrender.
<br />
<br />We become familiar with what life was like for the front-line soldiers who spent much of the war in fox holes.  We understand how decisions made by upper echelon generals, some good but may colossally stupid, meant life and death for the millions of enlisted men and junior officers.  
<br />
<br />We experience snapshots from the lives of hundreds of men who, in the face of death, used their innovation and ingenuity to create successful battle plans despite their training which never prepared them for the situations they faced.  
<br />
<br />We witness moments of unheralded bravery when men set their own lives aside to carry out orders which made little sense.  We see men who, a year ago were repairing Chevy's in a garage in Kansas, and who are now retrofitting Sherman tanks with battering rams to fight in hedgerows.  We read about engineers who used to build roads in California but are now erecting bridges in France while being peppered with German small arms fire.  We read of men who used to teach school in Boston but who are now leading a patrol of 18 Americans which stop a German advance, slaying hundreds of them, before running out of ammunition, surrendering, and becoming prisoners of war.  We learn about young teenagers who lied about their age to enlist, become medics only because their name was pulled from a hat, given cursory medical training, and then perform such profound acts of bravery to save injured soldiers that old and seasoned soldiers watch and cry.
<br />
<br />Yes, this book is not without its flaws.  But, you would be wise to forgive them and let this book be what it is: A life changing, educational experience that will leave you haunted and inspired.

                    </div>
                    <span>Against the backdrop of the WWII Allied invasion from Normandy to Berlin, Stephen Ambrose pens a remarkable "you are there" history of the front-line soldier with "Citizen Soldiers". Using many first person accounts from both the Allied and Nazi side, Ambrose presents a truly gritty and at times macabre testiment to the existence that these amazing men went through and in the process gives an alternate history to the many previously published works of this monolithic period of WWII.
<br />
<br />From the Allied breakout at Normandy (Ambrose's previous work "D-Day" covers the Normandy landings), we follow many U.S. frontline troops as they work their way through hedgerow warfare and push the German army eastward through France. Ambrose exposes the everday technicalities of this fighting while maintaining the big picture as the Allies adjust their invasion strategy. Both the German and American infantry soldier tells his story (through Ambrose, of course) and the scenario that emerges is one of brutal massacre followed by un-ending periods of waiting and frustration...I've never read such intimate details of warfare as depicted here by Ambrose.
<br />
<br />The Allies encircle the German army and allow it to escape through the Falaise Gap and this sets the stage for the failed attempt by British General Montgomery to bridge a gap to Germany with operation Market-Garden. The major struggles at the Hurtgen Forest and the southern France battles at Metz all precede the Ardennes Campaign, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. Ambrose works the reader well here with the General's strategy and paralleling with the views from the division command all the way to the lowly private. What we get is front line warfare at it's literary finest...Ambrose surley deserves his reputation as the finest conveyer of this foxhole warfare.
<br />
<br />The book at this point digresses as we get short chapters associated with replacement soldiers, the air-war, medics and frontline nurses, POW's and the low life of the Army (aptly titled "Jerks, Sad Sacks, Profiteers and Jim Crow"), but gets back to the battles as story after story is told of the horrific conditions both sides encountered as the "Bulge" is pushed back and as the Allies take their initial casualties in Germany. The final push to Berlin is highlighted with the story of the troops at Remagen where the struggle for the bridge and bridgehead is prime-time Ambrose. Both the German and American veteran tells of the awful slaughter here and the desperation of the Germans as they realize that all is lost. The book ends with VE Day and the relief of the troops as they start to consider going home...this thinking is of course tempered with the knowledge that many of them are bound for the Pacific and a return to the slaughter.
<br />
<br />If one is looking for a detailed and comprehensive account of this period of ETO operations, this is not the book for you (you should look at Max Hastings "Overlord" and the newly published "Armageddon"). But if you want to understand what the front line soldier truly endured as he made his way from Normandy to Berlin, than you can do no better than "Citizen Soldiers". Stephen Ambrose is at his best here and he's clearly passionate about this period of WWII. Combining intimacy with brutal battle tactics, one comes away from this read exhausted and, like the soldiers he presents, relieved at the end of the struggle. Highest recommendation!</span>
