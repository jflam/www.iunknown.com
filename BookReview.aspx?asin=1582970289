                    <span>I am a novice photographer breaking into the world of Pro childrens photography and this book has been extremely helpful. Lots of great pics with a caption by each naming where, and what equipment and film was used to create the photo. I sat and read this in one night, easy read with just enough technical info to be helpful.</span>

                    <span>I am a professional children's photographer who was looking for some fresh poses and ideas, and I definitely found those in Orenstein's book. The photos are non-traditional and full of life and movement, but you can bet that almost every last one was a seller -- and probably at a higher price than a boring department store portrait. It's full of great ideas for showcasing a child's personality and developing a creative, personal, SELLABLE style. <P>I read the reviews before I bought it, and I have to say that the photos are great examples of how you need to learn "Photo Class 101" rules, and then break them. If you are interested in "mall photo mill", standard studio stock shots of kids with tired props in front of fake-looking backgrounds, look elsewhere. But if you want to be more than just a point-and-shoot photographer, Orenstein's book is for you. I would highly recommend it to all those who are just starting out in this fun but often frustrating field.</span>

                    <span>After reading the book from cover-to-cover and analyzing the pictures, I agree with kiraras: many (or most) of the pictures are of what NOT to do. If you want a better alternative, go to a website that teaches composition techniques and take a bunch of pictures of your son or daughter. If you get the book, compare your shots with Vic's, and I'm sure your photos will be just as good (assuming you can afford a non-point&shoot). The picture on the front of the book is excellent, perhaps the best. Follow the 'Look inside this book' link and see what's on the first few pages; that's as good as it gets: good pictures, not great. If you want 'great' or are a non-studio photographer, this book may not be of much use. However, if you're not good working with kids when photographing, this book may provide you with some valuable information, but nothing outstanding.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book looking for the author's credibility online and I couldn't be happier.<BR>The book shows information concerning how to select equipment, to deal with children, improve lighting skills, how to choose a good lab, films, making proofs, etc.<BR>It also has lots of inspiring pictures of children.<BR>If not the best, one of the best books I have ever read.Iam proud to own it.<BR>If you want to choose one book on photographing children among many, I vote for this.</span>

                    <span>This book is very good. It is complete to the point of ideas on how to get the attention of children of different ages and how to help them smile and relax. The author covers just about every issue concerning photographing children.<P>This book is good for beginners and experienced photographers because it has many ideas. Beginners will not get overwhelmed with photography jargon, and experienced photographers will get an insight on thinking like a child and dealing with them and the parents. I recommend this book for every child photographer.</span>
