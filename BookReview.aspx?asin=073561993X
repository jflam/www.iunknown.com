                <span id="Label1">Apply the principles of Scrum, one of the most popular agile programming methods, to software project management&#151;and focus your team on delivering real business value. Author Ken Schwaber, a leader in the agile process movement and a co-creator of Scrum, brings his vast expertise to helping you guide the product and software development process more effectively and efficiently. Help eliminate the ambiguity into which so many software projects are borne, where vision and planning documents are essentially thrown over the wall to developers. This high-level reference describes how to use Scrum to manage complex technology projects in detail, combining expert insights with examples and case studies based on Scrum. Emphasizing practice over theory, this book explores every aspect of using Scrum, focusing on driving projects for maximum return on investment.</span>

                    <span>The book was an easy read and provided a fair but light treatment of Scrum.  The numerous examples provide a good illustration of some of the key concepts of the method and help in better understanding implementation issues and lessons learned.  This being said, a complete understanding of Scrum requires additional reading above and beyond this book, and most importantly a good solid (if not many) attempt at applying it in the real world.  For individuals interested in Scrum, I would also recommend a very active discussion group to which the book's author and many other Scrum aficionados contribute regularly: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumdevelopment/</span>

                    <span>This book helped me understand more details about how to implement Scrum. The rules of Scrum are simple. Apply these rules in your context can be tricky. I found that the case studies that thread throughout the book really helped me to understand some of the nuances of the Scrum process. And if you want a checklist, there is a appendix that summarizes the rules of Scrum. 
<br />
<br />This is a great book if you want to learn about Scrum as a project management tool, or if you have been trying to use Scrum and want a chance to renew your understanding. </span>

                    <span>Ken Schwaber, the co-founder of Scrum, presents a text of case studies based on his experience helping teams implement Scrum.<p>Each case is a mini-retrospective focusing on topics such as planning a scrum project, project reporting, team formation, and team member responsibilites.  Ken presents the situation, the application of a scrum practice, the lessons learned, and a conclusion.  The chapters can be browsed and read out of order.<p>For those not familiar with Scrum, there is a useful appendix which covers the rules and practices of Scrum.<p>For those who learn through case studies, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>If you have read any of Dale Carnegie's books you will see that all you are getting is a series of anecdotes. It takes a while to get to the essence of the book, where a few pages could have done that in the upfront chapters, then the gumpf could have filled the rest. If you think about it, you are a manager with little time who wants to implement the system, analogous to the scrum master holding the 15 minute daily meeting: I feel the book should have been written like that - have the chapter overview, have the introductory facts ie rules then do the work.</span>

                    <span>Our organization recently implemented Scrum, and although the<br>Beedle/Schwaber book was great to get us off the ground on Scrum<br>theory, we immediately had many questions once we actually tried to implement it in real life projects. I agree with the notion that Scrum is conceptually easy to understand, but actually quite complex to implement correctly. The scrum  forum has been helpful, but we really needed a cohesive reference of situational problems. The APMWS book really hit the nail on the head and delivered what we needed the most: a practical guide to Scrum with anecdotes and "what happens if..." situations from real world Scrum implementations. This came just in time for us, and we are feeling more confident for our upcoming certification class.<p>The appendices in the back are also very helpful. The "Rules"<br>appendix is perfect as a quick introduction to Scrum for new Team<br>members and Product Owners. It's actually quite detailed for being such a short appendix.<p>Also, for newbies the three main Roles are very nicely explained. We had some misconceptions that were immediately addressed by this book.<p>Anyway, from a Scrum newbie that is faced with implementation issues, thanks to Ken for putting together a real world implementation guide.</span>
