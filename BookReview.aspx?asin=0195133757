                    <span>this book has 15,000 entries and over 350,000 synonyms and a writer's toolkit. With Oxford, we all know how respected it is, but what impressed me most was the superior print face. This thesaurus did not make me go blind trying to read it. The paper is high quality that will withstand constant use of a writer, and provides excellent contrast, and in easy to read fonts.<P>I am sorry, don't care how good the dictionary is, if it is not made to prevent eyestrain it gets low marks for me. This one gets an A+ and a big THANK YOU for that quality.</span>

                    <span>Assiduously edited this thesaurus offers up to the minute listings of words we use, hear or read everyday. Included are 15,000 main entries and some 350,000 synonyms with notations that make clear the subtle nuances of inference among several closely related words.<P>Headwords, presented in alphabetical order, are in eye friendly bold print. Following each headword is its part of speech, such as "accredited" is followed by "adjective."<P>When a certain word has the same spelling but a different meaning, which is known as a homograph, each meaning is treated as a separate word. Thus "bank" us found as "a grassy slope" and as "financial institution" under separate headings.<P>Synonyms are included in each listing, and the volume contains a punctuation guide, a usage guide, as well as a listing of easily confused words.<P>At sea as to the proper usage of "alternate" and "alternative"? Just keep this handy volume at the ready.<P>Wordsmiths will delight in the clarity and presentations of words in this thesaurus, and all of us will benefit from its use.</span>

                    <span>I found this thesaurus to be an excellent addition to any reference collection. It is comprehensive and takes all synonyms into account. There is a definite American bias but is serves it's purpose. With 15,000 main entries and over 350,00 synonyms, this thesaurus is the only one you will need.</span>
