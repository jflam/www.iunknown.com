It is, scientists say, the worst global extinction crisis in the last sixty-five million years -- the hemorrhage of thirty thousand irreplaceable life-forms each year. And yet, every so often one of these lost species resurfaces, such as the Indian forest owlet, considered extinct for more than a century when it was rediscovered in 1997. Like heirlooms plucked from a burning house, they are gifts to an increasingly impoverished world.<br><br>In <i>The Ghost with Trembling Wings</i>, naturalist Scott Weidensaul pursues these stories of loss and recovery, of endurance against the odds, and of surprising resurrections. The search takes Weidensaul to the rain forests of the Caribbean and Brazil in pursuit of long-lost birds, to the rugged mountains of Tasmania for the striped, wolflike marsupial known as the thylacine, to cloning laboratories where scientists struggle to re-create long-extinct animals, and even to the moorlands and tidy farms of England on the trail of mysterious black panthers whose existence seems to depend on the faith of those looking for them. <i>The Ghost with Trembling Wings</i> is a book of exploration and a survey of the frontiers of modern science and wildlife biology. It is, in the end, the story of our desire for a wilder, bigger, more complete world.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This is a very unique book about mankind's relationship with endangered and extinct species, from both a naturalist and ethical perspective. As more and more species become extinct through the actions of humans, sightings of supposedly extinct creatures remain common. Is this because those animals really aren't extinct, with small populations still surviving in remote locations; or is it just wishful thinking? Weidensaul finds some of both in this book. Some regions of the world are still so remote that they are yielding new species (even some large mammals like in Southeast Asia) and revealing survivors of animals that were thought to be extinct. On the other hand, people may think they see romantic and mythical creatures out of subconscious longing for a world that is still mysterious and dangerous, and maybe even evolutionary guilt for destroying species forever. A related issue to that subconscious longing is the creatures of cyrptozoology, which explains the never-ending reports of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. Weidensaul dwells both on the ethical issues behind such wishful thinking, and also on the real science of bringing species back from the brink. He examines the ethics of using genetic engineering and cloning to save endangered species - and recreating extinct species, a new craze of questionable value. Weidensaul also takes us on entertaining searches for supposedly extinct creatures that have a reasonable chance of still existing, like the cone-billed tanager in Brazil or the strange thylacine in Tasmania. The only problem here is Weidensaul's lack of closure on many of the ethical issues that he raises, but this book is still a rewarding look into mankind's always complicated relationship with nature.</span>

                    <span>Scott Weidensaul has written a fascinating, page-turning exploration of the complexities of species survival and extinction. From the first chapter, a narrative account of his personal search for the probably extinct Semper's Warbler on St. Lucia, to the last chapter where he may, or may not, have found the never before seen female cone-billed tanager, this book never let go of my imagination. Most of the sought-after species in this book are never found, but a few, such as the coelacanth and the almost-aurochs, are. The author looks for big cats rumored to be living in the English countryside, and tells of the accidental rediscovery of the Australian night parrot. He provides one of the few intelligent treatises on the Loch Ness Monster and other cryptobiological "species." Even though most possibly extinct animals are never found, it's the hunt for them that excites both the author and the reader. The often suspenseful narrative is peppered with history and sharp observations as well as varied opinions. The language is rich with visual and engaging details, the kind that makes you feel as though you've entered into the "land of the lost." Trust me, you won't fall asleep reading this book. This is lay science as it should be, full of mysteries and questions, both accessible and intelligent. The author's good humor and pithy insights lend a friendly tone to his science. For example, when he is fighting insects - in his ears, eyes, and under his watch band - during a frantic search for a specific flock of birds, he writes, "There is a reason lost species are lost in the first place. Sometimes the reasons are weighty and formidable, like civil unrest, impenetrable mountains, or bandit warlords who use visitors for target practice. Sometimes they are more prosaic, like bad roads and worse information. And sometimes the reason is sweat bees - too many sweat bees." This witty, conversational tone makes The Ghost With Trembling Wings as fun to read as it is instructional.<P>I highly recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in conservation, evolution, field biology, and environmentalism; however, you don't need to know a thing about the preceding fields to enjoy The Ghost With Trembling Wings. All you need is a healthy curiosity and the time to indulge it.</span>

                    <span>I read quite a bit and this book is definitely one of the reasons why. It is a great read. I could not get enough about the thievery going on at museums in the past to fill collections... nor about the "Tully Monster" hoax put on by a close scientific colleague. I was sad through parts of it, laughing out loud in others, I just couldn't put it down.<P>And finally, it was real interesting to read some good info on all the talk about cloning this and that, from Mammoths to Thylacines. Scott Weidensaul is an excellent science writer and I highly recommend this book.<P>I am going to classify it in my library as real cryptozoology, and that is not a bad word in my home.</span>

                    <span>We're facing the worst global extinction crisis in over sixty million years; yet once in a while a species presumed lost re-emerges. In Ghost With Trembling Wings, naturalist Scott Weidensaul pursues these stories of loss and recovery, traveling around the world in pursuit of animals that have recovered against all odds. Included in the search are visits to labs attempting to recreate longextinct animals. A lively, hopeful discussion.</span>

                    <span>Weidensaul's book is at once a narrative of his searches for lost species and an educational piece on science, genetics, environmental impact and a dozen other areas that affect the habitat and adaptability of various animal species. "The Ghost with Trembling Wings" examines all the possible scenarios when dealing with lost species. There are ample examples of a species declared extinct but suddenly one is captured, found, or sometimes a dead one found (as was the case of the Australian night parrot thought extinct for many years until one was found as roadkill). He also covers sightings of unknown creatures (Bigfoot, Loch Ness) as well as sightings of creatures whose very existence seems to depend more on the desire of the observer to see them than on anything else. All aspects of this area of research are covered including current directions in cloning, captive breeding, disease, and even the effect of the political climate. <P>Travel with Weidensaul as he goes to the most remote areas of the earth in search of lost species and provides an inside look into this field as well as those who would dedicate their lives to resurrecting the dead and lost. An fascinating book that anyone interested in the area of finding living specimens of "extinct" species would be sure to enjoy.</span>
