                <span id="Label1"><i>Drinking: A Love Story</i> is journalist Caroline Knapp's powerful, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling account of her twenty years as a functioning<br>alcoholic.  Knapp drank through her years at Brown University, and through an award-winning career as a lifestyle editor and columnist.  Publicly, she was a<br>dutiful daughter, attentive friend, and a sophisticated professional. Privately, she was drinking herself into oblivion, trapped in destructive love relationships--until a series of personal crises forced her to confront and, ultimately, break free of the "liquid armor" she'd used for most of her life.</span>

                    <span>I've spent 26 of the past 28 years as a sober, happy, recovering alcoholic. This is the best-written account I've seen of how it feels, how we deceive ourselves and others, the struggle of secrecy and denial, the battle of recovery, etc. <BR> I found it very much like a long, heart to heart conversation with Caroline, and was sad when she stopped talking to me. I wanted more! <BR> I loved it so much I immediately ordered eight copies for friends and family, and planned to write Caroline to thank her. Sounds like she'd be a delightful dinner companion! Broke my heart to read tonight that she died of lung cancer last summer...alas, probably from all those cigarettes with the booze.<BR> I find it fascinating that 95% of reviewers think it is very well-written, magnificent,compelling---and 5% think it is awful, repetitious, boring. Can't help wondering which are alcoholic! <BR> If you or anyone in your family has a problem, or thinks they may have a problem with alcohol, this book may save your life.</span>

                    <span>Once I started reading it, I had trouble putting this book down (kind of like my experience with alcohol!). This book is powerful and compelling. Alcoholism claims many victims, as any Friday night visit to an ER will show. However, this book gives a most insightful look at the emotional and physical damage this disease causes to the alcoholic and loved ones closest to them. Non-alcoholics may not "get" the descriptiions of compulsions, mind games, and sense of powerlessness felt by alcoholics, but they can certainly understand the pain caused to lovers, parents, and others close to the addicted person.<P>This book is sometimes funny, often sad, occasionally verges on shocking - pretty standard experiences of alcoholics, but often misunderstood by others. Although it drags a bit in the middle, time will likely make this work a classic narritive of the alcoholic experience. <P>I encourage anyone who has been touched by this disease, either alcoholics or those close to them, to read this book. Due to the detailed description of drinking situations, I would not suggest someone in the first few weeks of recovery to read this, however.<P>Thank you Caroline, for your courage to share your experience, strength, and hope with us.</span>

                    <span>I read this book initially as a practicing alcoholic in denial, and then in early recovery. I loved the book the first time recognizing the honesty and courage. The author's style was very pleasing. Now, I appreciate the honesty, courage, and accuracy. I go to A.A. meetings every day, and A.A. is my family now. I wondered, "What could this book offer that I wasn't already getting?" The fact is that this book offered wisdom I hadn't heard before, such as, in decision making, how to tell the difference between the alcoholic alternative and the better choice. I re-read this two days ago, and used it today. I won't spill the beans. You'll have to read the book to learn.<P>In A.A., sponsors are always the same sex as the sponsee. I wondered what insight I could get from a female alcoholic. I learned tht this is not an issue. I strongly recommend this book to everyone.</span>

                    <span>My guess is this woman wanted to write a book about her alcoholism. But her publisher said (just as mine did when I tried to write a memoir about my heroin addiction) "No, no, no. People do not buy books about women who have drug or alcohol problems. It is not considered masochistic or self-effacing enough. Everyone knows drunks and junkies like to have fun, and people only like reading about women when they torture themselves." So Caroline Knapp decided to compromise--discuss the tiresome travails of anorexia ("It's about control!" "I looked at all the women, particularly this one 120 pound, 5 foot 7 woman, and thought about how fat she was.", etc. etc.) and the far more interesting tale of her alcoholism. In my own research (both academic and personal; including many, many talks with fellow female addicts), we have a WAY lower rate of eating disorders than the non-addict female population. Part of what makes addiction such a tough snare to crawl out of is that the addict likes to feel good even as her life is falling down in the process. So she drinks or does heroin to avoid DTs or withdrawal. If she was that concerned with how much she melds with society's image of the perfect female (with which anorexics are obsessed), she WOULD NOT drink or drug, because using one's body for pleasure, not pain, is considered a male not a female activity in our society. Therefore, I am left only with two options: Is Knapp a phony drunk or yet another female addict who was rendered invisible by a society that refuses to admit that women love escaping into the world of drink and drugs as much as men?</span>

                    <span>I myself have had a drinking problem in the past and when I was trying to sober up I bought this book and let me tell you, I thought I was reading my life. I am just glad that she had the guts to come out in public and tell her story. I would have loved to have met her. It's a shame she died before her time was up.</span>
