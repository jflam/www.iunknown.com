                <span id="Label1">This 40-minute documentary was one of the first commercially released DVDs. It should serve as a welcome introduction for those who are interested in but know little about the tropical rainforest and the process of deforestation. The script, however, provides little in the way of concrete information regarding the images on screen at any given time. The intended effect appears to be poetic (&agrave; la Henry David Thoreau), but the narration tends to veer toward the New Age. This could prove frustrating for those who would like to know exactly what species of plant or animal is being featured and what makes it unique to the rainforest. Further, indigenous peoples and their relationship to the world's rainforests is not explored.<p> The documentary is narrated by actor Geoffrey Holder (Ray the Sun from <I>Bear in the Big Blue House</I>), who has a deep voice with a pleasant tone, somewhat akin to that of James Earl Jones. His thick Trinidad accent, however, can be somewhat hard to understand despite the clear diction. A couple of scientists provide supplementary narration, but it is not sufficiently clear who they are or what their relationship is to the rainforest. The film ends with a fitting musical number, "Mbube (Wimoweh) (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)" by the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. <I>--Kathleen Fennessy</I></span>

                    <span>This is the WORST documentary I have ever watched. Anyhow i consider iMAX documentaries sub par to National Geographic and BBC documentaries. Given that leeway, this documentary still sets new standards. New stardards in terms of the worst documentary made.<P>The narrator sounds like hes overdosed on prozac, there is no theme whatsoever (they take a rainforest, take the first person off the street to narrate, and an IMAX camera: where they spent all their money). I was so severly disappointed. The DVD transfer is nothing spectacular.<P>Which brings me to my next point: IMAX documentaries are subpar in terms of filming and content and narration to the aforementioned documentaries. They are only popular becuase of the film and projection technuiques of the BIG screen IMAX theatres. Once they are transferred to DVD, the effect is lost and they appear as inferior, B-class documentaries. Stick to some BBC or National geographic documentary.<P>I think the grass growing in my lawn is more fascinating than this lacklustre piece on a "rainforest". Useless.</span>

                    <span>It would be better advised if you rent this film from Netflix first before you make your purchase here. As the other reviewers have noted, the transfer from film to DVD can vary, and in this particular case, it was clearly poorly done. It's a terrible shame that this beautiful IMAX film was given such a second-rate transfer.<P>Normally I would end it here, but as some perceptive readers might have noticed, a vocal creationist has entered our midst, voicing his objections to the theory of evolution being used so matter-of-factly. Now I certainly don't want to belittle Dan, he can certainly believe or disbelieve whatever he wishes. However he went beyond just stating his discomfort with the theory and went out of his way to draw out a couple objections to Evolution, in effect distorted the evidence and philosophical foundations of the theory. Thus, here entails my problem.<P>Dan complains that the IMAX film, while giving references to evolution, never attempted to provide evidence that evolution had taken place. Is this really surprising? Perhaps Dan should ask himself if just conceivably that the theory might be so well established in modern biology, so well documented in scientific literature, that no rational person questions it today (i.e. such as cell theory, or population genetics), therefore any exposition on "proving" evolution would simply become superfluous. Just an idea Dan.<P>If Dan is so dissatisfied with the rather simplistic explanations given in the film, perhaps he should actually read some of the evolutionary literature that is readily available (here at Amazon no less). A great text would be Douglas J. Futuyma's _Evolutionary Biology_, or Ridley's _Evolution_, and a few excellent popular works would include Steve Jones' _Darwin's Ghost_, Kenneth Miller's _Finding Darwin's God_, Donald Johanson's _From Lucy to Language_, and anything by Steve Gould or Richard Dawkins.</span>

                    <span>Completely useless piece of film making, why did IMAX bother? Picture quality bears no resemblance to other IMAX productions such as "Africa The Serengeti" and the transfer to DVD has been done very poorly. The background sounds of the rainforest are completely marred by a terribly delivered commentary which sounds as if it were intended for 5 year olds. Any adult of average intelligence will learn nothing from the commentary that they didn't already know. Don't waste your money.</span>
