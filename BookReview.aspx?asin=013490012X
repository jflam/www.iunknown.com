                <span id="Label1">The classic programming text <I>Unix Network Programming</I> has been updated by author W. Richard Stevens to encompass three new volumes. There have been a few changes in the computing world since 1990 (the year the original was published), and Stevens has taken the opportunity to create a complete set of reference manuals for programmers of all skill levels.<p> The first volume, <I>Networking APIs: Sockets and XTI</I>, covers everything you need to know to make your programs communicate over networks. Stevens covers everything from writing your programs to be compatible with both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6, to raw sockets, routing sockets, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), broadcasting/multicasting, routing sockets, server internals, and more, plus a section covering Posix threads.<p> Stevens also notes compatibility issues with different operating systems so that readers can create code that is more portable, and he offers plenty of advice on how to make code more robust. <I>--Doug Beaver</I></span>

                    <span>This is one of the best network programming books I have read. The level of detail was perfect not to deep yet detailed enough to make the information useful. The examples were easy to understand and helped guide me in the right direction. He pointed out areas where you might run into portability problems. This book is a must. If you need greater detail TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2 is a great follow on book.</span>

                    <span>The book is very good for touching on quite a few topics in Network programming and doing so in a concise way. However, when reading the book I often felt as if I wasn't learning socket programming so much as learning how to access Steven's personal API to socket programming. When Stevens introduces a new concept he will immediately afterwords introduce a wrapper function that he uses to do it 'correctly'. From then on he will continue to use this wrapper function throughout the rest of the book whenever he needs to use the stanard library function. In fact, in any 10 lines of source in the book it seems like there will be 7 wrapper functions. This of course makes it very hard to use the book as a reference unless you are resigned to using Steven's wrapper library in all of your projects. In several cases, when attempting to reference some concept I ended up flipping through several pages in different chapters to look up definitions and prototypes for these functions in different place, and then diging deeper into the function to decipher what was going on. All I really wanted was a quick answer to a specific question concerning a socket. I can't deny that what he ends up with is a nicely done system for working with sockets, but I don't feel a general programming text should take this approach. I'll be shopping for a different socket book to use as a desk reference.</span>
