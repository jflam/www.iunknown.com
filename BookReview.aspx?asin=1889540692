                    <span>Street strategies is a collection of "stories" that are part or all of articles written by David Hough. The stories are entertaining and similar (if not identical in some cases) to stories contained in Proficient Motorcycling.<p>This is more of a waiting room kind of book. Very short chapters with cartoon diagrams  that give the reader insight into the type of dangers that he/she might encounter in the real world of motorcycle riding and some advice on how to avoid them. It lacks the detail that makes Proficient Motorcycling and More Proficient Motorcycling such excellent training guides for riders. <p>This book might make a good stocking stuffer for someone who has already read the other books but if your looking for something for a starting/experienced rider pick one of the other two books (Proficient Motorcycling for the starter, "More" for the more experienced rider).</span>

                    <span>This is not a bad book at all. Just by knowing its author any rider can tell he/she will find good learning material inside. But it is not more than a well organized and decorated synthesis of same author's Proficient Motorcycling couple of books. I strongly recommend those as the Bible for street riders. Anyway, if you like, you can take this nice compilation, it's a good choice as a night table book.</span>

                    <span>I am a big fan of David's and am on my third time through his Proficient Motorcycling (a must read for all motorcyclists).  I bought this book on David's reputation primarily and must say I am a bit diaappointed.  While these pages may make great sidebars for other books, after a while it seemed like I was reading the same thing over and over again (be alert, be aware, use caution) in each an every scenario.  Some may find the scenarios insightful.  I found them repetitious and wanting.<p>Sorry, David, but don't worry; I am ordering your More Proficient Motorcycling right now.</span>

                    <span>This is not a bad book, but don't make the mistake I made of getting both this and Proficient Motorcycling, also by Hough.  Proficient Motorcycling contains all the information in this book and then a lot more, and should be required reading for anyone who wants to drive a motorcycle.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">Great book to help refresh you of all the possible dangers</div>

                    <span>we motorcyclists face out there.  Sure alot of the situations the book covers are common sense, but lets all face it, when was the last time you thought a loose wooden board on the railroad tracks could be hazardous?  And for the price, just being reminded and instructed on ways to overcome these seemingly non-dangerous situations can be is worth ever penny.<p>Is this book as good as Proficient Motorcycling, perhaps not, if it was I would have given it 5 stars.  But's it's worth every penny and you WILL be amazed at the sheer amount of situations covered in this book.<p>So basically, make sure you have a Dot/Snell helmet, good gloves, nice protective boots, a good riding jacket, some nice riding pants and all of David's books and you will be one of the safest riders on the road...<p>Ride safe...</span>
