                <span id="Label1"><p>They came from everywhere across the nation to be part of the most elite fighting team in the world: the U.S. Navy SEALs. At a no-frills training base on the shores of the Pacific Ocean the weak and unworthy would be quickly eliminated -- and the strong would learn the true meaning of pain, fatigue, and endurance. The regimen was brutal and legendary, designed to punish and steel the body and push the spirit to its very limits. And at the end of one incredible week of torture those without the mettle would be broken and discarded ... and those destined for greatness would know it.</p> <p>From Command Master Chief Dennis Chalker -- "plankowner" of the fabled SEAL Team Six and himself a survivor of "Hell Week" -- comes a riveting novel of blistering authenticity that takes readers through the grueling BUD/s training process -- as a handful of America's best are miraculously transformed from mere warriors ... to Navy SEALs.</p></span>

                    <span>I would recommend this read to anyone interested in the Seals or the Teams Training in general. The 5 1/2 days of hellweek are described day by day, and done so wonderfully. I would have liked to read more about the rest of the training; however, as the title implies "hell week" is the narrow subject. I plan on enlisting soon and am tryign to gather as much 1st phase of BUDS information as possible. This is a good one. Its also a good read to get you going and motiviated as well.</span>

                    <span>A lot of good information is available on Navy SEALS, and this book adds to that. It gives detailed information on expectations to make it through HELL WEEK from an insiders view point. Dennis Chalker has a way of writing that is subtle, but powerful. This book may be an autobiography of his BUDS experience, and is a valuable resource for any person who wants to understand HELL WEEK from someone who has been there. From his writing style, I found myself struggling with the Class 78 to get thru every evolution described and immense relief when they were declared "secured". I also enjoyed Dennis Chalker's first book "One Perfect Op". Some readers may expect some kind of movie glitz when they read about Navy SEALS, but the true effort is described in this book- pain, determination, tenacity, stress beyond ordinary imagination, but ultimately the immense pride and respect that comes with the accomplishment of completing Hell Week.</span>

                    <span>This book might appeal to SEAL wannabes, but anyone else should skip it. This is advertised as a novel, but there is no plot or storyline anywhere in sight. It is another of the many books recently published along the line of "See how tough the SEALS are". While I have the utmost respect for the US Navy SEALS, this book is simply another recitation of BUD/S and Hell Week.<BR>SEAL wannabes and SEAL fans might apppreciate it because the author is well-known in the SEAL community. This book appears to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's own BUD/S experience. There are a lot better SEAL books out there.</span>
