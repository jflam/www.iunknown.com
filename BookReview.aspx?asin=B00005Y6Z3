                    <span>This is just an hour of nothing but scenery from the Big Sur region of California, just as the description implies. No narration, no pointless features... Just Big Sur. <P>If you want to see how great Big Sur really is, then you should go there... If you are skeptical, however, watch this DVD, as it will take you through some of the majestic bliss that Big Sur has to offer. If you have already been there, this DVD is a must have, because it will remind you of how great this place really is.<P>The soft music that accompanies this production is very pleasing and offers an appealing sense of awe when cued to the video. The soothing audio greatly adds to the visual experience while not completely taking over. <P>This video contains the many various land and oceanscapes of Big Sur, including waterfalls, lush green hills, vast coastline, beautiful sunsets, wildlife, forests, and much more. <P>If you are a fan of Big Sur, or just nature in general, this DVD is a must have. You will not be dissapointed!</span>

                    <span>I must say this was all I expected and more. To hear the waves crashing the beautiful coast line with the perfectly matched soothing music. The production of this DVD is top notch and well thought out. For those that have been to the Big Sur get ready for a mental trip when you walked the coast. Those that have not been you will want to go when this is over so pack your bags, thats how good this DVD on Big Sur is in my opininion. You wont go wrong with this purchase its well spent money...I own Yellowstone which is wonderful also and just ordered the rest of the products by them: Yosemite, Glacier, Grand Canyon, National Parks of Alaska, Bryce & Zion</span>

                    <span>Just received and watched "Big Sur:California Coast" - Excellent photography - Good music. The first thing I did was to look for the button that would separate the music from the magnificent sounds of nature. No separation possible. The scenes while beautifully photographed move much too quickly from one beautiful shot to the next. Instead of being soothing I felt like I had just watch a music video from MTV or VH1. There are all well and good in their place. But I was looking for a soothing experience but ultimately felt like a marionette. I immediately went to my dvd supplier and looked up additional Ron Roy productions. They give you the option of natural sound and music OR Nature's own sounds alone! If you want postcard presentation buy Big Sur. If you want to be soothed buy Ron Roy.</span>
