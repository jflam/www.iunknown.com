                <span id="Label1">A holistic approach to harnessing a company's processes to achieve true customer satisfaction<br>    Every move that a corporation makes is a mixture of input, action, and output-in short, a process. To keep customers, employees, and shareholders happy, corporate management must juggle conflicting priorities. These competing priorities result in conflicting processes. To help achieve true customer satisfaction, manage-ment needs tools that allow for a holistic approach to analyzing these processes. This book provides that tool. It shows corporations how to analyze and enhance their critical processes in order to deliver the highest level of service to their internal and external customers. Providing a clear understanding of what process mapping can do for a company as well as practical applications for each step in process mapping, this useful guide outlines a proven method for assuring better processes and building a more customer-focused company.</span>

                    <span>We, Optimal CAE, Inc., have used this process for the last few years and it works GREAT!  Ignore the previous feedback!  The interview approach, if done correctly, allows you a behind the scenes look at what is really happening.  Currently, we process map ALL of the Ford Motor Company assembly and stamping plants and this method has helped us identify disconnects even in organizations of this size.<p>Chad Mockerman...</span>

                    <span>I have never written a review in my life, but for this book, I will make an exception.<p>I am a consultant.  Most of my firm's (SAI Consulting, LLC) work is focused on the design, documentation, and management of processes, as they relate to improving our clients' operating and financial performance.  We are experts at process mapping and the proper use of process mapping in a broad range of strategic and improvement initiatives.<p>In fairness, there are some good points to this book, but there are also some serious flaws in the approach to process mapping it recommends:<p>1.  The use of individual, isolated interviews to develop an understanding of the current state of the process is a very bad idea, particularly on large, cross-functional processes.  The interviewer will chase his tail listening to different versions of the same process. The best approach is a cross-functional team.  We have found that teams do a much better job of exposing the real process, and they produce much greater insight and reality into the process.<p>2.  Likewise, the use of the interviewer to analyze the current state of the process and either redesign the process or design a new process is a very bad idea.  People will not settle for a method that limits their input to the current state - they want to have a say in the redesign or new design.  The authors say the experts 'are the people who perform the work', but they don't let those experts provide the solution?<p>3.  The vertical design of the process maps is not as useful or practical as a horizontal cross-functional flowchart.  There are plenty of reasons to choose horizontal over vertical, but - if for no other reason - processes need to be depicted horizontally in order to break away from the functional mindset of most organizations.<p>3.  The treatment of operating measures is almost useless.<p>4.  The book explains the use of 'drill down' maps to expose increasing levels of process detail.  These are very difficult to create and maintain without software specifically designed to automate the drill-down structure.  Yet, there is no mention of the use of IDEF0 software that would make the production and maintenance of these process models a snap.<p>My recommendation:  Buy the book if you don't know much about process mapping, but don't stop there.  If anyone reading this review has questions, I would be glad to discuss them.  <p>Fletcher L.

                    <span>I have been looking for an effective analytical tool that would help me make get a good understanding of my company's business processes.  This book hit the mark by providing me with step by step guidance.  Especially helpful was the expense payment process example as well as the hints it provides on what to avoid while performing a process mapping.  Overall it was worth the money.</span>
