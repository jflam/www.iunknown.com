                <span id="Label1">A Nobel Prize-winning scientist and a leading brain researcher show how the brain creates conscious experience In A Universe of Consciousness, Gerald Edelman builds on the radical ideas he introduced in his monumental trilogy-Neural Darwinism, Topobiology, and The Remembered Present-to present for the first time an empirically supported full-scale theory of consciousness. He and the neurobiolgist Giulio Tononi show how they use ingenious technology to detect the most minute brain currents and to identify the specific brain waves that correlate with particular conscious experiences. The results of this pioneering work challenge the conventional wisdom about consciousness.</span>

                    <span>Edelmans new theory of consciousness is, as I expected,impresive and quite apealing. Reentry is again in the spotlight, but this time in support of the Dynamic Core hypothesis. This hypothesis is a step foward from other less specific neuronal assembly theories of consciousness, and overall, I found it convincing. I did not give this book 5 stars because at the end of the book, Edelman moves frome concrete science to speculation, and because qualia as neural dimension space discriminations is far from being a convincing model for qualia. It is grounded on neurology though, and for that it is much better than many others. It also is able to diferenciate between conscious and unconscious proceses, among many other advantages. At the end, I believe the strongest aspect of the dynamic core is the way Edelman and Tononi use it to directly explain the phenomenology of consciousness. The introduction is also excellent, and the whole attempt is an adequately built bridge between the neurology and phenomenology of consciousness.</span>

                    <span>How does matter become imagination? How could consciousness arise as an emergent property of complex brains. This is by far the most exciting question one can ask ( at least in my opinion). It's a quest set by the unified collective brain in order to understand itself on lower hierarchial levels. <BR>The authors do a marvelous job in overviewing the philosophical history and implications of such a question. It is extremely enlightening to read through the first few chapters and get a feel of how significant the question is and where the "knot is tangeled"<BR>In the next few chapters, the authors present their hypotheses on this issue, with some real mathematical tools to test them. They also bring about some results that support their hypotheses. I found the concept of a "functional cluster" along with the statistical models that describe it extremely novel and creative.<BR>Reading this book was a great experience for me. A source of insipration I would say. A few things I found a bit unsatisfying were:<BR>1.Reentry as a solution for the binding problem-- I thought this was merely speculative in nature<BR>2.Untangling the knot-- It hasn't been untangled! Actually the authors say it all throughout this book: Describing something does not give any clue on how it results in subjective, first person, experience<BR>However, I still found it a great book. I would recommend reading it along with Dr. Crick's work</span>

                    <span>There is no doubt in my mind, after reading this book, that the authors have done excellent scientific work and made very interesting discoveries. On the other hand, it has certain problems.<P>To start with, it seems clear that they do not have a full grasp of the philosophical problems they are attempting to resolve - or if they do, they avoid going into the stickier points. This is not necessarily a reason to condemn the book; there are huge volumes of philosophy on this subject, and it would be futile to try and fit a quick resolution into one small volume already full of other facts. Nonetheless, they probably should have avoided the philosophical aspect entirely if all they were going to do is attack the mind/body problem in a way that arguably does nothing but shift the terms around a bit to produce the appearance of a resolution. There is essentially nothing new here, philosophically, and they certainly had more than enough interesting material for a book without attempting this.<P>A second thing that disappointed me is the lack of contrasting points of view. It seems unfair to ask an author to present a summary of theories which argue against his own, but in fact it's in the best interest of an author/scientist. What are the points of contention between theories, and what are the alternate explanations? This gives the author an ideal chance to explain why their theory is superior, what it has that the others lack... and in turn it gives the reader the chance to be convinced (or not) by the force of the argument, which is always more intellectually satisfying than being led by the nose.<P>Stylistically, also, it could have used a bit of revision. Long, complex sentences are fine (great, even) for something like Proust. When you populate those sentences - even if they're perfect grammatically - with large and generally unfamiliar scientific terms, it can be quite awkward. This happened just frequently enough to be a nuisance, as far as I was concerned.<P>So, apart from these criticisms, the subject material is still interesting. I would be inclined, however, to look for a more recent title by these authors (or others) on the subject. A lot can be discovered in a few years, and hopefully the experience they gained in writing this book will help them produce a work with a bit more polish.</span>

                    <span>This is a very important book. Although the authors recognize that there is still awfully much tot do, their analyses and hypotheses are a big step forward in our understanding of consciousness.<BR>It is certainly not an easy book. One should have a basic knowledge of the constitution and the working of the brain.<BR>I, personally, would have liked more concrete examples, like those for instance in the book of C.J. Lumsden and E.O. Wilson 'Promethean Fire'.<P>This book doesn't explain how consciousness arises, but what it is (properties) and how it works.<BR>Consciousness is not a thing or a property, but a process (of neural interactions).<BR>One of the reviewers here compares consciousness to a car. But a car is a thing, not a process.<BR>Consciousness is a private, integrated, coherent, differentiated, informative, continually changing process.<BR>The authors make also the opportune distinction between primary (animal, unconscious) and higher-order consciousness (the ability to be conscious of being conscious).<P>Crucial for the authors are re-entrant interactions, degeneracy (recategorical memory), and a part of the brain 'the dynamic core' (a subset of neuronal groups responsible for consciousness).<BR>The dynamic core provides then a rationale for distinguishing conscious processes from unconscious ones (e.g. the circuits that regulate blood pressure).<P>This book shows clearly that the brain is not a computer and that it doesn't work as a computer program or algorithm.<BR>It has also very important philisophical consequences, which the authors summarize as follows: being is prior to describing, selection is prior to logic and doing is prior to understanding.<P>I also fully agree with the authors that Darwin's theory is the most ideologically significant scientific theory ever written.<P>Although this book is rather technical, it should not be missed by those interested in the real nature of the conscious process.<P>I should also recommend the work of V. Ramachandran 'Ghosts in the Brain', for its multiple examples of (un)conscious behaviour and its philosphical implications (the body/mind problem).</span>

                    <span>The title quotes A. Damasio from the front cover. <P>In my view Gerald Edelman has the best theory of consciousness there is, by far. It is strongly grounded in biology, evolution, the nature of the brain and nervous system. Firstly, consciousness is not a thing, it's a process. Consciousness is private, unified, and informative. It is private because no two are alike and its workings are dependent on its own history. It is unified or integrated because it arises from a variety of sources, e.g. the different senses and a body which provides a built-in value system. The unified integration is the result of global, reciprocal mappings among diverse groups of neurons. It is informative and highly differentiated because of these various sources. <P>Conscious awareness arises from a lot of unconscious processing, along the lines of information theory (a branch of mathematics) with importance to the organism driving what is selected.<P>Edelman holds there are two levels of consciousness -- primary and higher-order. The primary level generates a mental scene with much diverse information for the purpose of directing present or near-term behaviour. It includes perceptual categorization, but no sense of self or use of language. Other animals have it, too. Higher-consciousness is built atop the primary level, includes a sense of self, awareness of a past and future, and language capability. It is supported by the evolutionary newer structures of the brain.<P>It gets pretty technical at times. There is quite a bit about the brain and neural processes. Information theory is introduced. An earlier book, The Remembered Present, might be a better introduction to his work. In any case, A Universe of Consciousness is founded on his previous works, but adds a lot more. It is a mighty blend of a firm empirical ground and a highly integrated and coherent theory.</span>
