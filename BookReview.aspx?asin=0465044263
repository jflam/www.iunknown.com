                    <span>This book is simply a MUST for anyone interested in the theory of evolution, including, and especially for, those human beings who are curious about the origins of their present constitutions, both biological and psychological, and who want to be informed of the most up-to-date natural and scientific explanations about them, rather than to continue to lie ignorantly, though comfortably, in the consolation of religious or supernatural dogmas. <P>I cannot think of anyone else who is able to present all levels of the complexity and subtely of the process of evolution and the theory of natural selection with such precision and clarity than Ernst Mayr, a venerable scientist, "the world's greatest living evolutionary biologist" (Steven Jay Gould), "the Darwin of the 20th century" (New York Times).<P>This book is not only consisted of rigorous arguments, but also full of compelling illrustrative examples picked up from the diversity of living beings on our earth of various geological ages (from the fossil record to modern human beings) and places in support of those arguments. <BR>Mayr's knowledge in biology is so comprehensive and his narrative so straighforward and lucid that he recounts those examples of evolution history just like a grandfather telling some everyday stories to his grandsons. <P>And I especially recommend those who once found or still find the so-called "GENE EYES' VIEW" (as popularized by Richard Dawkins) attractive shall seriously study this great work. And then he or she, I think, will soon discover that how imprecise and misguiding is the metaphorical language of those sociobiologists in their description of almost every parts of the process of evolution. This book shall at least provoke our cautions towards the trend of reductionism and atomism in various branch of scientific endeavor.<P>Besides, Jared Diamond's preface is also well written. It let us have a look into the extraordinary life of this great scientist. I am especially moved to read that Mayr "at the age of 97, still writing a new book every year or two." <P>Finally, I have also to point out what seems to me to be hardly a harmless drawback of this otherwise excellent work. This is the author's explicit belief, as expressed in the section on HUMAN ETHICS, in the "moral education" of the "world's great religion", especially for the "cultures of the Christian world". I feel quite puzzled how Mayr could think that some "perfectly sound" ethical principles could ever be deduced from a utterly absurd world-view, as that which is presented by the creationists, which, in so far as I understand it, seems to Mayr to have already been completed refuted by the Darwinian evolutionists.</span>

                    <span>This book is not aimed at refuting creationism or primarly defending evolution. While there are some chapters dealing with the evidence for evolution, the book is largely a technical overview of evolutionary theory. There is a lot about speciation, and an introduction to concepts of macroevolution. <P>In reading the book, I got the impression that Mayr is a bit miffed at how various others in his field have misunderstood certain concepts, or tried to ride his coattails. The average laymen has probably heard of punctuated equilibrium, but has probably not heard of parapatric speciation. That's a shame, because parapatric speciation is easily the more fundamental and far reaching idea. <P>Some of the terms where a bit technical, but I usually skipped them and kept reading. I was still able to pick up the main points. I think this book is an excellent companion to Ken Miller's Finding Darwin's God, which address the creation/evolution issue directly. Read Miller's book, and then read this one.</span>

                    <span>If you are a Biologist or are a curious naturalist this is a book for you. Mayr makes an outstanding abstract of evolution, he clearly defines it with mastery. I would just like to add that this is my favorite subject and have read a good amount of books on evolution and this is clearly one of the best (don't be mislead by the size nor the price). Of course there are huge treatises on evolution (like The Structure of Evolution, of Stephen Jay Gould), but such a Bible is, for most of the cases, unpractical and unnecessary. Mayr clears evolutions' place in Biology putting it at its' very center. Great book, great style.</span>

                    <span>Although it might be a good introduction for beginners, the views presented by Mayr have a feeling of 80s and 90s. Mayr does little to include the cutting edge research in evolutionary biology and his vision for the future of evolutionary biology is at best short-sighted.</span>

                    <span>This book covers almost every aspect of evolution. A good book for understanding darwinism and evolution. This book is written for people of various backgrounds. Moreover, the charts and text boxes are used in a manner that add substance to the book. The second appendix is awesome. Twenty tough questions about evolution are asked, including questions such as: is darwinism a dogma and is evolution a scientific fact. The answers though are less than convincing and tend to sidestep the questions.<P>Mayr has some of the best material on speciation that I have read. In this book, Mayr covers issues such as human evolution, macroevoution, natural selection, variational evolution, mutations, etc. He goes in depth but not so much so that laymen cannot follow. <P>Overall, the author has written a good book. Problems revolve around Mayr's refusal to adapt his writings and beliefs to current facts. In other words, Mayr still argues that the fossil record is the best evidence for evolution. A fossil record showing stasis best illustrates evolution??? Is not this the ultimate display of blind faith. Horse evolution is the most complete picture of evolution?!? WOW! <P>Maybe Mayr has grown hardheaded in his age and needs to keep update with current findings. Further, Mayr says embryology supports darwinism. Haven't we got past this yet? Problems like this show how old myths die hard and prove that perception is actually more important than reality. <P>Buy the book if you want a great reference for what evolution is, just remember when reading that dogma dies hard.</span>
