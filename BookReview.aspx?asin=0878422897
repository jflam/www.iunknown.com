                    <span>This book has triggered day-trips & camping expeditions in our family. I've had the pleasure of leading my children and their friends to moments of discovery and learning & shared wonder and beauty with my father--all based on this book.<P>It starts with a six page description of SoCal's geological history, then jumps into 20 sites of interest. A glossary, "Sources of Supplementary Information," and an index round out the book. <P>Each site receives its own chapter, replete with photographs, maps, geological diagrams, and even driving directions, as needed. I'm not a serious geologist, but landscape features fascinate me. The explanations that the authors give work well for me: I can understand them well enough to explain them to children. <P>If you're interested in how the land has been shaped, if you're willing to turn off the tube & make contact with the natural world, then this book is for you. One of the best "field guides" to geology I own. One of my favorites, too. (The companion volume, GEOLOGY UNDERFOOT IN DEATH VALLEY AND OWENS VALLEY, is also an excellent book).<P>(If you'd like to dialog more about this book or review, click on the "about me" link above & drop me an email. Thanks!)</span>

                    <span>It is nice to see new geological tour books come out. This is a good book for both the novice and the professional. It is very hard to present geology to a novice without losing them with the technical end of the profession, and yet the author's pull it off. The trips are great for weekend exploration in southern california.</span>

                    <span>If you've used the "Roadside Geology of..." series, this is a bit different. It's more of a "sites of interest" type of book. It lists 20 sites in the southern California area, from Mammoth Lakes out to the coast, and south to Needles and San Diego. The sites are wonderfully explained, with aerial photos, illustrations, and maps. This is definitely aimed at the casual tourist, with very little knowledge of geology necessary. As a professional Geologist, it's one of those books I'd give a non-Geologist friend.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">Excellent reading for the amateur or layperson geologist.</div>

Full of maps created by the author to help the reader locate interesting sites described along with easy to understand explanations of the covered material.
