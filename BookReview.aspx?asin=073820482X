                <span id="Label1">A fascinating glimpse inside the life-and-death business of biotechnology.  <P>"A tour-de-force for anyone who is interested in the biotech industry. I applaud the enormous achievement of Cynthia Robbins-Roth." -Frederick Frank, Senior Managing Director & Vice Chair, Lehman Brothers  <P>"From Alchemy to IPO tells the dramatic story of this revolutionary industry as only an insider can." -George Rathmann, President and CEO, ICOS Corporation, Chairman Emeritus, Amgen  <P>Written by a well-known industry insider, From Alchemy to IPO addresses the coming-of-age of biotech products and companies and traces the history of biotechnology from its early inception in the seventies to today's heyday of new solutions and breakthrough treatments. It describes the amazing entrepreneurial trail of product development, novel business models, and critical trials that eventually pave the way to market. This is the first book to accurately record the inner workings of an industry-biotechnology-that's on the verge of living up to its monumental promise to change the world as we know it.</span>

                    <span>I read From Alchemy to IPO for an MBA course on entrepreneurialism in the pharmaceutical industry. Given my background (undergraduate business, financial analyst role, limited in-depth scientific knowledge), I found this book to be a very useful and balanced guide to both the business and technical aspects of biotechnology.
<br />
<br />Robbins-Roth includes enough information on initial public offerings (IPOs) and merger activity among biotech firms to warm the hearts of the most resolute business student, but the drug discovery and development process is also covered in sufficient detail to give the lay reader an understanding for the operational challenges faced by firms in this sector.
<br />
<br />Add to this the competent yet necessarily superficial descriptions of more esoteric terms such as monoclonal antibodies and combinatorial chemistry, and you have a solid text that covers the industry and its ongoing challenges very well.</span>

                    <span>This is a great overview of the world of biotech.  The author explains the science with clarity and enthusiasm and the introduction this book provides to the corporate side of biotech is also very interesting and well written.</span>

                    <span>I read the first 20 pages of this book and quit.  It was too painful to keep going.  The author's wording in convoluted, tangential, and just plain annoying.  She throws out dozens of names from the industry, so many you can't keep them straight.  There is poor flow to the writing, so you cannot understand why she is telling you things from one line to the next.  The topics of each paragraph jump from one subject to another with abrupt, confusing transitions.  I returned the book!</span>

                    <span>I'll be starting a biomedical engineering Ph.D. program in the fall and have read recently a few books on the biotech subject.  This one gave the clearest picture of the biotech industries, the companies in them, how to manage and finance them, as well as how to recognize solid biotech companies for investing purposes.  A quick and entertaining read for anyone interested in the business behind biotechnology.</span>
