                <span id="Label1">Unix ranks among the great engineering accomplishments of the last half of the twentieth century, and its heir--Linux--seems already imposing and still on its way to achieving its full potential. Eric S. Raymond argues in <I>The Art of UNIX Programming</I> that the excellence of Unix derives as much from the fact that it was (and continues to be) a community effort as from the fact that a lot of smart people have worked to design and build it. Raymond, best known as the author of the open-source manifesto <I>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</I>, says in his preface that this is a "why-to" book, rather than a "how-to" book. It aims to show new Unix programmers why they should work under the old "hacker ethic"--embracing the principles of good software design for its own sake and of code-sharing.  <p>  That said, a great deal of valuable practical information appears in this book. Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good. In many cases, the people who did the work in the first place make guest appearances and explain their thinking--an invaluable resource. This book is for the deep-thinking software developer in Unix (and perhaps Linux in particular). It shows how to fit into the long and noble tradition, and how to make the software work <I>right</I>. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Why Unix (the term being defined to include Linux) is the way it is, and the people who made it that way. Commentary from Ken Thompson, Steve Johnson, Brian Kernighan, and David Korn enables readers to understand the thought processes of the creators of Unix.</span>

                    <span>I've been using, administering, and teaching UNIX since 1991 without the benefit of any formal instruction.  That means I rely on books.  I just got a desk copy of The Art of UNIX Programming and found it to be one of the very best UNIX books I've ever seen.  Although it's not a text I'll strongly recommend it to students in all of my classes.
<br />
<br />ESR's writing style is excellent.  The information density is very high but the book is an easy and engaging read, in fact the first time through it was hard to put down.  The inclusion of historical anecdotes, caustic comments, and even koans keep it lively.  Technically it's rather high level with very little fine detail.  For details consult UNIX for the Impatient.
<br />
<br />The book is as much about using UNIX as it is about programming with UNIX.  I suppose these points of view are inseparable, after all why bother to use UNIX if you don't want to tell your computer what to do?  The point is this book is useful to non programmers and occasional programmers.  ESR fills far more space discussing things like file formats, XML, shells, editors, and documentation than he does explaining C.  Understanding how these pieces work and fit together is essential to using UNIX productively.
<br />
<br />This is not a high school history book edited to be free of all content which might possibly offend someone.  If you're a Windows partisan you'll have to get past more than a few uncomplimentary references.  Even if you disagree, you can take the knocks as enlightening you on the considerable philosophical differences between UNIX and Windows.  ESR also doesn't hesitate to point out areas of difficulty within UNIX, now I understand exactly why I have problems with vi and sendmail.cf.
<br />
<br />This book is old school, but then so is UNIX itself.  This book will help you understand the history of what went right, what went wrong, and why; and that will help you make better use of UNIX today and tomorrow.</span>

                    <span>I read the book first in its HTML form, from Raymond's site, and I felt need to buy the real book.
<br />Its format is very appropriate and shows the best we have in Unix.
<br />Even though I have a degree in chemical engineering, I found it to be a valuable resource for my own projects for open source development.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book as soon as it was avalible is September 2003. Mr. Raymond gives good sound advice that this Computer Science student has taken to heart is his studies. The advice is so simple, obvious, and logical that you will find yourself wondering why you didn't think of these things in the first place.
<br />
<br />Along with good advice this book also gives an insightful history of UN*X and some suggestions as why it is not "King" of the desktop today, as it should be. 
<br />
<br />Further into the book there numerious examples of good programming practices; featuring programs that follow the traditional UN*X philosophy of coding. This book also explains the many pitfalls that seem so prevenent programming practices. I say this as an experenced computer user not as programmer. With these observations I hope to become a quality UN*X programmer.
<br />
<br />It has been noted in an other review that Mr. Raymond is big into the Linux community. Yes this is true. He is one of Linus Torvalds's right hand men and spokesmen. Mr. Raymond, to his credit, touches very little on the subject of Linux of his known dis-liking of M$ in this book.
<br />
<br />This book will forever be in my library of programming books. You will never catch my copy of this book here on Amazon as a used book. (Unless of course I am starving to death or I am already dead and my family is selling off my stuff.) I would like to thank Mr. Raymond for sharing his many years of UN*X expertise. (I would actually like to meet him some day.)</span>

                    <span>I suppose any book containing so many interesting quotes from so many UNIX luminaries cannot be overlooked. (I wonder if any of them would have co-authored this) It also happens to contain a great many topics that are well-worth writing about; My only wish is that someone less in awe with the contents of his own field of vision, and with greater depth and objectivity (not to mention humility) had the opportunity to write this book.<p>Quality of discussion is varied as expected; Raymond is not quite the UNIX expert he thinks he is. In places, Raymond's tone encourages one to throw the book at the nearest wall and go out just to get some fresh air; He is condescending, hectoring, lecturing, and sometimes just misleading. Alas, I will still recommend it as worth reading (check your local library) with a nice grain of salt; just enough friction for thought is provided in this edition.</span>
