                <span id="Label1">A heart-hammering sensation at Slamdance, Faster is an electrifying tribute to the white-knuckle world of the Motorcycle Grand Prix--the fastest sport on two wheels--where only the most audacious competitors race at speeds over 200mph and crash at over 100mph. Narrated by Ewan McGregor (Big Fish, Star Wars: Episodes I-III), Faster chases two seasons&#146; worth of the world championship, featuring revealing interviews with riders, mechanics, doctors, commentators and fans.</span>

                    <span>If you're into motorcycle roadracing and haven't been living under a rock, then you've heard about "Faster" by now.  It naturally draws all of the inevitable comparisons to the immortal "On Any Sunday," though its singular focus, effective editing, and engrossing backstory development make this the definitive roadracing movie.  Like O.A.S., it has a beautiful knack of presenting the material in a manner that both interests and educates those with little prior knowledge of the subject while still including everything necessary to keep the most hardcore roadracing afficionado hooked.  If you're reading this review, then you already want it.  I'm here to tell you to cough up the cash and buy a copy.  You won't be dissappointed.

<br />See you at Seca in July!!!

                    <span>Moto GP is a world lesser known to most Americans - the exception of course are American motorcycle racing fans.  In Europe, especially Italy and Spain, Moto GP is wildly popular. This is true for Japan as well. What I like about the video is the objective almost analytical insight it provides into the cloistered and exotic world of 28 superior riders - the world's best - where speeds on the track are routinely over 200 mph.
<br />
<br />The latest release includes interviews with the sport's former champions including Barry Sheene, Mick Doohan, Wayne Rainey and Kevin Schwantz as well as current champions.  The interviews help you to understand the fierce competitive nature of the pilots and also the vast sums of money to finance the sport. I found the interviews fascinating as it gives you the human side of the sport (80% rider & 20% machine), a chance to compare the rider's very different personalities and their view of the sport as a whole.  Barry Sheene, for example, liked " the crumpet." 
<br />
<br />I enjoy competitive motorsport and I found that the video is one I can watch again and again and still learn something new and interesting about Moto GP each time I watch it.  Non-race fans will enjoy it too although obviously not to the same extent as enthusiasts.  If you are interested in learning more about Moto GP you will enjoy this video.</span>

                    <span>They're nothing else like it on earth!  If you're interested in MotoGP, the most elite road racing series in the world, this dvd is the bible.  Beautifully narrated by Ewing McGregor, the rest of the world's 2nd most loved sport, behind futbol ofcourse, we are guided through the nitty gritty world of factory backed MotoGP.    
<br />
<br />In the world of MotoGP, 2004 was one of the most historically profound seasons ever.  Most of you will already know because Valentino Rossi moved from the tried and true Honda to the inferior Yamaha, just to prove a point.  That it's 80% rider and 20% bike.  When Vale took home the 2nd MotoGP championship in '03 on a Honda, Honda started getting big headed.  Implying that with their machine, good racers will become great racers.  Vale could only take so much.  He decided to move to the big underdog known as Yamaha for '04.  During his previous battles on the Honda, great riders such as Max Biaggi would whine about how if he only had a Honda to ride, he could win.  Vale went to Yamaha with his chief mechanic Jeremy Burguess to ride in the greatest epic journey in history.  
<br />
<br />And against all odds, against everybodies doubts, and against great advisaries, Valentino Rossi took his 3rd MotoGP championship in a row.  On a different bike.  On a bike that even he thought at the beginning of the season, wouldn't even be competitive for two years.  We are living in an era that'll forever be written in MotoGP history.  
<br />
<br />For 2005, MotoGP will come to U.S. soil.  July 10th, the madness will reign here at Laguna Seca.  Yamaha has donated more than $2-million to rennovate the track for MotoGP standards.  Tickets are almost sold out.  
<br />
<br />And that brings me back to Faster.  With the purchase of Faster, you'll receive Faster and Faster.  Faster (part 1) starts with MotoGP still racing 500cc two-strokes from 2001-2002.  Faster and Faster (part 2) will start with the end of the two-stroke era and leads into a grid full of the much faster four-strokes.  
<br />
<br />The Faster collection is an essential prequel to the much anticipated 2005 season.  The dvd is a must own in any motorcycle enthusiast's archive.

                    <span>Hands down, the best documentary I've ever seen (regardless of subject) is Mark Neale's "Faster." The subtitle is "Two wheels. 200MPH. Every man for himself." That pretty much tells the story of what this movie's subject matter might be. However, the real story is the people who ride, maintain, and write about these machines and riders. 
<br />
<br />Neale incorporates the current war on wheels between kid-phenom Valentino Rossi and his near enemy, rival, Max Biaggi, as a vehicle for examining how vicious and unreal the battle at 200mph can be when it's done at a world class level. As a side show, riders like Gary McCoy and John Hopkins demonstrate the character traits/flaws that create super riders in the world's most dangerous sport. 
<br />
<br />The incredible insight offered by past-greats, Mick Doohan, Kevin Schwantz, Wayne Rainey, Kenny Roberts and Barry Sheene, provides something between sports commentary, personal insight, and some of the funniest dry humor ever put on screen. 
<br />
<br />I've watched "Faster" a half-dozen times and I still get something new from on each viewing. I own very few videos, but this one is an absolue necessity for anyone who drives ANYTHING and can imagine motorsports as "sport." </span>
