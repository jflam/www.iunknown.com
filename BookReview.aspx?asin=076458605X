What is the name of the file, so I can copy it for him, so he can do his homework on his computer?<p>Assuming he can read it -- hopefully, tonight, before his test Monday -- it seems like a good product. We really need to find the name of the file, however.</span>

                    <span>Not to sound pretentious, but I had no trouble understanding "The Scarlet Letter," but I still found immense value in this companion text from Cliffs. It helped me by confirming what I myself had thought about the book and giving me interesting ideas for the term paper I was writing. Its usefulness comes from the ease of reading and the volume and quality of its contents. Of further value to the student is the rapidity with which the Cliffs Notes are read, making it indispensable for last minute paper-writing!<p>One closing comment: Cliffs Notes, however useful, are an aid for the reading of the full text and are no substitute for it.</span>

                    <span>Since the Bible is not taught in most schools, this Cliffsnotes is quite handy. There are so many biblical references and ideas driving the theme of Hawthorne's splendid novel, that without this guide, few teachers would understand the full context of Hawthorne's book.<p>Oh, students will find it helpful as well!<p>I fully recommend "Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (Cliffs Notes)."<p>Anthony Trendl</span>

                    <span>Once, we were impressed by the characters and conversations. But, you will soon find out thatis not important. I know it is easier for a Christian to feel how painstaking to cencede. We are living in a sinful world with our erring nature. Death should be our eternity. But, Mr. Dimmesdale strived to win and be respected. He knows what is wrong and make the very decision to admit his error. He is brave, with no fear of death or punishment. A love lasts for seven years. Connecting our innermost desire for love, it touch every reader. I cannot move, feeling sorry after reading the ending. I hope no one will miss it.</span>
