                <span id="Label1">To date, Tim O'Brien's novels have all shared common traits: his heroes hail from the Midwest, usually Minnesota; Vietnam figures prominently; and the stories he tells, though invested with mordant wit, are usually pretty grim. So an O'Brien fan coming to <I>Tomcat in Love</I> on the heels of  his earlier novels can be forgiven for occasionally checking the name on the cover (and the photo on the dust jacket) just to be <I>sure</I> this is, indeed, the same Tim O'Brien who wrote <I>Going After Cacciato</I>, <I>The Things They  Carried</I>, <I>If I Die in a Combat Zone</I>, and <I>In the Lake of the Woods</I>.<p>  In <I>Tomcat in Love</I> O'Brien introduces us to a very different hero: "In summary, then, my circumstances were these. Something over forty-nine years of age. Recently divorced. Pursued. Prone to late-night weeping. Betrayed not once but threefold: by the girl of my dreams, by her Pilate of a brother, and by a Tampa real-estate tycoon whose name I have vowed never again to utter." Thomas H. Chippering, professor of linguistics, war hero, and sex magnet--in his own mind, at least, has recently lost his childhood sweetheart and wife of 20 years to another man, the Tampa magnate, and Lorna Sue's desertion has clearly unhinged him. He has taken to flying down to Tampa from Minnesota on weekends to spy on his ex-wife and plot revenge against her, the tycoon, and Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, whom he blames for destroying his marriage. <p>  Thomas, Lorna Sue, and Herbie go back a long way together, bound equally by ties of love, guilt, and suspicion. Dating from the afternoon young Herbie nailed an even younger Lorna Sue's hand to a makeshift cross, Thomas has occupied a kind of emotional no man's land between the two: "In my bleakest moods, when black gets blackest, I think of it as a high perversion: Herbie coveted his own sister. Which is a fact. The stone truth. He was in love with her. More generously, I will sometimes concede that it was not sexual love, or not entirely, and that Herbie was driven by the obsessions of a penitent, a torturer turned savior. Partly, too, I am quite certain that Herbie secretly associated me with his own guilt. I was present at the beginning. My backyard, my plywood, my green paint." <p>  Chippering takes his revenge to hilarious lengths, starting with a purple leather bra and panties stuffed beneath the seat of the tycoon's car and escalating from there. But even as he attempts to wreak havoc in his ex-wife's life, he succeeds in laying ruin to his own. His self-proclaimed irresistibility to women gets him in hot water with both his female students and his administration; his obsession with Lorna Sue threatens his budding romance with Mrs. Robert Kooshof, a woman who loves him as his wife never did--and, oh yes, there's that little matter of the squad of Green Berets he crossed many years before in Vietnam who may or may not be hunting him down. <p> Once you get over the shock of this new, funny Tim O'Brien, traces of the writer you thought you knew begin to surface. Chippering might be a pompous, overbearing windbag, but you can't trust him any more than you did any of O'Brien's other earthier, equally unreliable narrators. In one breath, he tells us, "I must in good conscience point out that women find me attractive beyond words. And who on earth could blame them?" In the next he describes himself as resembling "a clean-shaven version of our sixteenth president." Half the fun of reading <I>Tomcat in Love</I> is trying to sort out just how much of what Thomas H. Chippering tells us is true. Stellar writing, a brilliant cast of characters, and a sly, surprising story that breaks your heart one minute and tickles your funny bone the next all make Tim O'Brien's first foray into the comic novel a resounding success. <I>--Alix  Wilber</I></span>

                    <span>After the brilliant "Going After Cacciato," this book severely disappointed me.  The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue hollow and unbelievable, and the plot laughable.  I had a hard time swallowing just about every scene.  I didn't like Tom, and not because he was obnoxious, but because he was such a broad stereotype with no depth.  R. Russo created an equally obnoxious protagonist (also a professor) in "Straight Man" who did some pretty loony things, yet I loved that book.  It rang true.  This book does not.
<br />
<br />By the end, I did not cheer, I did not hiss.  I found I just didn't care one way or another for any of the characters.</span>

                    <span>Let me explain something to the folks who disparage Tomcat in Love because the narrator is a self-centered, obnoxious prig: This is a novel about a guy who is a self-centered, obnoxious prig out for revenge on his ex-wife and her lover.  It is a hilarious portrait of a total jerk.  I loved it.
<br />
<br />Then again, I have to admit to being an Updike fan. I even like Philip Roth!  And, OK, maybe I'm old--but more of a dog than a cat.  I haven't read John Cheever, but if he deserves as much scorn as O'Brien, Roth, and Updike, I'll have to check him out.

                    <span>Linguistics professor Tom Chippering is still mourning the loss of his wife, Lorna Sue. He can't accept the fact that she's dumped and divorced him and is now living with a wealthy tycoon in Tampa, Florida. Chippering is determined to get Lorna Sue back--and have some revenge along the way. Chippering is a Vietnam veteran, so first he does a little reconnaissance in Tampa, and he discovers that Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, conveniently lives just a few streets away from his sister. Thomas has a long-standing score to settle with both of them, and the root of the trouble stems from a childhood incident. <p>My first problem with the book ... the main character Tom Chippering is an obnoxious, self-centered, egomaniac. He doesn't listen to anyone else's problems, and to Chippering, women are a sum total of their physical attributes (and this is supposed to be a source of amusement).  This, quite frankly, annoyed me so much, I had a difficult time finishing the book. Also the character is supposed to be a Linguistics professor, and while the author briefly mentioned the title of a class or two, and numerous female students, I found the characterization extremely unbelievable. Chippering's profession is just a coat hanger to stick the character onto. He could be anything--a car salesman, an undertaker--it really doesn't matter.<p>Also the author's meandering style was annoying. He has a fixation with cumbersome footnotes, and the information in the footnotes is worthless, distracting, and nonsensical. <p>Finally, Chippering states that he longs to get his wife back, and yet this is also implausible as the wife is clearly an undesirable crackpot, and Chippering seems to have plenty of entertainment with his female students, and well ... anyone who looks remotely female. The idea--the ex-husband trying to win back his wife through fair means or foul--with a little revenge along the way--was an engaging one. Unfortunately, the main characters were unappealing and largely uninteresting. Unappealing, nasty characters can be great fun to read about--if the author handles the characters in the correct manner. In this novel, Chippering is unleashed--it's not pleasant, not funny, and after a while, his shallow, one-dimensional, flawed character and continual escapades become boring--displacedhuman</span>

                    <span>I wanted to like this book, really, but after 70 pages or so, I realized life is too short to waste on crap like this. Where to start? The lead character speaks like someone in a Stephen King novel. For instance, who have you ever met someone in real life who introduces themself with their full name, including middle name? Now, that wouldn't be so bad if, like King, it had a good plot. But I didn't believe this one for a microsecond. The whole family watched from a window as the teen couple kissed? The girl in the lingerie store cheerfully tried on clothes for the lead character? Come on. When the protagonist showed up in the yard of his family's old house and started weeping, I made a vow to myself: If he wound up bedding the woman who came outside to chase him away, I was outta there. I'm glad I followed that vow.</span>

                    <span>Tim O'Brien has been a favorite of mine for nearly 25 years. His books are always deep and insightful, but they reached new levels of somberness with "The Lake of the Woods". "Tomcat In Love" is a delightfully unexpected left turn and reveals a surprisingly sharp comic talent.<p>I usually find it difficult to enjoy a novel with a protagonist I can't admire. But Thomas Chippering is so delighfully self delusional that you can't help but giggle as he digs himself in deeper with every scheme he contrives. And yet amazingly you find yourself rooting for this buffoon as reaches new depths of social ineptitude. Other reviewers mention that Chippering is an unreliable narrator, but it is important to realize that he actually believes all the lies he is telling. Half the fun of reading this comic novel is reading between the lines to distinguish where what is really happening diverges from what Chippering is telling you.<p>This is a funny, funny book. Even so, it confronts the reader with many serious issues, particularly the objectification of women. There's plenty to think about while you are laughing at the characters. That's one reason this book stays with you much longer than most comic novels.<p>I gave a copy of this novel to my father, and after he finished it he sent it along to my brother. Tim O'Brien is exactly a generation between me and my father, and while there's plenty we can't see eye to eye on, we both found this novel extremely entertaining.<p>Tim O'Brien is a treasure. Read this book!</span>
