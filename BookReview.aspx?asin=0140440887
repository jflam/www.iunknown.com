                    <span>I read this book for an upper division religious studies class in Buddhism at UC Davis.  My limited knowledge of Buddhist Canon aside, this is a solid and concise collection of the most basic Buddhist scriptures that are common to almost all schools.  In our class we studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, and used this book in conjunction with Hirakawa Akira's well-known "A History of Indian Buddhism."  The latter book is a very terse and informative synthesis of the life's work of one of Japan's most highly regarded scholars on Buddhism and is the kind of book that one might want to read alongside Conze for historical context.  I say this because although Conze does give brief introductions to each translation, the average reader with little or no knowledge of the development of Buddhist canon will not walk away from this book alone with a very thorough knowledge of just what he or she is actually reading.  That's not to say this book is "scholarly."  On the contrary, Conze's translations are straightforward and easy to read, but you will get more out of this book if you already know at least a little about the history behind the writings.  <p>Conze includes translations of works on such topics as: the Buddha's previous lives, the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, Buddhist doctrines, Meditation, Wisdom, doctrinal formulas, disputes, and future times and Buddhas.  Some specific works include excerpts from the Heart Sutra, the Diamond Sutra, the Questions of King Milinda, and doctrinal formulas on faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.</span>

                    <span>The translator, Edward Conze, in attempting to include what is common to most Buddhists rather than concentrating on what separates them, has made some difficult choices and has made them well.  Though readability is not too highly stressed at the expense of accuracy, the resulting work is accessible to readers of varying education and interest levels.  (Given the difficulty of the ideas expressed in many of the selections included, this is no small accomplishment.)  I would recommend this book as an introduction to Buddhist thought and as an aid to further study (though I would not necessarily recommend it as an end to the matter for one whose interests tend toward the academic).  The glossary and the list of sources included at the end are both quite helpful.</span>

                    <span>While I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as a primer for beginners, it is an excellent introduction to basic Buddhist texts and sources.  I have found this text to be quite useful as a reference work and can recommend it as such.</span>

                    <span>With this book is very easy know the basics of budhism and her differents traditions around the world. You find zen, theravada, chan, tibetan...  and you reading different great masters of the buddhist history. In this times we don't find this quality. I love this book and I need write this) :)</span>
