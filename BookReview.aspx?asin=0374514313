                <span id="Label1">Born in 1915, the mountaineer and outdoorsman David Brower has arguably been the single most influential American environmentalist in the last half of the 20th century; even his erstwhile foes at the Department of the Interior grudgingly credit him with having nearly single-handedly halted the construction of a dam in the heart of the Grand Canyon, and he has converted thousands, even millions, of his compatriots to the preservationist cause through his work with the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, and other organizations.<p> Brower was in the thick of battle when John McPhee profiled him for the <I>New Yorker</I> in a piece that would evolve into <I>Encounters with the Archdruid</I>. McPhee follows Brower into unusually close combat as Brower faces down a geologist who is, it seems, convinced that there is no sight quite so elevating as that of a fully operational mine; a developer who (successfully, it turned out) sought to convert an isolated stretch of the Carolina coast into a resort for the moneyed few--and who provided the title for McPhee's book, wryly opining that conservationists are at heart druids who "sacrifice people and worship trees"; and, most formidable of all, former Interior Secretary Floyd Dominy, who oversaw the construction of a structure that for Brower stands as one of the most hated creations of our time, Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. McPhee offers up an engaging portrait of Brower, a man unafraid of a good fight in the service of the earth, making <I>Encounters</I> an important contribution to the history of the modern environmental movement. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>As the other reviewers here have noted, this is John McPhee's superb recounting of three episodes in the life of famous environmental activist David Brower. The three people he encounters are a geologist, a land developer, and a dam builder. The structure of the book allows a revealing contrast between one of America's greatest environmental activists on three key issues. These are: 1) the desirability and advisability of exploring and mining for ore and minerals in protected wilderness areas, 2) whether it is preferable to develop land on the Atlantic Coast or allow it to be developed, and 3) the desirability of damming major rivers in the Southwest.<P>My favorite portion of the book featured Brower's encounter with the fascinating Charles Fraser, one of America's greatest and most gifted land developers. At debate was whether to develop Cumberland Island as a recreational and residential area, or whether to leave it wild and protect it as a National Seashore. The editorial reviewer inaccurately stated that Fraser was successful in his goal to develop it. He was not. Today Cumberland Island is a designated National Seashore. Fraser had hoped to develop Cumberland much as he had Hilton Head. What is compelling about Fraser is his desire to develop land on the one hand, with an intent to respect the physical surroundings to the greatest possible degree. Brower himself says in the book that while he is opposed to developing Cumberland Island, if anyone were to develop it, he would want Fraser to be that person.<P>The section of the book in which Brower and dam builder Floyd Dominy discuss a wide range of issues is fascinating not just in contrasting two fundamentally opposed viewpoints, but in bringing out both Brower's most conspicuous success and failure. The success was his leading the Sierra Club in opposing building a dam in the Grand Canyon. The tragedy was that in focusing on opposing the Grand Canyon, Brower and the Sierra Club were unable to fight the building of the Glen Canyon River Dam, for environmentalists and conservationists perhaps the single greatest tragedy since the building of the Hetch Hetchy Dam early in the 20th century. In building this dam, the ironically named Lake Powell was created. Many environmentalists refer to his as Lake Foul. The irony stems from the fact that it was named in "honor" of John Wesley Powell, who led the first expedition of Europeans to explore the entirety of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. Powell was deeply opposed to the development of the American West beyond the ability of the water supply to support the local population. He would, therefore, have been horrified to find such an anti-monument as this lake bearing his name. Edward Abbey's books are filled with vituperative attacks on the devastation wrought by the building of the Glen Canyon River Dam. There are several organizations that continue calling for the draining of Lake Powell.<P>Why is there so much outrage at this dam? In creating Lake Powell, the water covered some of the most excruciatingly beautiful landscape not only in the United States but the world. Just before the dam was completed and the waters filled the area, photographer Eliot Porter took a number of remarkable photographs chronicling the magnificence of what was lost. Instead of being covered with water, the area should have been declared a national park. The poignancy of the final section of McPhee's book is the since of the tragedy of the dam, and the two who struggled over its building, meet and talk.</span>

                    <span>A collection of 3 narratives, these are stories of the interactions between David Brower, a militant environmentalist and former head of the Sierra Club, and three of his natural enemies from the worlds of engineering, government, and real estate development. McPhee does a brilliant job of getting the reader into the hearts and minds of these people without taking sides, and you won't look at environmental issues quite the same again. I was especially impressed with McPhee's exploration of Floyd Dominy, a builder of monumental dams and the man behind the notorious Glen Danyon dam. I couldn't put this book down. John McPhee is an amazing writer who has tackled just about every subject. I think it's much easier to shop McPhee in an online setting like Amazon.com than to try to locate him at your local bookstore. He has covered so many topics that no one really knows where to shelve his books, and used book dealers have an especially hard time of it. Southern California readers will enjoy his book "The Control of Nature" if only for his wonderful piece entitled "Los Angeles against the Mountains." You cannot go wrong with John McPhee!</span>

                    <span>It made me want to hike the Sierra Nevada mountains. The cover of the book enticed me to read this book. The book was very informational about David Brower's life. It was good how the book was divided into three parts to makea it more interesting. John McPhee did a good job of describing how the mountains looked. It helped show how nature is affected by humans and how we shouldn't interfere with it. It was very interesting to see the differemt views of a conservationist verses a copper miner or a developer. Overall, this story has enlightened all of its readers to the effects of human growth and industrialization in the wilderness.</span>

                    <span>There are three parts to this book. The first is about A Mountain. Brower, Park, Brigham and some others go up the mountain in pursuit of copper. The second part of the book is about An Island. The Island is owned b a man named Charles Frazer. The chapeter deals with the developemnt of the Sea Pines Plantation. The third part of the book is The River. The men discuss the pros and cons of dams. The entire chapater is dedicated to the arguement oabout dams.<BR>The book talks about the good and bads that come about with changes in the environment that maybe some people aren't aware of. Overall, this book reveals good information about the encirionment, but is boring. THe entire third part of the book is about the arguement over dams. At first. the arugements are humerous, but after 94 pages of arguement, it gets very redundant.<BR>The first section of the book is much better than the other parts of the book. Brower and his group have several adventures, such as finding copper in a streamn. Also, they run into more people in the first section of the book, so fortunatly there are more viewpoints. One other partcularly interesting adventurous part was at the very end, when the men go down Lava Falls. Unfortunatly, the book was still rather dull, due to the reptiteveness of the themes in it. Basically, in each chapter, an interesting environmental theme is brought up. However, by the end of the chapter, the theme becomes like beating a dead horse.</span>

                    <span>The book is three stories involving hte controversial issues with different land areas. Each story involves a conservationist, David Brower, and opposition. In the mountains, David Brower( the archdruid mentioned in the title), aruges against Charles Park over the issue of a copper mine. On an island, Brower advises Charles Fraser against developing a secluded area. And finally, on the river, Brower arugues with Floyd Dominy about the construction of a dam. Although the three stories shared the same main character, they all stressed different opinions and ended differently. The story showed both extremes of a conservationist and opposition. The book is hard to follow and make connections. It also jumps from present to pas. This is apparent especially in the third story on the river when it jumps from ravelng along the river to Brower's past and resignation from the Sierra Club. The book is interesting as it shows the sides of both conservationist and opposition as expressed through extremely well written stories. Overal, we would recommend this book to people torn between the conservationst and oppositions standpoint but fails to include what we could do to help these issues.</span>
