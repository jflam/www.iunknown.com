                    <span>There is a problem in the IT learning experience that surrounds textbooks. The problem is that their is not a logical learning path to follow to obtain the prerequisite knowledge to progress in the field. Data structures and Discrete Math are two prime examples of this. Its not like traditional math where you take Alg1 then Alg2 College Alg...etc....Its more like boom here it is with Discrete. Anyhow, I have been over many textbooks in IT and this is the problem. IT authors are either way too indepth and write textbooks that are practically impossible to understand or...??? Well in lots of cases there is no alternative. Database texts are no exception. I studied Conelly/Begg's "Database Systems" and found that to be an exceptional book for Intermediate level study, however it lacked any systematic learning approach. Its more encyclopedic and detailed than what is needed in a first course. Thats the problem with learning from IT texts. We are forced to learn from texts that are written from a high level non-structured format in entry level courses where structured learning is most critical. So how do we learn and progress when this is the case...answer: you dont...its a weed out. LOL? Anyhow, look at the title, it says FUNDAMENTALS! Then look up the word in the dictionary if you dont know what this means as it seems that some people in the IT teaching/learning world dont understand this word! Kroenke writes this book as an entry level, basic, introductory and FUNDAMENTAL course in database processing. After understanding these basics then you can move on to Intermediate and more Advanced Database courses. Thats what the IT teaching and learning experience is lacking. A Progressive structured learning format with texts written with appropriate titles which is seldom the case! Kroenke does this however as the title suggests. The text is progressive and structured and teaches the FUNDAMENTALS! Hopefully the textbook teaching world will evolve from the dark ages and professors will start writing texts in a progress oriented format in order to make the learning process more efficient and effective. Hmm..maybe thats why we are losing out to other countries, they teach this stuff more effectively? In brief conclusion, although this text isnt perfect, Kroenke provides what many of us are really looking for; to learn the basics of database technology. Thanks Mr. Kroenke!</span>

                    <span>This book was used in the Data Modeling course I just finished and it was an excellent choice. Kroenke's book came bundled with oracle 9i, but I think that the ERwin data modeling tool should also be included in future editions. The use of the book along with Oracle and Computer Associates' ERwin made my study of Data Modeling very enjoyable. <br>In response to some of the negative reviews, it is my belief that the student should have a previous exposure to Relational Databases before attempting to read this book. Therefore, to use this book as an introductory course might be a bit much for the novice.</span>

                    <span>I use this book to teach database course as part of information systems management program. The update to the 9th edition is a big relief to me since it makes considerable improvement from the 8th edition, though I still feel disappointed time by time during my preparation and teaching. The 9th edition perhaps is a quick fix to the 8th edition and a lot remain to be corrected or improved. 
<br />
<br />First, let me discuss some of the strengths of this book as textbook. This book covers not only relational database itself, but also the database applications, which is essential to build an in-depth understanding of database technology. It covers managing Oracle and SQL Server in two separate chapters, which makes it easier for instructors to tailor the book. It has extensive coverage of database access technologies that enhance the understanding of database processing if the presentation of such material is improved.  
<br />
<br />This book does contain quite a few vague and confusing discussions on some important issues and concepts, even to subjects as basic as entity, entity class and entity instance. This makes the book sometimes difficult for beginners and students and irritating for experienced practionaers. 
<br />
<br />In my opinion, the author sometimes deliver material without enough consideration of the course flow or the style of the book. For instance, the discussion of the synthesis of relations is in a very different tone from the rest of the book. There are many occations like this one that cause this book unnecessary difficult to read. Though the book has devoted entire two chapters to Oracle and SQL Server, it fails to provide an adequate coverage of database industry, vendors and products. It does not provide good overview for the architectures Oracle and SQL Server, either.
<br />
<br />Upon reading and teaching this textbook, I have the impression that the author often fails to deliver adequate and correct discussions of many of the contemporary technologies widely used in the industry. For instance, the discussion of database access technologies contains many incomplete and incorrect statements. Often efforts are made more to unnecessary details other than important concepts. Apparently the author is teaching us something that he does not understand well. 
<br />
<br />Some of the newly added contents are not very well designed and organized. Part V is titled Database Access Standards. I do not understand why Chapter 14, with subjects such as OLAP, data warehouse, data administration, is placed as a chapter here. I do not understand either why the author does not consider XML be a part of Chapter 14. I believe the author should also cover data integration in this chapter. Though the author spends 3 chapters to discuss database access technology, I feel most of the efforts are devoted to lengthy and poor-written ASP/VBScript, and JSP codes that do not help much to the understanding of the concepts and should be covered by other books and courses. Surprisingly, the author does not cover multi-tier architecture. For me, merely one chapter to cover the latest client/server and Internet architectures, as well as the various data access layer implementations, including the conceptual coverage of the contemporary database access technologies such as ODBC, OLE DB, ADO, ADO.Net, JDBC, and object-relational mapping, will achieve more. I also suggest the author to enhance significantly the coverage for Chapter 14, since OLAP, data warehouse and data management and database administration are fundamental for database processing course. I believe the author should at least dedicate one chapter to OLAP, considering that fact that he wrote 3 chapters for database access technology alone.
<br />
<br />Overall, I feel the database coverage of this text is far more professional than the database applications part, though I still hope he will do a better job next time for the database part. 
<br />
<br />At the website of the publisher of this book, it states that this book is "For undergraduate courses in Database Design, Introduction to Database Processing, Database Management and Design in departments of Business, Information Systems and Applied Computer Science". However, The book description of Amazon.com suggests that this book is "For database administrators, database designers, application programmers, or other professionals in the field who want a complete, up-to-date, easy-to-use database book". Of course, this is an almost impoosible mission. My opinion is that this book is for school study, provided you have an experienced and good instructor who may clarify the many issues that the author misrepresented or not explain well.

                    <span>This book is grossly overpriced and not useful, at all, to anyone trying to learn about databases. I find some of the "positive" reviews to be unfounded and grossly biased (they must be friends of Kronke or bad instructors trying to justify their use of this BAD textbook). I would suggest that both Kroenke and his buddies look for a dumbies book on "how to write a textbook." Note how the publishers comments about this book refer to it as discussing "fundamentals" and providing a "foundation" on databases. This book fails completely at doing either of those things.</span>
