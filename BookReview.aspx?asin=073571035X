                <span id="Label1">In <I>Photoshop 6 Effects Magic</I>, a array of professionals illustrate the use of many of Photoshop 6's new features as well as basic techniques in a collection of over 20 tutorials. This book is not for freshmen Photoshop artists. It requires that you have a working knowledge of basic Photoshop tools, getting around the interface, and creating and editing Photoshop images.<p>  Spanning four sections, the book covers painting techniques, photographic techniques, image manipulation, and compositing techniques. Each section contains at least five tutorials, and all are in full color and richly illustrated. While the book is not platform-specific, many of the techniques described in the "Painting Techniques" section, for example, are dependent on a graphics tablet. If you use Photoshop for freehand illustration, you're probably already using one. If not, you can still use many of the techniques described with a mouse, albeit with less control.<p>  Creating painterly illustrations from photographs in a sketch or watercolor style is well covered, as are manipulating and retouching photographs to change atmosphere, create multilayered compositions, or add depth or style. Compositing techniques using Photoshop's live effects give a designer great latitude, and the tutorials using text and live effects are especially worthwhile.<p>  The Magic series of books from New Riders Publishing is an outstanding collection, with no expense spared in layout or production. <I>Photoshop 6 Effects Magic</I> holds its own in this distinguished series, and is a valuable handbook to have at your fingertips. <I>--Mike Caputo</I> </span>

                    <span>I teach both a begining and advanced Photoshop class for an Apple Specialist. I try to provide a book to go with the two day advanced class. Finding a book that is right for this class has always been a challange. I was sent this book to review and I have to say I was disappointed. It seems like they are wanting to impress and not use the route with the fewest steps. There are easier ways of doing most of these exercises. The effects themselves were also a little strange. The liquify filter is the old Kai's Power Goo and doesn't need a whole chapter on caricatures. I will say that there were a few (two) of the examples I was able to use in class.</span>

                    <span>I have just about every book New Riders has ever put out regarding photoshop, and once again, they have a winner. All of the tutorials are easy to follow and easy to do. As with most of their work, my biggest complaint is, MORE! Another book please! Also, I am always one to play with "easy to do" features. Most of the cd's that come with the books have a nice assortment of actions, but now we need to add some cool, easy to apply styles! I would say it is a book worth buying.</span>
