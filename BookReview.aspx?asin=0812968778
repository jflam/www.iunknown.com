                <span id="Label1">Moscow, May 1876: What would cause a talented young student from a wealthy family to shoot himself in front of a promenading public in the Alexander Gardens? Decadence and boredom, most likely, is what the commander of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Moscow Police thinks, but still he finds it curious enough to send the newest member of the division, Erast Fandorin, a young man of irresistible charm, to the Alexander Gardens precinct for more information. <br><br>Fandorin is not satisfied with the conclusion that this is an open-and-shut case, nor with the preliminary detective work the precinct has done&#8212;and for good reason: The bizarre and tragic suicide is soon connected to a clear case of murder, witnessed firsthand by Fandorin. There are many unresolved questions. Why, for instance, have both victims left their fortunes to an orphanage run by the English Lady Astair? And who is the beautiful &#8220;A.B.,&#8221; whose signed photograph is found in the apparent suicide&#8217;s apartment? Relying on his keen intuition, the eager sleuth plunges into an investigation that leads him across Europe, landing him at the deadly center of a terrorist conspiracy of worldwide proportions.<br><br>In this thrilling mystery that brings nineteenth-century Russia to vivid life, Akunin has created one of the most eagerly anticipated novels in years.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></span>

                    <span>If I hadn't known that the author of this novel is a contemporary writer, I would have absolutely believed that he lived at the time this book is set in, which is 1876. Akunin's knowledge of the Tsarist Russian culture is remarkable. The language, the style, and the very tone of the book are exactly what you would expect to see in a classic Russian novel of that time period.<P>On to the story. Meet Erast Fandorin, a handsome young police investigator, poor, unknown, naive, and somewhat shy, but eager to be the best sleuth and catch all those villains out there. His chance comes when he is assigned to work on the investigation of a rather unusual, public suicide of a rich university student. Things speed up from there, introducing new leads and new characters. What first looks like a tragic love story turns out to be an international conspiracy, and you will never guess who is the master mind. Well, maybe you will, but right where the author wants you to.<P>Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Such a small book and yet so richly packed. The translation is, well, delightful. You'd swear this book really was written in the 1870s. It's full of wonderful little details such as Russian Roulette being referred to as American Roulette, and Fandorin's boss having one of the first of a new invention called the telephone. The characters are intriguing, especially the neophyte detective Erast Fandorin. More than a few times I was thinking, "No! Don't do that! Pay attention to your job!" But, obviously he wasn't listening... <BR>I was sad to see this book end and hope the rest in the series get translated NOW. If you like reading Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky (is that spelled right?), give this a shot. It's not as deep as those authors, but it captures their styles well.<BR>Also, this had one of the most shocking and devastating endings I've read in a book in a LONG time. I am still trying to deal with it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>We learn from the book-jacket (and from the description above) that Akunin has sold millions of books in Russia, and that The Winter Queen is the first in a series of novels involving 19th century criminal investigator Erast Fandorin. I stumbled across this book on a table in Harrod's, and if the rest of the series are as fast-paced, witty and well-written as this one I am a new Akunin fan.<P> The book takes place in 1876 Moscow, where a good-looking, wealthy young gentleman approaches some ladies in the park and shoots himself in the head. Some in the Criminal Investigation Department wish to close the file immediately, an obvious suicide by a lovesick youth, but young Fandorin, a newcomer to the department, takes the investigation seriously. He starts uncovering all sorts of interesting secrets and conspiracies, taking him to London and back. Along the way he must deal with attempts on his life, learn how to gamble for high stakes, preserve his honor by issuing a challenge to a duel, and decide whether an agent in London is trust-worthy or a double-agent.<P> Some here have likened Fandorin to James Bond, or a Russian Sherlock Holmes, but he doesn't really fit either bill since he is too young, naive, eager to please and vulnerable compared to those classic characters. At various times in the novel Fandorin prepares to meet his maker, including one chilling scene in London where he gets to take a swim in the Thames, Harry Houdini style. We know he must make it to the next book in the series, but he seems to make it by the skin of his teeth. I agree with the reviewer who likens him more to the young protaginist from Caleb Carr's The Alienist, a much closer match in my opinion.<P> The language of the novel can get a little wooden at times, common especially with translated works, but the dialogue occasionally sparkles, and Akunin is trying to emulate a late 19th century style. Overall I enjoyed this book immensely, and will have to look for some of the later books in the series. Four stars.</span>

                    <span>The ending! What a shocker! I couldn`t get over it for days, and wanted more! I found this book by chance and read it because I am interested in Imperial Russia. Boy, was I surprised at how good it was, written just as though the author had been there. I was so impressed with the detail of the setting, and the translation was excellent and very readable. I of course do not know Russian and haven`t an idea of what the read is like in Russian, but if it is any better than this translation it must be superb indeed! Try not to look ahead, but it will be hard not to... just think of the surprise you will rob yourself of if you do! It is hard to find good surprise endings these days. As I read this book, I was reminded of the original tv series Wild, Wild, West and some of the evil characters that James came up against. This novel is set at the same time or thereabouts and Ruth Rendell is correct in describing this author as an Ian Fleming type! I want to read all of his books, and I have missed Erast since finishing the book! Bring on more! Bravo!</span>

                    <span>Akunin's "Winter Queen" is a wonderful addition to the mystery genre. We meet Erast Fandorin in 1876 Moscow, as he attempts to solve a mysterious suicide. Soon, while he is investigating, a murder is committed, and Erast knows he is on to something. Frankly, Erast is quite lucky here, as fate prevents him from dying at least three times. That is why this book is only 4 stars instead of five. Good background on "Russian" roulette, and on the moody fatalism of Russians. I really liked how the conspiracy was found, and its purpose. The book should have kept its "Azazel" title for America, as it is much more relevant to the story. Count Hippolyte is an intriguing sidekick type, and I hope to see him again in an another Fandorin novel. Great shocker of an ending. Goes out literally in a bang.</span>
