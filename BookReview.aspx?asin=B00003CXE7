                <span id="Label1">A big-budget summer epic with money to burn and a scale worthy of its golden Hollywood predecessors, Ridley Scott's <I>Gladiator</I> is a rousing, grisly, action-packed epic that takes moviemaking back to the Roman Empire via computer-generated visual effects. While not as fluid as the computer work done for, say, <I>Titanic</I>, it's an impressive achievement that will leave you marveling at the glory that was Rome, when you're not marveling at the glory that is Russell Crowe. Starring as the heroic general Maximus, Crowe firmly cements his star status both in terms of screen presence and acting chops, carrying the film on his decidedly non-computer-generated shoulders as he goes from brave general to wounded fugitive to stoic slave to gladiator hero. <I>Gladiator</I>'s plot is a whirlwind of faux-Shakespearean machinations of death, betrayal, power plays, and secret identities (with lots of faux-Shakespearean dialogue ladled on to keep the proceedings appropriately "classical"), but it's all briskly shot, edited, and paced with a contemporary sensibility. Even the action scenes, somewhat muted but graphic in terms of implied violence and liberal bloodletting, are shot with a veracity that brings to mind--believe it or not--<I>Saving Private Ryan</I>, even if everyone is wearing a toga. As Crowe's nemesis, the evil emperor Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix chews scenery with authority, whether he's damning Maximus's popularity with the Roman mobs or lusting after his sister Lucilla (beautiful but distant Connie Nielsen); Oliver Reed, in his last role, hits the perfect notes of camp and <I>gravitas</I> as the slave owner who rescues Maximus from death and turns him into a coliseum star. Director Scott's visual flair is abundantly in evidence, with breathtaking shots and beautiful (albeit digital) landscapes, but it's Crowe's star power that will keep you in thrall--he's a true gladiator, worthy of his legendary status. Hail the conquering hero! <I>--Mark Englehart</I> </span>

                    <span>I completely dug this film from beginning to end,and every aspect of it,from the breathtaking cinamatography,the expertly staged battle sequences,and exqusite set-design,to the stellar performances of a top-notch cast,rang true.The film starts with a stunning battle and doesen't let up from the time Maximus says"on my mark,unleash Hell". Do they ever.Russell Crowe is perfect in the lead role,as an expert warrior with a grieving soul and a deep sense of honor and loyalty.It's a true star-making turn,and he oozes rugged charisma from every pore.Equally impressive,but in the exact opposite way,is Juaquin Phoenix as the conniving,decadent,deeply evil Emperor.Also great support from Richard Harris and the late,great Oliver Reed.Director Ridley Scott uses his gift for composition and visual flair to great effect,giving each scene a painterly burnish and unforgettable depth,whether it's the after-life of Maximus' dreams,the bustling,grand sprawl of Rome,the rip-roaring battles of the Coluseum,or the sinister twinkle in the Emporer's eyes.At one point Maximus admonishes the bloodthirsty crowd:"Is this not what you wanted? Are you not entertained?" Indeed we are Russell,very much so.What a great film.</span>

                    <span>Most times when studios go out to produce a movie of this size and grandeur the most important parts of the movie, mainly the plot and the acting, are lost to the fight scenes and the special effects. What makes this movie rise above all other action/drama film is that it has both a strong story and cast as well as very complex and beautifully shot battle sequences. And not to mention stellar performances by leads Russell Crowe (The Insider), Joaquin Phoenix (8MM), Connie Nielsen (Mission to Mars), and Oliver Reed (Funny Bones) who passed away during the filming of Gladiator.<P>Having defeated the last hoard of Barbarians, sealing the lands for the Roman Empire, General Maximus (Crowe) had proven himself to be loyal to Rome and to its Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (wonderfully played by Richard Harris). As a result, the dying Aurelius plans to hand over the Empire to Maximus rather than his corupt son Commodus (Phoenix). Upon finding out that his father has named Maximus the sucessor to the throne in place of himself, Commodus becomes angered by his father's decission and takes matters into his own hands. Knowing that Maximus is a threat to him, Commodus places him under arrest and orders his guards to execute him in secrecy. Narrowly escaping death, Maximus rushes home to try to save his family from a similar fate, only to arrive after his son and wife have already been murdered by Commodus' troops. <P>With nothing left to live for and no where left to go, Maxiums eventually finds himself a slave to a former Gladiator named Proximo (Reed). Having gained his freedom long ago, he now purchases slaves to fight in the battle arena, betting for his experienced fighters and against his worthless fighters in order to make a profit. However, when Maxiums, feuled by rage and a need for vengance, easily defeats all whom he encounters, surpassing all other fighters in every way, Proximo realizes that there is something different about this man the other slaves call "The Spaniard". And when Commodus, the new Caesar, initiates the Gladiator games in commemoration of his late father, Maximus, who Commodus believes is dead, is determind to go Rome, where the games are being held, and take revenge on the man who took everything away from him.<P>Connie Nielsen who playes Lucilla, Commodus's sister, is the sole female character in this male dominated film. However, she holds up very well with Phoenix and Crowe during their numerous dialogues and shows great talent in each scene as both sister to the Caesar and mother to her eight year old child Lucius (Spencer Treat Clarck).<P>Djimon Hunsou (Amistad) also appears in the film as a fellow slave/Gladiator who becomes friends with Crowe, helping him complete his goal of taking his revenge on Commodus.<P>And Director Ridley Scott, most well known for his Sci-fi/fantasy flick Blade Runner, has brought Rome and all it's spectacle, glory, and gore to the big screen in a way that puts it along side classics like Ben Hur and Sparticus. It has quality, quantity, and a uniqueness to it that makes it worth the $9.50 price for addmission.<P>All in all, this movie reigns supreme in my book. Visually stunning, wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, and superbly directed. If people want to see how a great action/drama movie is made, then this is the movie you gotta see. <P>Revuman: Live by the sword, die by the sword, but eat first...peace!</span>

                    <span>this is a three star movie with a five star dvd. one of the biggest problems with the movie was the first battle. i was expecting braveheart quality but ended with a battle less entertaining than the one in dragonheart. the blurry camera and closeups made it impossible to tell what was happening. if you want to see a movie like this but better, see the last samurai or braveheart.</span>

                    <span>I seldom write reviews for anything, but for a movie like 'Gladiator' I'm willing to make an exception, and gosh if it's worth doing it!! <BR> The movie, by far the best of the year 2000, is not only an award-winning production, but it is also one of the few that I personally enjoy watching again and again and again. Not because it is flawless (at times the storyline is quite predictable) but because it portrays life and death in the Roman Empire in such a way that it really bring those old buildings we all know since childhood (the Coliseum, the Forum, Via Appia, etc) back to life. <BR> And yet it does so not at the expense of the story but through it, from the characters, to the script (they're so many quotables lines from Maximus and Commudus alone to make a CD)...in fact everything in the movie, from the battle in Germanica to the last fight at the Coliseum, is portrayed with realism plus an amazing score lacking in so many movies these days. <BR> The movie of course is not to be seen as "history" in the academic sense but rather as an historical exercise, Holywood style, of one of the most facinating and complex periods of Western History. The attention to the detail is amazing, especially in the opening scene (the battle in Germanica) and the gladiatorial fights. Even most deleted scenes are great in the sense that they allow us to understand the characters a little bit more (Commudus' sword smashing of his father's marble bust is a most see), although they neither add nor take of the story. The casting is superb, with Russell Crow in the main role, Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commudus, along with such legends as Oliver Reed as the freedman slaveholder and Richard Harris as the great Marcus Aurelius.<BR> I'll recomend strongly that anyone who sees this movie shoudl do his/her homework and do a little of reading about Rome, both as a Republic and after, and the huge importance of the entertaining business in her late everyday life (an importance unreached until recent times).<BR> Overall, a classic epic of an scope and ambition not seen since 'Ben Hur'; full of action, drama... and yes, more action. <BR> As the Romans themselves said, Faber est quisque fortunae suae... each one is the architect of his own fortune. Feliciter!</span>

                    <span>Ridley Scott's movie, "Gladiator" is one based on fiction of a General in the times of Marcus Aurelius. It tracks the life of a general who is effective in battle and is to rewarded by the emperor with the crown of Rome until it can be handed back to the senate. The movie won 5 oscars and is compared to Ben-Hur, which is ludicrous. For starters, Ben-Hur had William Wyler as the director who went to Gore Vidal to fix the screenplay. This movie will imaginative has so many historical inaccuracies, it is funny that it can be even thought to be in the same league. <P>Some of the actors did a decent job, these include Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and his daughter, Lucilla. I had problems with Russell Crowe's acting. He is unmistakably patrician, however, and physically very like Richard Burton, with Burton's battered face and gravel-voiced machismo. But Crowe's Maximus is no Mark Antony; there is no destructive love interest in the picture. Maximus is sweetly devoted to his late wife; though it turns out he once had a bit of an unbuckling thing going in his backstory for Commodus's lovely sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). I did not think that he deserved the best actor oscar. He has a very limited repertoire of actions and emotions. Crowe is no Tom Hanks or Geoffrey Rush in acting, he does not have depth and breadth of acting.<P>This movie cannot stand the test of time, it does not have great screenplay and historical integrity. It will gradually ebb away from the minds of the people. To stand out from the other movies, it has to have a new paradigm, either in acting or story or screenplay, none of which are depicted. Another one of those movies that do not deserve the best picture oscars. It is OK to watch this once. If you compare this director with Ang Lee, who did "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman", and "Sense and Sensibility" you can see the difference in directing talent. See them and judge for yourself.</span>
