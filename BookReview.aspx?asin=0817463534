                    <span>In my opinion this book gives you a basic training of view camera. In particular it explains very well all view camera movements, but I would have preferred if there had been more details in those explanations, with more examples and other. Another point that I would have preferred different was the sequence of the chapters. In firsts chapters where is explained camera structure, accessory and other, there are too many reference at camera movements, that you haven't known yet, because chapter of movements is after.
<br />Anyway, this book, is well written and easy comprehensible, but in my opinion in some parts is too condensed; so my rate is 4 stars.

                    <span>This is an excellent book which meets its purpose well: providing all the important information you need to dive into the greatest format there is in photography: the view camera.  <p>It's important to note that this book is not titled "How To Be An Artist" - this isn't at all the point of the book.  Too many people are interested in being 'creative' before they have a clue technically as to what they're doing, which wrecks a lot of photography that could be excellent.  I teach large format photography, and the skills taught in this book are absolutly essential to the technical aspects of the large format camera as a necessary step BEFORE the creative aspect.  <p>This book explores the endless possibilities in shooting with a view camera; possibilities that are nearly never available to those shooting smaller formats.  Everything is covered in the book from shooting to processing to printing, in an easy-to-read fashion, with excellent photos and diagrams along the way to help guide the reader.  <p>I would recommend this book to all those just becoming interested in the view camera, as well as those who have quite a bit of experience.</span>

                    <span>This is a thin book designed really to introduce the very basics of view cameras. There are sufficient explanations of the various movements and the reasons for using them, but not much that would really make you want to get out there and get creative. A pity really that most beginning books dont seek to be more inspirational. Most of the information in this book is readily available from a number of individual web sites, and delivered in a more inspiring style.</span>

                    <span>As beginer to large format, I was looking for a book that would give me the basics of view cameras and their use. I already have a good foundation of photographic and exposure techniques. I found this book to be just right. No time is wasted discussing basic photography (although a nice intro to the Zone system is included, very basic), and very non-technical introduction to view cameras is presented. There is just enough math and science in this book to make you realize how much you may want to learn. After reading this book just once, I feel I can go out and use a view camera to take a picture.</span>

                    <span>This book is well-written and contains everything you need to know to buy and use a view camera.  It contains information that I haven't been able to find anywhere else.  It even gives the disadvantages of using a view camera over a newer SLR to help a novice decide whether or not to get into medium/large format photography.</span>
