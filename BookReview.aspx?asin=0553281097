                <span id="Label1"><div>Every day, you negotiate for something: prestige, money, security, love.  This straight-talking guide  will show you how to get what you want by dealing successfully with your mate, your boss, MasterCard, your children, your best friends and even yourself.  As Herb Cohen counsels, "Power is based upon perception-- if you think you've got it then you've got it.  Be patient, be personal, be informed-- and you can bargain successfully for anything."<br><br>Based on his book that spent over nine months on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, the author presents specific guidelines, personal anecdotes and practical advice drawn from his three decades of successful negotiating experience.  Here is a wealth of information and the motivation that you need to succeed.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This book is about negotiation as an integral part of successful human conduct. Mr. Cohen is not only a negotiator by profession, but also by obsession. There are Many helpful hints in this books; for example the Three Crucial variables (Power, Time and Information) and also the 14 applications of power. This book is easy to read and full of real life anecdotes about real negotiations that range from a kid who "successfuly" negotiates with his parents , to shop bargaining and to complex international negotiations as between the US and former USSR. This book will be helpful to all people from all walks of life; negotiation is a part of everybody's life.</span>

                    <span>I am back reordering this book to hand out to some new employees and I saw the previous review, which slammed this book. Had it been a Ken Blanchard book, I probably would have moved me (and my cheese) over to the purchase area and forgotten it. However, this book, "You Can Negotiate...." is one of the most influential books I have ever read, with lessons that I use daily in running a 100 mil plus division of a Fortune 1000 company.<P>Bottom line is that this book is the best negotiation book I have ever read. ( And I've read a lot of them... not to mention way too many seminars)<P>Mr. Cohen is entertaining and reveals the common elements of all negotiation, whether it is in business or your personal life.<P>Read it, enjoy it, and learn. It's a classic.<P>Terry</span>

                    <span>As per the Herb Cohen world is a giant negotiating table and one can negotiate ANYTHING.Though for many this is very convincing an argument,I prefer to disregard this golden rule a little because in my opinion it is too idealistic to say one can negotiate ANYTHING.However hard one tries,in reality,one cannot negotiate ANYTHING.The human limitations interms of right level of skills and abilities,attitude,knowledge,capacity to acquire and analyse the information in time,ability to conclude and decide, deviated perception of time, power and needs prevents us from successfully negotiating ANYTHING.<P> As a human being,internally,we all do have an inflated perception of self and like many other things it has its own advantages and disadvantages.In this book Herb Cohen has made use of these advantages very nicely and successfully.Although it is very idealistic to say you can negotiate ANYTHING,it helps much for a man on street to motivate himself and approach<BR>the negotiations positively with much confidence.In his book Herb has successfully negotiated with reality, to infuse that confidence and motivation to negotiate ANYTHING in the minds of the reader.<P> For me this book is the first structured and scientific introduction to the world of negotiations and I have benefited immensely.Though this is a very small book I took much time to complete the first reading as the contents are very informative.Just reading this book doesn't help much for a person who is serious about learning the science of negotiations.Understanding this science, and successful<BR>implementing and practising interms of building the right attitude,thoughts and views is the key and this is why I took more time in completing the first reading.It is not that after<BR>reading this book one will become master in the art of negotiations, rather this book will INITIATE one's journey in the world of negotiations.<P> I first got attracted to the subject of negotiation when I was thinking what makes people successful,how Lord Gautam Buddha and Lord Jesus were able to influence, change and convince such a huge populace.This desire to know the unknown has put me on the path of understanding the world of negotiations and psychology of human behaviour.Without understanding these two things one cannot become successful in any of his endeavours.<P> This book definitely helps in understanding the value of information,psychology of needs,and perception of power and time.It also helps in how to deal for a WIN-WIN and how to deal with the so called Soviet Style adamant people.The very presence of 'SOVIET STYLE' psyche proves that one cannot negotiate ANYTHING, as Herb very rightfully suggests to walk-away<BR>from such people.This only underlines another golden rule that one cannot negotiate successfully without any MUTUAL GAIN.</span>
