Now is the time to consider SOA and to think about how to architect applications using XML messages and loosely-coupled services. With this book, you can get a head start on building SOA applications, using the .NET Framework combined with the Web Services Enhancements (WSE) 2.0 toolkit.  <p>  Web services are hot &#150; and with the release of WSE 2.0, Microsoft developers now have a toolkit that makes it easy to implement industry-standard specifications for building secure, reliable Web services. This book provides deep insight into the newest release of the WSE toolkit: blending theory with ample C# code samples, and directly teaching you how to implement SOA solutions that are based on specifications such as WS-Security, WS-Policy, and WS-Addressing. Most .NET-based Web services are simply containers for limited RPC-style methods. This book will show you how to shift your development paradigm to create Web services that process sophisticated XML messages within a secure, service-oriented, loosely-coupled architecture. Jeff gives you the practical information you need today, while at the same time preparing you for what you will need tomorrow. <p>  Read this <a href ="http://www.axisebusiness.com/adnano/default.aspx?date=2004-05-09">blog entry</a></em> about Jeffery's latest speaking engagement at the L.A.

                    <span>This book provides a very good overview of Service-Oriented Architecture in C#: Using the Web Services Enhancements 2.0. Mr. Hasan provides alot of background information and definitions for understanding the architecture and goes into detail about how the process works. I liked his writing style and ability to express these terms in a cohesive overview and explanation. I too like some of the readers would have liked to have seen a CD of code (I am a developer). I liked the discussion on security and that he alluded to the coming indigo development. </span>

                    <span>This book serves as maybe a decent reference book if that. First off, its hardly about SOA and doesn't cover anything deep enough to really use if you are trying to get into it. The author right away breaks one of the major tenants of SOA, sharing types. If you are too lazy to search msdn or the Internet on basic .net Web Services then maybe this is a book for you.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I currently run a .NET user group so I know first hand that two of the most requested topics at my meetings are SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and WSE (Web Service Enhancements) version 2.0.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately this demand is hard to supply because there are simply very few speakers or books addressing these topics.  This book delivers on both topics!
<br />
<br />First of all, the title of the book is right on the money.  Jeffrey Hasan does a great job explaining SOA concepts by demonstrating how WSE 2.0 allows you to implement them.  Most tech books I read are not balanced, either it is too conceptual with no implementation details, or it only has implementation details and doesn't flesh out the concepts.  This book is very well balanced.
<br />
<br />You do not have to be a web services guru to read this book but it certainly helps to have some web service experience.  This book would be useful for any developer/architect interested in the details of SOA/WSE and the future promise of indigo.
<br />
<br />A major bonus that is included with this book is over 20 pages of great references so that you can dig even deeper into the topics covered in the book.  The only thing missing from the book is the CD with all of the samples included.
<br />
<br />I found the book to be very readable, and does a very nice job moving you from the traditional web service, to a message oriented one and then finally to a service oriented web service.  That section of the book is one of the best at explaining why simply having web services does not mean you have an SOA.  
<br />
<br />I would strongly recommend this book, and it gets my personal highest honor, which means it is carried in my laptop case, so I always have it.
<br />

                    <span>The web used to be so simple. You had a bunch of pages, and like magic you could hyper-link to an entirely different page. Then it made a lot of sense to back the web site with a database. That way a standard page could pull up different data as needed. Kind of like this page, where the book title and description changes within a standard template. 
<br />
<br />Then came web services companies that supply some particular kind of service. The first of these (or at least the first that most of us got exposed to) were companies that checked, authorized and/or billed credit cards so we could do e-commerce. The companies in this business established standards. And now the world has established standards for such service oriented architectures (SOA). As of the moment the world doesn't quite agree on what these standards should be. Two of the standards are incorporated in IBM's Websphere, and the J2EE. 
<br />
<br />This book is on the Microsoft version on the way it should be done, called Web Services Enhancements or WSE and specifically the 2.0 version. If this is what you are thinking of using, or have been directed to use, this book provides a great introduction to the Microsoft approach. It a beginners book so far as SOA/WSE is concerned, but you should have some experience in .NET and in programming.</span>
