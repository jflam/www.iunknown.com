                    <span>Forget about Gary Wills at Gettysburg.Historian and theologian, Ronald White has written definitively on President Abraham Lincoln's definitive speech on THE CAUSE & NATURE of the American
<br />Civil War. In the studied judgement of Lincoln,our Civil War...[The bloodiest conflict ever fought by Americans. Where at--for example: ANTIETAM(9/17/1862)26,000 Americans killed each other in one day; GETTYSBURG,56,000(equivalent of America's combat fatalities of the entire Vietnam war)were killed in three days from July 1-July 3,1863; the killing field of Spotsylvania's BLOODY ANGLE(5/12/1864)12,000 were killed in one day;and COLD HARBOUR(two weeks later on June 2,1864;7000 of General Grant's soldiers were killed in fifteen minutes]...was TRIBULATION Punishment by Almighty God for the SIN,"the offence...of AMERICAN SLAVERY".
<br />
<br />The Apocalyptic tone and Biblical measure of THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS--granting its profoundly prayerful;hopeful;and mercy imploring coda/conclusion)are analytically examined by White. Only a most obtuse reader can avoid the implication of Lincoln's statement: "Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.Yet,if God wills that it continue until the wealth piled by the bondman's two-hundred and fifty years of unrequitted toil shall be sunk,AND UNTIL EVERY DROP OF BLOOD DRAWN WITH THE LASH, SHALL BE PAID FOR BY ANOTHER DRAWN WITH THE SWORD, as was said three thousand years ago,so still it must be said,'the judgements of the Lord,are true and righteous altogether.'"(p.16,handwritten text;p.19). Professor White provides unimpeachable evidence of the profoundly religious character of this President and his resignation to the will of God(and his own agency as President of the United States(cf:Apendix II,p208):"'if God wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for complicity in that wrong,impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God.' Yours truly,A.Lincoln"   
<br />In addition to White's superb text of explication,Lincoln's MEDIDATION ON DIVINE WILL 9/2/1862[in Appendix III,pp.209-210]is
<br />provided to thwart typical PM revision/deconstruction to oppose our greatest leader's Confession that,"the will of God prevails... that this present civil war...is part of God's purpose:GOD WILLS THIS CONTEST(sic!)"...
<br />
<br />Implication for America's Blue/Red divide is equally unavoidable.
<br />We have a Nation divided. ONE asserts an often unreasoning, "rationalist" secularism that would remove THE WILL OF GOD from our Polity,schools;legal discourse;and ethical foundations... 
<br />
<br />[46,000,000 ABORTIONS cannot possibly be defended by anything  espousing to comprise or defend freedom. First Amendment rights have been deconstructed and bent to justify perversion of our children's innocence: per Media glorification of sexual promiscuity; pornographic language; violence-in/as- entertainment/sports; meretricious exultation of rank materialism. The degradation of our Public School system by its oligarchs and lackey mediocrities in the name of an agenda of Self-centered "esteem"--using full panoply of racist victimology and PC psycho-babble--is too evident to warrant serious debate...
<br />
<br />The OTHER prays and pleads.(Sometimes with humility.Sometimes with Savonarola's Inquisitorial shrillness).The War in Iraq is not the question. THE WAR for the heart & soul,"of the last best hope of mankind"is. Professor Ronald White's essay is marvelous opportunity to ponder spiritual wisdom of one of the greatest men who ever lived and...under terrible challenge...perhaps the Greatest American. Forget Gary Wills erudition on GETTYSBURG. Forget the hollow,intellectual dilettanism of Maureen Dowd and the NYT homies.As White observes: "Lincoln speaks forever against any 'God Bless America'theology that fails to come to terms with evil and hypocracy in its own house. While the audience waited to hear words of self-congratulation, Lincoln continued to explain the implications of the judgement of God. He knew the peril of theological politics is the danger of self-righteousness"(p.203).  
<br />BUT THAT WAS THEN! The United States has come full circle.
<br />Post-modern secularism...obeying self-apotheosis and un-Natural Law...worshiping Deconstrucion of Enlightenment Reason...is now rampant. The HOUSE is again divided."God wills this contest,and wills that it should not end yet...and having begun...He could give the victory to either side any day:THE CONTEST PROCEEDS..." (p.216, Abraham Lincoln)[10 stars:A magnificent study in a time of National danger]  </span>

                    <span>Several recent and outstanding books have each examined in detail a single address by Abraham Lincoln.  These books have the overall goal of explaining Lincoln's Presidency, the meaning and significance of the Civil War, and the continued impact of the issues raised in this conflict upon today's United States.  These books include Gary Wills's study of the Gettysburg Address,  the books by John Corry and Harold Holzer on Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, Allen Guelzo's study of the Emancipation Proclmation, and, the book I will discuss here, "Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The Second Inaugural" (2002) by Ronald C. White, Jr.
<br />
<br />Ronald White is a professor of American Religous History at the San Francisco Theological Seminary.  Given his background as a scholar of religion, it is unsurprising that Professor White focuses on President Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and on the religious vision he finds Lincoln set forth in that great speech.
<br />
<br />The book begins with a chapter setting the stage on the cold and rainy March 4, 1865, in Washington D.C. when Lincoln delivered his brief 703-word address.  Union arms were close to victory, and the large audience undoubtedly expected a paean to the might of the Union Army together with tones of triumph.
<br />
<br />President Lincoln delivered a speech entirely different.  In short compass, he delivered a meditiation on the origin of the War, its cost in human life, its origin in the institution of slavery, a call to forbearance and charity, and, most importantly for Professor White, a religious understanding of the meaning of the War.
<br />
<br />Professor White explores the speech on a paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line basis.  He discusses closely the words of Lincoln's text, and he places the text in context of events in the War and of mid-19th Century America.  He offers illuminating insights on the Second Inaugural by discussing a short letter Lincoln wrote on April 4, 1864, to the Governor of Kentucky in which Lincoln explained his reasons for issuing the Emancipation Proclmation. He also relies heavily on a short passage of jottings Lincoln prepared for himself in September, 1862, captioned "Meditation on the Divine Will."
<br />
<br />The Second Inaugural as Professor White expounds it sets forth a complex religous message. The War, as Professor White reads Lincoln, was the will of a living and ethical God and was a recompense for the sin of slavery. This sin was nation-wide in scope and could not be imputed only to the rebelling Confederates. During the course of the conflict, Lincoln had moved from the agnosticism and determinism of his youth to a concept of a personal God.  His God was nondenominational and nontribal rather that the God of any particular creed (Lincoln never joined a church) or of factions, including the North or the South.  The scourge of slavery had brought on the War, but the end of the War opened the opportunity for forgiveness, reconciliation, and justice, "with malice toward none,with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right."
<br />
<br />It is an impressive and theologically-complex vision.  Professor White writes with a purpose of encouraging meditation among his readers on the role of religion (not denominationalism) in our public life and on the continuing sruggle in our country to eliminate the vestiges of slavery and racism. He writes (p. 202):
<br />
<br />"The Lincoln that is available to us comes with no simple answers.  The chasm of race, which undergirded the legal structure of slavery, continues even though the Civil Rights movement, a hundred years after the Civil War, spearheaded political and legal action intended to right ancient wrongs.  Martin Luther King, Jr. chose to speak with the imposing statue of Lincoln as the background when he offered his dream for America."
<br />
<br />Those readers interested in exploring further the complicated question of Lincoln's philosophical and religous beliefs may wish to read Allen Guelzo's biography "Redeemer President" together with his more recent study of the Emancipation Proclamation.

                    <span>I never thought a book about a speech would be so very interesting.  White does a great job dissecting this short speech and Lincoln's thinking behind it.  At the time, the speech was not thought of well, but after his assassination, the words became the last testament of this great president.  With malice toward none and charity to all, these words came to embody Abraham Lincoln.<br>I was especially interested in the spiritual aspects in both the speech and Lincoln.  White makes Lincoln come across as a spiritual person, who believed in fate.  The book examines his experience in three Protesant denominations.  As we look at Lincoln's spiritual growth, we find this reflected in his speeches, especially his Second Inaugural.  The last speech contained many references to God.<br>This is a great book about Lincoln.  For those who want to understand Lincoln more, White's book examines a crucial episode in the final stages of this president's life.</span>

                    <span>This is a short book about a short speech; but both are saturated by meaning and insight.  Ronald White's analysis of Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address (which Lincoln gave weeks before the end of the Civil War), portrays Lincoln as a thinker and artist, wrapped in a politician.  White deconstructs each word and phrase in the speech/sermon, firmly setting them within the historical context that includes  Lincoln's speaking style, Frederick Douglass, Bible-smuggling, Aristotle's rhetoric, the reading public, theological debates within Christendom, the little table in front of Lincoln while he spoke, long-forgotten sermons delivered in the Washington church where Lincoln and his family worshiped, the overtaxed printing presses which rushed out copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin, skeptical foreign newspapers, and so many other aspects of this lost and sad world.  American deaths in the Civil War almost equaled American deaths in all subsequent wars, and yet, in this speech, Lincoln avoided blame for the war and gloating over the North's impending victory, and instead invoked a merciful God that punished the whole of the country for "America's (not the South's) slavery."  White captures a Lincoln who was a man of his times but was somehow able to rise above them.  He has written a masterful book here, blessedly short.  We need more short books like this.  History, like speeches, can be a lot more palatable in small bites than in the large tomes that crowd contemporary bookshelves.</span>
