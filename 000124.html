<p><P>Please excuse this interruption in your regularly scheduled technical weblog. I need to vent.</P><br />
<P>I just had the worst customer experience that I can recall. And it has to do with my treatment at the hands of Expedia. Along the way I learned quite a lot about exactly what your rights are as a consumer at the hands of Internet retailers and what, if anything, you can do to protect your rights. </P><br />
<P>I'm writing this entry for a couple of reasons. The first is to calm myself down after an extremely frustrating morning. The second is to share my story in hopes that this might help others who find themselves in a similar situation.</P><br />
<P>My story begins on June 16. On that day, I went to Expedia.com to book my flight for an upcoming business trip. I recall the evening well; we were at my parent's house and were about to leave for dinner. I suddenly remembered that I needed to book my flights to take advantage of the 21 day advance fare. So I went online and booked the flights. The transaction went smoothly, took only a few minutes and we went out for a great dinner.</P><br />
<P>Fast forward to this morning. I went back through my email archives looking for my confirmation email from Expedia about the trip. There was none there. Now, I was worried. It has happened in the past that I researched ticket fares but forgot to purchase the ticket. So I logged onto Expedia, and discovered that I had booked the flight on Expedia.ca (I live in Canada). After logging onto Expedia.ca, I found my itinerary. That's when the horror story begins.</P><br />
<P>There was something seriously wrong with my itinerary. I had originally planned to fly from Toronto to Knoxville, TN the evening of July 8, returning the morning of July 11. In American, that's 7/8/02 to 7/11/02. However, when I looked at my itinerary, it showed me leaving 7-Aug-02 and returning 7-Nov-02! In American that's 8/7/02 and 11/7/02. Clearly the itinerary had the month and the day digits transposed. </P><br />
<P>Now here's the problem: I have absolutely no evidence that I correctly booked the ticket for the dates that I had requested. I didn't have a print out of my itinerary because I was expecting Expedia to send me a confirmation email like they always did. In hindsight I now realize that it was clearly a mistake to trust that they would send me a confirmation email.</P><br />
<P>Today is only four days before my flight was supposed to leave. I called Expedia's customer support department, and talked to an agent. She couldn't help me, so she forwarded me to someone in their Customer Care department. I talked to the second woman. She quickly got up to speed with my problem and we began discussing possible remedies. I explained to her that I had no evidence from Expedia that I had purchased a ticket for travel on the dates requested. I asked if she could explain why their computers had not sent me a confirmation email. Furthermore, I asked if anyone else had experienced these problems. She replied quite belligerently that "their computers work". When I asked for proof, she replied that "she knew that they worked". </P><br />
<P>When I asked what they could do about it, she told me that they would assess me a change fee plus any difference in fares. This was the only time that I lost my cool. I replied "Well the airline's going to screw me over on the fare because it's now only 4 days before departure. That ticket will be $2000+ CDN!". She seemed to take offense to the my saying "screw me over" and scolded me for being "unprofessional". She then testily asked "well do you want me to bother checking what that will cost?" When I said yes, she then put me on hold <EM>immediately.</EM></P><br />
<P>The time was 11:50 EST. After being on hold for a couple of minutes, I decided to look up the fare for myself. That took about 2 minutes to get the result: $2029.00 CDN as I had suspected. The hold music played on my speakerphone until 11:58. I stayed on the now silent line for an additional three minutes until 12:01. That was when I hung up and called again, hoping to speak to a different rep. </P><br />
<P>To say that I was mad at this point would be an understatement. It should not take an experienced Customer Care representative 11+ minutes to look up a flight on Expedia, right? Not when a customer&nbsp;can do it in 2 minutes. I have a voice mail from that same Customer Care representative at 12:05 calling back, wondering why we were disconnected. At that point, I was talking to other representatives at Expedia.</P><br />
<P>Once again&nbsp;I called back in. The front line agent couldn't help, and referred me to a Customer Care representative. The second Customer Care rep that I spoke to was much more professional, but could not help me resolve my problems. I then requested to speak to a supervisor at their call center. She was equally professional, but she also lacked the authority to solve my problem. But she did refer me to her boss, Rick Robertson, who is the Director of Customer Service at Expedia (425 564 7200). </P><br />
<P>I tried to call Rick today, but of course, it's July 4th in the US so nobody was around to take my call. I left a voice mail, and am now awaiting a reply.</P><br />
<P>To summarize what happened here, there were a number of safeguards that failed.</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>Expedia.com failed to send me an email confirmation with my itinerary<br />
<LI>I failed to print out the confirmation web page on Expedia.com<br />
<LI>I failed to request a printed copy of my itinerary and a paper receipt.</LI></UL><br />
<P>I realize that it is entirely possible that I had made a mistake in transposing those digits. However, the confirmation page on Expedia clearly displays the month of the departure date as a three-letter abbreviation and not a number. I find it <EM>unlikely</EM> that I would have looked at that page when reviewing my itinerary and failed to have spotted that. However, if I am presented with reasonable proof that this was what I had indeed selected, and that I had been negligent in reviewing my final itinerary before purchase, I would be happy to pay for my own mistake.</P><br />
<P>However, I don't have an email from Expedia that confirms my itinerary. In fact, I have <EM>nothing</EM> but my recorded itinerary on Expedia's web site as proof. If this were a case of a bug resulting in the transposition of those digits, I would have absolutely no way of proving the existence of this bug. An email or a piece of paper from Expedia would have proved this to my satisfaction. But no email or piece of paper was ever sent from Expedia.</P><br />
<P>I tried getting some help from Visa. However, their customer service reps told me that since I had a pre-existing account with Expedia, that they could not do anything to recover the funds. In other words, the fact that Expedia is holding onto my credit card number means that if they mistakenly charged me for a product that I would have to take it up with Expedia to get my money back! Visa only normally intervenes in cases where I can claim that I did not give a merchant my credit card number. This was not the what happened in this case. I <EM>wanted </EM>to do that transaction. It's just that I didn't get what I thought that I had paid for.</P><br />
<P>So, what's the take home lesson here?</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>Always get some kind of paper or electronic back-up for your purchases. A clear audit trail here will help you tremendously in case a dispute ever comes up.<br />
<LI>Do not assume that your credit card company will go to bat for you if you dispute a charge.<br />
<LI>Watch out for places that keep your credit card number on file. Remember that this is treated as a "pre-authorized" merchant, even if you never signed for it.<br />
<LI>Patiently and politely escalate your complaint with the merchant. </LI></UL><br />
<P>The jury is still out on Expedia's customer service. All I want from Expedia is the following:</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>An apology from the customer service rep who treated me rudely, and from her supervisor(s).<br />
<LI>Proof that I had entered the dates incorrectly, in which case I would accept a credit with United Airlines.<br />
<LI>In the absence of proof that I had entered the dates incorrectly, a simple voiding of the transaction.</LI></UL><br />
<P>That's it. After this experience, I'm not sure whether I would ever do business with Expedia again. I realize that it would be wrong of me to boycott a company based on the actions of just one of their reps; everyone else I talked to from Expedia treated me with professionalism and respect. However, my faith in the system has been severely shaken. </P></p>

<p>Expedia customer support is the worst possible.  My story is too long to recant at this time (or too painful).  The short story is they left me on hold for at least 30 minutes.  Promised to call me back with alternative options to a "4" Star Hotel that was somewhere between 2 and 3.  Never called back.  When I called again to be reconnected to the "supervisor" that was to call me back.  The customer support person told me she had to check with her supervisor first, then put me on hold and left me there until I hung up 30 minutes later.</p>

<p>I will write a letter.... I expect no response.  The only worse customer support I have experienced is MCI!</p>

<p>I would like to report on the rude,  unprofessional service that I experienced at the Hotel Escalante in Naples, Florida.  My wife had several hundred dollars stolen from her wallet in a locked room and the management of this hotel has been most inconsiderate from the minute the burglary was reported. I highly recommend that anyone consider other hotels in that area.</p>
