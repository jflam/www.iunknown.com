                <span id="Label1">Today graphic design is done almost exclusively on screen, where colors look different than when they are printed. To help designers and the people who work with them address this critical disparity, authors Michael and Pat Rogondino have completely revised and expanded their standard manual, Computer Color (0-87701-739-5). A boon for all designers, production people, artists, and printers, <I>Process Color Manual</I> provides an astounding 24,000 colors that match from computer display to printed page. The standard-issue Pantone color books, by comparison, can cost as much as $175 and offer only 3000 colors!  <P>Also included with the book is a handy cardboard mask, white on one side and black on the other, that allows the user to isolate a specific block of color. This sturdy color guide partly came about due to demand from the people who have sworn by the previous edition: Chronicle Books designers. For accuracy, accessability, value, and sheer volume, <I>Process Color Manual</I> is indispensible to everyone who works with graphics and colors.</span>

                    <span>I lost this book due to our recent earthquake, and here I am ordering it again already. This manual is really indispensable in specifying process builds and is an unbelievable bargain for what it offers. It's more accurate than the 1999 Pantone Process book and is way more accurate than relying on a software's spot-to-process conversions. Don't guess or hope -- use this book and get the color you want!</span>

                    <span>this is a stupendous compendium of reflective color variations, presented as specific combinations of the printer's four process inks -- cyan, yellow, magenta and black. the book moves systematically across the halftone screen variations of single inks (from most saturated to near white), then two, three, and four color mixtures. two color mixstures are shown as a grid of swatches spread across two facing pages, 5% increments across the column color, and 10% increments in the rows. mixtures of three or four colors are shown stepwise across several pages.<P>i'm a painter, not a printer, but i find this guide easily as valuable as much more expensive color atlases (from munsell or the swedish ncs) as a way to analyze a specific color in terms of hue balance (as a mixture of the three subtractive primary colors CYM) and reduced saturation (increased black, or screen value below 100%). this is all i need to mix a close match using whatever paints i have available.<P>the major drawback is that although the swatches are systematically organized, there is no index or page lookup table to guide you to a specific color mixture -- each page is headed simply "two (three, four) color mixture". if you know you want an orangish color (equal parts magenta and yellow), but aren't sure how bright or dull the orange should be, there is no way to find the relevant color pages adding cyan and/or black except by leafing through the book one page at a time. that's 260 pages, folks!<P>the introduction to subtractive color mixing, computer color programs and good printing practice is concise and accurate. an extremely reliable and useful, if inconvenient, reference.</span>

                    <span>Wow. I am rarely impressed with books on color. However, this book is fantastic. The entire book is composed of blocks of color with the cooresponding CMYK values. I have found printed color reproduction of these values much more accurate than using the Pantone Process Guide. In the past, I have had consistent color matching troubles using low end-quick turn around 4 color postcard printers. They do not do Pantone Matching on these print runs - so you have to cross your fingers and pray the printed colors are within a few levels of the Process Pantone Color you plugged in. I have had much better results with these types of print runs using the CMYK values from this book. This is a book that sits on my desk within arms reach. A must have for all print designers.</span>

                    <span>The color combinations are very comprehensive. However, I found the methodology used in organizing the color grids extremely confusing, and not very practical. I purchased this book to replace a well-used process color manual given to me by a printer 15 years ago. I'm disappointed, as I had high hopes from the description.</span>
