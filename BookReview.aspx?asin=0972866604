                    <span>This delightful children's book helps other children learn how to understand, respect and celebrate other cultures (as well as their own). The chief character is Rain, a soon to be 6 year old Asian child who tells the story of how she was adopted by an Italian NY single who came to China to get her, along with her first stuffed animal.. a hippo named Bo. It's a heartwarming tale of family love and beginnings. Great illustrations!<BR>Raleigh Pinskey, author of 101 Ways to Promote Yourself.</span>

                    <span>Both of my girls, elder aged 6 and younger shortly will be 3, love this book. As they are from China, and I am a single Mom, they often have to be reminded it is NOT their story, but it is LIKE their story. They don't really seem to care - - they love Bo and her Hippo, and the straight-forward way the adoption story unfolds. It is clear and simple, and filled with love .... and that makes it 100% ok for us!<P>If you are looking for a way to introduce the concept of adoption to a young child, this book is a very nice way to do that. If you are looking for a way to broach the subject of your child's adoption with her/him, this is a great way to open the door.<P>Families are Forever .. .it's as simple as that .... straight-forward concept, presented in a way children can accept, understand and work into their perceptions in an easy way.</span>

                    <span>Masterfully written, this book immediately touches one's heart. Rain, the central character, takes us through her long journey to her new adopted family, crossing continents and cultural boundaries, and teaches us, in a way that only a child can, the power and poignancy of a family's love.<P>Through this book, we are reminded that a family's love really is forever.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book...I am considering adopting a child and found this book really heartwarming...I bought a copy for my nieces because I think it's good to expose them to the idea that there are all kinds of families in the world, and adoption, single mothers, and interracial families are all gently discussed. <P>My seven year old niece was able to read the book to her 4 year old sister, and both of them loved the story! The younger one was really excited about the pictures and Annie is her favorite movie, so this was a natural. The elder has a Chinese adoptee in her class this year, so this book addressed some really germain topics.<P>Someday maybe I can read this book to MY daughter!</span>

                    <span>This book is a great find and a wonderful story about love and family formation. This book follows one girl's heartwarming, fascinating journey from China to America into the arms and life of her loving mom and extended family. Lighthearted and touching, the story is narrated by Rain, a six year old Chinese-American adopted girl. I'm looking forward to reading what is in store for Rain and her friends next!<BR>J. Benatar, mother of three.</span>
