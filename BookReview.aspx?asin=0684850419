                <span id="Label1">Want to be more successful, happier, wealthier? You could hire a personal coach: a business and personal-growth mentor who consults with you, offering advice and insights. Or you could read this book by Thomas Leonard, the "father of personal coaching" and founder of Coach U, a virtual university that trains coaches from 30 countries. In his lively <I>The Portable Coach</I>, Leonard presents 28 principles to help you shape your life, career, and relationships so that they are satisfying and profitable, with 10 ways to accomplish each principle, and additional tips and self-tests.<p> This is no superficial, feel-good-now, get-rich-tomorrow book. It's like having a year of sessions with this celebrated coach without paying his $400 per hour fee. Flip through the book until you land on just the right tip for what you need to learn right now, or take a progressive journey through the book, putting the tips into action as you go. <I>The Portable Coach</I> bursts with more immediately useful, personally relevant suggestions than you can possibly use. It should expand your mind, improve your performance, enhance your relationships (business and personal), help you enjoy life more, and give you many swift kicks toward becoming your best. Highly recommended. <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>If you can get through the first chapter on "selfishness," this book really does have a lot to offer.  Using charged words like "become incredibly selfish" and absolutes like "tolerate nothing" was an integral part of Leonard's in-your-face, we-don't-have-time-for-you-not-to-get-this style.  So many of us in the professional coaching industry have been touched by Leonard.  We owe him a big debt of gratitude for making the profession of "coaching" the big opportunity it is for us today.  This book is a good legacy to the man, as well as to what he thought was important for us to understand in our lives and in the lives of our clients.</span>

                    <span>I first bought this book three years ago at a Coaching Tour stop in Denver.  The late Thomas Leonard signed my copy, making it a treasure in more ways than one.<p>The primary way it is a treasure is that it is exceptionally useful both as a personal growth tool and also as a book to work through with the folks who I am privileged to coach.  The writing is conversational and not filled with jargon.<p>It is destined to be a classic, even moreso with the untimely, way to early death of the author.</span>

                    <span>Most of us know the things in life that are preventing us from reaching our true potential. Then again, some of us simply don't care. However, after reading this highly informative book, I discovered that there are a few areas in life that required attention - absurdly simple areas, such as basics for caring for one and one's home and possessions. It astonishes how a dirty car, a non-existent filing system and a messy cloths closet can have such a negative affect on one's life. Thomas Leonard brings these apparently non-important basics to your attention and coaches in a friendly manner, gently instructing us to do something about it.<p>The text offers 28 strategies in 28 chapters, including numerous tests that help you to reflect on your current state or condition, and simple step-by-step guidelines to change your current condition for the better. The key notion in his strategy is to make oneself more attractive by living a fulfilling life. Rather than `strive' and `hard sell' your way to success, his method is more along the lines of taking the path of least resistance - that by being aware and sensitive to oneself and one's environment, you create an attitude of mind where living and success becomes almost effortless. His method more or less has a Zen quality to it - surrendering to the Tao and moving through life in a natural way. In other words, by attaining clarity of mind, one is more in a position to recognize opportunities when they present themselves, and because we have become more ourselves and in-flow with our environment, good things will happen. Put in other terms; remove the physical and emotional clutter in your life, thereby creating the space for success to occur.<p>It is impossible for a single self-help book to be the answer for everybody. Though Leonard has an approachable method covering general areas that most of us experience and have trouble with from time to time. If anything, it could well bring your attention to areas that you thought were under control and moving smoothly and are not. This book is worth having a look at...</span>
