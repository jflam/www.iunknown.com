                    <span>If you want to see how different lighting arrangements can effect a picture then this book should be part of your phtotgraphy library. I just wish there were(approximate) distance measurements given between the subject ,background and lights.</span>

                    <span>I love this book! I am a self taught photographer with over 20 years of experience. Almost everything I know about photography has come from reading books or trial and error. Most of the books I have read stated that they contained "everything I needed to know" or they were "packed with information" etc. etc. blah, blah, blah! Usually thay were OK for beginners containing only basic information and lacked real substance. Well this book is the real deal! Great photography and loads of lighting techniques from very simple to complex. Most of the photographs occupy a page all by themselves with little or no distracting text. An explaination of the complete lighting set up with a detailed diagram is on the adjoining page. The quality of the printing is great, allowing you to reap the full benefits of what a book on photography should be. This book is a wealth of information for photographers who want to take their lighting skills to a higher level.</span>

                    <span>As the latest from the Rotovision series, this IS an excellent book, BUT it is a compliation from the very popular Pro-Lighting series (which I already own). If you haven't purchased any of the books in this series, I would not hesitate to get this one! If you already have Portraits, Fashion, Glamour or New Glamour, you already have what this is made up of.</span>

                    <span>This book is like a catalog of photos; real high quality fashion/glamour/style photos with illustrations of how they were made. There are not a lot of text there. Maybe you still need another book that deals with technique, basic and advanced. It will be great in conjuntion with this book.</span>
