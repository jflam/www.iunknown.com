                    <span>The only thing that disapoint's me is that most people even watching it a lot of times didn't quite get the storyline.  My first advice to you is to learn spanish.  I'm from Puerto Rico and I can talk and write enligsh.  Why can't you learn spanish? It would be easier for you to understand what this movie and other great movies like Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN.  But I praise that more people are interested in movies that are from LATIN AMERICA AND SPAIN.  I will like to explain the movie.  Lucia doesn't go to the island to look for her boyfriend.  She thinks his dead, she went there to find the truth about what happend to him there.  There she starts to remember everything that happend between them, and starts to put things together when she sees that he was involucrated with Elena.  The story he was writing was his real story about his search for his daughter and his mistakes.  The only thing that was fictional was Belen and her mom's suicide.  He killed them in his novel for his peace of mind.  Something else...for those that taght the movie was too porn at first, well I didnt saw a pornographic movie...I taught it has a great plot, with twists and great acting, plus the writer has a beautiful and artistic mind.  For those of you who gave this movie one star...then you didnt understad what the movie is about.</span>

                    <span>As the reviews here state, this is a convoluted movie requiring either close attention or a second viewing...neither of which is worth the time and effort. l haven't the slightest idea why some viewers go ga-ga over the sex scenes; they're better done in many a skin-flick. Maybe it's the foreign atmosphere, who knows.
<br />Anyway, the plot rambles, the characters amble, and very little is accomplished. And anyone who mentions a parallel to the brilliant Quentin Tarantino should take primer courses on cinema and directorial skills.
<br />This movie is an overrated farce...and whatever else sounds like 'farce'.</span>

                    <span>"It's a story filled with advantages. The first advantage is the end of the story. It doesn't finish. It falls in a hole, and the story starts again halfway. The other advantage, and the biggest ... is that you can change course along the way. If you let me. If you give me time."<p>First viewing ... mostly watched and "kind-of" read the dialogue; found it a stunningly attractive film with good acting and confusing plot.<p>Second I sat down and went though some of the extras that were so caringly included on the DVD; and decided to really sit through it and try to keep on the dialogue.  You can tell the makers of the film believed this one on terrific script.<p>Third, sat up until 2am reading and watching it.  Wow, I was moved by the detail and caring that went into the script.  The expressions on the faces: when Lucia runs home fearing something bad has happened to her boyfriend, the expression of the Nanny when she opened the door, and Lorenzo running down the street, and of course the last 20 minutes with the swaying camera (which was increase by having the actors walk on a board on-top of a roller to keep them off balance when they walked).<p>The Moon=Daughter, Sun=Lorenzo, Mermaid=Mother.  The TV picture in early bar scene foreshadowning as does Lucia's review of his second novel and its "optimisic" ending she felt took away from the impact. The lighthouse and moon images.<p>It takes some concentration, but you will find it so moving.  This movie is packed with so much content, you get more out of it with each viewing.  Highly recommended for the thinkers out there.</span>

                    <span>The title of "Sex and Lucia" is misleading: if one expects to see a soft-porn film, with a lot of moaning but little depth, you'll be disappointed. Instead, the film is really about the creative process. It's a film that seems at times to take place in the author's head, and it's unclear which storylines are "real life" and which ones are part of the story.
<br />Briefly, an author, Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa) fathered a child with a woman 6 years ago. Meanwhile, he meets the incredibly sexy Lucia (Paz Vega) and they begin a torrid affair. Lorenzo's also working on his novel. But the affair seems to cause a bad case of writer's block, and the relationship thus suffers. Meanwhile, Lorenzo is on a bizarre search for the daughter he fathered. One night Lorenzo disappears, and Lucia goes to find him on an idyllic island he once talked about. This is where the movie "begins."
<br />Medem's movie is meant to be circular and confusing I think -- are any of the relationships of the movie real? What "subplots" are really subplots of Lorenzo's novel? This ambiguity allows the director to indulge in rather whimsical, even surreal cinematography. The island, for instance, doesn;t look like a real island -- it very literally looks like an island in one's dreams. The almost unbelievably sexy Lucia at times also looks like a figment of Lorenzo's imagination. In one scene, we see her reflection on Lorenzo's computer monitor, suggesting that she's just a character of his novel. 
<br />Because there are so many ambiguities, this movie is a lot of fun to watch repeatedly, because each time what's 'real' and what's 'novel' changes. 
<br />*******************SPOILER'S AHEAD.*********************
<br />I *personally* think that Lorenzo's "long-lost child" plot is his novel, which is semi-autobiographical. Thus his rejection of Lucia is his inability to let go of his past. At the end, Lorenzo realizes that his new life is with Lucia, so he "lets go" of his past, and also finds the "ending" of his novel. That's how I saw it, and I think the final shot where Lucia looks slightly pregnant, supports this. But I have friends who disagree and think that *Lucia* is the novel character. So who knows? That's part of the fun of this entertaining, thoughtful movie.</span>
