Parts of the book are Linux-specific, but most of it applies to a UNIX system, including multiple variants of UNIX. Author Kirk Bauer briefly overviews tools and technologies&#151;and assumes preliminary knowledge about editing a configuration file or mounting a file system. <p>  The techniques, methods, and tools in this book will help you manage a single system&#151;but will prove especially powerful across multiple systems. No matter if the systems are desktops, servers, or Beowulf clusters&#151;all of them will benefit from this automation. And managing five to five thousand systems will become a simpler task!</span>

                    <span>I see that most of the reviewers didn't like this as much as I did.    That may be because they are home users or have small networks - I think this is very useful for the admins of larger systems (though it may not be useful for VERY large systems).  
<br />
<br />Or it may be that the subject matter is too dry. Sure, this can be a boring subject, but isn't that the point?  System administration is often boring, and particularly so if you haven't automated it.  Making global changes isn't exciting, but it is something some of us have to do now and then.
<br />
<br />I'm surprised that it averages two stars - I think it is better than that.  When I first get a technical book, I flip to a few random pages - I'm looking to see if I find things I didn't already know and if things are well explained.  I found a LOT of things I was not previously aware of and I thought the coverage was thorough.
<br />
<br />I agree that it has a strong Linux slant, but I don't see that as a problem - most of what this book suggests could be translated to any system.</span>

                    <span>If you do *ANY* Unix/Linux system administration (from just maintaining your own desktop machine on up to the big-time), and automating some (or most) aspects of UNIX/Linux system administration sounds at all interesting to you, then stop wasting your time reading this review, and *IMMEDIATELY* go purchase this book!  Really!
<br />
<br />OK.  If you are still reading, then either you don't do *any* UNIX/Linux system administration (in which case: Why *are* you reading this?), or you aren't quite sold.  Let me tell you: This book is among a truly rare breed---just bursting with quality and value!  (This book is an absolute *steal*; its a bargain at twice the price!)  I'm a bit of a Linux and Perl book nut; I have so many O'Reilly books on my bookshelf that I have a better selection than my local Borders!  AULA's publisher is a new one for me, but I think that they got an author---and a book---that O'Reilly would *kill* for!
<br />
<br />First of all, in the interest of full disclosure: I'm not a professional Sys-Ad, but I do administer my own small network of Linux machines that I use in my technical business.  Oh, and I'd never heard of Kirk Bauer before reading this book (although I did know about a quality piece of open-source software called LogWatch---I just didn't know that Kirk Bauer was its author too).
<br />
<br />Automating UNIX and Linux Administration (AULA) is a genuinely *outstanding* UNIX/Linux system-administration book!  I have read, re-read, and re-re-read *most* of the book!  AULA is truly worth its weight in platinum!  It is a rare and wonderful thing to start reading a computer/technical book and realize that it is of monumental significance, something that you *know* will be of enormous value!  A "_this_changes_everything_" moment!  In my personal programming library, AULA occupies prime real estate---and I would say that it shares the "WOW" factor with only a few of my other favorites:
<br />
<br />   Linux Administration Handbook
<br />   Evi Nemeth, et al., 2002, Prentice Hall PTR
<br />
<br />   Linux Server Hacks
<br />   Rob Flickenger, 2003, O'Reilly
<br />
<br />   Linux Shell Scripting with Bash
<br />   Ken O. Burtch, 2004 Sams Publishing (Developers Library)
<br />
<br />And of value to Perl hackers:
<br />
<br />   Perl for System Administration
<br />   David N. Blank-Edelman, 2000, O'Reilly
<br />
<br />   Perl Cookbook
<br />   Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington, 2000, O'Reilly
<br />
<br />If Kirk Bauer ever publishes any other materials on Linux administration, I'll buy them on the basis of the title (and his name) alone---I have no need for any more information!  This is clearly a guy who *knows* what valuable information is, and has the technical savvy to save you years (decades?) of trial-and-error experience.  AULA is packed with unique insight and a source of information that cannot be found anywhere else!  Do yourself a *big* favor---buy this book now!</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for everyone that want to go a little bit deeper in the Linux Adminstration. In Linux distributions we often find differents solutions to address the same problem. The book can save hours deciding between using solution A or B.

This book certainly will save you a lot of time and will give you the bases to go deeper in the topics that are more important to you.<p>If the above if not your case, I think the book is still a worth too. I will help to understand the pitfalls in Linux administrations a bit deeper.<p>At least, but no less important, I found the book easy to read.</span>

                    <span>If what you want is a bok that's a cross platform as the title suggests, this might not be a book worth buying.  Examples in this book make horrible assumptions, along the lines of removing all native commands and replacing them with GNU commands.  In a Linux only environment, this may not be a problem.  In many other environments where enterprise level support isn't a concern, this may also be acceptable.  But the place where automation is needed the most is the larget enterprise production environments.  While ideas and basic tennets outlined in this book are what you ultimately need, the scope of the examples have problems scaling beyond 20-100 systems, let alone 5,000+.  As for the basic tennets, you can cheat and be reminded what they are: common configurations, keep good documentation as to the differences, and manage systems, in a secure manner, in a common fashion that relies on the common configuration and documented differences.<p>The errors and ommissions in this book should be easily caught by any technical senior administrator of the OSes in question.  For me, that's Solaris and Linux.  <p>For a Linux only environment, it is a solid book.  The writing style is drier than most of the manuals I read from various Unix/Linux vendors, and truly is the first tech publication since I supported PBX systems to put me to sleep.<p>As for the "subjective" analysis of various tools to assist in automation, I was highly disappointed.  On various occasions, only 2 or 3 tools were discussed in an attempt to make the assesments fair.  In each case, I came up with twice as many tools that I use on a regular basis, that were also F/OSS (as was usually the criteria the author used to talk about a product) that perform similar, if not identical, tasks much better.  And those tools aren't that new: most predate the tools he refers to.  Plus, most Linux distributions come with them installed and configured by default!<p>Since all I got out of the book were the above tennets that I already have known for the past 10+ years, I was VERY disappointed.  Just make sure you know who you're letting borrow your copy, and what is expected that they'll take away, otherwise you'll end up with junior admins scripting their way into destroying your enterprise.</span>
