                    <span>My wife and I have just signed a contract to display our photography in a new gallery in Taos, New Mexico, that specializes in photography. I have been reading, Mastering Digital Photography, Second Edition, for a few weeks now, and have learned a great deal about printing. In some cases, it has reinforced what we were doing, and in others, the information has changed the way we do business with our printing. The net result is that this book has given us some of the knowledge we needed to present our work in a truly professional way, and has probably contributed to the success of our bid for our place in this gallery.

                    <span>I've scanned through most of the past Amazon reviews of this book and I find it surprising at how different my opinion is. I have in fact read the whole book cover to cover and I own a $1000 digital camera and a $200 inkjet printer and I have as a hobbyist done a tremedous amount of printing using this type of middle class printing. So I thought a book on the subject would help fill in some holes in my knowledge. In a nutshell my problem with this book is that it is without a doubt not meant for someone like me using this "middle class" tools. I found the book incredibly elitist, the only thing I really learned was I must buy more & better equipment to be a real artist - what I have isn't good enough apparently. For example apparently you need at least 8 megapixels to print an 8x10? My other main issue is that after having read the entire book, when I go to print an image nothing has changed at all - I still do everything exactly the same simply because none of the information in the book applied to me unless I buy thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands dollars worth of additional gear - and in general there was no info on how to use this gear specifically either - just you should have it. I've read an enormous amount of technical books over the years and on average most are great in that they strive to empower the reader with the skills and knowledge to achieve better things - but this book seems to achieve the reverse - unempowering the reader with lists and graphs and photos of things you can't ever possibly obtain. It's quite unique. 
<br />
<br />So honestly if you're a regular human being who has a camera and printer then this book is really not intended for you. The book's title and back cover do indicate otherwise, there's a photo of a consumer digital camera and nice write up that sounds like it'll apply to you in the same way a fortune cookie is vague. The experience level is also listed at beginner to expert in an attempt to net as many potential buyers as possible. 
<br />
<br />Who would this book be good for? Perhaps if you are working or beginning to work in a professional print shop that has many professional fine artist clients - this would be a good buy. Or if you're rich and can buy anything you feel like, this would serve as a good catalog.  The other advantage if you're rich is you get to be a "real" artist. There were a few parts I did like, one section of 5 pages had a really good overview of the steps to take in color managing your system - if you have the gear of couse, but nonetheless it was useful to know. Unfortunately many chapters just feel entirely useless, the author seems obessed with print permanence which is how long prints will last, he goes on and on about it, always avoiding specifics and generalizing and stressing the importance of performing your own permanence tests and although it is useful on one level it could of been 4 pages not 35. At one point he suggests if you don't have time to perform your own tests you can contract out your permanence testing - does this sound like you? If so I recommend this book to you. </span>

                    <span>I have to be honest. I read only a few chapters and sknimmed around the the "first edition" of this book. There were a few chapters that were helpful, but too much information I personally did not find helpful. And books are too expensive and time consuming to only be "somwhat helpful". 
<br />I just purchased the second edition today. While in a bookstore I read 3 chapters and briefly looked at all the other chapters and found a big improvement.  
<br />One of the biggest's complaints I noticed in the reviews here at Amazon, was that the first edition focused nearly exclusively on Epson printers. 
<br />Yes, they still discuss Epson, but much more is discussed about HP, Canon, Lexmark and Dell printers. There is also more info on supplies, software, scanning, displaying prints, etc..etc..
<br />I'll write another review when I read several more chapters.
<br />But, right now, I think this "second edition" deserves 5 stars.
<br />
<br />One other thing I wanted to mention. When I typed in the ISBN: for the second edition, they are the same reviews given for the first edition. I don't think Amazon has had a chance to wipe the slate clean here. 
<br />P.S. I don't see spellcheck. Sorry for any errors.

<br />There are a lot of books on digital cameras and how to take digital pictures. There are also a lot on processing these images to create the special effects that you might want. But up until now I have not seen any that talk about converting these beautiful images into something so mundane as a picture you can put into an envelope and send home, or hang on the wall. 
<br />
<br />Of course everyone starts out with an inexpensive ink jet printer, the kind you get at WalMart or where ever for only a few tens of dollars. The next step is to realize that the ordinary typing paper you've been using is not the best, so you go get some that promises photo quality. 
<br />
<br />If the result you're getting with this approach is satisfactory for your needs, you need go no further, and this book probably isn't for you. I say probably, because there are hints here on paper, ink and techniques that will help you get the most out of any printer. 
<br />
<br />But if you want to go further, up to advanced amateur standing or beyond, then I'd consider this book a necessity. It covers everything. From printer technologies, to specific brands, to inks, to papers. 
<br />
<br />At this level, you're not talking about $29.95 printers, and just getting the right printer is worth far more than the cost of this book. It clearly represents the state of the art in photo printing today.</span>

                    <span>The second edition of Mastering Digital Printing is a major updating and rewrite with important new material and photographs. Harald Johnson provides artists with a wide array of in-depth and up-to-date information they need to make considered choices in the process of mastering inkjet printing. For both the beginner and advanced printer there is no better source.
