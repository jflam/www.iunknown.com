                    <span>If you're in the mood of "beautiful cinematography"c<P>Cutting-edge cinematography successfully capturing astonishing clips of nature - as with many other IMAX films - but only a small fraction presented in this piece of work. The story of Magellan's search for the passage to the Pacific captures a long shot of mega-icy-glaciers of the North and the teeny row boat of Magellan's team (understandably, the package cover) which is purely my favorite scene. "WOOOW!!" guaranteed on a mega-sized plasma display, but a "wooOOOOOWWWW!!!" guaranteed on a 100inch+ LCD projector. <P>If you're in the mood of "beautiful cinematography + dynamic sound"c<P>I wouldn't expect much on the sound quality. My BOSE system has seen much better production (e.g. IMAX "The Living Sea"). The documentary structure of the film makes it hard to enjoy combining your own-taste of music (unlike "The Living Sea" which works amazingly with house/ drum 'n bass/ techno).<P>Bottom linec<BR>All-in-all for me, "the glaciers & the row boat" scene is the film's worth. The scene is precisely "Discovery" - human challenge to define nature and upon that, being thunderstruck.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this DVD as a teaching aid. It is worthless from a pedagogical point of view. It is nothing more than a pastiche of disconnected topics. It displays none of the intelligence nor logic of Boorstein's book. It's not even very entertaining-- a colossal waste of time, money, and film.</span>

                    <span>Not up to the normal standards of IMAX movies. The flow is a very disjointed and unconnected of random events. The audio is poor enough that even following what is there can be difficult. I normally love IMAX movies, but this one leaves a lto to be desired.</span>

                    <span>When I first got into DVD, I was pleasantly surprised that it seemed to be an excellent documentary. This is probably the most impressive IMAX I have ever seen before. A complete and enthralling.. I have this DVD and I'd highly recommend it. This is a DVD that anyone can enjoy, it is really educational, you can actually stay home and watch this DVD with your whole family.</span>
