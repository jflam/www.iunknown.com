                    <span>This book is extremely readable and matter-of-fact in its delivery of the three critical aspects of communication:
<br />
<br />1) The Speaking Game
<br />2) Organization, Writing and Presentation
<br />3) Delivery
<br />
<br />As someone who has been invited to speak at conferences and to deliver senior executive level briefs, I can attest to the usefulness of much of what was written. Further, the graphics and diagrams within the text add another demension to the book, enabling the reader to gain a more right-brain understanding of the author's points
<br />
<br />That said, I think that had the book contained some examples of real speeches in their entirety, it would transcend the realm of very good books, into that of truly superb ones.  
<br />
<br />Overall however, I would certainly recommend this piece for one's professional development library or as a gift to any professional motivated towards excellence.
<br />
<br />I would suggest reading this book in conjunction with a guidebook to Powerpoint Presentations if the reader is not well-experienced in creating presentation his/herself.
<br />
<br />In any case, I hope you are made a more effective corporate communicator because of these pointers!</span>

                    <span>I do not mean to be as glib as my title suggests, but I am truly disturbed by this book. It effectively explains how to spin a product and recognizes that the spinner is as important as that which is spun (I.E. you aren't just selling the product, you're selling yourself). The book offers several strategies for focusing a pitch/speech, and some ways to turn the shortcomings of a 'product' into a positive. So why be bothered? It's missing the chapter that focuses on honesty and truth. Whoever continually packages re-packages the Iraq War read this book. 
<br />Read it to win. Read something else if you also want some ethics.</span>

                    <span>Book Review: Granville N. Toogood's, The Articulate Executive<p>Jack Llewelyn, who was the CEO of Ocean Spray Cranberries, described Granville N. Toogood's The Articulate Executive (1995), as a "... required reading for every board room, class room, and living room in the country."  When reading Toogood's book reviews, I was astonished that a book about public speaking could be so highly touted.  Haven taken public speaking courses before, I wondered if  The Articulate Executive could possibly "cure" my fear of public speaking.  After reading the book's introduction, I realized that I was not the only one who fears a public audience.  Not only developing college students, like myself, but also well established CEO's, corporate managers, and important individuals from all walks of life share in the popular fear of speaking in public.  "Polls tell us that public speaking for some people can actually be scarier than death" (Toogood, p. 7).  Therefore, I wonder, can a book help reduce an individual's fear of public speaking and aid in his or her quest to become a better public speaker?  In this book Granville Toogood helps the reader become a more effective communicator and overall the book educates the reader about the steps each individual should take to present a good presentation.<br>In today's business world, public speaking can be a key to success.  The author describes how most people would prefer having a root canal rather than speaking in public.  Toogood says, "that people who view public speaking as a bad thing...are amazed to find that public speaking can actually be fun-and well worth the time and effort" (Toogood p. 3).  The author describes how public speaking is to be viewed as an opportunity rather than an unpleasant and tedious job that has to be done.  Furthermore, Toogood emphases in the first chapter of The Articulate Executive that an advantage in any business relationship will usually go to the "articulate, well-organized, and thoughtful" business player (p. 7).  Consequently, "seizing opportunities" is the first concept that Toogood presents as a potential key to business success.<br>The author also talks about controlling the presentation.  Toogood states "The presentation should always be an opportunity rather than an obstacle or chore.  When you are in command of your presentation, you come across as a leader" (Toogood, p. 167). The author introduces the reader to the POWER formula.   Which is essential to follow; this formula ensures that the speaker has the groundwork of a good presentation.  The presenter should also give the speech the way he or she speaks, making the presentation conversational and easy to follow for the audience.  The author also introduces us to the "18-minute Wall", i.e., the audience will only be able to pay attention for 18 minutes. It is also important to remember the "18-minute Wall" when organizing the presentation to meet the timing requirements.  There is also the "8-second rule", this rule will help the speaker come up with the theme of the presentation.  This rule will also help the presenter remove any unnecessary clichés and come across as being straightforward. After the presenter has the making for a great presentation, it is essential to make good use of body language and to dress appropriate for the occasion.  Finally, the correct use of visual aids is essential for any presentation, and they should not dominate the presentation.  In my opinion, Toogood has given me the correct set of guidelines to follow, and his advice will help his readers to come across as leaders and become better public speakers.</span>

                    <span>Granville Toogood's "The Articulate Executive" is a quite excellent introduction to public speaking in a variety of forms. Toogood is an accomplished communications consultant and has distilled his advice into a very readable book that will help almost anyone improve not just their communication style, but also their impact.<p>Toogood covers all the bases, from basic public speaking, to presentation, to handling the media. His POWER formula offers a simplified approach to effective speaking that's approachable by all of us. He offers real-world advice - such as time your speeches to be no longer than 18 minutes - that is often missing from other books.<p>Most importantly, his book is easily readable. It features short chapters with a lot of punch. And although some chapters build on contents of previous ones, it's easy to read the book a chapter at a time, or even find just the chapter the deals with the topic you need.  While written for the beginning communicator, most non-professional speakers will find a lot of value in this work. It was an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>The key to success, I believe lies in effective personal communication.<p>In a world that increasingly relies on technology to respond to other human beings, a personal response results in results - deals are made; red tape is cut; decisions are made.  Yet we live in a world where the ability to communicate personally with each other seems to be on the decline.<p>Granville Toogood has written one of the best books on the subject I have ever read.  The Articulate Executive should be required reading for every business student, project manager, teacher and politician.  By taking the time to adhere to his simple P. O. W. E. R. formula, leaders would see their effectiveness soar.<p>P. Power - Start Strong.<br>O. One Theme.<br>W. Windows to illustrate your theme.<br>E. Ear - Your presentation should be conversational.<br>R. Retention - End your presentation with a call to action.<p>If you plan to be successful, then public speaking is something you cannot avoid.  If you plan to speak, do your audience a favor and spend some time with this book.  Your career and your audience will be grateful.</span>
