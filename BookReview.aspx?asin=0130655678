                    <span>I would definately recommend this book to someone new to XML Schemas. It is not particularly wordy, but I feel that is a good thing - it is clear and to the point, with many simple examples. It should serve you both as a good overview and a reference that will be handy when you need to get to some particular concept quickly. I was pleased to see it has a chapter on Naming Considerations - something that has sparked much debate where I work. As noted by others, this material all can be found in one form or another on the web, but I went that route at first and found it a bit frustrating. It was much more efficient to sit down with a well written book like Definitive XML Schema.</span>

                    <span>As a professional application developer I don't have the luxury of time to read through massive "door-stops" to get up and running with a new topic. I'm sure many other programmers out there share the same constraint. I normally will not give a computer reference book, or any book for that matter, a chance if it isn't clear, concise and well organized. In short, if it cannot explain a concept clearly in the first few pages or if I find myself reading a chapter over and over again, it isn't worth the little time I do have.<p>After reading the positive reviews on Amazon I decided to take a chance and purchase it. Even after I received the book I approached it with the same air of skepticism as any other book I pick up and I must say that I was "hooked" the moment I started to read it. I found Priscilla's writing style to be effortless and fluid, clearly explaining the topic with plenty of examples to illustrate each concept. The topics are presented in logical order, but the book is approachable from any starting point within it. A fantastic read and an invaluable reference for anyone seriously involved with XML Schema. I place this book within quick reach in my library.<p>When learning to apply a new technology such as XML Schema, XSLT, XPath, etc, I will sometimes approach it with a misconception of overcomplication, thinking that the topic will be so difficult to understand that it will take months to grasp. Picking the right book can make all the difference. Some books only aim to exhaustively detail the mechanics and spew theories without any consideration for the practical application of the technology. And that type of book may be for some, but when you're under the constraint of time, there is little use for theory for the rest of us who need to have a product done by yesterday! This book is immediately practical and approachable from page 1! XML Schema is very easy to understand when it is explained by a professional who can effectively communicate. If you want this in a book, then Priscilla Walmsley is the person that delivers. If you are looking for the best guide to XML Schema on the planet, your journey has come to and end; look no further.<p>"Definitive XML Schema" is excellent and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to learn more about this technology!!</span>

                    <span>XML Schema was something that I had a vague understanding about, but figured I had to learn soon. When I started to read this book it took me only a couple of days to understand what XML Schemas are all about. There is nothing that I hate more than wasteing a lot of time reading a book and afterwards thinking: What did I just read? This book is worth every minute spent reading it!<br>So stop reading these reviews and go get the book!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book primarily because of reader reviews. I would like to personally thank each reviewer who used words like "superb" or "excellent", but this will have to do. I struggled with the baffling, cryptic XML Schema spec for years and would not have supposed this subject could be discussed with such clarity. I give it the highest compliment I can pay a technical book: it seems so simple.</span>
