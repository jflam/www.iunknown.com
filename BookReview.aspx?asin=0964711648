                    <span>This book should be on every computer professionals bookshelf. 
<br />
<br />Though geared for the american labour market, most of the content is applicable to professionals in any country. 
<br />
<br />The topics dealt with involve every possible facet of a career in IT: breaking into the field, the importance of a first job (IT apprencticeship), looking for work (how to write resumes, handle interviews), the merits of contracting, going into IT management, job hopping, etc.
<br />
<br />Great reference book for anyone in the field, or considering working in IT.

                    <span>I read this book when I first started work in IT, and then again after a few years of working.  I got more from it in the second reading.  Writing from a consultant's perspective, the author is somewhat cynical about the corporate world.  As I have grown cynical over the past few years myself, I can truly appreciate her sense of humor.  I especially liked the metaphor about the bathtub.  Some of the data are probably slightly out of date, but the book is still good for a laugh.</span>

                    <span>The main thing that is different about this book is it talks about things about computer jobs that you normally don't see in print that often.<p>One main idea is your long term computer job longevity can  greatly be impacted on what you do in your first computer job.  If you are 1 of 100 people programming and you only get to see a small part of a project, your skills don't increase that much. If you are 1 of 100 people but split in 10 projects and you work on a project from start to finish, you will learn a lot of new skills in a short period of time that are useful to other  companies.<p>You need to constantly increase your skills that are in demand outside of your company because you may be in trouble if you are fired or laid off.<p>Another idea in the same vein is start off as a maintenance programmer instead of as a developer. You may learn more of  the system and also add many new skills compared to a developer that only sees a small part of a project.<p>The main thrust of this book plus her other books is you need to take control of your career. I worked 15 years at 1 company without much of a career plan and I had a hard time finding a job when I got laid off. If I had these books 5 years or 10 years or even 15 years into my career, I would have known what to do to stay in a technical career. The 5 years that I have been contract programming along with Janet's books, I now realize how I want to continue the rest of my career. Janet's books explains why and how I will achieve these goals.</span>

                    <span>I enjoy mentoring people who are interested in moving into the high tech world but don't know where to start. I used to spend hours explaining how the IT world is divided up, what different technology choices there are and how they relate to jobs and training alternatives. Now I suggest people exploring information technology careers read Janet Ruhl's book; she's much better than I at explaining how everything works. I like this book so much, I've bought it as a gift for three prospective computer professionals.<p>But the Computer Job Survival Guide is equally good for those of us who are already computing professionals but want to continue to move on and up. Janet reviews some common-sense job skills, such as salary negotiation, but also hits on new hot topics, like stock options, working for start-ups, and when, how and whether or not to move from technical work into management.</span>
