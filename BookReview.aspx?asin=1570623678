                    <span>While the book is organized for the most part chronologically, I have enlisted three major themes<BR>-Matthiesen's personal spiritual quest<BR>-Matthiesen's first-hand experience of formal Zen teachings <BR>-A brief historical biography of past Zen masters<P>Matthiensen's long road to being a Buddhist monk takes him through many trials and tribulations and sometimes mixed with a sense of relief and surprise. In summary, it delves into the greater purpose of spiritualism for humanity: the particularity of the quest, coupled with universality of the discipline, notwithstanding the appreciation of the ordinary. <P>In the beginning days of his interest in Zen culture, Matthiesen sought to question the western ways of knowing i.e. knowledge as an accumulation of thought and analysis. Instead he was impressed with the Zen way of knowing (or rather 'not-knowing'). From these humble beginnings, Matthiesens's immersion into Zen culture did not occur fully until a personal tragedy (the death of his wife) made him see things differently. During these times Zen provided a vehicle for his personal spiritual journey. <P>At times Matthiesen aligns his personal quest with literal Zen teaching and in some parts of the chapter he alludes to a much broader connotation of spirituality -- that goes beyond personal search to include collective consciousness. During his days at the dragon river, Matthiensen gets to know first-hand experience of Zen studentship. Such experiences are not always pleasant. In the act of attaining concentration and bliss he seems to be constantly battling with selfish thoughts and the prejudices of the ego. <P>The last two or three chapters provide a brief historical biography of various Zen teachers starting from 12th century. The purpose is perhaps to enlighten the western reader about the roots and depth of Zen culture. Being a Buddhist monk, this could also be seen as a way to trace his own genealogy in the myriads of Buddhist teachers and a way to assure the perpetuality of Zen culture.</span>

                    <span>I believe this work by Matthiessen is simply the best written, most accessible and enlightening work on Zen Buddhism out there. For those who disagree, please post your own recommendation. It's a huge challenge (if not a Mission Impossible) to write a powerful, poetic and insightful autobiography on Zen Buddhism. We are very fortunate to have someone of Matthiessen's genius to introduce Zen to the Western world in a such powerful way. I am very grateful to the author for this treasure of a book.</span>

                    <span>Matthiessen's prose is clear and his story compelling. His Zen journals, from 1969 to 1982, tell the story of his Zen journey, without any of what the author might describe as, the breathless prose of the sincere seeker, but with great humility, depth, simplicity and beauty. Whether you like biograpy, travel books, or are interested in Zen or Buddhism, do yourself a favour and buy this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is core reading. It may even be the equivalent, for American Zen Buddhism, of Thomas Merton's SEVEN STORY MOUNTAIN - although there are no signs Matthiessen will later distance himself from his autobiography, as Merton did.<P>As a spiritual autobiography, it is magnificently compelling. It is some of Matthiessen's finest prose, and he writes with complete openness about the cruel death of his wife, Deborah Love (who became a Zen student while he looked on skeptically, only later trying zazen for himself), his own demons, and his practice without imposing on the reader. It is a fine model of autobiographical writing.<P>It is also a valuable document of the planting of the Zen seed in America. Matthiessen begins as a student of Eido Shimano Roshi in New York, and provides a truthful and valuable portrait of that sangha as they built the Dai Bosatsu monastery and established one of the major places of Zen training in the United States. Later, Matthiessen becomes a student of Bernard Glassman and the portrait of their friendship as well as the beginning of their student/teacher rapport is such a gift.<P>Finally, this provides maybe the best portrait in print of what it was to sit retreat with Soen Roshi, the Japanese roshi and renowned haiku artist who defies brief descriptions. (Other accounts do exist: to some extent in ENDLESS VOW, a collection of Soen's haiku; and in the New York Zen Studies Society's SOEN ROKU.) <P>This is highly suited for people already practicing, but Matthiessen provides plenty of background material on Zen Buddhism as well as his own introduction to the practice, such that any general reader can appreciate and enjoy this marvelous work.</span>

                    <span>I Strongly Agree with the previous review. The author (who is famous for his many non-fiction and fiction works which have nothing to do with the zen subject) later became a Dharma Heir himself. "Nine-Headed" is of special interest to those who may wonder what it's like to get close to the zen hierarchy, and all that goes with that. This book was an early hint that being a Roshi does not make one perfect, a lesson that many zen students later learned the hard way, to their cost.</span>
