                    <span>Now in an updated and expanded fifth edition with over 14,000 songs added (and featuring over 35,000 songs overall), The Green Book Of Songs By Subject is a comprehensive and very strongly recommended, "user friendly" reference for looking up popular songs by subject. Basic topics such as Freedom, Rivers, specific states and cities, etc. are listed in alphabetical order; each listing is followed by appropriate song entries arranged by title. An especially excellent book for tracking down the title, composer, or publisher of popular as well as obscure songs, The Green Book Of Songs By Subject is a core addition to the reference shelves of academic music history reference collections, and would prove invaluable in the personal reference libraries of professional musicians, DJ's or music-writers who can't afford to waste time struggling to remember (or needing to track down) who composed, performed, or produced a given tune.</span>

                    <span>How many times does the fragment of a song go through your mind, or a phrase and you cannot think where it comes from? And even more, how often during a day do you think of a song again and again and you cannot recapture where you heard it or who sang it on the record.This Book is the answer to any music lover who forgets the title or author of a favorite song. I have used it to plan theme parties, since it lists songs by subject. I cannot imagine how they did the work and keep it so up to date, but this is a reference book for the professional, and for any music lover who has a headfull of songs and needs a hand remembering "Where have I heard that song before"<BR>Don't even think about planning a wedding or a 50th anniversary or 21st brirthday with the Green Boook. It is a treasure!!...</span>

                    <span>I just received the latest edition (5th) and am blown away by how comprehensive this book is. As a marketing professional, I consider it a competitive advantage and a wise business investment. At times, it's downright entertaining. I would love to see a pocket or "bathroom reading" edition. In the meantime, I'll haul it's comprehensive girth around with me wherever I "go." ;?) LOVE it. HIGHLY recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I work as a Mobile Entertainment Professional. When I have a "theme" party to perform, I immediately turn to The Green Book. I look for the category that the theme is centered around and I am immeditely amazed at how many songs are listed. My clients are blown away by the theme music that I play all because of The Green Book!</span>
