                <span id="Label1">David Bank's <I>Breaking Windows</I> offers a scathing inside look at the past few tumultuous years at the Microsoft Corporation. Bank, who covers the company for <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, bases this well-written tale on interviews he has conducted with most major players (including Bill Gates), along with boxes of e-mails and other documents that "provided an unprecedented glimpse into strategic debates and internal decision-making processes of a company that had long restricted outside access to its insular corporate culture." Through them he shows how Microsoft, which always put software above everything--and in more recent years made Windows its number-one priority--has scrambled and squabbled as first the Internet and then the U.S. government forced major directional changes and significant internal reevaluations. <p>  Bank's story crackles with immediacy as he brings readers directly into the action with central characters like Gates, who "created a company that remained uniquely a projection of himself"; Steve Ballmer, the close friend of Gates and former sales-force leader elevated to CEO; Jim Allchin, a senior vice president who heads the Windows division and remains a staunch advocate for its dominance; and Brad Silverberg, another VP who launched Windows 3.1 and 95 before forming the Internet division and fervently trying to turn the company in its direction. Those who can't get enough on the behemoth from Redmond will find this an illuminating addition to their bookshelf. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>The most frustrating aspect of this book is that the first half, based largely on emails produced during the antitrust trial, is a riveting and fascinating look at the internal Microsoft battles, while the last half is a poor analysis of a "missed" opportunity.  <p>For the last half to be even readable you have to accept a few premises that simply were not supported by the text nor borne out by subsequent history.  As an example, Gates is portrayed almost as an incompetent fool, eased aside into near-irrelevance by his board and Balmer.  Further, the future of Microsoft's very existence is keyed upon abandoning (even giving away) Windows and starting from scratch, competing always on the last best effort with no clinging to any competitive advantage won so far, and that customers always value interoperability over utility, and so on.  <p>While many of these would be highly desirable for competitors, the book repeatedly claims but never sufficiently makes the case for the theory that for its own sake Microsoft should discard its durable competitive advantage at every turn.  I consider that to be an exceptional claim which demands exceptional proof, and which is never provided.</span>

                    <span>Despite what Microsoft says they have no real competition.  After reading this book I have to say, one choice is no choice at all.  If you don't like Microsoft products you can't find a wide variety of programs without going to a lot of trouble.  Microsoft would do better if they had competition nipping at their heels.  <p>I love the people who say that Microsoft will take care of all its bugs.  There are bugs because there is no formidable compitition! Microsoft can take it's sweet old time because there is no one out there to give people a real choice.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In the second half of the 90's Microsoft got caught in the now classical "Innovator's Dilemma", described by Clayton Christiansen in his book of the same name. The essence of it is that highly successful companies often become victims of their own legacy - not because of bad management or even obsolete technology, but because the inertia of their successful product improvements creates appearance that they are still on top of the game, better than any competition. But now these improvements do not matter any more, because new, emerging technological challengers do not strive to beat the entrenched leader on the same field, but instead compete with them on different criteria, which become more and more important to consumers while being cheaper and simpler than the established product, and eventually overcome the latter.<p>For the Microsoft the dilemma was the following: Windows was a gigantic cash cow for the company, its most profitable product, together with MSOffice firmly tied to the Windows platform. But the sudden explosion of the Internet, World Wide Web, and emerging Java technology by 1995 threatened to sweep away existing status quo, and totally reshape the landscape of computer industry, threatening Microsoft dominance in desktop computing. Should Microsoft stick defensively with Windows or should it reinvent itself around Internet and promising new technologies?<p>The author describes the intense internal debates and doubts within Microsoft campus about this very real and credible challenge of the Internet, that occurred in 1995-97. <p>Microsoft finally decided to stick with creaky old Windows. The author decries this course of events - arguing that the company squandered its chance for renewal. Yet, at least on the on the surface, it was a sound decision. Threat of the Internet largely passed, Microsoft is still dominant and profitable as never before. Was it right to stick with the old? Perhaps yes, from its monopoly position. It is (probably temporary) advantage to the Microsoft, but this ossification of  monopolistic power is inevitably a huge loss to the whole computer industry and even science.<p>Supporters of  Microsoft often claim it as an example of relentless innovation and technical brilliance. This is hardly credible in recent years. The rate of innovation in Microsoft products themselves was absolutely dismal in the last decade. Consider just one example. In the five years of intense competition from 1981 to 1986, before the Microsoft dominance, enormous strides were made in the user interface - one the most important aspect of personal computer technology. It evolved from primitive, barely legible screens of a dozen lines of greenish letters, where user had to precisely type some obscure, hard-to-remember commands, to the very usable system of windows and icons (first commercially implemented in Apple's Macintosh) which everybody could still recognize and use today. Compare this to the five-year period from 1995 to 2000. The operating system progressed from Windows 95 (not very innovative in itself) to ... (yawn) some barely distinguishable to an ordinary user messy bunch of obscure acronyms (Windows 98, 2000, ME, XP, whatever), united perhaps by a common feature that they are usually not worth many hours spend to install or upgrade them, until Microsoft policy on compatibility makes it absolutely necessary.<p>In fact every significant innovation in computers in recent years was in the areas outside the Microsoft monopoly power. Its domination most likely stifled progress not only inside the company, but almost everywhere in the computer industry. Contrary to widespread boosterism associated with go-go years of Internet boom, the decade of 90's was NOT a time of revolutionary developments in computer science. Research associated with new operation systems stagnated - a direct consequence of the Microsoft overwhelming dominance. No breakthrough comparable in importance, for example, to the Object-Oriented Programming in early 80's, occurred in software engineering. There was a lot of noisy activity but in fact only incremental progress in such areas as parallel computing, storage, databases. Computer graphics mainly followed developments invented earlier, in 70's and 80's (polygon graphics with increasingly sophisticated shadings, ray-tracing), only with vastly increasing hardware power.<p>Most of the compression algorithms (LZW, JPEG, MPEG, wavelets etc.) were also developed during previous two decades. So are all basic principles of modern cryptography and security. In this area the 90's were the years of commercialization and incremental, often glacial, improvements. In terms of new ideas this decade was not even remotely comparable to the fundamental revolutionary advances made in 70's. The only significant developments were in those areas outside of the Microsoft dominance - mostly in the Internet area (such as caching, distributed processing and storage), or the invention of the "virtual machine" used in Java technology.<p>Instead of being dynamic innovators, boldly leading computer industry towards the new horizons, thousands of Microsoft clever programmers long ago became an oppressive praetorian guard defending the palace of the current ruler. <p>Often cited as a sign of Microsoft technical prowess is the sheer volume of code contained in the Windows or Office programs (reaching some 30 million lines of code or more). This is preposterous. Millions of lines of code built in Windows are no more signs of innovativeness and vitality than ever increasing millions of tons of steel production were the evidence of economic strength of the later-era Soviet Union. True innovation is not proportional to the volume of code crammed into a package of software.<p>Christiansen's "Innovator Dilemma" and the ways to overcome it was conceptualized with application to companies which have comfortably leading position in their fields, but not all-encompassing monopolies, who can squash emerging competitors at the early stage. Microsoft is clearly (and legally) a monopoly - one of the most powerful in history. It is possible that one day it will be driven by pure market and business forces to reinvent itself and become again an innovative, entrepreneurial company. But for now, and in the immediate future, it continues to buck and stifle innovations in computing.</span>

                    <span>Bank's thesis that Gates somehow fumbled is not supported by the context: the company continues as an economic powerhouse.  As the richest man  in the world, with the finest people in the world working on your team, it is reasonable that a lot of great ideas will have to be constrained or stopped.   Raising thoroughbred horses is not a far cry from Gates's position leading some of the fiercest, the fastest, the most persuasive, and most aggressive people that have been produced by our society.   It seems that Banks spends a lot of time gathering facts and opinion from the fine people whose ideas get quashed, and colors his thesis with their emotion and frustration.  <p>Paradoxically, Banks literally presents Gates as a technology reactionary, when in fact he appears to be more willing than others in the company to spend money on long term initiatives.  Toward the end of the story, we learn that Gates is supplanted by fiscally conservative Ballmer.  From a business perspective, it's not likely Gates will go down in history as an enemy of innovation.<p>Much of the world runs Windows, and many people have staked their companies, lives, and careers on the technology.   It's not responsible to suggest that, over the timeframe of this book, the Windows desktop could have been displaced by an Oracle, linux or a 'network as computer.'  People and organizations can absorb change only so quickly.  Gates' unwillingness to undermine the Windows platform reflects social reality more than it does represent any kind of quashing of innovation:  the health and popularity of the technology is important to the customers who have chosen to make trillions of dollars of significant personal, professional and business investments in the technology.<p>Banks comes across as someone who has never had to explain a software bug to a panicky secretary who is worried about her job, or had to stay up all night fixing a server so a company could operate the next day.  Microsoft has made tremendous progress in these kinds of contexts.  Which explains something that Banks does not: why a company with a 'fumbled future' continues to command the attention of economic decision makers on every level of society.    Microsoft software provides tremendous utility.  Ordinairy folk can only absorb change at a limited rate.  A company that takes a conservative position with respect to the revolutions that seem to rock the industry every two years is going provides much greater social good than a company which would decry it's model (leaving the rest of us in the lurch) in the face of a new way of doing things.<p>I think that Banks' book does a disservice in that it leads the unwary into a unnecessarily negative position. While reading the book, I found myself questioning my decision to support Microsoft software professionally.  I had to remember that I did not choose Microsoft because I was 'locked in' to their platform.  Looking at a system like NT, or SQL Server, there is no question that the platform is unambiguously superior, and of great value when third party vendors can spread their costs over such a large customer base.  (Imagine buying a linux computer from Dell and then realizing after the first time you lose power that the operating system has no automated way of recovering the hard disk damage caused by a power failure!) Hooks or no hooks, Microsoft software is nice to use and easy on the end user.   Then I realized my emotional conflict: that I was simply responding to the ad hominem nature of many of Banks' statements, his depiction of Gates as an irate fool, and his deliberate de-emphasis of the big picture.   As a previous reviewer said, it would be nice if Banks stuck to the facts, and had listened to the input of Gate's ex team members with a more critical ear.</span>
