                    <span>I just wanted to humbly disagree with the review from "C. De Luz - cdeluz".
<br />
<br />If you are truly in search of God, then you have to go inside you. Once you find him inside, you will also experience him outside. There are a million scriptures in this world from all the different religions but if you look closely, all of them guide you inside. Whether Jesus said it or Krishna (the Hindu lord), it all leads you to the same. Please don't go by words what Jesus said, rather hear what he said "forgive them....". If you keep reading words from bible or any other scriptures for that matter, you might as well not read it.
<br />
<br />I urge you, not read it from an engineer's mind (which I also have) but read it from a spiritual heart. When Dr. Dyer speaks, I can feel him touching my soul and instantly puts me in meditaional bliss even with my eyes wide open and mind working.
<br />
<br />I hope that you can feel it too but the only way you can do this is by surrender. Don't go by the words he is using but hear the silence between the words and I am sure you will hear the devine music.</span>

                    <span>     After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.  
<br />     Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.  
<br />     Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts. 
<br />     Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point.

                    <span>At first glance you may think that Wayne Dyers advice is simplistic and without form. But don't underestimate the power of Wayne Dyer. Fundamental to this book are our core belief systems, prevailing attitudes and faith all of which can either lead us closer to our destiny or farther away. By incorporating many of Dyers principles one is able to transcend the chains that has kept many of us from reaching our destiny and instead allows us to find our idea of happiness, inner peace and balance.</span>

                    <span>This is a book to read and reread.  If you're looking to make some changes in your life Dr. Wayne Dyer outlines the nine principles for (not so much getting what you want) as living a more fully rewarding life.  It's more about getting into the flow of living rather than making any sort of material demands and having them promptly met.  'Manifest Your Destiny' is filled with numerous ideas and insights to expand your take on reality, enhance your everyday existence, feel a deeper connection to the world, and really change in a deeper and more substantial way than 99.9 percent of the self-help books on the shelf.  I found Dyer's explanations logical and easy to follow and felt an almost internal 'click' that what I was reading was right for me.  Few books strike me that way and this is one which I have periodically read to recenter myself when life starts to feel a bit too confusing and chaotic.  Reading this book is a wonderful way to regain focus and clarity.      </span>

                    <span>I bought my copy in Sept 1998. Recently, I took it out and have another go. I am really grateful to God for guiding me again to this wonderful masterpiece. It is a totally different experience from the first time. So I guess it must be that I am more ready to receive .. now than before. 
<br />My recommendation to readers is perhaps , read it with your heart; with no judgements and  no expectations. After all, Dr Dyer wrote this with his heart too! The effect as I have personally  experienced, is beyond measure. You would certainly be eternally  grateful . Good Luck, God Bless.
