                <span id="Label1">This book provides an entertaining, and practical tour-de-force for every trainer and performance improvement professional. It tackles the three universal and persistent questions of the profession-how do learners learn, why do learners learn, and how do you make sure that learning sticks.  <P>The authors of this interactive and provocative volume provide solid answers to these questions backed up by more than 70 years of combined real world experience and academic study. Training Ain't Telling deliberately avoids the one-way communications of "telling" trainers how to be more effective. Instead, it uses an interactive approach which models the basic message of the book-that is, humans learn best through active mental engagement. The authors expect the reader to "do" something, not just read! Despite its fun, and breezy tone, every concept in the book is solidly backed up by research. The ultimate goal of this book is to allow the reader an opportunity to break through learning barriers, to separate learning myth from research-based facts, and to dispel counter productive beliefs and practices that harm the instructional process.</span>

                    <span>This excellent book by Harold D. Stolovitch and Erica J. Keeps - researchers and consultants in workplace learning and performance - emphasizes making training fun and interactive. While their basic learning principles will be familiar to those in the field, they enliven their book with examples, exercises and research. The authors distinguish among training, instruction and education. They note the differences among various types of knowledge. Then, they explain the major factors that motivate people to learn and show how to apply these principles in hands-on teaching situations. Charts, illustrations, quizzes, and short chapter summaries enrich the book. We believe that even professionals already familiar with the field will enjoy this refreshing and lively look at how to help people learn. And if you are hiring trainers, this is what they should know.</span>

                    <span>It is rare to find a book written by an expert that isn't made for is fellows specialists. And most of the time, less specialized books misses the point by leaving behind huge chunks of knowledge.<P>We are here in front of two great authors and they know how to use synthesis. They have been able to put together the essence of their skills in words that makes it readable for every interested mind. The result is a complete book, with no missing part. It will become a reference to those who want to have the full picture. The newcomer and the addict will use it often.<P>M. Stolovitch and Mme Keeps use a "discussion" mode to cover theme like: adult learning, course creating techniques, training approaches and evaluation. They keep the interest of the reader with exercises, questions and tests. To read the book is to have a talk with them.<P>But the part that is to most satisfying is the one on training myth. At last a very good text on what works and why!! You should buy the book just for that chapter. I keep reading "Telling ain't training" just to feel that what I do is fine and that I am not alone fighting for a just cause.</span>

                    <span>Harold and Erica have created an excellent job aid for people in the training business. I have used the Five step model to help "retrofit" existing training we had developed and it was just what we needed to focus our efforts. The other topics in the book provide thought starters and useful models. It is easy to find and read topics of interest in this brief and appealing format.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book about training that uses training principles to deliver its message! <P>Stolovitch and Keeps little masterpiece "Telling Ain't Training", incorporates a variety of adult learning principles throughout the book like:<P> telling the learner the benefit of the training, <BR> taking into account the different experiences of the learners, <BR> making sure the learner is actively involved and particpating in the learning, and <BR> leading the learner to action. <P>The reader/learner is led systematically to an realization of why transmitting (telling) information doesn't work as well as transforming (including practice and feedback) the learner. The reader/learner's active involvement is ensured through constant examples, analogies and activities that are fun and always to the point.<P>As someone who both develops and delivers training programs, I found this book to be highly informative (it discusses the current research in learning and development), extremely well focussed and ultimately very useful. I have already incorporated at least 5 of the book's wonderful little nuggets into my training and development activities.<P>I highly recommend this book</span>
