                <span id="Label1">Written for the more knowledgeable Visual Basic programmer or hobbyist, <I>Windows Game Programming with Visual Basic and DirectX</I> presents the fundamentals of game design in Microsoft Windows from start to finish. Based on author Wayne Freeze's easy-to-approach framework and source code for an <I>underwater</I> virtual mall, this book introduces essential game programming concepts and the relevant DirectX APIs you need to get started with custom game development.<p>  Although this book relies on the older VB6 standard and makes no mention of Microsoft's new VB .NET, the text really focuses on the DirectX API, the foundation of graphics and gaming on the Windows platform. The author walks the reader through the steps required to design and code a game, from defining features to designing 2-D and 3-D artwork to implementing a computer simulation in code. There's good coverage of 3-D content design with the Caligari trueSpace design tool, which is used to design virtual scenes. Freeze's sample game for a virtual mall starts out simply with basic 3-D rendering and introduces features like user input, music, and sound in subsequent chapters.<p>  Besides giving a tour of essential DirectX APIs like Direct3D, DirectInput, and DirectSound, the author also provides background material on game design concepts like random numbers, simulations (used extensively in computing today), and <I>finite state machines</I>. The heart of this text shows off the design choices made in the author's own case study. By the end, his virtual mall is enhanced with moving customers, special "cheat codes," and even a popup newsletter that displays game state. Though certainly not the most action-oriented game you're likely to see, the virtual mall shows off the power of computer game simulations (like SimCity) to good effect and also provides an approachable example for getting you started on your own creations.<p>  Game programming is legendarily difficult and extremely challenging. This title fills a useful niche by providing an accessible and entertaining introduction to game development without getting bogged down in extensive math (or gnarly DirectX APIs). It's a worthwhile choice for getting started with games and graphics in Windows and VB. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to game design (including technical features, user interactions, cheat codes, and "Easter eggs"), DirectX services, 2-D and 3-D graphics quick-start tutorial (including rendering basic Direct3D scenes), graphical content design with Caligari trueSpace and Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator, texture mappings, saving and loading game state, 3-D rendering techniques, random-number-generation techniques, programming strategies for computer simulations (including multiple servers and queues), custom VB6 code for a simulation framework, case study for a virtual mall (including simulated stores, customers, and money), user input with DirectInput, adding game commands, background music and sound effects with DirectSound and DirectMusic, editing WAV files, game maps, finite state machines, saving and loading games, and adding features for more playability.</span>

                    <span>"Windows Game Programming with Visual Basic and DirectX" is one of the best sources for game programming with Visual Basic. It is rare to find a nice VB book these days, and this one covers everything to make a sim kinda game. you make a mall and try to run it, teaching you how to Program games on the way. This is a must have for any Game programmer that wants to use VB for thair game.</span>

                    <span>I just bought this book, and it is actually quite helpful. I have never written a game, but am fairly experienced in VB6. I wanted to explore DirectX programming, and this is a good start. As far as other reviews complaining about having to use Truespace, you can also use 3dStudio Max, get the file exporter from Microsoft and you can can create .x files with that. Should also work with Maya, and you can get that for free. I thought the code was well organized, and on my 1.2 ghz machine, I get excellant frame rates. I only wish there was more detail about Direct3d, but still, enough here to get started. I recommend this book if you are an intermediate level VB programmer, and need some ideas on how to program games, if you are new to VB, probably not the best book to get.</span>

                    <span>I expected a thorough explanation of DirectX when I bought this book. I want to know what CLIPPER is, why we have to use it...etc. There's so much cryptic terms to learn in DirectX - DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN, DDSCAPS_PRIMARYSURFACE, DDSCL_ALLOWMODEX, BltFast, Blt just to name a few. The book does explain how to set up DirectX so that we can use Direct3D etc, but it does a poor job on explaining them succinctly, instead it spends too much time on third-party graphics tools. The explanation on the 3D coordinate space, vertex, points etc is very short.<BR>The explanation on the logic of the game is very boring, to be objective, it doesn't help me much. Overall, I'm disappointed.</span>

                    <span>In the context of showing you how to make a simulation game, this book shows you how to load meshes from outside sources like 3dsmax. What's more it's done simply and clearly explained. It also shows how to make your game scriptable and is a very good example of how to make your code object orientated. Every thing talked about in the book while shown in the use of a simulation game would apply to any other type of game with a little creative thinking. This book is a must, the price seals the deal.<P>However, it's not without its faults. One thing to remember though is that you will need to refer to the cd, because the author cut the size of the book by only showing the relevant portions of the code to the topic in the book not the whole picture. However since the code makes use of a debug log you can't run the code from off a cd. You need to copy it to a space on your hard drive first and then open it in vb and run it. Lastly the modeling package featured in the book seems to be another me too product.</span>

                    <span>Wayne S. Freeze, Windows Game Programming with Visual Basic and DirectX (Que, 2002)<P>First and foremost, a warning. Freeze's book, despite its publication date, deals exclusively in Visual Basic 6. If you're using VB.NET, a lot of this stuff is going to cause you to wonder what on earth Freeze is on about. I strongly suggest reading Keith Sink's DirectX 8 and Visual Basic Development in conjunction with this, and asking a lot of questions on a lot of VB.NET tech support mailing lists. (Microsoft's documentation on how to go from VB6-VB.NET with DirectX is not nonexistent, but it is such that nonexistent would have been better.) Given that .NET had already been in prerelease for over a year by this book's publication, one would think that, at the very least, the publisher would have made it very plain somewhere on the cover that the book dealt in a technology that's not compatible with the next generation of the language. An unforgivable oversight, especially if you happen to spend the full retail price for a copy of this book.<P>That aside, Freeze's book is quite good in the way it introduces the reader to the new, and largely esoteric, combination of Visual Basic and DirectX (the latter technology was exclusively the realm of C++ programmers until 2001, when DX8 began to include VB wrappers). He's not afraid to use repetition to get his point across, and he does so in a laid-back atmosphere that's quite different from what one sees in most how-to programming manuals. <P>Freeze teaches the VB/DX intersection through the programming of a SimCity-style games called SwimMall, which is in and of itself at least worth a discounted copy of the book. Needless to say it's not a commercial-quality game, as one would expect from a single person programming such a thing while under the pressure of a book deadline. But the routines and ideas therein are just the thing to spark the imaginations of novice game programmers; no matter what genre a person is working in, there are certainly routines here that will help a programmer out in various ways. Much of this code is easily ported to any other type of game framework.<P>Very good stuff. Just remember the admonition in the first paragraph if you're working with .NET and haven't used VB before. (Actually, I recommend Sink in conjunction with this book anyway; the atmospheres of the two are a pleasant mesh, and when you can't find a niggling piece of information you need in one, the other is sure to have it.) *** ½</span>
