                <span id="Label1">The iPod is the world's bestselling music player. But if you think that it's just a music player, then you must think Clark Kent is just a newspaperman.   In this freshly updated edition, <i>New York Times</i> tech columnist J. D. Biersdorfer blows open the secret doors of this gleaming, chrome-and-white beauty. With humor and authority, she lays bare an astonishing collection of useful tips, tricks, and shortcuts like these:   <b>iPod as PalmPilot</b>. The iPod can suck in your calendar, address book, to-do list, and notes from a Mac or PC, and then display them at the touch of a button. It also doubles as an alarm clock and stopwatch.   <b>iPod as hard drive</b>. You can use your iPod to carry gigantic files from place to place.   <b>iPod as e-book</b>. The iPod makes an excellent book reader, capable of scrolling through recipes, driving directions, and even Web pages.   <b>iPod as GameBoy</b>. The iPod's games are perfect time-killers for waiting rooms, bus rides, and the Department of Motor Vehicles.   <i>iPod & iTunes: The Missing Manual</i>, 2nd Edition is much more than it seems, too. It not only covers all iPod models for both Mac and Windows, including the iPod Mini, it's also the ultimate guide to the iTunes software, MusicMatch Jukebox, and the new iTunes Music Store for both Mac and Windows.   No matter what kind of music moves you, <i>iPod & iTunes: The Missing Manual</i>, 2nd Edition will help you get much more out of your iPod--and much more into it. </span>

                    <span>Whether you are a newly initiated iPod user or a veteran iPodder, this comprehensive, clearly written, and entertaining addition to the successful "Missing Manual" series is a MUST have. It has basic information for people who want to get started, but also has great insightful info for people who want to get their iPod to be more than just an elegant digital Walkman with tips, hacks and some things even this iPod fanatic didn't know about! This book is the only iPod book I've seen that thoroughly covers Mac and Windows issues, the latest 2003 models (which have some fairly fun differences from their predecessors) and the new iTunes Music Store.<P>I bought my first 5GB iPod the moment they rolled off the line a couple years back and have since upgraded. After the initial excitement, it has become a part of my life I take for granted. It plays music. It works. What more do you need to know? I've spent some time looking at a lot of the excellent websites that have cropped up when I needed help (which the author has helpfully included in the book). I picked up this book and now I am really excited again about all the possibilities. I am also really glad to have so much information all in one place. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an iPod, as well as anyone planning to give an iPod as a gift.</span>

                    <span>The iPod is the best personal music player available. Its ease of use, and enormous storage capability, are possible because of the software written for the device, the iTunes utility, and to the fact that the iPod is basically a portable hard drive. This valuable 350 page how-to book will guide both new users and experienced hacks to utilize the capabilities of the iPod, as well as the iTunes utility, to the maximum.<BR>	This is not a supplemental manual. It is a stand-alone reference that will walk the reader through the basics of the iPod and iTunes. It will also, in simple language and clear graphics, explain how to utilize iPod as a PDA, a data storage unit, and even a recording device.<BR>	The author, very thoughtfully, provides not only thorough coverage of topic for Mac-only users, but also includes detailed guidance for Windows users as well as Mac OS 9 users. For Windows users, utilities that can be linked with the iPod are explained as clearly as Mac utilities. And as important as explaining what various capabilities are, describing the limitations to each utility are often just as detailed.<BR>	There are generous amounts of figures and other graphics for both Mac and Windows utilities. What I particularly liked about many of the the illustrations was that layered windows, and menus for several steps, were shown in a single figure. This makes it even easier for "visual" learners to master the instructions.<BR>	Perhaps the part of the book I was most pleased to find was in the appendix. For both iTunes and Music Match Jukebox Plus, every menu (dozens of them) are explained in detail. I think this is essential for novice users to have this kind of guidance, and I have not found it in other manuals and "how to" books.<BR>	Disappointments were few and minor. Though I suspect there are no substantial differences with using the iPod Mini, I would have liked to have this stated one way or the other. Also, I would like to have been instructed in how I could have set up a separate iTunes account on my Mac, so others who use my computer would find it easier to download only their music into their own iPod. Finally, marker tabs on the side of the book may make it easier to find chapters more quickly. These, though, pale in comparison to the benefits of buying this "must have" book.</span>

                    <span>"iPod & iTunes, 2nd Ed.: The Missing Manual" is an update to the 2003 book, "iPod, The Missing Manual". I described the earlier book in a prior review as "having everything you wanted to know" about the iPod, its software, and its accessories. It was everything a manual should be and more.<P>	Since then, the iPod has changed - it's now bigger and more capable, has newer and better software, and has been joined by the iPod mini. This new edition of "iPod and iTunes" is bigger, updated, and improved as well. It still is everything a manual should be and more. It has everything you could possibly want to know about the iPod universe, circa May 2004.<P>	For example, Apple bundles a set of earphones with the iPod which are described as noticeably better than most. The book reveals that the Apple speakers use neodymium transducer magnets, described by Apple as five times as powerful as conventional aluminum or cobalt used in cheaper units. That material is a rare earth metal, atomic #60. Not every resource would have that depth of description or explanation!<P>	In its sixteen chapters and 349 pages (including index), the book updates the original by describing the latest iPod hardware and available accessories. It details the features of the latest iPod, iTunes, and iSync software, both Mac and Windows versions. Regarding nearly all its topics, the book makes every attempt to cover both the Mac and PC variants, including the PC-specific Music Match Jukebox software included as an alternative to the PC version of iTunes.<P>	Even if you don't have an iPod yet, you still will have a great manual for the iTunes software which has more features than previously and includes the iTunes Store features.<P>	From learning how to maximize and/or benefit from the iPod and iTunes software, to knowing all the available accessories for the iPods, this book is as thorough and useful as you can get.</span>

                    <span>Title: iPod & iTunes, Second Edition<BR>Author: J. D. Biersdorfer<BR>Edited by David Pogue<BR>Publisher: Pogue Press/O'Reilly & Associates, February, 2004<BR>ISBN: 0-596-00658-6<P>Reviewed by: Curt Blanchard, Tucson Macintosh Users Group<P>The Missing Manual books from Pogue Press/O'Reilly have another publication in their outstanding series. iPod & iTunes (Second Edition) is a 350 page follow-up to the original iPod Missing Manual published in July, 2003. Once again, J. D. Biersdorfer takes the helm (David Pogue edits) and does a masterful job of handling the complexities of a couple of seemingly simple things. One of Apple's greatest strengths from the very beginning has been their ability to take a complex piece of software or hardware and make it nonchalantly intuitive while keeping a vigilant and attentive eye on ease-of-use. Both iTunes (software) and iPod (hardware) are fine examples of this. Both can be used without reading a single page of instruction. (Try THAT on a PC!) However, underneath their friendly, simple faces, lie things that is deceptively robust approaching near pro levels.<P>The iTunes application, part of the iLife suite, which was not covered in the first edition, and is now explored in detail - the latest and greatest version being iTunes 4.5. J. D. Biersdorfer treats it in her usual thorough way without making it heavy or gooey to read and absorb. (This is a real skill. Why are Mac writers able to do this better?) About a third of the book deals with iTunes, its formats, playlists and how to rip music so it will burn onto CDs or get sucked into the iPod properly.<P>The iPod takes up the rest of this comprehensive book. Who knew so much could be written about such a miniscule machine which is now smaller than a stack of business cards! Yes, the iPod Mini is covered as well. These marvels of miniaturization are not just sophisticated a Walkman, at their hearts are real hard disks that can make the iPod an ideal place to download images from your digital camera, can masquerade as a GameBoy, an Alarm Clock, an address book and calendar, a player of audio books or even an external, bootable hard drive. Yes, iPods record data just as well as music! The book will lead you through the ins and outs of playing and recording music, importing calendars and contacts, syncing with your desktop machine, connecting to home and car audio systems and lots more. There is even a wealth of iPod accessories and shareware apps.<P>To be fair, this book is dual-platform and devotes equal time to Mac and PC step-by-step instructions. Both are treated with respect and are given the time and space required to explain the differences. The Mac platform is the native one, of course. Both are Apple products<P>Last year, I wrote enthusiastically about the first edition, but now I heartily endorse this new Second Edition, iPod & iTunes. It covers so much more - mostly because so much more is now available - the iPod Mini, iTunes 4.5 and an ever-expanding list of exciting accessories. If you have an iPod, you really need this book, if you don't have one yet, read this book and you'll want one!<P>--Curt Blanchard - 5/28/04</span>

                    <span>This is an end-user manual primarily for the iPod, but also for iTunes. It covers both Mac and Windows. Part one covers the basics of the iPod. Part two, the heart of the book covers iTunes and it's interaction with the iPod. The writing is high quality, but there are a lot of screenshots, and some editing errors. For example, the figure 4-20 is missing entirely. The third, and last part, of the book, covers more uses for the iPod. Ideas include using the iPod as a calendar, an address book, as an external disk, and for games.<P>I recommend this book for anyone looking to get the most out of their iPod.</span>
