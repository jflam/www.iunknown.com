                    <span>Ethical influence has rarely been dealt with so carefully, credibly and intelligently. The blend of NLP with solid research from social psychology and the author's personal experience make this a fascinating read. My only concern about the Psychology of Persuasion is that this book seems to reveal too many sociological and interpersonal communication "secrets." One hopes that the book buyer will follow Hogan's admonition to make sure every communciation is really a Win/Win or No Deal. The book is top notch and should be owned by anyone in business, sales or marketing. I think the section on brainwashing could have been more extensive. It is already a great self defense tool against cults but expansion on key ideas would have made it even more invaluable. I thought the master persuader chapters were some of the most advanced material I've seen. The book was relatively easy to read and the exercises added to my understanding of the more complex strategies. The discussion about values alone was probably worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>I bought the Psychology of Persuasion because Kevin Hogan spoke at our annual conference last week. The book actually lives up to the presentation he gave. The body language material in The Psychology of Persuasion is complementary to Dr. Hogan's presentation and provides the reader with ideas and techniques I had never heard before.<P>I've been selling insurance for 13 years and I have never read a book that was so geared to the salesperson and yet just as easily can be applied in any setting.<P>The Psychology of Persuasion is well written, easy to understand and has plenty of reasons to be on the desk. (Power words, hypnotic language, body language, gathering intelligence, closing, and some really fascinating "mastery tools."<P>Highly recommended!!!</span>

                    <span>I saw Kevin Hogan speak last week. Excellent presenter. Dynamic and as knowledgable about persuasion as anyone I've ever listened to. I read his book this week and found it to match his character and integrity (and fun spirit) on stage. The book offers new insights for an investment counselor. Interestingly the content of his presentation didn't overlap the book in any way. That in itself was interesting. I think the book goes along side some of the names like Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, Brian Tracy and Jim Rohn. I know I'll be reading his stuff for a long time to come. <P>Pick up The Power of Persuasion and I believe you will close more sales and make more money. I'm making changes in my business already!</span>

                    <span>I picked this one of a shelve in a sumer-cabin I was staying at and could not put it away until I had finished it. I think everyone can benefit from the advice in it. Even though some of the advice is common sense it is still valuable and worth reading over and over. <P>I don't work as a salesperson but I think this book can help me with my career, that is if I can remember the advice given in it.</span>

                    <span>The title should be "The Techniques of Persuasive Selling - How to Persuade People to Buy What You Sell." "Psychology" is advertised in the title, but it's sizzle with no steak. The "techniqes" are standard selling stuff. It's a quick read.</span>
