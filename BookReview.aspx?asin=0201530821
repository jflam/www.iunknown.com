                    <span>A well-written book that teaches you how to think about complexity theory instead of just a flat summary of results. Something like Lewis and Papadimitriou's _Elements of the Theory of Computation_ would be more than enough preparation for this (note that the style of these books is quite different- this one is more informal and descriptive). Covers all the material you need in a first text. Has a good little introduction to mathematical logic in it, including a nice succinct version of Godels Incompleteness Theorem.  Lots of interesting exercises.</span>

                    <span>*Computational Complexity* is a great introduction to contemporary formal logic, which is more heavily mathematical than even the great mathematical logicians of the past were.  It's a great introduction, even though they put a good-lookin' chick on the *back* cover (what's that about?), because Papadimitriou does not suffer from what Quine called *mathematosis* -- he is not assimilating the material of logic (anything and everything symbolic) to the rigorized abstractions of mathematics.  And as such, this book defines what I think *computer science* should be today by choosing the "greater of two evils".  If you think that computer science began with Turing like most people, CS is about building machines that do what thinking beings do (problems of detail); but if you think that computer science began with Church's undecidability theorem, CS would be about figuring out why thinking beings fall down on the reasoning job (troubles with principle).  <p>I prefer the second definition; and although I'm a little old-fashioned in my tastes (prove it by me), this book demonstrates such an attitude can be forward-looking.  Although Church is not venerated throughout the book, a task handled by Papadimitriou in his earlier CS introduction with Lewis, unlike Hopcroft and Ullman the spirit of Church is very much present in Papadimitriou's teasing-apart of complexity problems from applied CS.  Yes, it's never about the physical machine, and Ryle can go away instead of work like this -- which in my opinion could form the basis of a "computational psychology" concerned with the will to truth rather than the will to power.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the review by Arthur Fischer.  Papadimitriou might<br>be an excellent researcher, but his communication skills are<br>hopeless and horrible.  The typos make learning even harder.<p>Perhaps someone like Michael Sipser should take up the task of<br>rewriting this book.</span>

                    <span>Yes,it is generally "hard" for undergradute students even grad. students. If you are taking course "Theory of computation", I would like to recommend the Sipser's or Cohen's books for introduction's supplement. However, this book covers too many topics, therefore becomes too dense, so that you should read it carefully and slowly. For example, it introduces the "reduction" in some previous chapters but without precise defintion and therefore miss the more important part :how to do the reduction in the right way. You will find the concept of "reduction" is not very easy to catch if you refer to the Sipser's or Ullman's books. I admit that I could not go through more than 20 pages of this book in the beginning. But I was keeping on reading and surveying some "easy books". Finally, I understand most parts of this book. However, if some readers want some more advanced and recent topics. They should refer to some conference's papers hosted by ACM or IEEE.</span>

                    <span>I found this book hard to follow. However, I suspect I did not have the strong background in complexity theory required by it.<p>This probably should not be the first book you read on this subject.<p>It is a dense book and will probably reward intense study.<p>Also I think it is a good reference as it discusses most of the important complexity classes out there.<p>The only problem is that I think it is slightly outdated by now, being published in 1994 and hence does not contain much discussion of the latest results especially on inapproximability, the PCP theorem and so on.<p>However, this is THE standard text on complexity theory and many people swear by it, which is why I still give it 5 stars.</span>
