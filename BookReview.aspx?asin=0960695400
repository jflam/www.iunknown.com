                <span id="Label1">Does your spouse's need to alphabetically organize books on the shelves puzzle you? Do your boss's tsunami-like moods leave you exasperated? Do your child's constant questions make you batty? If you've ever wanted to change your mate, your coworkers, or a family member, then "Put down your chisel," advise David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates in this book of personality types. We are different for a reason, and that reason is probably more good than bad. Keirsey and Bates believe that not only is it impossible to truly change others (which they call embarking on a "Pygmalion project"), it's much more important to understand and affirm differences. Sounds easier than it is, you might say. Well, this book is a guide for putting an end to the Pygmalion projects in your life and starting on the path to acceptance. <p> For anyone acquainted with the ubiquitous Myers-Briggs personality test, <I>Please Understand Me</I> will be familiar territory--but gone over with a fine-toothed comb. And for the uninitiated, this book will be a quick introduction to personality typing the Myers-Briggs way--with a Jungian accent. After presenting a brief rundown of 20th-century psychology movements, Keirsey and Bates encourage you to take the 70-question "Keirsey Temperament Sorter," a sort of mini-Myers-Briggs test that places you in 1 of 16 personality types. Like the Myers-Briggs system, this test sorts your personality into groups of extraversion/introversion (E/I), sensation/intuition (S/N), thinking/feeling (T/F), and perceiving/judging (P/J). Unlike the Myers-Briggs system, <I>Please Understand Me</I> also presents four easy-to-remember temperament types--Dionysian (freedom first), Epimethean (wants to be useful), Promethean (desires power), and Apollonian (searches for self)--that underlie the 16 possible personalities identified by the test. The book then delves into a detailed analysis of each type, with sections on mates, children, and leaders. An appendix paints portraits of the 16 possible personality types. <p> Unless you're already a true personality-typing devotee, this book may seem a little esoteric, especially the somewhat "in" references to psychological theory that few laypeople will be likely to understand. But give it a chance and you may find that you'll begin to understand why you always know where to find <I>Anna Karenina</I> on the shelf (you have an ESTJ husband), why your boss is sarcastic one day and praises your achievements the next (she's an NF), and why knowing the reason that the sun comes up in the same place every day is important to your little one (he's Promethean). You may even find that once you accept quirks and ticks in others, they will understand you a little better, too. <I>--Stefanie Durbin</I> </span>

                    <span>Offering a comprehensive analysis of how our temperaments affect our style of leadership, romance, childhood behavior, and overall character, "Please Understand Me" is an invaluable tool of reference that will forever change the way you view interpersonal relationships. There were moments in the book when I could not help but think to myself, "If I had just known this earlier, it would have saved me so much trouble."
<br />
<br />The universal applicability of what Keirsey & Bates discuss make this a relevant read for all of mankind, however, only the enlightened minority that actually cares to discover why human beings behave the way that they do will appreciate the content. Exceptionally practical and insightful, this is a work that you can refer back to again and again throughout the years to better decipher the actions of those around you. Highly recommended.</span>

<br />
<br />This easy-to-read book, by clinical psychologists David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, is about character and temperament types.  Character is the integration of all traits to yield a unified whole which reveals the nature or personality of a person.  Temperament is an aspect of a person's general make-up characterized by dispositions toward particular patterns of behavior (for example, emotional reactions and mood shifts).
<br />
<br />The authors explain the purpose of their book:
<br />
<br />"The point of this book is that people are different from each other, and that no amount of getting after them is going to change them.  Nor is there any reason to change them, because the differences are probably good, not bad." 
<br />
<br />The book begins by making the reader aware that there are four pairs of "dimensions of difference":
<br />
<br />(1) (Extroversion vs Introversion) or (E vs I)
<br />(2) (iNtuition vs Sensation) or (N vs S) 
<br />(3) (Thinking vs Feeling) or (T vs F)
<br />(4) (Judging vs Perceiving) or (J vs P).
<br />
<br />All these dimensions are thoroughly explained.  These are very important and form the basis of the entire book. 
<br />
<br />There is a page in this book that summarizes these four dimensions.  I suggest photocopying this page and keeping it for easy reference in order to get maximum benefit from the rest of the book.
<br />
<br />From these four pairs of dimensions of difference, it has been determined that there are four temperament types that consist of combinations of two of the above letters.  For example, there are SPs (Sensation/Perceiving temperament).  This is also called the "Dionysian" temperament.  These temperament types are well explained.
<br />
<br />From these have emerged sixteen different personality or character types that consist of four letters each.  For example, there is the INTJ                                       (Introvert/iNtuition/Thinking/Judging).  This type is also known as the "scientist."   In the appendix of the book, each of these sixteen types is discussed.
<br />
<br />The rest of the book has interesting chapters on mating & temperament, temperament in children, and temperament in leading.
<br />
<br />A feature of this book is that it enables you to determine your own character type.  The reader does this by completing "The Keirsey Temperament Sorter" which consists of seventy questions.  There are no right or wrong answers to these questions.  (For those with some psychology background, this sorter is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test.)
<br />
<br />Finally, there is a second version of this book that has much more psycho-babble.  This book has no psycho-babble and is easy to follow.
<br />
<br />In conclusion, read this book to understand why people are different from each other and why that's OK!

                    <span>"Please Understand Me" is a clear description of the 4 variables in Briggs-Meyer personality types.  It is fairly simple to understand.  One is either introverted or extroverted.  One looks at the world through one's senses, or through intuition.  One evaluates the world through thought, or through feelings.  One prefers the world either structured, or open-ended.  Each of these preferences can be mild, moderate, or intense, and the way the four preferences can be combined creates 16 personality types.  Yet, with variations in intensity, there is ample room to understand the true range of human personality.  
<br />
<br />"Please Understand Me" and "Please Understand Me II" are two completely different books, not an original and updated version of the same book.  "Please Understand Me" covers the basics, understanding what each letter means, and the way they combine.  "Please Understand Me II" is a detailed description of each of the 16 personality types, carefully structured to allow easy comparison.  It would be difficult to understand for anyone not already familiar with the Briggs-Meyers personality type system from "Please Understand Me" or another basic book.   
<br />
<br />While the "Please Understand Me" system can be interesting as a means of self-analysis, it is most useful when turned outwards, as a way of understanding the people around you, and as a way of planning your actions for maximum effectiveness.
<br />
<br />For example, when planning a party, it can be easy to slip into planning only the types of activities that you like.  But your guests will be of all personality types.  So consider - the extrovert's may love a loud dance floor, but the introverts will need a quite space to recharge now and then.  Sensing types will love the stimulation of good food, good music, etc.  Intuitive types may want a space to chat.  Judging types will want an idea of what to expect, perceiving types will want room for spontaneity.  So invite a few SJ's to show up early and help set up.  Let the SP's bring some excitement.  The NFs will love making sure everyone feels pampered and appreciated.  And the NTs will be ready to understand any possible crisis, and solve any technical problem that may arise.    
<br />
<br />This is not a way of ranking personal development through "stages," or of telling you what you should be.  It is a way of understanding the world for what it is, and people for what they are.  At times it can seem almost ruthlessly pragmatic, such as when discussing leadership types, and how to lead different types of people.  Yet it can also be idealistic, seeing the role of a leader as one of understanding and inspiring followers, and the importance of appreciating people in a way that matters to the person being appreciated.  </span>

                    <span>If everybody had the chance to read just one book, this one is packed full of information on understanding yourself - but mostly others - better.  You learn those little things your spouse and kids do are really NOT meant to drive you crazy;  they're just hardwired differently than you.  I have read many books on this subject and this one, along with Type Talk, are the best.  This first version is perfect for the lay person;  there is a newer, updated version but it gets into a lot of psycho babble which most of us not in the field would find difficult to digest.  I am thrilled the "older" and original version is still available;  I've ordered multiple copies and handed them all out already.  It's time to replenish my supply.  Great for managers who are hiring, but take the time to really absorb the information.</span>

                    <span>Despite its cheesy title, this book is not only a lot of fun to read and test out on friends and family, but it's also helpful and informative.  It was given to me by a guidance counselor while I was in high school, and being an INFJ, it helped me understand myself and others better.  I think we should be discussing this stuff in classrooms, especially classrooms of young kids, not as a model of absolutisms or concrete scientific fact, but as a method for teaching tolerance for different types of people.  I really think these temperments are legit, and it inspired me to read about Jungian psychology.  I've taken the test a few different times over the span of the past several years to see if my type had changed as a way of testing the Myers-Briggs-based test itself, and I've always come up w/INFJ.  At the risk of sounding narcissistic, I also find that when I compare INFJ w/other types, the profile of INFJs most closely describes me so I think the test is accurate.  It's not an exact science, but it's still useful.</span>
