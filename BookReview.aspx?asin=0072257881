                    <span>I am doing a presentation on e-portfolios in Acrobat next week.  I have version 7 and I really wasn't comfortable with all the fine details.  This book has been a lifesaver.  I got the Bible (a lot of useless information; no meat)and the Classroom in a Book (waste of time).  This book was so easy to read and understand.  I would have felt like a fool at this presentation had I not read it.  I work at a college in NJ and I am recommending this book as the textbook for the e-portfolio center.
<br />
<br />I had another book by this guy and it was pretty good which is how I happened upon it.  One thing though; who designed the cover of the book? Talk about hokey.  Don't consider the cover a reflection of the contents which is great!</span>

                    <span>This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences.</span>

                    <span>This manual will get you up and running using Acrobat 7 very quickly. I had no idea Acrobat did so many things! I had a presentation to do and in Acrobat I made a "PowerPoint" like slideshow and embedded my Camtasia movies. As a result, at the end of the presentation, before I even left the room I received 4 referrals for work (which I closed on). The book more than paid for itself!!
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this information, through and easy to use book for anyone who wants to tap into the awesome power of Acrobat 7.</span>
