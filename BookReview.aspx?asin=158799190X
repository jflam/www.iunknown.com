                <span id="Label1">If the prescriptions for getting rich that are outlined in books such as <I>The Millionaire Next Door</I> and <I>Rich Dad Poor Dad</I> are successful enough to make the books bestsellers, then one must ask, Why aren't there more millionaires? In <I>Fooled by Randomness</I>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a professional trader and mathematics professor, examines what randomness means in business and in life and why human beings are so prone to mistake dumb luck for consummate skill. This eccentric and highly personal exploration of the nature of randomness meanders from the court of Croesus and trading rooms in New York and London to Russian roulette, Monte Carlo engines, and the philosophy of Karl Popper. Part of what makes this book so good is Taleb's ability to make seemingly arcane mathematical concepts (at least to this reviewer) entirely relevant in evaluating and understanding everything from the stock market to the success of those millionaires cited in the aforementioned bestsellers. Here's an articulate, wise, and humorous meditation on the nature of success and failure that anyone who wants a little more of the former would do well to consider. Highly recommended. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I> </span>

                    <span>by far my top 10 favorite investing books.
<br />what did i learn?
<br />only invest when your probablity of winning is good and the risk-reward ratio is skewed in your favor.
<br />if you made quick easy money, it could be that you just got lucky.
<br />why do i like it?
<br />its a philosophical look at investing that easy to follow and understand.</span>

                    <span>It's an interesting book. Very arrogant but nontheless truthful, and it could be shortened by a hundred pages. The author delves into the classics (half dozen of them) to sound intelectual, but it is hard to justify that; he scorns this attitude several times in the book, but otherwise does the same thing. Granted, he admits he is quite like the characters he ridicules in the book. Aside from    that the book is a page-turner and fun to read.   </span>

                    <span>Look no further if you need a book to fully engage all your mental capabilities. To list a few interfaces, the topics covered in the book are a blend of Literature, Philosophy, Mathematics and Finance. I must confess that my understanding of the contents after reading such a high density text is partial, but I am determined to read it again.
<br />
<br />The book is an excellent discussion on the concept of probability and asymmetries in real life. We get a clear view as to how the human brain naturally lacks the ability to grasp this concept and is trained to think linear while life is full of non linear outcomes.
<br />
<br />Imagine a sturdy typewriter over which a group of monkeys are allowed to dance. If billions of these creatures are at work, statistically, one of them might produce the Iliad, just by chance. Imagine if we were to honour this fellow and expect him to produce the Odyssey next. 
<br />
<br />In another instance a clever trickster selects 10000 names at random from the telephone directory and sends them a recommendation to buy a particular stock. By the end of the week his forecast comes true to 5000 of these mortals. The next week he mails another recommendation to these 5000 and after the repetition of this process for a few weeks, we have about 125 hard core believers who are willing to pay anything for advice from this portfolio expert. 
<br />
<br />The millionaire next door may just be an outcome of chance, the lucky monkey on the typewriter. However the society showers lots of praise on him for his vision, hard work,  business acumen and the like.
<br />
<br />When the author was asked once if he was expecting the market to rise or to fall in a particular week, he says that it would rise. But he sells calls in apparent contradiction to his own opinion. The explanation is very interesting. He did expect with 70 % probability that the market would rise, but very slightly, but there was a chance of 30 % that it would fall steeply. 
<br />
<br />There are several outcomes in life and in markets that are rare - black swans. But these are the exceptions that provide great opportunities. The author says that he is one of those happy crisis hunters who may lose small amounts of money frequently but makes tons of it during rare volatile events. The author uses the Monte Carlo simulator to visualise outcomes where mathematical equations are too complex or provide partial answers.
<br />
<br />Entertaining, educative and at times too sharp in criticism of "proven theories" chances are that we have more questions than answers to many problems that we confront in our daily life. 
<br />
<br />Journalists and MBAs  should be forewarned that they might feel like the creatures on the typewriter after reading this book.</span>

                    <span>Fooled By Randomness delivers an introductory course on how to live in a random world. Taleb believes the human mind isn't made to understand randomness and that really complex systems operate more or less as if they were random. 
<br />
<br />Taleb wants us to change how we think about risk. He wants us to abandon the attitude that because something's happened before, it'll happen again (e.g. my portfolio will continue going up) or that because something hasn't happened before, it'll never happen (e.g. others traders have gone bust, but I never have and I never will). Taleb chides traders who prefer frequent small gains and tries to explain their behaviour. A trader who makes small profits 4 days out of 5 and a small loss the other day will have a solid record, he will feel good about himself but he will not be prepared for Black Mondays or other financial shocks and he will blow up, to use Taleb's phrase, and disappear. 
<br />
<br />Taleb also wants to debunk the assumption that the bell curve (the Normal distribution) is a good model. He points out that financial disasters like the 1929 crash or Black Monday in 1987 have happened more frequently than the bell curve predicts. Why then, he asks, do risk managers still stick with Normal models? These models have failed to predict large movements and are dangerous. 
<br />
<br />Taleb does not take credit for the views he presents and he gratefully acknowledges debts to a range of thinkers from Montaigne to Popper to Mandelbrot. But a good teacher is hard to find and we should be grateful for someone like Taleb. The ideas here are not original, but Fooled by Randomness presents them forcefully and dramatically. </span>

<br />
<br />Taleb is well educated and because of that interesting. Unlike  the corporate types that dominate modern finance. This book gives great insight on markets and mathematics of probability. It changes your thinking on luck and chance in life. It breaks down dogmas in finance and economics. Everyone interested in markets must read this book.
