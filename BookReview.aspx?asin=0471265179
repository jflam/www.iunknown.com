                <span id="Label1">This is the first full-length account of the CIA's coup d'etat in Iran in 1953&mdash;a covert operation whose consequences are still with us today. Written by a noted New York Times journalist, this book is based on documents about the coup (including some lengthy internal CIA reports) that have now been declassified. Stephen Kinzer's compelling narrative is at once a vital piece of history, a cautionary tale, and a real-life espionage thriller.</span>

                    <span>This comprehensive--and most current--account of the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company under the leadership of Mohammad Mossadegh in 1951 details the reaction of the company, the British government, and US political leadership to that historic event. Mossadegh had become "a defining figure whose ideas, for better or worse, were reshaping history," a fact that the British were simply not willing, or able, to accept. The ensuing crisis pushed Iran into economic bankruptcy and political chaos, vulnerable to Soviet designs. In 1952, Churchill and Eisenhower agreed to get rid of the Iranian prime minister using covert activities of the CIA. The consequences proved monumental for both Iran and the whole region. Seasoned New York Times reporter Kinzer offers a well-researched and attractive book that is more journalism than scholarship. Sources for the numerous quotations appear in endnotes rather than footnotes, and some quotations are from secondary sources whose reliability many scholars have questioned. However, on the whole, this is a valuable and informative work for students of international affairs, with a moving account in the epilogue of the author's visit to Mossadegh's estate, where the leader was forced to spend the last years of his life and where he is buried.</span>

                    <span>I couldn¡¯t understand the desire of a suicide bomber. But I was ignorant. <P>This book is a great read. It's told fast and personally. The reader feels the author's genuine interest in the subject. What is sad is how little I knew about Iran or Western influence in Iran. <P>This book is a must read for anybody like me that wants to know more of the background to today's political climate. The sections on the ancient history of Persia are particularly fascinating and told in a quick, clear way. <P>As far as the connections between terror and the coup I think it's easy to see that the 50s, while marking the end of the British colonial era, established the US as a new Imperial power. This, is at the heart of every terrorist act. If you read this book you will come closer to understanding the fear of foreigner powers meddling with your country or the feeling that at any moment a missile can blast through your apartment window.<P>Seems to me that most Americans, or Westerners, still have not grasped the fundamental realities of the psychology of terrorism. What dignity is there being killed by a satellite guided bomb? There¡¯s not even any personal interaction with the enemy. Of course there are going to be suicide bombers. People who have a history of suffering and place honor in death during rebellion will revolt. This is made clear.<P>The strength of the book lies in the facts being pulled out in different themes. One reviewer said the book is poorly organized. This was an interesting review but I disagree. The book is organized thematically so things overlap but give the reader a richer idea of how one event affected another. I think Mr. Kizner has a firm grip on the difference in cultures, the lives of the people involved, both Asian and Western, and the resonance this event in history is having today.</span>

                    <span>Kinzer not only tells the story of the 1953 coup against Mossadegh itself, but gives a very good historical review of the events in Iran leading up to the coup, and gives us all pause for thought as to how we should ... and should _not_ ... go mucking with other countries and trying to set them up in _our_ interests.<P>The short term benefits to U.S. and British "national interests" (read: "oil companies") in installing the Shah as the ruler in Iran may have been beneficial (although it's not clear that Mossadegh would have been a whole lot worse), but the long term outcome was pretty much a foregone conclusion: The revolution, and a generation or two with deep distrust if not outright hatred for the Western powers. And we're reaping the whirlwind right now for it.<P>Must reading. I'd say start at the White House. Rewrite it in small words with lots of pictures, and force Bush to put down the "Very Hungry Caterpillar" and take on something substantial for once in his life.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Kinzer presents one angle very well in his thought provoking book. This book shows how the CIA coup removed Mossadegh from power and brought back the Shah. There are deep implications to this. Any Iranian would be hurt by another country coming and interfering in the internal affairs of their country. Mossadegh was a nationalist, not a communist as a number of reviewers feel. It shows how simplistic a number of Americans are about their knowledge of another country. All this was done for the oil. In the end, we ended up making a lot more enemies than before. The Shah was not elected and was a dictator. He may have done some good and a lot of Iranians were OK for him, but he was bad for a lot of people with his deadly SAVAK. The number of political prisoners tortured were enormous. America would always support any dictator as long as it serves their purpose, but this is a short term perspective. In the long term, it comes back to hurt us. The same was proven in 9/11, as Osama Bin Laden was a protege of the Americans in the Cold War. An enemy's enemy should not become a friend. The true mark of a great leader is to understand the long term implications of any decision one takes. The present day Iran is not in a good state, hopefully it will change for the better soon. But the change must come from within. No one must try to bully them, that would only make things worse for the common person there. It is one of the few countries in the middle east that has potential for real democracy and free thinking, unlike what most people think. They should find their path. The same is true for Iraq, I personally feel that it is simple minded thinking to believe that we can change that country by going in and forcing a regime change. History shows that such things happen otherwise.</span>

                    <span>This is a mostly intriguing account of a specific episode in history with some far-reaching lessons. In the early 1950's Iran was a developing democracy but was being oppressed by British oil interests. The newly-formed American CIA engineered a scheme to overthrow Iran's popularly elected Prime Minister Mossadegh and prop up the much less popular monarchy of the Shah. Here Kinzer describes the intrigue and international political shenanigans that led to the coup, which was fueled by anti-Communist paranoia based on Mossadegh's nationalist (but only tangentially socialist) ambitions. This was the CIA's first dirty tricks campaign to destabilize a foreign government, and Kinzer ably points out the irony in how the US overthrew a democracy and installed a totalitarian regime, in order to basically protect Western corporate profits. Kinzer also outlines the very real ramifications this all had decades down the road in the form of radical Islamic fundamentalism in Iran and fractured international relations to this day. <P>However, some of Kinzer's conclusions are reaching way too far. The book's subtitle confirming "the Roots of Middle East Terror" appears like a ploy to sell books in the aftermath of 9/11, as his attempt to directly connect the 1953 coup in Iran to specific modern acts of terrorism and hatred toward America is not completely logical. For one, he has completely disregarded the continuous Israeli/Palestinian saga. Kinzer's hero worship of Mossadegh and neglect of all other Iranian interests of the period (the Shah barely registers as a character, for example) is also problematic in its one-sidedness. But if you disregard some of the specious conclusions, Kinzer's story is an interesting example of the far-reaching effects of political dirty tricks and unintended consequences on America's relations with the developing world.
