                    <span>No, you won't become an accomplished boat builder simply by picking up this little book, or any other for that matter. Respect this beauty for it's glimpse at tradition provided by an underappreciated master of a dying trade. <P>This book includes lines and offsets for 16 boats. Good boats. Where can one find plans for a stunning example of a 125 class step hydro, or a well proportioned little full keel sloop for the paltry sum of the cover price of this book? Only getting started? Check out the pram, the punt, or the skiffs. <P>Monk's designs are relevant even in these days of design software and chopper guns. If you are an aspiring boatbuilder, this book can help you to learn respect for the old timers and their ways. If you're an accomplished boat builder in search of a worthwhile project, this book provides many. All of these designs are adaptable to current methods and materials by the experienced builder.<P>A wonderful design compilation. Get a different book to learn how to sharpen those shiny new chisels. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>As others have noted, this book is actually a reprint of an old collection of plans. The techniques used in construction are very traditional; no plywood, epoxy or synthetic bedding compunds found here. It's not a beginner's book, either, although a careful craftsman could probably build the first one or two boats with a little thought.<P>But even if you never built any of these boats-- and I suspect most who buy the book fall into this category-- this volume is still a wonderful addition to the bookshelf. I bought my copy before I knew anything about boat construction, and the more I learn, the more I enjoy casually thumbing through it. At the price, it's a bargain; I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in boat design, or traditional construction, or who just likes looking at boat plans.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed the book and agree with the reviewer who said it is a must for anyone's collections. The book is not, however, what, from the title and the reviews, I believed it would be. This is not a practical guide for novice boat builders.<P>This how-to guide is an unabridged republication of a book originally published in 1934. Much of the advice is dated. Sixteen horsepower outboards are no longer suitable for racing boats. To build a stream box, it is no longer practical to look for an old "stove boiler" (whatever that is) abandoned on a vacant lot. The author never mentions power tools. And the section on legal requirements for a new boat bears a publisher's footnote indicating that the information has not been updated in 65 years and may no longer be right. The author also assumes that the reader already has extensive knowledge about boats. For example, it seems that almost every board and plank on a boat has a unique name to boat builders, and the author uses those terms throughout the book, but nowhere does he provide a diagram of a boat with all of the various parts labeled. <P>I enjoyed reading this book the same way that I enjoy reading old newspapers: as a snapshot of the past and as a work that occasionally provides new insights. I imagine that an experienced boat builder could find much in the book that is useful, and at a bargain price. This is not, however, a practical how-to guide, at least not for novices.</span>
