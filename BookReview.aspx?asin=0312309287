                    <span>Lukeman presents a useful illustration of how character drives the story. However, I'm sometimes turned off by his own lanuage. Female characters are often "girls", while male characters are usually "men".
<br /> 
<br />For example, "You've set up your friend on a blind date...there are many girls who fit her description." Is this friend fourteen years old?
<br /> 
<br />Or under Prolonging Conflict, "..two brothers meet a pretty girl they both like, and for the first time realize they both like the same type." What type is that? The pretty type? 
<br />
<br />Worth reading, occasionally annoying. Without them, I'd say it's terrific.

                    <span>Go into a bookstore and check out this book for yourself. It's good enough to speak for itself: good stuff, especially for the person who doesn't have a definite plot idea in mind.
<br />
<br />You'll find that most of what Iowa Bookman says is bull. Had s/he read the Introduction (most kids don't), he would have learned that Lukeman used movies such as the Godfather for a specific reason. Even the "on the contrary" claim is untrue. </span>

                    <span>Lukeman's previous book, The First Five Pages, provided good practical information about grabbing an agent's or editor's (and presumedly a reader's) attention quickly in order to increase your chances of getting published.
<br />
<br />In the first five pages of The Plot Thickens, I counted several cliches (he uses the phrase, "On the contrary," three times within four paragraphs), the word "reference" used as a verb when he meant "refer to," and other examples of unimaginative construction and sloppy usage.
<br />
<br />Continuing on, I discovered that this may have been intentional, for Lukeman's goal seems to be to help you construct a story that is full of cliches. He encourages the recycling of plot devices that will be immediately recognizable to the reader (and refers to popular films - not other books - to make his point.)
<br />
<br />If your goal is to create easily digested fiction that will not challenge your reader, and will stand a better chance of getting optioned for a screenplay, then Lukeman's advice may help you. </span>

                    <span>I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters?</span>
