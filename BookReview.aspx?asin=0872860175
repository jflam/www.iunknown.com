                    </div>
                    <span>And as one of the most memorable poems of the 20th century began...
<br />"I saw the best minds of my generation
<br />destroyed by madness, 
<br />while starving hysterically naked,
<br />and roaming the streets with an angry fix..."
<br />
<br />Allen Ginsberg, poet and storyteller of the Beat Generation, became the driving force of the newly formed Beat movement that, through insanity, madness, and periods of solitude, rose from the depths -- specifically the woefully sexy city of Berkeley, CA, to the cumulative vortex that remained in pieces on the seductive streets of NYC's Lower East Side community. 
<br />
<br />"Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in houses, we'll both be lonely."
<br />
<br />The book, "Howl & Other Poems" not only includes both parts of "Howl" but includes other works such as "A Supermarket in California."
<br />
<br />"The madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time, coming after death."
<br />
<br />Overall this book is the equivalent of a historical document, in terms of the Beat Generation's poetry. It also contains several short poems that were written under the influence of... certain substances and poems related to Ginsberg's sexual experiences, as well. 
<br />
<br />This book, short as it is, is well worth owning. Another Amazon quick pick I'd like to recommend is "THE LOSERS CLUB: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, about a poet who can't get published -- amazing book, referencing the beats and Bukowski. Not only is it entertaining and funny, but ultimately profound.

                    <span>Beat Generation poetry.  Obscene and profane, but is it great?
<br />
<br />This book is introduced by Williams Carlos Williams, a far better poet, who really should have known better than to pass Ginsberg's rants off as poetry.
<br />
<br />There is energy and youth evident in Howl, but there is also an abundance of hogwash and lies. </span>

                    <span>A must read for those who have an interest in the sixties.  Ginsberg is able to express much of what this time period was all about. The growing pains of a generation and the struggle for identity in poetic verse.

                    <span>This book of Ginsberg's poems are an essential for the Ginsberg reader. 
<br />
<br />This has "America" and "Howl", 2 of Ginsberg's best poems. This little book of poems was also on a list of banned literature for the contemplation it makes one ponder.

                    <span>Read "Howl" when I was around 18 and thought it (and still do) a groundbreaking (for various reasons) work.  Twenty years later, I find that I don't praise it as quickly and easily as I used to.  The images Ginsberg created are fantastic and the whole stream of consciousness approach is, more often than not, exhilarating but I sincerely doubt that all those people posting 5 star reviews can honestly tell me what "Howl" is remotely about.  Art is subjective, I know, and where one person sees a brilliant poetic catharsis another sees a slightly over-rated diatribe, no doubt written while under the influence of some "chemical refreshments" so popular within the beatnik culture.  I'm aware that "Howl" doesn't necessarily have to have a "meaning" (at least not a conventional one) but even employing a surrealist stance and dismissing even the most remote notion of logic, there seems to surface little more than drug induced hallucinations and ravings.  Did "Howl" push the envelope?  You bet it did.  Did it change how poetry was viewed?  I believe it did that, too.  Is it great poetry?  That's totally personal, but it my opinion it serves more as testament of the culture and age from which it emerged than anything bearing literary merit.</span>
