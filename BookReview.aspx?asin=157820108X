                    <span>A pleasant surprise: a good book from CMP; not bad for a change. Someone below complained that it's disjointed, well, I'd rather say it's literarily imperfect, but in that particular case I'm willing to forgive stylistic quirks -- for two reasons: first, it's not *that* bad relative to the area, it reads OK; and second, whether well written or not, the book is very instructive, contains no bs whatsoever, the density of good stuff is high. 
<br />
<br />What I also liked quite a bit here is that the author goes beyond basic exposition of the subject matter; in addition to covering the code in the book, he also explains his own thinking, problems he encountered, tradeoffs he faced, possible alternatives and what -- and why -- he ultimately settled on, and what the reader could try instead, what to tweak, what to expect from such tweaking, and so on. This is a great, mind-expanding approach the reader stands to benefit from (quite irrespectively of the subject matter, actually). For example, even though the book is mostly about software, the author includes the relevant hardware issues -- without getting bogged down in irrelevancies, but in sufficient detail which is very helpful in the overall scheme since it shows the reasons for design decisions. 
<br />
<br />The author comes across as a bona-fide knowledgeable, experienced, and likeable person who has "earned his epaulettes" in real life with real stuff, who has something to say, and who is quite generous in telling it.
<br />
<br />All I can say is that I'm pleasantly surprised (especially this book coming from CMP whom I have already written off as a shoddy publisher); that because of reading this book I've had a few helpful and timely for my own work ideas -- it's been pleasant and instructive at once. Recommended (not only for TCP/embedded/PIC developers -- this piece holds something useful for anyone, I think).</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent introduction to TCP/IP on embedded systems and webservers. The author is very clear and divided the book in a very smart way. The last few chapters which talk about the low level codes are excellent. This book will be one day recogized as the ultimate reference of embedded TCP/IP.</span>

                    <span>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to implement a complete embedded webserver, but has no prior knowledge of ethernet, ip, tcp, or http. There are a few good state diagram pictures, and snippits of C source to walk through every state. It goes above and beyond a raw technical RFC explaination and mentions  features and techniques common in other implementions. This book does not cover HTTP as completely as it does the lower level protocols, but it does cover it well enough to implement a small, simple embedded webserver. Combine this book with UNIX Network Programming / W. Richard Stevens. And you have an ideal combination. TCP/IP Lean works from the bottom on up (over-the-wire transmissions) and UNIX Network Programming works from the top on down (high-level API). This book also covers SLIP, Ethernet, ARP, and other protocols. If you have to implement your own TCP/IP stack, or only want to learn the guts of what SYN, FIN, ACK, and RST mean in your packet captures, then this is a well written book.<p>This book does not describe BSD Sockets or any APIs. It really only covers the author's thin "API" which is really a kernel interface. That is why it's best as a low-level book, as I mentioned before UNIX Network Programming is the book you want if you need a high-level view of TCP/IP and networking in general.<p>Perhaps the most important feature of this book is that it tries to take you from nothing to having a TCP/IP stack in the most direct route possible. It does not try to insert all possible optimization, and infact it recommends ignoring various TCP/IP features for your first pass because they are rarely used. (For example, It mentions that without additional handling, the implementation presented can only handle 4.3Gb of data transfer per connection. This is when the sequence number address space wraps around). I consider this a good thing, keeping it simple so you can get a workable system as quickly as possible is the best route. You can bog yourself down in the details after you get a rough draft working.<p>I'd recommend this book as a text book for undergrad courses in TCP/IP and networking implementation, especially as a complement to any other low-level Operating Systems courses.</span>

                    <span>The second edition of the book is an expanded version of the first edition with the same, lazy, writing style. The author seems to have a problem collecting his thoughts and tends to jump around topics. The writing style is that of a technician with limited technical writing skills. CMP Books could use a good copy reviewer/editor team.<p>If you are attempting to learn networking protocols in general, there are higher quality books available. If your goal is to learn a network stack on an embedded processor (In particular the PIC), this is not a bad book as source code is included. To be successful and focused on the software, you'll need to invest another [$] for the PCW version of CCS's compiler, and another [$] for the Microchip PIC.net demo board (Unless you have very good prototyping skills). Note that the first edition of this book comes with the Microchip PIC.net demo board which is sufficent.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on the reviews here, and the fact that the author popped up in several Usenet groups and seemed to know what he was talking about.  The title and subtitle would indicate that this was exactly the book I was looking for, and the fact that it included source was a bonus.<p>Unfortunately, after having the book for two weeks now, I can tell you that I've gotten far more value out of Stevens' "TCP/IP Illustrated" series.<p>The source code included on the CD-ROM is licensed for personal use only, and it appears that probably %90 of the code is included in hardcopy format inside the book.<p>Finally, the network traces are practically unreadable: it would have been easier to read if the author had used tcpdump, instead of his own style of printf's.<p>What I wanted was a concise guide to how to strip down TCP/IP to get it running on small systems: what I could delete, what I had to keep, and the tradeoffs of doing so.  When I finish filtering through all the source code and simply focus on the text, that may be what I end up with.<p>But since I don't have much time, the book will probably sit on the floor, and I'll keep Stevens on the desk.</span>
