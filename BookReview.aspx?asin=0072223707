                    <span>I just took the test today and scored 89% to my suprise. 100% on Section I, 93% on Section II, and 75% on Section III of the Macromedia study guide. The book does help, but more so by going through the 'experience' of completing the chapters. Also read everyone else's reviews for this book for more helpful tips( e.g HTML & CSS cheat sheets at Web Monkey). Don't spend too much time on memorizing how to navigate around the IDE like the books says... very few questions on that. My tips too you: Experiment, and make sure you know the fundamentals ( even the little things you overlook ). Also as obvious as it may sound, use your common sense, if the answer doesn't sound right it probably isn't. The questions are pretty short and too the point, the answers can be tricky though. Good Luck! ...</span>

                    <span>I had been warned that the Dreamweaver MX exam was tough, and this guide, weighing in at more than 600 pages, did nothing to alleviate my anxiety. However, I attacked it systematically, chapter by chapter, and as a result passed the test with a very good score.<P>Like many Dreamweaver users I make heavy use of a few well-known features. This book revealed a huge number of tricks, tips and obscure features I never knew about and definitely plan to use. The sample questions were fair, although they were more ambiguous and inteface-oriented than the actual test questions (thank goodness). If you take the exam, make sure you know the *actual* code and standards as well as the Dreamweaver way of doing things.<P>A few criticisms: the book could have used one more copy-editing pass, as there were errors in the test answers and even a few in the "Exam Watch" tips that are supposed to give you a heads up on nasty exam tricks. The CD was disappointing, since it contained only one exam (the downloadable second exam appears to be on DW/Flash integration) with questions that are drawn directly from the book. It is mainly a promo for LearnKey online training.<P>There are many excellent Dreamweaver books available, but this one has the advantage of hewing closely to the exam syllabus, and the results (in my case) speak for themselves.</span>

                    <span>If you're going spend the time to study and pay the $100 to take the exam, this book is a sensible buy new, and a no-brainer used. I don't know how large the pool of exam questions is, but, unlike some other reviewers, my exam had maybe 10 questions that were mostly about the IDE ("If you're in X mode and you click Y, what happens next?"). I doubt that I would have passed the exam without this book alerting me to these types of questions. There are too many errors in the book's quizzes, but they're not confounding - the answer is given as "C" but the explanation clearly fits "B". Other than that, the book is solid.</span>

                    <span>I had taken many tips from this site regarding this book but no book in the market covers all the modules for the exam.So I bought this book and studied it from cover to cover.Yes,the exam was much more challenging and some questions had to be read thrice to understand the language.But Thank God!!! I managed to get the pass the exam but not with a good score i had expected.The exam covers indepth knowledge of HTML,CSS,Javascript and dreamweaver's way of integrating Behaviors.So all those designers,please brush your code and fundamentals and some General knowldege like the IP address of your local web server and about FTP.Lastly,this book covers the entire contents needed for the exam but the mistakes should have been avoided and the CD should have been more useful.But untill anyone releases a book for the certification this study guide by Marc Campbell would serve the purpose.</span>

                    <span>This book did an excellent job of preparing me for the test, although the actual test questions were much harder than the chapter review questions given. It covers all the areas on the test and goes more into depth about the actual HTML code than most other Dreamweaver books.<P>With so many high points, it is hard to believe some of the errors that are in this book. Having a wrong answer for a chapter review question is one thing, but having entire answer choices and screenshots missing is inexcusable.<P>This is still the only avaible book specifically for Dreamweaver certificaiton. If your goal is to pass the test, this one is for you.</span>
