                    <span>As a fcs app developer, i recommend this book to those who look for a good reference and practice of fcs apps. As most of you know, at the present time (2005/1/26) there are still little resources around on internet, and this book is a really good deal and start.
<br />
<br />From the ground up, the authors of this book explored a lot of fcs app capabilities with very good examples that take the reader from the beginning to the end.
<br />
<br />Although it doesn't go in depth with the fcs components, it showed general uses of them that are quite helpful, and other ways that u can do things without the components.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, other than the new book "Programming FlashCom" that will come up in Feb, this is a really good book to get on fcs development!
<br />
<br />Never mind the beginning of this book, at my first look, i almost thought this book might be useless since it's just a lot of introductions, but the good stuff comes later :-)</span>

                    <span>(Barry L Beattie is an ASP,ColdFusion and database programmer and teacher at a Multimedia training college)<p>This book covers building internet applications (more than just web pages) using some of the newest and most exciting technologies available for the web. While a large part of these Rich Internet Applications (RIA's) involve new Macromedia Flash functionality, the strength of RIA's (and this book) is how it integrates with other technologies: databases, streaming audio and video, and webservices.<p>First some background.<p>I was looking for a book like this for two reasons. The first was to build on my web programming skills and RIA theory. The book should assume I wasn't a Flash guru and use concise and practical examples with easy to understand explanations.<p>The other reason was for a "suggested reading" text for my students to integrate their flash skills with the internet programming I was teaching, especially ColdFusion. The aim was to equip try and "future-proof" students with some experience in cutting edge internet technologies.<p>This book has met these expectations nicely. It is well written and structured, with easy to read overviews of the technologies used (databases, server-side code, webservices, remoting, communication server, etc). It has sufficient explanations of protocols (like Flash remotings' AMF, XML and SOAP) and technologies without boring my students with too much detail or myself with stuff I already knew.  <p>The use of notes, tips, sidebars and cross-references provide more than just a book about theory. Combined with screenshots and easy to understand diagrams, the book is broken up sufficiently to make reading - and understanding - easier. While it is not the last word in RIA's, it successfully covers almost all of the topics and technologies with a sufficient depth to get myself and my students up to speed quickly.<p>A special note should be made of the examples provided on the accompanying CD-ROM. Each example is built up slowly, having multiple versions to build up to the completed functionality. This includes both the source code and the final versions and work easily, showing in detail how the RIA's work. I was very surprised to get the examples to work as easily as they did, and they showcased the application of the technologies well.<p>The examples are used as talking points for design and implementation considerations. Sure it might feel like a cookbook at times, but that hand-holding is invaluable to first-time users and serves to demonstrate putting the theory in the book into practice.<p>So this book is suitable for both the internet programmer wanting a solid introduction into RIA's and Flash users wanting to extend their skills in a new facet of their chosen tool. Combined with practical examples, this book provides an excellent introduction into Rich Internet Applications.</span>

                    <span>This is a really interesting book. I am a long time Flash developer (since Flash 4) looking to expand my knowledge into areas such as integrating databases with Flash front-ends, learning more about the new Flash Comm Server, and incorporating Cold Fusion into my designs (I am also an intermediate ActionScript programmer). Well, this is the book to do it. Flash Remoting, Flash Comm Server, Cold Fusion MX, and even a bit on Dreamweaver MX (exclusively on server-side applications) is covered in the book. There is also a chapter on Web Services, which is very enlightning. There is a lot of new information and technologies for Flash developers to absorb. The book has excellent examples and a companion web site with a forum. Overall, an excellent choice especially those wanting to learn the Flash Comm Server. This book should be flying off the shelves! Get it!</span>

                    <span>I would have given this book 4 stars if the CD was Macintosh-compatible, as stated on the cover. 
<br />It isn't. 
<br />It's Macromedia's fault for not offering a Mac version of ColdFusion or Flash Remoting (yet), but this book is by Macromedia Press, so I hold them accountable.
<br />Unless you have already figured out how to set up your Mac as a server, and/or have Virtual PC running on it, don't look for answers on Flash/database connectivity here.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever looked at your parent's book collection? Notice how they tend to pick up books by the same author, time and time again. I can say that after reading the first 8 chapters of Building Rich Internet Applications that I will be looking for more titles from both of these authors.  <p>First of all the title of this book is a little misleading,<br>because it delivers A LOT more than just information and hands on demonstrations for building RIA w/MX. <p>Other things you'll learn<br>- Object-oriented programming concepts and practice.<br>- Proper coding syntax for writing actionscript.<br>- How to use actionscript to create a user interface with flash.<br>- How to write ColdFusion components that allow Flash to access databases via Flash Remoting.<p>These are just a few things I have picked up on after reading about half of the book. You will also learn how to put together a nice workflow process for a dynamic site from the database to the UI. There is also a great website that goes with the book where you'll ACTUALLY get to communicate with the authors directly.<p>That's all for now... After I finish the book I'll have to come back and let you know how the rest of it went. I recommend this book for anyone at any skill level who has an interest in extending Flash to it's full capabilities.</span>
