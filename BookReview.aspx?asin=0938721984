                    <span>I have read at least a dozen books on how to get organized, at work or in general. As a professional with a private office, I have found this book the most helpful, inspirational, and practical among those. The language is neither condescending nor folksy; the principles are clearly stated and summarized; and all advice is eminently applicable. Now I have all my office files in half a drawer and I can produce any document within seconds. The author does not require you to clean up your office in one day: you are allowed to start from today's paper piles and work backwards as needed. We procrastinators are now officially out of excuses.</span>

                    <span>It takes time but going through the process outlined for filing information has helped.  I have organized my files, both paper and computer, so I can find things in seconds instead of hours or days.<p>I would have given the book 5 stars but I thought there was a little "fluff" added that wasn't neccesary.<p>Overall a great book for those who tend to need some help getting organized at work.</span>

                    <span>I was not near as bad as some of the cases Barbara describes in her books, but I was pretty pathetic!  I was over a year behind reconciling my checkbook, paid bills late and my finances were in a mess, because my home papers were in such disarray!  I felt so out of control, I didn't know where to start.  I finally spent a weekend going through 7 boxes of papers I'd moved around for years, set up files, etc.  Then I found Taming the Paper Tiger.  Barbara covered things from setting up a workable space to how to organize action and storage files.  I now have a terrific credit rating, run the family budget, have NO stacks of unidentifiable papers, mail greeting cards timely, and even get photos mailed out to the inlaws.  I have recommended this book to several friends and family members.  You simply cannot run your life successfully without managing your papers.  God bless Barbara Hemphill!</span>

                    <span>Some are blessed with amazing organizational abiities.<p>Some of us are organizationally impaired ... or go through spurts of organization followed by piles of paper and inefficiency.<p>Hemphill's "Paper Tiger"  takes you through the steps of organizing information from the  philosophical ("Clutter is postponed decisions") to the practical  (setting up filing systems, organizing computer files) to the special  circumstances (attending conventions, sharing offices, working on the road  or home).<p>She offers concrete, easy to remember tips for getting started  (think F*A*T for each piece of paper), and then provides info on more  complex tasks.  You can pick up this book, turn to the sections that apply  to you, or read it all the way through.  Regardless of how you use the  book, or the level of your organizational skills, you'll gain valuable tips  for getting better organized.</span>
