                    <span>I watched this when it aired on the Discovery channel and have all intentions of purchasing the DVDs. <P>Within the first 20 minutes, I was amazed by the animation. The Coelophysis was so life-like, I had to remind myself that this is not a typical wildlife documentary. This six-part dinosaur film is presented as one would expect a documentary on tigers or spiders to be presented. It followed the story of individual dinosaurs and specific herd and packs. From a herd of hadrosaur, to the flight across the ocean of a great pterosaur, to the family life of T-Rex. Almost all of the creatures featured were of believable quality. The dinosaurs appear to interact with their environment of real-life scenery.<P>While this is an educational film, it would only be fair to point out that the information and stories about these creatures involve a lot of speculation, but that is to be expected in any dinosaur documentary, especially one presented in this style. <P>I would recommend 'Walking with Dinosaurs' to anyone who likes dinosaurs, wildlife documentaries, or just want to see something amazing and imaginative. This is a program I watch when I'm feeling creatively blocked... it really jump-starts my imagination to see these extinct creatures come to such believable life.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of dinosaurs since I was little, so I found this series to be really cool. I liked the graphics it made me say "Woah! " a few times. The DVD version is sold in two disks and the second disk is the making of "Walking With the Dinosaurs". It is really neat to see how they made this, and they put some additional dino animation which I thought was clever and funny. The first disk has a cute menu screen and it presents the dinosaurs and other animals in the land, sea, and air during three different time periods. Although I have a problem with the theory that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, I do dismiss this because it is the popular view point and the series is based on the 'popular theory'. Anyway, I do have to admit that the "Jurassic Park" dinosaurs seemed more real to me than the dinosaurs in this presentation, but I still liked it and would recommend it to anyone interested in walking with the dinosaurs.</span>

                    <span>With 230 minutes and bonus features this two disc set is a must if you enjoyed any of the other "Walking With..." series. From the very first dinosaur to to the very last, the show explores the changes to the world and evolution of the dinosaurs to keep up. Frankly, two of the shows don't even FOCUS on dinosaurs, but on the sea reptiles and the flying reptiles. It could of used more dinosaurs.<BR>There is a 50 minute "Making Of" documentary in the second disc and about 29 minutes of behind-the-scenes picture-in-picture footage spread through-out the first disc. The behind-the-scenes footage tells you how they did the effects, why they picked certain locations and why they made the dinosaurs do what they did. Some of the behind-the-scenes footage is also shown in the "Making Of", so there is some overlap.<BR>Interesting, but much of the information was already well known and covered by older shows or children's books. And, yes, lots of babies seem to die. A lot. THAT is nature, but maybe not something younger viewers should be exposed to in so many scenes.</span>

                    <span>Walking with Dinosaur; is a SPECTACULAR movie featuring different kinds of dinosaurs. The movie is done in a documentary style, like those nature shows you've seen on television. They used computer animation to bring the dinosaurs to life; and let me tell you that they look incredibly realistic. The movie is broken down into a series of episodes featuring a different dinosaur in each one of them. The narrator, Mr. Kenneth Branagh (sorry if misspelled) did in excellent job and just added to the immersive story telling! I felt like a child listening to a wonderous bedtime story. I laughed at the funny parts and felt sad during the tragic parts of the stories. The movie is very long and is complimented with beautifully orchastrated classical music. The movie is about three hours long and I still wish it was longer; because that's how much I loved watching WWD! Adults and children will like it! And although dinosaur behaviors are all hypothetical, the scientists explaining their theories sound pretty valid and logical. If you enjoy nature shows or love dinosaurs, you should add this movie to your collection! Walking with Dinosaurs is a Magificent Epic!</span>

                    <span>We bought this for my (almost) 5 year-old son who has already forgotten more about dinosaurs than I'll ever know. I have worked in the elearning world with programmers who make 3-D animations of industrial equipment, and I have to say I am just amazed at the quality of the work in this series. The dinosaurs just plain look like they are alive today. It looks as real as if they were shooting elephants in Africa.<P>PROS<BR>* Presented in story style of real animal documentaries: Each of the six episodes follows a small number of dinosaurs for a period of time; we learn about their relationships with each other and their environmental struggles<P>* "Making of" bonus DVD is a treat for older viewers interested in seeing how the episodes were made. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH PALEONTOLOGISTS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT ADDS TONS OF CREDIBILITY AND REALISM TO THE END PRODUCT.<P>* Animations as real (or better) than Jurassic Park<P>* Comprehensive focus on different periods (Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous) of the dinosaurs and wonderful background on the different climates and geology of these periods<P>PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION<BR>Anyone, young or old, with an interest in dinosaurs should get this. There may be some parts that frighten young viewers, so parents should screen it first and be with kids during the kids' first viewing. BUT THIS IS PHENOMENALLY ENTERTAINING AND EDUCATIONAL FOR EVERYONE.</span>
