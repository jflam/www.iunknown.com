                    <span>I think this book will change the world if enough people read it. After I read the last page of the book, I was so galvanized to put its principles into action, that I even contemplated becoming a politician! But I then understood why Gandhi was so inspired and moved by it.  And in a sense this book did change the history of India. The first nine or ten chapters are very dryly written - almost like a scientific paper, with very little emotion or appeal to the reader. Tolstoy uses many examples and logic to argue his case. Towards the end, he becomes more passionate and thats why some people suggest reading the last chapter first. Either way, the book has amazingly powerful ideas that will change the way the world operates and thinks. I think this book should be made compulsory for all graduate students of philosophy , ethics, politics and social studies. I almost feel that 'war and peace' wrongly overshadows this piece of work. 'The kingdom of god is within you' is far more visionary, powerful and far-reaching. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I first learned of Tolstoy and this book after reading Gandhi's book "All Men are Brothers"  
<br />
<br />Tolstoy sets out a challenging interpretation of Christ's teachings, namely, that all violence is a crime against God, as God lives in each person.  Technically, in each living thing, as Tolstoy himself was a vegetarian for this very reason.   He articulates that it is not merely the obvious violence of war which is a crime; it can also be violence committed through the use of courts or even through taxation.  Even the threat of violence is tantamount to violence in Tolstoy's view; there may not be violence when taxes are collected, but there is an implicit use of violence behind their collection.  Similarly, the use of the court system may not be violence in and of itself, but the threat of violence if its rules are not followed. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else, this book will make you think.   I would advise reading it with an open mind.  Few people will ever be able to follow the ideology or philosophy Tolstoy espouses to the level that Gandhi did, but that does not mean each and every one of us should not try.  I am reminded of the saying "men use the North Star as a guide, but they never expect to reach it."   Similarly here, Tolstoy points out to us the North Star; whether or not we reach it is up to us as individuals.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>"The Kingdom of God is within You" is a large, polemical work in which Tolstoy outlines his case for "nonresistance" to evil. The book had a large effect on Mahatma Gandhi, and is thus of interest not only to Tolstoy fans, but to those wanting to understand more about Indian history.
<br />
<br />Tolstoy unveils his critique of modern society (as it then was) and modern Christianity. Society is characterised by repression and brutality (either overtly or as an immminent threat). These occur not just between nations, but within nations as the ruling classes exploit and control the masses. Much of the book, therefore, is a strong attack upon the capitalist-militarist-colonialist nation states of the time.
<br />
<br />Established Christianity only vaguely resembles the teachings of Christ. The Church is complicit with the state, pumping out a "Christian" message designed to further its own power and to legitimise the abuses of the state. Christ's real teachings are nowhere to be seen. Tolstoy laments the corruption of the modern Church when compared to the early Christian church: unfortunately his belief in the purity of the early Church is backed up with little evidence and could be criticised as myth-making.
<br />
<br />Tolstoy points towards Christ's real message as conveyed in the Gospels, and advocates that humans should strive towards the ideal standards set in those teachings (they might not be achievable, but people can improve in the attempt).
<br />
<br />The book is written in a clear accesible style, with frequent use of metaphor and similie to help illustrate the points being made. It can drag at times - Tolstoy quotes other works at length, so much so that extraneous irrelevant material is shovelled in with the pertinent stuff. Also, it's passionately written, at times descending into a hectoring tone.
<br />
<br />In all though, still thought-provoking, especially as Tolstoy's criticisms can hit the target today.

                    <span>This is the book which sparked the spiritual revolution in Ghandi, and helped make him the unbelieveable man he was.  Ghandi raved about this book in his autobiography, and I couldn't agree more.  This could quite possibly be the best book I have ever read.  However, two years ago I wouldn't have gotten all that I have out of it.  It came in the perfect time of my spiritual awakening.  By the very Truth of you reading what I am saying  I would suggest you get this book RIGHT NOW!  You are ready to hear what he has to say, and it will make you a better person and thus making our world better.  Tolstoy is a remarkable spiritual revolutionist, and he will open your eyes to the works of others that have been suppressed throughout time.  Good luck to you and take care out there!</span>
