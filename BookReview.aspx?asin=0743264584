                    <span>While a previous reviewer calls this work "irrefutable", those with logical minds know better.  Obviously, this book is based upon the false premise that homosexuals are denied the right to marry.  All homosexuals have the right to marry, so long as their object of matrimony is of the opposite sex.  This begs the question...do any of us have the freedom to marry who and/or what we want?  Of course not.  I can't marry my computer, sister, brother, car, etc.  There are restrictions in marriage for everyone.
<br />
<br />It doesn't take too much work to see through the author's flawed thinking in this excercise in futility.  Hopefully there are enough people who will realize this and send this book to the trash heap of irrelevancy. </span>

                    <span>Evan Wolfson has been called the Martin Luther King, Jr. of the gay rights movement. Since 1983, when he wrote his Harvard Law School thesis on the subject of marriage equality, Wolfson has focused his keen intellect on the subject. Now, he has done all of us a great service by writing Why Marriage Matters: America, Equality and Gay People's Right to Marry.
<br />
<br />	Why Marriage Matters addresses the concerns of everyday Americans as they struggle with the issue of marriage equality. He touches on all of the issues-from the religious response to the historical argument, from racial equality to what the opponents of marriage equality don't want you to know-in an easy to read, easy to follow way. In fact, the book becomes downright compulsive as Wolfson draws the reader into the compelling stories of real people whose lives are affected by society's injustice.
<br />
<br />	Never didactic or preachy, Wolfson explains carefully and respectfully exactly why marriage matters to the millions of us who can't have it. And he does it in the way that we could (if only we were so articulate). In fact, the next time you're discussing marriage equality with family or friends and you find you don't have the words, give them Why Marriage Matters instead. </span>

                    <span>"The most important benefit of marriage is marriage." This simple statement has haunted me for more than a week after reading this rather enjoyable book. Evan Wolfson dissects the arguments for and against state recognition of marriage between people of the same-sex and why nothing can compare with marriage itself. Civil unions, domestic partners and the rest can never compare with the basic recognition, portability, and personal fulfillment that one gains through marriage.
<br />
<br />Wolfson is one of the smartest and influential human rights leaders today. He brings a wealth of historic, legal, and personal perspectives and stories together in a surprisingly quick read aimed at the general public but a great resource for anyone interested in the institution of marriage, its history, and its future.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the definitive polemic on why marriage rights must be preserved for same sex couples; not civil unions, not "gay marriage," just marriage.
<br />
<br />Wolfson, a nationally renowned attorney and the director of Freedom To Marry, tackles the political, ethical, religous and legal arguments, and does so with grace, elegence and rigorous logic. 
<br />
<br />He frames the entire discussion in terms of civil rights, and makes a compelling and irrefutable case.
<br />
<br />This is the book to give to your friends who "still don't get it" and say "ok, here, read this, and come back with questions."

                    <span>This book achieves the rare feat of making a non-fiction book into a page- turner. The arguments of course are compelling, reflecting the most persuasive points in a pithy fashion. It is the examples of how marriage impacts individual lives that keeps you reading it. Quite simply, the combination of effective argument and people's lives will convince the most skeptical. Even those who disagree with equal marriage rights should read this to see what arguments they need to defeat. A great book for anyone - you won't put it down. </span>
