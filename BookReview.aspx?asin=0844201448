                    <span>I wanted to get to know the city in more than the typical touristy way, and this book made it possible. The walks were really the highlight of my four weeks of study in London; I met so many interesting, friendly people and saw so many things that might not have been destinations in and of themselves but were memorable as part of the walks. I was a college student (female) traveling alone when I used this book, and it gave me the confidence to explore many places that I wouldn't otherwise have ventured to, simply because I had some sense of what I could expect when I arrived. One of the most amusing moments was when I bumped into another walking tourist at the Portabello Road market...he also had a copy of the book and was following the Notting Hill tour on the same morning that I was.</span>

                    <span>I used this guide while walking in London two years ago, and I'm taking it to London again this summer. The variety of walks is a joy. I did not see this book on sale while in London, and some English friends saw mine and wanted a copy for themselves. No wonder--it's that good. If you like to walk and do other exploring besides the usual London tourist things, then don't go to England without a copy of this book in your suitcase or backpack. My only suggestion to the author is to bind future editions of the the book in a way that the chapters can be removed and replaced. So I wouldn't have to carry the whole book along, I tore the pages out for each walk I did, and then taped them back in place afterward, but there must be a better way.</span>

                    <span>Highly recommended if you are planning an extended stay in London, or have been there a few times already and seen the major sites.<P>My favorite memories of six months spent working in London were of the walks I took from this book just about every weekend. Some of the walks are short enough that you can do two or three in a day, depending on what adventures arise. The best for me was Kew to Hammersmith, along the Thames, an all day walk, where I had tea in a church basement, a pint in a pub on Strand-on-the-Green, got caught in a rainstorm in a church graveyard, got lost in the woods on the grounds of Chiswick Manor...my workmates were very impressed, and started asking to come along!</span>

                    <span>The only problem with this book is that one would have to live in London to have the time to do all 30 walks! The level of detail for the walks is just right - long enough to make it interesting, short enough that it can be read and followed while actually doing the walk. Each walk has a summary paragraph; the start and finish location with Underground and Bus information on how to reach that location; the length [distance]of the walk; the time required to do the walk; information on refreshments en route; and then the walk itself with a route map of the walk. For added flexibility, the map and commentary allow one to start/stop each walk at just about any point on the route. I teach an Insider's London class and recommend this book for both first-time and return visitors.</span>
