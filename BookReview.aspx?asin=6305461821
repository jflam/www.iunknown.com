                    <span>Sometimes the impresive achievements of the Imax and dvd technologies exceed the quality of the content of a certain documentary. This is not the case. If any, this video keeps us longing for more, much more. Since the beginning of this highly entertaining video we feel commited to watch one of the untamed scenaries of our world. Virgin Landscapes (rivers and mountains that are yet to be named), wild and funny animals (such as the black bear taking a bath, the humpback whales bubblenetting, the wild polar bear cubs and the stubborn salmon) and an extreme weather that changes the sorrounding scenary on a daily basis are described and tought with either the lightness of humour, or the concern of a nature fan. If you like to watch beautiful images over and over, buy this dvd.</span>

                    <span>I love nature and I love my high-end audio-video system...The IMAX series discs offer like minded people to get a trully awesome visual eye-feast.The narration by C.Heston fits the somber,harsh yet beautiful imagery of this DVD.I know some people complain that for the money its to short.However,the thrill of seeing such sharp,clear,pristine views in my view,makes up for it.And,until more networks broadcast true HDTV programs,this is the best us nature lovers can get!</span>

                    <span>I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this and now, having watched it, I'm so glad that I did. A:SotW is entertaining and enlightening... with breaktaking scenery and unexpected humor, courtesy of the Alaskan wildlife. (there's a scene with a black bear that's absolutely hilarious.) Charlton Heston's narration doesn't annoy or interfere with the scenes as some narrators do... I highly recommend this DVD become part of your collection, if only for the sheer beauty of the Alaskan landscape that is shown.</span>

                    <span>I am an aerial/landscape photographer living in Alaska and some aerial scenes in this movie remind me of my photoshoots and fights through steep valleys. In IMAX format, it's almost spellbounding! With the size of Alaska as large as 1/2 of the contiguous 48 lower states, it's hard to document everything 'wild' about Alaska in a short 40+ minute film. However I will give the film-makers credit for doing a fantastic job of showing the audiences the differences of seasons while integrating the wildlife aspect of this great state. This film will do wonders for the eco-tourism of Alaska. The aerial scenes taken from Denali National Park via K2 Aviation (the red small aircraft) are especially inspiring. Come on up and visit us in Alaska everyone and get ready to be inspired like you've never been inspired.</span>

                    <span>I was attracted to the movie by my wife who is a big polar bear memorabillia collector. Though it's only an hour in length, it's scenic beauty will blow you away. Can you imagine what it looks like on an IMAX movie screen? WOW!</span>
