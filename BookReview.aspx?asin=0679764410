                    <span>Joseph Ellis is without a doubt one of the most qualified historians in this nation to study Thomas Jefferson the individual.  To this end, "American Sphinx; The Character of Thomas Jefferson," is a brilliant examination of a complicated individual.  Quite frankly, this is not a historical narrative...it is an upclose look at the many contradictions in the Thomas Jefferson personality.  
<br />
<br />Readers who are looking for a full accounting of Thomas Jefferson's role in American history should look elsewhere.  This book unmasks Jefferson.  Ellis's chief quarry is Jefferson's character.  On that note the author documents the behavior of a great visionary and that of "a devious manipulator who played cowardly games with the truth." More importantly Ellis honestly concludes that Jefferson "probably came to believe his own lies...he was not accustomed to having his word questioned and his excuses exposed, not even by himself." 
<br />
<br />Jefferson's paradoxical stance on slavery gets glaring attention.  Ellis reports a stunning Jefferson metamorphosis, "His most unattractive feature...his deep convictions that blacks were inherently inferior and could never live alongside whites in peace and harmony."  This imperfection stains Jefferson's greatest achievements...the skilled draft of the Declaration of Independence and the timely Louisiana Purchase.  Still and all, Jefferson developed a keen sense of himself as a Founding Father with a prominent place in history books.  He left behind many of his edited letters and papers for history to judge.  He obviously hoped he could influence how history remembered him but he probably never imagined that people like Ellis (and select others) would dig this deep.  Highly recommended.

                    <span>Well written in prose style that allows reader to easily follow the complicated life of one of the founding fathers.  Tends to skip negative events, especially second term with little or no explanation.  Provides prologue which discusses events not sufficiently covered in main body, specifically Sally Hemmings.  Epilogue takes the Jefferson legacy and applies it to events following his death up to current issues such as the fall of communism. Although it is incomplete, the subject matter provides a well rounded insight to the author of the Declaration of Independence and our third President.  Well worth the read.   </span>

                    <span>This is an excellent piece of scholarly work in which an esteemed professor analyzes Thomas Jefferson by means of gathering certain ascertainable facts and expounding on them through use of the scholars' tools of opinion, interpretation, and speculation. You will derive much appreciation from this book if you are not too adament about requiring provable facts to form historical conclusions. If you like to deal with raw facts, I must say I finally got myself to try the book by Remick called West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education that I saw several previous reviewers recommend as one that accomplishes bringing the thinking mind of Jefferson into clear focus by understanding the interrelationship of simple facts by him and about him. It's not a scholarly work having the greatness of Joseph Ellis, but, one I certainly recommend to compliment American Sphinx as both light and enlightening. </span>

                    <span>Ellis has a problem.  He makes claims that he can's support, and he makes claims that are inconsistent.  To borrow one of his techniques, he writes like a pathological liar.  He seems to forget what he has said from page to page or even from the start of a paragraph to the end - more interested in calling attention to himself than he is to the truth.  I recognize the pattern.  I was a pathological liar once.
<br />
<br />Here are some examples.  On the last paragraph of page 87 (paperback edition), he claims that Jefferson had compartmentalized conflicting beliefs.  That may be the case, but the rest of the paragraph is poor evidence at best.
<br />
<br />On the bottom of 123 he says that Jefferson's remarks on ratification were inconsistent and contradictory.  The evidence?    He changed his mind about the timing of support: oppose after 9 states ratify to force a bill of rights, and later oppose from the beginning to force a boll of rights.  What a flip-flop.  I'm shocked.
<br />
<br />I don't have the page now but he's says that Jefferson withdrew into an emotional shell when Martha died to protect himself from future hurt.  Then a few pages later he describes Jefferson's intimate relationship with the Adams family, and then his heads-over-heels crush on a young woman in Paris.
<br />
<br />I'm suspicious of the way he footnotes.  He begins a paragraph with a few quotes from Jefferson's correspondence.  Then he psychoanalyzes Jefferson extensively making claims that aren't supported by the quotes, and then ends the paragraph with a footnote.  The footnote gives the citation for the quotes early in the paragraph but is mum on his interpretation.
<br />
<br />A couple more.  The first paragraph pn page 137.  He quotes a letter from Madison.  Some of the quote is in italics added by Ellis to indicate coded language without saying how he knows what words are coded or where he found the key to decode the language.  It reminds me of the movie, A Beuatiful Mind.  He uses the coded language to state that Jefferson expected to retire and return to Paris.  Wow.
<br />
<br />I'm on page 190; it's 1797 or there abouts.  Ellis is claiming that Jefferson is coming out of retirement to solve the nation's debt problem because he can't solve his own debt problem.  What hogwash.  Mr. Ellis, there are a myriad of other explanations.  Perhaps, Jefferson's financial problems made him acutely aware of the problems debt represented to the nation.  He wasn't entering public life to duck the problem of his private debt.  Given the acerbic mood at the time, entering public life would make it harder to confront his own debt demon.
<br />
<br />That's enough for now.  I will continue reading because I told my nephew, a history student, that I would.  Keeping ones word is such a burden.</span>

                    <span>This is a well-balanced and fair study of Thomas Jefferson.  As another reviewer notes it is not a biography, but neither does it claim to be.  Rather it is a careful, incisive look at what must be one of the more fascinating, and troubling, of the American founders.
<br />
<br />Elsewhere it has been noted that John Adams is undergoing a mostly positive re-evaluation while Jefferson's, perhaps since the publication of Fawn Brodie's book in 1974, has been in decline.  Bernard Bailyn in "To Begin the World Anew", puts Ellis among the Jefferson naysayers but I do not see that.  Certainly there are those who have been hard on Jefferson.  Ron Chernow in his biography of Alexander Hamilton, for example.  Ellis appears to admire Jefferson and tries to work out why such an outstanding figure would stoop to being so duplicitous.
<br />
<br />Ellis faces all the contradictions and problems head on in way that I feel Bailyn in his book does not.  He works out a plausible explanation that he further develops in another excellent book "Founding Brothers".
<br />
<br />I found Ellis' writing style took a little getting used to but it grew on me and became quite involving.  It was involving, and rather convincing, not only due to the style but also by the force of his ideas and insights.  
<br />
<br />This appears to me to be one of those books that anyone else who subsequently writes on the subject has to look at before writing.</span>
