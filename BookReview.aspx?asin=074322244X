                <span id="Label1"><P> From medicine and defense to food and cosmetics, biotechnological breakthroughs are creating huge new global market opportunities as well as unprecedented challenges. Companies from mega-pharmaceuticals to infotech giants and biotech start-ups must radically rethink their business models. In the first book on the business of biotechnology, Fran&#231;oise Simon and Philip Kotler combine their biotechnology and marketing ex-pertise to show managers how to innovate with bionetworks, win customers with biobrands, and create sustainable advantage worldwide.   <P> Simon and Kotler explain in clear nontechnical prose how innovation in the new biosector will be driven by a web of cross-industry collaborations, and in particular by three transforming forces: information technology, consumerism, and systems biology. With timely industry cases, the authors demonstrate that by capitalizing on these forces, companies from Hitachi and Siemens to Amgen and Pfizer could become the biotech leaders of the coming decades.   <P> The chapters on building and sustaining biobrands are the centerpiece of this indispensable book. Simon and Kotler present a powerful framework that will enable any manager to redefine and transform traditional models into a new branding paradigm: the global "targeted" model as an alternative to the global "mass market" model. The authors illustrate how each of these models has proven successful in launching such blockbuster drugs as Viagra, Lipitor, Rituxan, and Gleevec. <P> Relevant to all industries impacted by biotechnology from consumer goods to industrial products, <I>Building Global Biobrands</I> is essential reading for every manager, marketer, analyst, and consultant who must understand the Biotech Century.</span>

                    <span>This book, exhaustively researched and daunting to read, sums up all of the most important forces likely to concern a biotech marketer. The authors take a dispassionate, methodical approach, buttress their points with plenty of case evidence and examples, clearly have a grasp of the subject and communicate detailed knowledge of great value to those in the field. Unfortunately, their style is plodding and clinical, replete with passive constructions and impersonal, generally soporific sentences. We believe that those with a real need to know will be glad to brew some strong coffee and grateful to stay the course and become so thoroughly updated. Readers who are intrigued by the field - but not immersed in it - will benefit most from reading the introduction, the first three chapters and the conclusion.</span>

They gave us a wide overview, from R&D leading trend to Marketing implementation and License & Acquisition Business. The two main strengths of this book are the numerous real case studies exposed and the international insight of the whole study(including Europe and Japan).<br>This book will interest Executives involved in Business Development, Bio-strategy or smart fox wondering what the Bio-sector will look in the fast coming years.

                    <span>This is a very smart book: it is valuable for professionals in all aspects of health care who seek an insight into the global pricing and marketing of medical therapies.<p>Though not biological scientists, Simon and Kotler impart their treatise with a savvy academic outlook blended with lessons learned in the consulting arena.  The authors show an amazing scholarship. They combine knowledge derived from personal acquaintance with key players in the biotechnology and classical pharmaceutical industry with an understanding of the medical applications and implications of drug therapies to weave a rich tapestry of a very complex topic. <p>Their view ranges from:<br>¬∑	a discussion of the history, politics and costs of biotechnologic research; <br>¬∑	the pricing of new drugs to allow both access and cost recovery (Novartis' introduction of GleevecR);<br>¬∑	 the evolution of Big Pharmas' ( e.g. Pfizer, Merck) alliances with smaller bio-tech firms to find innovative therapies,  <p>to the techniques used to maintain brand franchises as patent protection is lost. (Over-the-counter Advil remains a viable brand.)<p>They are able to keep readers' interest high by providing concise and lively vignettes of many developments in the history of drug introduction and marketing. Among these, they cite:<br>¬∑	Pfizer's promotion of late-entrant LipitorR to become the victor in the statin "races"; <br>¬∑	Johnson & Johnson's brilliant recall of TylenolR following deaths due to product tampering and its ability to maintain the brand's prominence for over 30 years; and <br>¬∑	Pfizer's consumer-driven shaping of the market for ViagraR by creating  erectile dysfunction as a new clinical entity.<p>The future appears to be in the realm of biotechnology with strong BigPharma participation. Whatever the new environment, the basic principles of marketing described in this volume will hold true.</span>

                    <span>Professors Simon and Kotler have done a great job in capturing many of the latest trends in the biotech world, and its continued fusion with the pharmaceuticals business.  The thesis of the book is well laid out, and especially useful are the hundreds of company examples and detailed case studies that are used to prove the points.<p>The book spans the value chain, and offers insights at several levels.  I suggest anyone with an interest in the biotech world -- venture capitalists, regulators, entrepreneurs, pharmaceutical company executives, individual investors -- have a reference copy.  You will find it to be invaluable!</span>
