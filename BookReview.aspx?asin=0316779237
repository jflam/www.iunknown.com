                <span id="Label1">HOLIDAYS ON ICE collects six of David Sedaris' most profound Christmas stories into one slender volume perfect for use as a last-minute coaster or ice scraper.  This drinking man's companion can be enjoyed by the warmth of a raging fire, the glow of a brilliantly decorated tree, or even the backseat of a van or police car. It should be read with your eyes, felt with your heart, and heard only when spoken to. It should, in short, behave much like a book.  And, oh, what a book it is!</span>

                    <span>To call David of Sedaris's sense of humor unique, might be an understatement. In "Holiday's on Ice." David delivers his wicked black humor with a Christmas theme that will doubtfully ever translate into a classic made for TV movie. These are certainly not heart warming, life affirming tales to read in front of the fire place with a nice glass of eggnog. To Sedaris, Christmas is an odd assortment of disgruntled department store elves, ..., tv executives, and suburbanites struggling with the "true" meaning of Christmas. "Give until it bleeds."<BR>	As always Sedaris uses his unique viewpoints, and sometimes personal experiences to create rich and creative stories. "Holidays on Ice" is a collection of his finest holiday based stories. While not as involving and complete as "Naked," or "Me Talk Pretty One Day." "Holidays On Ice" is a nice Sedaris for beginners book. Stories like "Santa Land Diaries,"<BR>and "Dinah, The Christmas Whore" are as involved, and as well told as any other story in his longer works. "Holidays on Ice" proves once again that David Sedaris is one of the finest Humorists, and all around story tellers in America today.</span>

                    <span>David Sedaris could be one of the funniest writers of our generation. His semi-autobiographical essays make me laugh out loud. Sedaris views the world through cynical, yet witty eyes. His brutal commentary on society makes one blink and then chuckle. <P>The Santaland Diaries is one of the 6 essays in the book, and by far the best. This biographical tale of Sedaris' time as a Christmas elf in a department store is critical of himself, parents, the tiny children and Santa himself. Now made into a hit play that tours the nation, especially at Christmas, there's nothing like reading Sedaris' first hand account of slightly bored, slightly crazy out of work actors struggling to make a buck. <P>Dinah, the Christmas Hore, is my other favorite holiday offering in this collection. This tells the story of Sedaris' sister, who brings an unexpected guest to the family's holiday celebrations. Suddenly, David sees everyone in his family in a whole new way--sometimes that's a good thing and sometimes it's not. <P>In the end, David Sedaris comes through with another winning collection. Every book he writes is funny, but this one makes an especially nice holiday gift. Also with this great purchase, I would also like to recommend two other enjoyable, lesser-known books: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, Will@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes. I purchased both books through Amazon to avoid the bug-eyed holiday madness at the mall. Happy and safe holidays everyone!</span>

                    <span>This was my first time reading Sedaris' work and I loved it. He has biting humor and applied it liberally to a season reeking with opportunity to unleash it -- the overcommercialized all-American Christmas!!!!<P>Sedaris tells of his stint as an elf in New York's flagship Macy's Santaland, and how much he hates it. He writes a satirical church sermon delivered by a TV exec, a Christmas letter from a soccer mom-type who discovers her husband fathered a child while serving in Vietnam, and a story of two neighboring families so into one-upping each other in terms of giving that they actually send their children off to be killed and dismember and disfigure their bodies. <P>Gruesome but truthfully, anyone who has attended any kind of holiday party or been near a mall after Thanksgiving knows he has touched on some people's holiday spirits with only a little bit of exaggeration.</span>
