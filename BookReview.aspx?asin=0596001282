                    <span>This book really dvelves into the using XML with Python. The <BR>chapter are well laid out and easy to read. There are some typos <BR>but nothing that you can't fix. There are some problems using the current XSLT processer that ships with PyXml0.7 but you can<BR>still apply the concepts (I used MSXML's XSLT). The best chapter (last one (:-|) ties all the concepts explained into a Web Service like app. that really shows the real strength of XML</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book because I was able to quickly start using XML with Python. I tried to use the package docs, but they were often hard to read, and didn't fill me in on the background stuff I needed to know. The examples in this book were easy to understand, and easy to see how to make practical applications from them. I didn't encounter any typos like the other reader did.</span>

                    <span>I'm not very far along in the book, but I don't like what I'm seeing. <BR>The preface purports that the book's audience need not "know anything <BR>about XML." There is very little in the way of explaining XML, however. <BR>The chapter on "Fundamentals" is O'Reilly at its most terse. If you already <BR>understand XML very well, you might think this chapter an excellent <BR>itemizing of the specification. Sadly, most people, I imagine, would be able <BR>to retain little from this.<P>Regarding the code examples, the explanations hardly illuminate the API. <BR>The code stands as is; and the commentary does only a somewhat decent job <BR>of explaining the larger context. You could always check the documentation <BR>given in the back of the book, but that's hardly as helpful as a good overview <BR>and commentary.<P>Moreover, and in some ways worse, I have found many typos -- and I am only <BR>as far as the first two examples. These mistakes include missing import <BR>statements, errant capitalization, bad indentation, double underscores ('__') <BR>written as one long underscore. This is unacceptable. I can only hope it is just <BR>this one chapter.<P>I bought this book because of the topics, and because I figured Python would <BR>be the easiest way to learn XML API's. I am only hoping that the book will <BR>get better, and that I will be able to derive benefit from it. As it stands, <BR>I'm skeptical that I will get my money's worth.</span>
