                    <span>I read the book for the first four Potter books, and I was shocked at how the authors picked up very tiny bits of info, so went out and bought this one. The authors tell what they find with wit and secrecy. They get you started on finding annoying little bits and hints that J.K. Rowling keeps dropping us. 
<br />  To sum it up, I am a proud Harry Potter Sleuth, and a proud reader of WWP {Wizarding World Press}.
<br />                          LET'S GO SNARK HUNTING!

                    <span>This really helps you think deeper into the world of Harry Potter. I love Harry Potter and have been reading it since I was 5 and I've never thought this deeply before. Now my extra HP books are filled with stickies and paper all thanks to Galadriel Waters! Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I felt that this book did help in some way.  The review of each chapter was very short and concise.  It did not offer lengthy in depth analysis of each chapter.  The information was general and filled with cute bits of information. The book has a funny way of its paper.  Its frilled at the ends.  I do not know why they did this.  I was hoping for more information and more substantional information to read.  Overall, I felt that this was a good book with limited information.  I thought that the analysis on book 1-4 was much better and filled with more data.  The price is not worth the book. I did like the cut out  tab of the last page.  The book is worth reading but only for short information to read.</span>
