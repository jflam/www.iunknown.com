                    <span>I use parts of this book in a Sociology of Education course on the college level. Most of my students really enjoy reading the articles. They feel that they can relate to the issues that are presented around tracking, gender biases, racial prejudice, poverty, discipline, etc. The writing is accessible and the book offers an alternative way of thinking. The book helps students to explore taken for granted ideas and it opens their mind. I've done the Organic Goodie Simulation with my class and they had a great time participating, asking questions, and learning. What more could I want?</span>

                    <span>I would call this book nonsense if only the ideas inside of it weren't so off base as to be harmful. Giving kids a proper view of reality should help them navigate the world better. This book and its lessons will not do that...it actually steers them in the opposite direction. The book provides practical ways in which your children can be taught about the horrible injustices of capitalism and the wonderful world of communism (it teaches only about the wonderful theoretical parts of communism, on a child's level). Whites are persons of privilege and only whites can be racist because only whites have the power to be oppressors. Basic skills are trashed. I kept this book...but only as a great example of how some "teachers" (people who SHOULD be teaching children ACADEMIC subjects but apparently don't have the time for that) are trying to indoctrinate children.</span>

                    <span>An excellent collection of ideas and experience that will move, inspire and instruct teachers who are concerned about ALL their children. [and who are not creepily consumed by their own bitterness] See also "Beyond Heroes and Holidays"</span>

                    <span>There are a few good ideas in some of the articles, but this book (as well as volume 2)is mostly just about being politically correct in the classroom. Each article is virtually the same thing, with a change of topic. A teacher describes some "issue" they faced in their classroom, describes how they handled it in a pc way and then tells how all the students and parents loved it and concludes by congratulating themself on what a great teacher they are.</span>

                    <span>This book is full of great short articles which are quick to the point and yet useful information. The articles are usually pretty interesting to read as well, and contain some great ways to incorporate diversity and critical thinking in the classroom</span>
