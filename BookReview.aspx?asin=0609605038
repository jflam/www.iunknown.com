                <span id="Label1">Any master stylist who encourages women to do less rather than more, to  simplify their wardrobes, to carry only a few essential cosmetics, and to take  catnaps in the summer has mastered the feminine psyche. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric  Fekkai, a native of Aix-en-Provence, is stylist to some of the world's most  beautiful women (Liv Tyler, Brooke Shields, et al.), as well as the founder of  eponymous salons in New York City and Beverly Hills and creator of a line of  hair- and skin-care products, fragrances, and accessories. He understands that  many American women are frustrated by unpretty trendiness and conflicting advice  about glamour, that they want a simpler, more timeless approach to finding their  own elegance. "Style," Fekkai writes, "is not about age, or height, or  weight--it's about a sense of ease, a sense of dignity, and a sense of  individuality shining through." <p>  Drawing largely on the effortless allure of the women of Aix, Fekkai's  foundation for <I>A Year of Style</I> is a month-by-month guide to simple  beauty, with themes like "Energize" in February and "Romance" in June. Fekkai  dabs in seasonal snippets: how to wear "sexy accessories" in May, how to choose  toenail polish in July, how to relax while getting dressed for a holiday gala in  December. His touches of beauty advice cover all the basics: the differences  among hair spray, gel, and mousse; the best way to apply concealer; the perfect  home blow-dry for a finished salon look. Daily sidebars add a whimsical  tone--send vintage postcards, buy brightly colored toothbrushes, rent a sporty  red convertible for the weekend--as well as beauty and style tips.<p>  <I>A Year of Style</I> is both cool (you'll learn how to sip a <I>citron  presse</I>) and refreshingly down-to-earth ("I have seen women subject  themselves to too-often-repeated peels. Their skin becomes so shiny, they look  shrink-wrapped.") Needless to say, this is a flawlessly designed book, from the  typography and layout to the hundreds of photographs--chic, natural, and  elegant--that perfectly showcase Fekkai's style. It's a book that's hard to put  down, because it's as much about personal style and sophistication as it is  about clothes and hair. Perhaps more than that, it's spirited, accessible, and  just plain fun. <I>--Rebecca Taylor</I></span>

                    <span>This handbook is a must in every woman's library, if she wants to look beautiful and more effortlessly chic. Frederic Fekkai shows you his point of view on the total beauty and style. By following his advises you will learn how to achieve a more simple, natural, and chic lifestyle. Mr. Fekkai encourages women to feel more confident and to discard unnecessary and expensive items that only make them look cheap (over bleached hair, excessive gold jewelry, artificial long nails, etc.) I would highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>The photography and models are gorgeous -- the format of the book is inviting. Content is another story - I was very disappointed. The author shines a little in his area of expertise - hair styling, but not much. I suppose this world-reknown hair expert is saving the real tips for his paying salon customers. Ditto for skin and beauty "tips" in this book. The only tip I got from the book was the use of pure shea butter to condition hair. More of this kind of information would have made this book much much better. As for a the subject of style, Mr. Fekkai's overall mantra is "less is more" (boring) -- except of course, if you're a celebrity or society person -- then you break this rule and Mr. Fekkai still calls it style. The verdict: be beautiful, young/wrinkle-less, thin; wear and decorate with neutral colors and you will be stylish. Being rich and famous doesn't hurt either.</span>

                    <span>It's clear why Frederic Fekkai is successful: he has a well defined point of view of what he likes, and why he likes it. For instance, daytime watches do not work for evening wear, people who talk incessantly on phones are not very sexy, that before the age of five, children should not be subjected to the barber or hairdresser, and that too much skin or cleavage shown on your wedding day is simply wrong. <P> Before you think of him as just a tyrant, think again.... how many people in this time have completely forgotten their manners, or that simplicity works best, and instead waste hours chasing an elusive and ephemeral ideal? Frederic Fekkai, in fact challenges the whole 'race to be beautiful' in a manner that is calming, wise, and friendly. <P>This is a lavish book. Thick pages, beautifully photographed, and there IS something nice about being reminded to clip flowers for the house, to take time to give yourself a pedicure, and to take time for your children. Once you finish this book, you'll think of him as a cross between Audrey Hepburn, Erma Bombeck and Letitia Baldridge...... and a wise friend.</span>

                    <span>Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the suggestions! When I first read this book, I thought it was nothing more than a coffee table book full of musings. But then I tried some of the suggestions, and the results were amazing. For example, the french olive oil soap he suggested cleared up a skin problem I've had my entire life (I couldn't even get rid of it with antibiotics), and made my skin very soft.<P>Also, his method of blow drying hair works much better than mine. I do it all the time now, with great results.<P>I've tried the makeup and fashion ideas, and received a lot of compliments. <P>The ideas in this book might be obvious to people who already look great, but for clueless people like me, it's perfect!</span>

The photos are beautiful, some delicious easy-to-prepare recipes and something to share with your girl-friends.<BR>Just do it!</span>
