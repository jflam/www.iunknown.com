                <span id="Label1"><div>From a rustic beach house on Puget Sound to a desert retreat on the high plateau of southeast Oregon to a cabin nestled in a forest of Douglas firs, vacation and retreat architecture in the Pacific Northwest is as varied as the terrain itself. The best examples of retreat architecture in the country are here, from ageless timber homes belonging to early Northwest moguls to today's "days away" architecture-- lodges, cabins, and summer cottages that communicate the exuberance for year-round outdoor adventure. With ideal terrain for hiking, rock-climbing, skiing, fly-fishing, and more, the Pacific Northwest is a mecca for lovers of the outdoors, and as a result, a flood of new wealth is being poured into lifestyle architecture in this area. Retreats here are designed to keep the terrain at the inhabitants' fingertips and to adapt to such unique demands as where to park one's glider.<br><br>These days Americans can be as remote as they want to be. This book demonstrates how retreat architecture can now respond to our recreational needs while providing comfort and beauty so we can settle down in style.<br></div></span>

                    <span>From the Seattle AIA Reviewer, Peter Sackett:<P>Trying to convince a reader that architecture is<BR> good by telling them it's good is an exercise in<BR> futility. In Coastal Retreats: The Pacific Northwest<BR> and the Architecture of Adventure (Universe,<BR> 2002) author Linda Leigh Paul understands the<BR> burden of her responsibility as a writer. Her<BR> contributions reflect what images, on their own,<BR> cannot. Coastal Retreats offers a broad<BR> photographic sampling of Northwest vacation<BR> homes designed over the last half-century with<BR> editorial work that provides context for their<BR> creation, including anecdotes from both owner and<BR> architect, taking the architecture out of the<BR> showroom and into the lives of the people who use<BR> it. <P> A couple of years ago I ranted for eight hundred<BR> words or so in the pages of Arcade about a<BR> newly-published monographic account on the work<BR> of architect Roland Terry. My beef wasn't that the<BR> architect's work wasn't up to snuff, rather that the<BR> book's author had done little to flatter the<BR> architecture nor contribute a compelling narrative to<BR> describe its significance. To judge from the editorial<BR> content, he seemed less than convinced that<BR> Terry's work could stand on its own without<BR> bolstering it with sentences of fawning admiration<BR> to make projects appear buoyant on the page. <P> Paul, instead, takes the trouble to tell stories<BR> behind the homes' creation using relaxed, informal<BR> language to describe the likes and dislikes of<BR> clients as well as quirks of the landscape that<BR> provide a setting for enjoyment of their<BR> investment. The approach is both entertaining and<BR> instructive. She includes the following in a chapter<BR> on "Decatur Island Haven" by George Suyama<BR> Architects: <P> "In the mid-1990s, while flying over the San Juan<BR> Islands, designer Christian Grevstad's instincts led<BR> him to alert his pilot that they were off course and<BR> lost. As the pilot corrected the flight path, Grevstad<BR> glanced down at a flowering meadow sitting atop a high<BR> bluff. Below him lay the site he had envisioned for his<BR> ideal island getaway. He headed for Seattle, where he<BR> did the necessary footwork, and found that the price<BR> was right." <P> Grevstad may enjoy a vexingly privileged lifestyle,<BR> but it makes for a cool story.</span>

                    <span>I was surprized by the quality of the works presented but more particularly the idea of "the architecture of adventure". The premise of this book is "right on." These get-aways are not just comfortable, but expose their owner's attitudes on being at home in nature.</span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful book full of beautiful houses in beautiful places. There is a wide range of projects and styles, illustrating the quality of design in the Pacific Northwest region. An attractive book in its own right, this would be a great resource for anybody thinking of building a vacation house.</span>

                    <span>Definitely, Linda Leigh Paul should be very proud of her work....It really captures the spirit of Northwest design...When one asks, "Why hire an Architect",,,all one needs to do is show this book,,,it tells all....Again, a job well done!!!</span>
