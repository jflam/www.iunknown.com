                <span id="Label1">Mr. Pipes writes trenchantly, and at times superbly....No single volume known to me even begins to cater so adequately to those who want to discover what really happened to Russia....Nor do I know any other book better designed to help Soviet citizens to struggle out of the darkness."<P>-- Ronald Hingley, The New York Times Book Review<P>Ground-breaking in its inclusiveness, enthralling in its narrative of a movement whose purpose, in the words of Leon Trotsky, was "to overthrow the world," The Russian Revolution draws conclusions that have already aroused great controversy in this country-and that are certain to be explosive when the book is published in the Soviet Union. Richard Pipes argues convincingly that the Russian Revolution was an intellectual, rather than a class, uprising; that it was steeped in terror from its very outset; and that it was not a revolution at all but a coup d'etat -- "the capture of governmental power by a small minority."<P>"A monumental study...of absorbing interest [by] the distinguished historian of modern Russia ...Lucidly written, unsurpassed in detail and comprehensiveness."<P>-- Wall Street Journal<P>"Mr. Pipes provides invaluable background to today's headlines....Few efforts have been made to create such a comprehensive work.... Pipes is a pathfinder."<P>-- The New York Times</span>

                    <span>It's amazing how many histories of the USSR or the Russian Revolution will gloss over the waves of terror they initiated, or imply that this terror was "necessary," or speak of it in the same phlegmatic way that one would describe routine events. This makes a stark contrast to the way that moral indignation is NOT withheld from histories of Nazi Germany. Professor Pipes should be commended for expressing moral indignation about inexcusable and unnecessary tyranny and bloodshed, just as William L. Shirer deserves commendation for telling the story of Nazi Germany the way it really happened. (Did this mean that Shirer was "biased"? If he had downplayed the Nazi terror and devoted hundreds of pages to Nazi "accomplishments" such as full employment, would this have been an accurate and meaningful account of the Third Reich?) Indeed, the fact that Pipes' book attracts criticism from intellectuals for having revealed the true face of Lenin's Bolsheviks and the Soviet government they installed--in all its ruthlessness, depravity, and mendacity--is strong proof that his book's focus on the role of depraved intellectuals and depraved theories in the establishment of the USSR is right on the money. As Pipes pointed out, one of its founding ideas can be traced back to Rousseau--the idea that man is a mere creature of his "environment," and therefore completely malleable. This amounts to an engraved invitation to bloodthirsty monsters like Lenin and Stalin to start thinking that mankind should be forced to become "good," regardless of the human cost. It's sad that intellectuals--those ceaseless announcers of irony--haven't spotted the irony here: policies that necessitate bloodshed are not "good" and cannot lead to "good." <P>Another valuable contribution of this book is that the author is not afraid to show that Bolshevism was the creation of the upper-middle-class intelligentsia, not the workers or the peasants, and served the interests of the intelligentsia, not the lower classes.<P>Pipes' book should be read by every person interested in history who is not afraid to be shown that ideas have consequences, and that these are often inexcusably horrible.</span>

                    <span>A review in simple words. <BR> This book is worth to read it twice. I'm a history student and I found the book to be the best in the topic of the Russian Revolution. I lived under the communist regime and agree with Richard Pipes in many of his point of views, in fact many of my point of views about communism in Russia were reflected in the book. I have read other books about this topic, but this book is the best of all books about the Russian Revolution. The chapters "The October Coup" and "The Red Terror" are the most interesting chapters of the book. The whole Revolution was about that, a coup d'état to take power by Lenin and Trotsky and the later terror that kept communism in power for more than 7 decades in Russia. The book provided me with a good source for my seminars. I recommend the book to any history student who studies the topic.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent overview of the Russian Revolution. Pipes does an excellent job of distilling the different factions involved, and constructing the worldviews of those involved. The dichotomy between the outlook of the aristocracy and peasants was particularly good--much of the revolution's course was explained there.<P>Throughout, I think Pipes did a good job of balancing the big picture with the details that are necessary to understand what was happening in such a large country at the time. His writing style varies somewhat throughout the different chapters, but on the whole was engaging and lively.<P>I have only two (minor) complaints, hence 4 stars instead of 5. The first complaint is that the book ends around a chapter too soon. The civil war is left out almost entirely, and in general the book ended with many loose ends, without even a quick summary of what followed in history. This is not a problem for the scholar, but to a casual reader (like myself) it feels a bit abrupt.<P>The second complaint, as others have noted, is Pipes' bias. When I got to Chapter 3 I started laughing out loud, and I wondered at first if it was written by someone else. Suddenly the objective writing style becomes full of venom for the "intelligentsia." Pipes' contempt is a constant theme throughout the remainder of the book, to the point where I wasn't sure how much I could trust some of his observations.<P>This is still a great book. But I do wish Pipes had remained more objective--the atrocious record of the Bolshevik party's early years speaks for itself.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Pipes demolishes all Marxist myths in this unbiased, factual and authoritative book. And he can also say, "I've been telling you so for many years!" Marxist ideologists and writers who promoted them have lost the struggle - disillusioned, discredited and utterly rejected. This is a fact they sometimes need to be reminded of. Many out of work leftists, ex-com party pensioners with medals on their chests, some Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, with criminal backgrounds, and all the armchair revolutionaries in the West agree - "We've lost big and we've been wrong - Mr. Pipes is right!"</span>

                    <span>In general this is a good and well documented book. Severely critical of the Bolshevik philosophy and practice, I found parts of the first six chapters really annoying due to the contempt the author shows towards the opposition movements to the tsarist autocracy and to what sounds to me like a slightly uncritical "understanding" of the reasons of the establishment. On the overall philosophy of the book, it seems a fine representative of the "seizing power and keeping it" school of thought in Schapiro's classification (Schapiro, "The Origins of Communist Autocracy", 2nd Ed, MacMillan Press, London, 1977; pp ix).</span>
