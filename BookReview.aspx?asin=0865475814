                <span id="Label1"><div><b>Riveting stories of our last frontier and the acts of God and man upon it</b><br><br>Even if we live within sight of the sea, it is easy to forget that our world is an ocean world. The open ocean--that vast expanse of international waters--begins just a few miles out and spreads across three-fourths of the globe. It is a place of storms and danger, both natural and manmade. And at a time when every last patch of land is claimed by one government or another, it is a place that remains radically free. <br> <br>With typically understated lyricism, William Langewiesche explores this ocean world and the enterprises--licit and illicit--that flourish in the privacy afforded by its horizons. Forty-three thousand gargantuan ships ply the open ocean, carrying nearly all the raw materials and products on which our lives are built. Many are owned or managed by one-ship companies so ghostly that they exist only on paper. They are the embodiment of modern global capital and the most independent objects on earth--many of them without allegiances of any kind, changing identity and nationality at will. Here is free enterprise at it freest, opportunity taken to extremes.  But its efficiencies are accompanied by global problems--shipwrecks and pollution, the hard lives and deaths of the crews, and the growth of two perfectly adapted pathogens: a modern and sophisticated strain of piracy and its close cousin, the maritime form of the new stateless terrorism.<br><br>This is the outlaw sea--perennially defiant and untamable--that Langewiesche brings startlingly into view. The ocean is our world, he reminds us, and it is wild.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc.</span>

                    <span>As Melville knew, we look to the sea as a symbol for freedom, and "freedom of the seas" is proverbial. But freedom at sea can lead to such manifestations as piracy, and not just in the swashbuckling days of yore; it could also lead to corporate irresponsibility and malfeasance. William Langewiesche's _The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime_ (North Point Press) collects and expands upon his previous magazine articles on this theme. All of us are dependent upon international trade, and few of us understand how it works or in what ways it is working badly or dangerously, unless we hear about a capsizing or an oil spill. There are a lot more of those than we hear about, and a lot more crime on the sea than even governments acknowledge. Langewiesche's book is a fine way for lubbers to get to know how traditional maritime freedom is endangering them.<P>Before World War II, ships were customarily built in a country, were registered in that country, flew the flag of that country, and sailed for the profit of businessmen in that country. Ironically, the United States began the current anarchical system in a pretense of neutrality during the pre-Pearl Harbor war, registering in Panama ships bringing needed supplies to Britain. The practice became widespread in the succeeding decades, with many ships now sailing under "flags of convenience." They might be registered in countries that have no navy and even no coastline, and the countries involved can get relatively small fees, which are actually almost pure profit. The countries don't pursue administrative niceties like taxes, labor laws, safety inspections, and so on, and the corporations which own the ships don't mind avoiding such things, either. Among the cases described here are a too-old ship (with full inspection documents) broken in half by stormy seas. Pirates can take advantage of the lax laws by making a ship disappear; capture, repaint, rename, and reflag the vessel, and it vanishes from the seas. Seas are big, ships leave no tracks, and patrol ships and aircraft can see only a tiny percentage of any hunting ground. Policing the oceans from such attacks is not now possible.<P>The longest episode in the book tells of the _Estonia_, a giant luxury ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994, with a loss of 852 of 989 passengers and crew. A victim of faulty design, poor maintenance, or even a bomb (none of the extensive investigations afterwards has satisfied everyone), the narrative here of well-chosen characters trying to escape from the swiftly-sinking ship is fast and terrifying. The book ends with a part of the maritime business that few people ever consider: what happens to the worn-out ships? Salvaging used to be a thriving business in our country and others; reclaiming the metal and reusing it was good for profits and good for the environment. However, showing the same pattern of lack of regulation and reduction of the job to the cheapest source available, shipwrecking has gone to places like India, where poorly equipped and poorly paid workers are glad of the job, even if it means almost constant danger from the unplanned movement of heavy objects or the inhalation of poisons. The shipping industry, Langewiesche writes, is "not exactly a criminal industry, but it is an amoral and stubbornly anarchic one." This is a deeply disturbing book, written with cool detachment. Technology and international organizations have not made improvements in the way the vital global trade is conducted. Profits are more important than anything, the sea promises the freest of trading, no one seems to be learning from the lessons described here, and no one should expect these dangerous situations to be changed anytime soon.</span>

                    <span>William Langewiesche's excellent book could be seen on one level as just a collection of harrowing, if wonderfully told, sea stories. His writing, though vivid, is understated, and can carry as much freight, so to speak, in one or two sentences as some writers pack into entire chapter. Even on this very superficial level, this title is both riveting and educational reading.<P>But the deeper you look into this book, the more there is to uncover. I read it during a news cycle when the threat of seaborne terrorism was once again in the headlines, and it was certainly sobering to see how easily how ships in what one reviewer called "the low end of the shipping industry" can disappear almost at will from the world's seas, reappearing in a new port under a new name, with a new flag, and even a markedly different appearance.<P>Langewiesche's key point is that the world's oceans are an outlaw place -- in the original, literal definition of the word as outside the protection, or even beyond the reach, of law. On the high seas, each ship is to one or another degree, its own absolute monarchy. When crimes occur, where can they be prosecuted -- by whom, and under what authority? (The author's recounting of one memorable case where modern-day pirates were tried in India vividly proves his point.)<P>Law and order tend to break down at sea in another way too, as the sinking of the ferry Estonia made clear. As the ferry began to go under, Langewiesche tells how civilization fell apart under the simple and inescapable need for survival. Thieves even began stealing jewelry right off the bodies of their fellow passengers -- before themselves going to their deaths, appropriately enough. Disaster at sea provides horrible proof for how thin the veneer of civilized society really is.<P>All this makes for disturbing, as well as fascinating, reading. The ocean is a world where few humans feel at home, and fewer would be able to survive for any length of time if their comfortable ships or planes were taken away from them. William Langewiesche's understated but revealing book illuminates this world in a way that should replace romantic visions with a very sobering understanding of reality.</span>

                    <span>How do you pronounce this man's name? He has a wonderful way with words and I think I am going to subscribe to the Atlantic Monthly just so I can read more of his writing. This book was really scary at times and I couldn't put it down. What I like most about the author is that he doesn't try to force his opinions on the readers. Or if he does, it isn't obtrusive. His description at the end of the shipbreaking yards in India are incredible and I would love to see pictures of them.</span>
