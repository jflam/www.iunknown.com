                    <span>While any reader of this review most likely already knows how the events of the 2004 MLB season unfolded, A Tale of Two Cities takes the reader beyond the dirt and sod of the ball field to the personalities and emotions that are not always evident to the casual fan.
<br />
<br />As a native New Englander, I loved the book's insights and vignettes which go well beyond the headlines to the foundations of what makes the Red Sox - Yankee rivalry so great.  As a lover of sport and human drama, the juxtaposition of events as told from the both the Boston and New York perspectives were truly revealing and well crafted.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly - so much so I finished it in a single sitting.

                    <span>No, it's not Dickens, but it's still a heck of a book. "A Tale of Two Cities" follows the Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees rivalry throughout the 2004 baseball season. Chapters alternate between Tony Massarotti of the Boston Herald and John Harper of the New York Daily News. Their writing is clear, efficient, and totally engrossing. Each of the head-to-head meetings between the Red Sox and Yankees is examined in detail, culminating with a fantastic account of the American Leaugue Championship Series. Massarotti and Harper offer many fascinating and thoughtful insights, plus some looks behind the scenes and psychological portraits of a few of the players. Each series is covered by a chaper by each author, so the reader gets a very balanced perspective.
<br />
<br />The only thing I didn't care for was the way the typeface changes inexplicably. The first four chapters are in one font, then the fonts alternate every two chapters. The authors alternate every chapter, so the font changes don't reflect who is writing.</span>

                    <span>As a baseball fan, I was glued to this book and could not put it down, even though I knew who won in the end...  Tony Mazz and John Harper did a great job giving the reader a feel for what each city was experiencing during the 2004 season.  The behind the scenes stories and quotes added a critical element to the book and made the reading fun.  If you want some inside information on Pedro, A-Rod, Schilling and others, this book is for you.  The off-the-record quotes are stunning.  I really enjoyed this book... and I've read a lot of baseball books over the years.  This is one of the best.</span>

                    <span>The authors do a great job of revealing facts about the stars (Pedro, Nomar, A-Rod, Jeter, etc.) and how they fit (or did not fit) in with their teammates. In addition there are several great stories about the relationship with the athletes and the media (the Mussina and Mike Kay relationship). Even with all of the books I have read concerning this great season I had not seen any mention that the Sox were the first team since '29 to have 5 pitchers with 175+ innings for the season. Even more enlightening is the fact that once Arroyo was put into the rotation the starting 5 did not miss a start the remainder of the season.
<br />Truth be told I found it a book that I hated. I hated to put it down, and I hated to finish the last page. What a masterful job both authors have done. Too bad your highest rating was only 5 stars!</span>
