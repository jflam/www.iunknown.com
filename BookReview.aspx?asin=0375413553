                <span id="Label1">He spent his earliest years in post WWII&#8211;refugee camps. He came to America and grew up in Cleveland&#8212;stealing cars, rolling drunks, battling priests, nearly going to jail.  He became the screenwriter of the worldwide hits <i>Basic Instinct,</i> <i>Jagged Edge</i>, and <i>Flashdance. </i>He also wrote the legendary disasters <i>Showgirls</i> and <i>Jade</i>.<i> </i>The rebellion never ended, even as his films went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the box office and he became the most famous&#8212;or infamous&#8212;screenwriter in Hollywood.  <br><br>Joe Eszterhas is a complex and paradoxical figure: part outlaw and outsider combined with equal parts romantic and moralist. More than one person has called him &#8220;the devil.&#8221;  He has been referred to as &#8220;the most reviled man in America.&#8221;  But <i>Time</i> asked, &#8220;If Shakespeare were alive today, would his name be Joe Eszterhas?&#8221; and he was the first screenwriter picked as one of the movie industry&#8217;s 100 Most Powerful People. Although he is often accused of sexism and misogyny, his wife is his best friend and equal partner.  Considered an apostle of sex and violence, he is a churchgoer who believes in the power of prayer.  For many years the ultimate symbol of Hollywood excess, he has moved his family to Ohio and immersed himself in the midwestern lifestyle he so values. <br><br>Controversial, fearless, extremely talented, and totally unpredictable, the author of the best-selling <i>American Rhapsody</i> and National Book Award nominee <i>Charlie</i> S<i>impson&#8217;s Apocalypse </i>has surprised us yet again: he has written a memoir like no other.<br><br>On one level, <i>Hollywood Animal</i> is a shocking and often devastating look inside the movie business. It intimately explores the concept of fame and gives us a never-before-seen look at the famous. Eszterhas reveals the fights, the deals, the extortions, the backstabbing, and the sex, drugs, and rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll world that is Hollywood. <br><br>But there are many more levels to this extraordinary work.  It is the story of a street kid who survives a life filled with obstacles and pain . . .  a chronicle of a love affair that is sensual, glorious, and unending . . . an excruciatingly detailed look at a man facing down the greatest enemy he&#8217;s ever fought: the cancer inside him . . . and perhaps most important, <i>Hollywood Animal</i> is the heartbreaking story of a father and son that defines the concepts of love and betrayal.<br><br>This is a book that will shock you and make you laugh, anger you and move you to tears.  It is pure Joe Eszterhas&#8212;a raw, spine-chilling celebration of the human spirit.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. It is exceptionally well-written, it's funny, full of real life stuff, there's dialogue, there are visuals and anecdotes, there is LOVE, and the story of Joe Eszterhas's life should give inspiration not pause and vitriol. Frankly the level of enmity he elicits from people surprises me--of course many of them have not actually read the book, but that's almost besides the point. Why take the time to bash something you haven't read? It must be the wild money he made doing something he liked. Yet, there's something else, too, for Jerry Seinfeld--to name just one wealthy celebrity--with sixty cars in his airplane hangar makes much more money than J.E. yet doesn't provoke nearly the same level of bile. But Eszterhas's memoir is not just a E! True Hollywood story, it's an American story--he suffered inhuman privation as a small boy, saw things no child should see, came to America with nothing, lived poor and lonely for many years, and then made something of himself, raised a family, raised two! He found his heart, he found his life. The account of his mentally ill mother while he was a teenager is heartbreaking, as is his complicated relationship with his father. His whole life is on the page. This book is astonishing, honest, and unputdownable through and through.</span>

                    <span>Joe Eszterhas had it all, and more, and then blew it in a mysterious way. He found happiness with the woman he calls the sexiest on the planet (Naomi) and seems now to have retired from the business of screenwriting, a business which made him the highest paid screenwriter in the world--not once, but twice. He has left a legacy of interesting films, some good, some bad, but his memoir of writing them (and of his cathartic childhood, the son of Hungarian emigres) is just plain stupendous. It's one book that should have been two, or possibly three.<P>If you wrote, "Jagged Edge," "Flashdance," and or "Basic Instinct," to name only the hits, wouldn't you try to be more discreet about it? And the flops are a true laundry list of disaster. Only in Hollywood could such an auteur not only survive, but thrive. Very few screenwriters can boast of having sex with Sharon Stone, but Joe E. really rubs it in. For all that, his picture of Marty Ransohoff trying to destroy the life and career of Glenn Close is truly a memorable one. I guess Ransohoff won after all, because today one hears as little of Glenn Close as one does of Joe Eszterhas. If you like Hungarian sentiment, add a star. This is almost the Magyar version of Allen Ginsberg's "Kaddish."</span>

                    <span>This book is so much more than a Hollwyood tell-all. For one thing, it's just terrifically written-- not "terrifically written for a Hollywood hack," but "terrifically written," period. Eszterhas' style is succinct, surprising and vivid. Some think he's boasting that he admires Salinger, Faulkner and Hemingway-- but Eszterhas writes terrific prose. He seems to be speaking directly, but his details are surprising and vivid. I haven't read his journalism, but I bet his articles were great. <P>He alternates chapters about Hollywood (which are yes, fascinating and appalling) with chapters called "flashback" about his dirt-poor and often difficult childhood as Hungarian immigrant in Cleveland, and brief, italicized sections called "close-ups" that are portraits of unnamed Hollywood personalities (a poolcleaner, a vice president, an actress).<P>It's a long book, but because of the way it's structured, it's a quick read (well, it took me a few weeks to get through it, but each time I'd pick it up I'd read 60-70 pages before I could bear to put it down). Ezsterhas includes verbatim hatchet-letters he's written to agents and producers who've offended him-- including one hilarious letter to Mike Ovitz that sets off a feud that is a running theme throughout the book. And while Ezsterhas is articulate and hilarious, any reader-- including apparently Ezsterhas himself-- can see that he's also defensive, arrogant and difficult as hell.<P>You can't help liking him anyway.<P>Even as he recounts episodes of cheating on his first wife. Even as he recounts painful alienations from friends and family that he is at least partially responsible for. Even when he shows a less than forgiving heart not only to his father but, in one of the sections that shows him in a rather petty light, to old high school classmates (he carries a grudge after 20 years and seems to take some glee in it).<P>In part that's because Joe is onto himself. He's deeply critical of himself and the book is long and full enough to show him actually reversing earlier actions that might raise an eyebrow. His portraits are sometimes cruel, but he doesn't spare himself either-- and there's as much love as contempt. Well, nearly. You get the sense that even when he was most a "hollywood animal"-- the guy was FUN. With a kind of fairness and honesty that is rare, threatening and delightful.<P>In the end, the book praises "flyover" values (the states in between the coasts)--prayer, family, changing seasons, hard work. Joe moves to Ohio with his family, and stays.<P>I found it inspiring on a lot of levels. Yes, I'm in entertainment and picked up the book for the "hollywood gossip"-- and there's lots of it here. One of the most admirable qualities Joe has is his sheer output. He doesn't write a whole lot about his process (though there is one section detailing his work on one of the screenplays). But many times throughout the book he writes of pitching this or that spec-- here is a man who didn't wait for assignments to just get to work. <P>But the book is inspiring too as an American Dream/Nightmare story, complete with pitfalls and rewards. finally Joe battles with cancer-- and goes on to become an anti-smoking activist. Go, Joe!<P>I rarely want to read a memoir more than once. But this one is so rich and full I know I'll be referring to it often. A great treat, easy going down but good for you too. Bravo!</span>
