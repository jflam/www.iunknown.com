                <span id="Label1"><div>In the 1890s, a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press prepared a single sheet of typographic fundamentals intended as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book--the first edition of the <i>Manual of Style</i>, published in 1906. Now in its fifteenth edition, <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>--the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field--is more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before. <br><br>Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the <i>Manual</i>, Chicago's renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the <i>Manual</i>'s first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments.<br><br>Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date--from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the <i>Manual</i> now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources.<br><br>A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the <i>Manual</i> is now introduced by a descriptive heading.<br><br>Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have.<br><br>What's new in the Fifteenth Edition:<br><br>* Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice<br><br>* Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications<br><br>* Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i>)<br><br>* Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy<br><br>* Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources<br><br>* Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms<br><br>* Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference<br><br>* New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions<br><br>* New, expanded Web site with special tools and features for <i>Manual</i> users.

                    <span>Since 1906, the incomparable Chicago Manual has been the reference for writers, editors, copyeditors, publishers, and anyone else working with words. This historic new edition reflects the huge impact that computer technology has had on writing and publishing in recent decades. Novelties include a new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (A Dictionary of Modern American Usage), significant updates of copyright and permissions information, a new typographic presentation of American Sign Language, and an "almost new" chapter on mathematical copy, especially useful for electronic notations. From elements to proofreading marks to bias-free language, the manual provides directions, preferences, and even suggestions to the publishing and writing professional. Chapter 16, for example, concentrates on the two documentation systems preferred by Chicago: the notes and bibliographic system and the author-date system. Chapter 17 concentrates on the style and items of bibliographic entries, notes, and parenthetical citations, while also providing information on interview, audiovisual, manuscript, and legal citations. In comparison, Kate Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations is a useful resource for students, but it does not tackle publication and production issues. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, now in its fifth edition, also omits that information, while the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing, now in its second edition, is more directed to the author's needs. Meanwhile, Chicago encompasses a variety of fields and professions, making this significant revision an invaluable addition to all public, academic, and special libraries</span>

                    <span>The 15th edition of the Chicago Manual of Style is the first great reference text of the 21st century. Writers, researchers, indexers, proofreaders, editors, publishers, archivists, and educators will all find common ground in the collective wisdom found here. <P>Those already familiar with other incarnations of this guide will find that is still the authority on a multitude of topics. Most of my initial forays have been in the fifth chapter on grammar and usage, a chapter that exhaustively covers all the parts of speech and provides an excellent guide to word usage. A separate chapter covers all aspects of spelling and the distinctive treatment accorded many works, including compounds. If only the eighth chapter on terms and names could be passed into law, then maybe some of the nonsensical and false capitalization that is applied so rampantly to military, political, scientific, religious, geographic, and government names could be controlled. Still, this information provides those willing to take on the fight with plenty of ammo to do it unreservedly. Likewise, the sixth chapter on punctuation will vindicate language purists who insist (as I do) that we have to uphold our standards and rules for punctuation to avoid anarchy in our writing. <P>A chapter on numbers jumps right into the common fray about whether to use numerals or words, providing myriad examples and not displacing the use of common sense in certain instances. There are plenty of nitty-gritty details here: when to use the en dash with inclusive numbers; how to form plurals of numbers (no apostrophes need apply); what is the correct way to express currency. Chapter 14, which is one of the many sections that reflects how technology has advanced our options and choices regarding printed communications, is essential reading for those in the scientific and technology fields and offers details likely not found in other guides of this sort, such as listing fonts frequently used for mathematical symbols. <P>The chapters on references, documentation, manuscript preparation, and indexing will likely be touchstones for the next decade. In these chapters, as throughout this guide, the articulate discussions of principals, guidelines, and rules are augmented with examples. The examples reflect a wide mode of communications, from print to the Internet. A chapter on rights and permissions ought to be mandatory reading for all college students. It pretty much covers what is and is not legal without smothering one with legalese. <P>Appendix A: Design and Production is not for everyone, but I've always be intrigued by the whole process of making books from the first scribbled outline to the binding process, so I find it an interesting read. And if you need more information, a generous 15-page bibliography offers more resources. <P>This edition is easy to search and use. The typography is more modern and less tiring on the eyes though the light blue type can be hard to read. (Was this "nonrepro blue" used as a countermeasure against photocopying and scanning?) There is also a deft touch of humility here, as noted in the preface: "As always, most Chicago rules are guidelines not imperatives; where options are offered, the first is normally our preference."<P>As hard as it is to give up my well-thumbed, annotated, and tagged 14th edition of the Chicago Manual of Style, I know that is well past time I retired it to sit along side my 13th edition. Too much has changed since the 14th edition was published, but not much has escaped the radar of those responsible for crafting this superb reference.</span>

                    <span>The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) is without question my favorite style manual. The fact that this manual is one of the best of its kind does not seem to be in question for most people. What does seem to be in question is whether or not the CMOS is a fit for an individual's needs. What also seems to be in question is whether or not the 15th edition is an improvement from the 14th edition.<P>In terms of fit, I would say that the CMOS is probably a good fit for advanced writers, editors, and publishers; however, most of these advanced professionals already know this. College students might be better served by a style manual specific to their discipline - for example, The Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for English students, or the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA) for psychology students. Beginning students might also be better served by a general handbook (such as The Little, Brown Handbook or The Holt Handbook). For office workers, administrative assistants, and secretaries, a better fit might be "The Gregg Reference Manual," which has an emphasis on business correspondence. In each of these cases; however, the CMOS would be a useful backup reference.<P>In regard to the editions, my overall opinion is that the 15th edition is a significant improvement in content to the 14th, and well worth the purchase. The 13th edition was published in 1982, the 14th in 1993, and this 15th in 2003, so the CMOS is updated approximately every 10 years, which feels like a good revision pace to me. The content revisions are summarized on the back cover, and I'll list them at the end of this review.<P>In addition to content, the layout of the new edition is also revised. There is a bit of risk and daring in using a light blue font to distinguish examples within paragraphs, and in using a new font for numbering. The light blue text is a bit hard to read at times, but for the main, it seems to add clarity. The daring numbering font is a bit less clear than the last edition, but probably only a keen font connoisseur would even notice.<P>Content revisions:<P>- Updated Materials throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice<P>- New coverage of journals and electronic publications<P>- Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage)<P>- Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy<P>- Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources<P>- Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms<P>- New diagrams of the editing and production process4es for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions<P>- Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference<P>- New expanded Web site with special tools and features for Manual users - www.chicagomanualofstyle.org</span>
