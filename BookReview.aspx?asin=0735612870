                <span id="Label1">Aimed at all developers of all levels who want to program Web applications on Windows, <I>Microsoft ASP.NET Step by Step</I> provides a perfectly pitched introduction to the world of ASP.NET ideal for those with a little experience with the older ASP standard, but also suitable for the raw beginner.<p>This text sets a high standard for clarity and approachability, as well as excellent production value, with color printing (using blue) to highlight important points. The author assumes little programming knowledge on the part of the reader and the focus is on using ASP.NET with Visual Basic .NET (with a nod to C#) to create real Web applications, rather than getting bogged down in the richness of the new .NET platform. Essential material on the structure of ASP.NET pages (with a new emphasis on event handling), Web form control processing, and database basics (with ADO.NET) make for a worthwhile tour of the fundamentals you need to get productive with ASP.NET in a hurry. Sections on programming language basics will also bring the novice along. Throughout this text, the author provides highlighted sections of what's new and different in ASP.NET, which will bring readers who have used the older ASP version onboard with the new platform.<p>Later chapters show off more advanced techniques, like creating custom server-side controls and a good introduction to the much-touted Web services used with ASP.NET. While these sections add depth to a capable tutorial, it's the rock-solid tour of the basics that makes this book a winning choice for busy Web developers. Final sections on the new caching abilities in ASP.NET are a must for running your applications effectively, as is the discussion on the nuts and bolts of deploying Web applications.<p>A final section highlighting the changes between ASP and ASP.NET will help introduce you to the .NET version quickly, as will the bulleted lists of task-based tips at the end of the chapter. With its Step By Step series, Microsoft Press has apparently added a winning format to its catalog, and <I>ASP.NET Step by Step</I> shows off its advantages with a new emphasis on approachability, excellent use of color (all too rare in programming books), and an excellent set of examples and material on the most important aspects of the new ASP.NET. This title is quite simply one of the best available getting-started guides to Web development on .NET. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>ASP.NET is released and lots of book out there, promising to teach you this new technology. I personally chose MSDN series for .net framework. As they are the closest to this technology. <BR>ASP.net step by step is a really good book for beginners. Unlike some books out there it doesnt jump into bunch of code from the first couple of pages. The book is focused on teaching the fundamentals of ASP.net, there are quite good hints in the book that I found very useful. There are some downsides though.<P>If you have worked with ASP.net before (in beta days) and developed some small to medium applications with that, you will find the book very easy and I dont believe that it will be very useful for your needs. The other thing is the content and the chapters are very similiar to ASP.net quickstart tutorials that comes with .net framework.<BR>If you havent used asp.net before and you dont like to read tutorials from the computer screen, I say go for it, it s very good resource. Otherwise get a more advanced book that is covering more in depth.</span>

                    <span>This book is well written and supported by the author at the books site (see CD that comes with book for details) on various web sites(eg. ASPGNVS). It has a fairly even mix of code and explanation. Used in conjunction with "Visual Studio.Net ASP Quick Start Tutorial" (assuming you have them) you will be pleasantly surprised at how they compliment each other. This also assumes you prefer to use a methodical approach to learning ASP.NET. I can see why this is a Microsoft Press Book as they are generally better at getting the important details out. If you come away disappointed with this book then it could mean that you did not work hard enough to see what points the author was trying to convey in each chapter or you tried to consume the book in one or three days. My recommendation is to go with this book if you are new to ASP.NET (or the net framework) and you want to get up to speed on ASP.NET without getting overwhelmed.<BR>The reason why I did not rate it 5 Stars is because of a few typo's(corrections are available at the web site) and the example in chapter 11 regarding accessing and binding data with SQL could have had more information on using the UPDATE command by including it in code(perhaps as a scrolling text bar) rather than adding it in as a comment(Page 309 of the book). But perhaps the intention was to get the reader to apply their own skills at it and get them motivated to code rather than be led by the hand and remain oblivious to how it really works...</span>

                    <span>You would think that, with a title that includes the phrase 'step by step,' this book would help you learn ASP.NET in a step-wise approach including examples and maybe even exercises. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I found this book disappointing. <P>"ASP.NET Step by Step" contains articles that give a good theoretical understanding of ASP.NET. Had I been looking for this sort of information, I would have found this book more useful. <P>The content of the book is good. It just isn't right for me. <P>Recommend: Questionable<BR>Keep for Reference: No</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book with the hope of having a relatively straight forward book that would walk me through the creation of an ASP.net Application "Step-by-Step". I guess I had set my hopes too high. I am already 300 pages into the book and I have only encountered one really useful example (in my opininon). <BR>This book does contain some very useful information, but it should not have been called a "Step-By-Step" book. <P>Just a side note: C# is mentioned occasionally but this book is mainly discusses VB.net.</span>
