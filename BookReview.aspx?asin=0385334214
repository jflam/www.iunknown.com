                <span id="Label1">For any parent who feels his/her child has exceptional talent but fears pushing them too hard, Nickelodeon and NBC television personality and Olympic champion Summer Sanders has written this warm, accessible book guiding parents through the agony and joy of raising a gifted child, as someone who was once a budding champion herself.<P>Parents may well remember Summer Sanders as the golden-haired swimmer who stole the hearts of the world at the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona, winning four medals. Kids definitely know Summer Sanders as the host of Nickelodeon's wildly popular program <i>Figure It Out!</i> or as co-host of NBC-TV's <i>NBA Inside Stuff.</i> Helping parents find the perfect balance of motivation and active interest to help their gifted child achieve his or her very best, Sanders tells parents what works and what doesn't, using her own upbringing, as well as those of other world-class athletes like Dan Jansen, Bonnie Blair, Dot Richardson, and Debi Thomas, as reference.<P>Insisting above all that the one thing happy, successful young athletes have in common is that they have fun participating in their sport, Sanders shows that good parenting can be the difference in making a gifted child's experience positive and empowering. With more children than ever before entering competitive sports, this relevant and timely book from an athlete who's been to the top--and knows what it took to get there--makes an important addition to every concerned parent's library.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to preview a few chapters of the book before I gave it to my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. Needless to say, I read it from cover to cover. Summer Sanders writes, in plain English, about her parents' roll in her successful swimming career. This book should be required reading for any parent who has a child who participates in sports!</span>

                    <span>In Summer Sander's book Champions are Raised, not Born she talks about her life and how her parents affected it. Summer believed that the measure of a true champion I show well they take a defeat and Summer was about to take them in stride. Summer believed that her four Olympic medals were not just from her hard work but from the support of her parents and coaches also. Her childhood wasn't easy with the divorce of her parents but no matter whose house she was at she had both of their support. In her childhood swimming was just something she did to make friends and take up time but it ended up changing her whole life.<BR>	In this book Summer gives specific examples of how her parents helped her to be successful. What's good about this book it that Summer also talks about how her life was like other Olympians. She talks bout how her life was different or similar to Dot Richardson, Karch Kiraly, and Bonnie Blair. It makes the readers realize that Olympic athletes' childhoods are not very different from the average persons. Summer proves that everyone can become an Olympic athlete you don't have to come from the perfect family.<BR>	Another thing that was good about the book was that Summer didn't just talk about the good times but also the bad ones. She didn't give the impression that her life easy perfect because the struggles made her stronger. No on e can live the perfect life because no matter how close they still have problems. Summer talks about the divorce of her parents as well as losses in major swim meets. There are the good times in her life but these are not the only tings that have made her who she is today.</span>

                    <span>As a former swimmer and as a parent of 3 age-groups swimmers I figured this book would provide some insight into success. However, i didn't anticipate how much insight I would take away from it. It is truly amazing how much Ms. Sanders had been able to accomplish in her life and it is refreshing to see that someone so young had everything in the proper perspective. <P>Hats off to her parents for raising and supporting (without pushing) Summer to accomplish all that she set out to do. I see the parents on the side of the pool who constantly push their kids so much so that they ultimately push them totally out of the pool all together. This is a fantastic how-to book for parents, regardless of what their kids are into.</span>

                    <span>While not the most organized book ever written, Summer Sander's discussion is insightful and balanced. There are no "a-ha" moments that will blow you away, but a whole bunch of minor insights that add up to a lot. Great reading for any parent of an athlete, from a star to an also-ran.</span>
