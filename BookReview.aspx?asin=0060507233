                    <span>In his first book BUDDHISM PLAIN AND SIMPLE, there are a few instances where a snobbish ego or holier-than-thou attitude creep through.
<br />
<br />That's forgivable considering that sort of attitude seems to run rampant among Zen folks - - and it is an amazing book.
<br />
<br />His new book however.  The snobbish ego shines very bright.  Chapter after chapter of the same repetitive things over and over and over  . . . . aahhggg!
<br />
<br />This book may have been a seriously great book if it had a heavy editorial hand.  I have a feeling the editor was an old buddy who didn't want to hurt Mr. Hagens pride.  I'm no english expert, though I did have a class in high school but the run on sentences and excessive commas, the rewording that is rephrasing or paraphrasing, if you will (and parentheses) REALLY GETS ANNOYING - very quickly.  See.
<br />
<br />I could have had this book down to a 100 pages with better english in a few days, and I'm not even a college grad.  It would've been a much smoother read.  Easier to understand and probably sold more copies.
<br />
<br />Love the first one, Steve.  Hated the second.  Good luck with the the third!</span>

                    <span>Steve hagen like his teacher Dainin Katigiri, has a knack of describing the Buddhist teachings in simple straighfoward terms. Just be here, just be "now". The past and the furture are just delusion. Its always "Now". As hagen says, if we could just see this all pervading truth thats right infront of our face, we would be enlightened on the spot (that is, we would realise we are, and always have been, enlightened). And no longer reach for things "out there" that lead to turmoil in the first place. Nobody points this out better than Mr. Hagen. This book is completely on par with and adds to his first book. This book is a must for anyone (in my opinion). Especially for those who just want to "wake up", and live in a world with equality and compasion for every living being. 
<br />
<br />Pretty sure I'm not the first to ever notice the people with 'noble' egos, who like to smother and numb themselves with spiritual materialism do not seem to take to well to these books (see previous reviews). Ironically these are the ones who need it most. This book isnt to confirm your previous beliefs, but rather to free you from the burden that accompanies them. Contrary to some of the things previously said. This is a great book, but one needs and open mind before reading something as profound yet sublte as this. So dont pass this one up because some people find it easier to pigeon-hole things than to give them a fair unbiased chance. I would recommend this to beginner, intermediate, advanced or whatever... one would consider themselves on the spiritual path. After all, we are all just here in the...

                    <span>Will turn off all but the most credulous. Does not seem to be able to universal philosophical insights from specifically Buddhist teachings, indicating shallow knowledge of Western tradition he criticizes. Talks down to readers. Presents himself has having personal authority. Presents himself as enlightened, as if he has transcended the human condition. Does not acknowledge his own faults, shortcomings, weanesses, or difficulties. Idealizes the teachings he has received as unique and superior to all others, but does not seem aware of his own motives for buying in. As the Publisher's Weekly review above states, "abstract and didactic." Critical readers willl revolt. There is better material out there, e.g. Bhante Gunaratana's Mindfulness In Plain English. Asians who were born into this seem to be more realistic about what this religion can and can't do for you. </span>

                    <span>The idea that we can somehow free ourselves from conceptual distortion is, when you really think about it, rather absurd. Language fragments the world before we even begin to see, so, of course, seeing an unmediated reality is impossible. Even if this weren't true, there's no reason to believe witnessing an unmediated reality is some sort of panacea. And Hagen really never offers us arguments why "seeing" will fix all of our problems.
<br /> 
<br /> Also, "seeing" seems to take a lot of thinking. The idea that we are all one, that the self is an illusion, that all is connected in an endless flux is very counter-intuitive. I find myself thinking a great deal in order to "see", which, according to Hagen and the Zen tradition, I shouldn't be. I should only be concentrating on the moment until, finally, one day, i can see and act as a part of the "whole". I find it very hard to believe that concentrating on my breath and any other insignificant thing I might be doing at the time will somehow evolve into my having such a radical insight, into "awakening". 
<br /> 
<br /> I get the feeling I'm not the one who needs to wake up.

                    <span>In this book, Steve hammers chapter after chapter about what being AWAKE really is.  He goes into depth of how we live in dukka or the world of delusion and gives chapter after chapter of the various ways we stay asleep and live in dukka.  Many practictioners decieve themselves about what being Awake is.  Steve  hammers away at the delusions, because they are so subtle and hard to realize...As far as compassion is concerned, real compassion comes when one becomes truly Awake, otherwise it is still a sophisticated form of delusion.  This book may not be suitable for the beginer, but it is a must for practictioners that truly desire to WAKE UP.</span>
