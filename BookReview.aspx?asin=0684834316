                <span id="Label1"><P> For the first time in paperback, international expert and consultant David Maister offers a brilliant and accessible guide to every management issue at play in professional firms. <P> Professional firms differ from other business enterprises in two distinct ways: first, they provide highly customized services and thus cannot apply many of the management principles developed for product-based industries. Second, professional services are highly personalized, involving the skills of individuals. Such firms must therefore compete not only for clients but also for talented professionals. <P> Drawing on more than ten years of research and consulting to these unique and creative companies, David Maister explores issues ranging from marketing and business development to multinational strategies, human resources policies to profit improvement, strategic planning to effective leadership. While these issues can be complex. Maister simplifies them by recognizing that "every professional service firm in the world, regardless of size, specific profession, or country of operation, has the same mission statement: outstanding service to clients, satisfying careers for its people, and financial success for its owners."</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the top book on the subject, by the one author who specializes only in the niche of Professional Services Firms.  There are numerous tactics in the book for improving one's practice, but it is a couple theoretical points that have the most value.
<br />
<br />First, the book describes the pyramid nature of the professional services firm, describing how the profitability of a firm is derived.  (A partner bills out the pyramid below him)  Therefore, the two drivers for profitability of a partner are how much he can bill his (or her) people out for, and how big the pyramid beneath her (or him) is.  There are many tactical points presented for improving these, but it really helps focus the energy of the partner to think about the two main drivers.  What about growth?  In and of itself, adding partners with their own pyramids will not help the profitability of other partners.
<br />
<br />What good is growth, then, if it doesn't drive profitability?  Growth is needed to encourage top employees to stay with the firm.  A firm that is growing 10% a year has many more opportunities than one growing 5% a year.  This counterintuitive idea (growth is more important for career advancement than size) is a great cue for picking the right place to work.  If the growth stops, it is time to move on.
<br />
<br />The book is near timeless - perhaps the only way time has passed it by is in the ownership structure of professional services firms.  At this point in time, many (most?) top consulting and financial services firms are public.  Does this change the assumption that growth no longer benefits the shareholders?
<br />
<br />Any employee or leader of a professional services firm is well advised to read it!</span>

                    <span>My edition is a 1993 hardback and the price is multiples of what you can buy it for today here online and in paperback.  Maister has also written several books since this one along topics related to managing the people side of the business.
<br />
<br />The reason to buy this book is to see a more complete picture of managing the medium to large professional firm.
<br />
<br />There are other, perhaps more recent, books that provide deeper and more targeted coverage of the MARKETING of professional service firms, but this book also covers: how to measure and deliver quality service; how to motivate, retain, compensate, and promote your professional assets that walk out the door each evening; and even such topics as to how to "split the pie."
<br />
<br />Maister follows the Harvard style of management books: lots of detailed text (375 pages), a few 2x2 matrices, a fair amount of original research based on management surveys of professional service firms.
<br />
<br />I'm sure most larger firms already have this book, but younger firms may want add this book to their collection as well.

                    <span>Many managers in IT professional services do not recognize the unique business model that we share.  They think that Service Delivery is all about matching customer projects with the right talent.  Maister reaches way beyond this short-sighted approach and shows critical practice development, relationship management, governance and business development techniques. Mastery of these techniques is necessary to build a healthy practice with long-term viability.</span>

                    <span>David Maister's book is a strong addition to the library of anyone involves in the professinal service industry.  These include everything from accounting to architecture to law.  Many of the principles also apply to other fields such as Medicine and Physiotherapy.<p>The book outlines the corporate culture and makeup that allow these type of firms to succeed.  It also has well defined plans on how to develop and train professionals in a manner which respects their personal autonomy.  <p>The book does a good job of covering both the theoretical and the concrete aspects of firm development.  <p>I very much enjoyed reading the book and came away with new ideas and approaches to management within this area.</span>
