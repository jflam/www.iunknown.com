                    <span>I just finished my first photo restoring project and am really impressed with the final result. I just followed the directions step by step and felt that if a klutz like me could do it, anyone should be able to.<P>I'm anxiously looking forward to doing some more pictures when time allows. As a matter of fact, others have asked me to do some of their personal family photos.<P>I recommend this book to anyone interested in photo restoring.</span>

                    <span>When I pointed to this site to recommend this book to a friend, I was stunned to see a review of 1 star. Even though I definitely consider myself a novice as well, especially in regard to digital photography, I had no problem learning from this book and following the examples. <P>This book was very helpful in doing what it set out to do - teach photo retouching and restoration. I was very confident in recommending it. Kudos!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book thinking that it would be a good guide and on first reading it it seem to be just that--however when I started to try out some of the examples on my computer, they didn't work. Steps were omitted and since I am a novice I need every step outlined which is what I expect from a "dummies" book. Very disappointing.</span>
