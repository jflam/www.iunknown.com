                    <span>Biddulph is brilliant in this book...good tips, very insightful, written with compassion and in simple English...as the father of a teenage son I appreciate a clear roadmap like this..Other books I've found great lately on the subject of raising boys include: Real Boys (Pollack), about the myths of boys and how to overcome them; Raising a Son, which also has great basic advice, and some very insightful chapters in the PC Dads Guide to Becoming a Computer Smart Parent (Ivey), which talks about raising a son in the computer age.</span>

                    <span>I LOVED this book so much that I found myself quoting from it to my friends and family. Raising Boys is packed with information that is easy and fun to read. Through the entire book, I could identify traits that not only opened my eyes to behavior from my own two sons and other males in my life (their friends, my brothers, etc.), but has shown me ways to handle or respond to both their positive and negative behavior! Steven Biddulph also explains the biological differences between boys and girls without being sexist!<P>I recommend this information packed and yet humorous book to anyone who has a boy or knows a boy of any age. This should be required reading for all teachers!<P>This is a book that I find myself picking up over and over again to reinforce the information I have learned. It's really made a difference in my understanding of the male species, and how I interact with them.</span>

                    <span>This book was written after Steve Biddulph's first book "Manhood" which was truly groundbreaking. If one grows up in the masculine societies of Australia, US, Britian, Scandinavia etc then these books are invaluable. Problem of course being that it's hard sometimes to get these masculine men to read books like "Manhood" as they are very confronting and avoiding emotions is what macho societies are all about! This book is great as it's aimed at parents and others raising boys and the differences between little girls and little boys. Definately a book that if bought and followed by parents would be amazing for future generations. It hasn't got the detail of some of his other books though.</span>

                    <span>Even if you are a man, this book is a MUST read for anyone who has a boy or works with boys (teachers, coaches, etc). My husband and I read this in anticipation of the birth of our boy (I am 6 months pregnant) and we can't stop discussing what we've learned! <P>Biddulph takes you through the key stages in a boy's development, explaining in an easy to read format what can be done to assist boys in learning and developing into healthy, happy people. He explains the difference between what girls need and what boys need and how to help boys reach their potential.<P>After you read this, you will be like us - you will be buying this for everyone you know who is around boys! The best I've read on the subject. Can't wait to read his other books...</span>

                    <span>am very impressed. The format of this book is pleasing to read. The main points will be easy to reference as my boy grows. Scientific facts are used to make major points on how moms and dads should approach their boys at different ages. The author has definite opinions on how to raise a wonderful boy but doesn't shove them down your throat. His views are refreshing and make a lot of sense to me. I think this is a must-have book for parents.</span>
