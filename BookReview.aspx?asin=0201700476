                    <span>.<BR>Ken's latest Guru's Guide is an important book for SQL Server Professionals who build or manage SQL Server systems. <P>SQL Server is tightly integrated with Windows, so understanding how SQL Server uses Windows services is essential to managing it effectively. This book covers the important Windows / SQL Server topics in significant depth, exploring each one from both a pure Windows perspective and then how it relates to SQL Server. <P>The first half of the book is dedicated to covering technical Windows concepts such as I/O, Memory, Thread scheduling, Synchronisation & Sockets as well as covering how SQL Server uses each of these. The second half of the book explores various SQL Server features in the depth you'd expect one of Ken's Guru's Guides.<P>This is not a beginners' book. It will feel at home on your shelf if you're reading books such as "Inside SQL Server" (another excellent SQL book) or "Inside Windows", both MS Press. These are all technically deep references for SQL people which offer real answers to the problems & issues we face in working with SQL Server & Windows. Many other books simply skim the edges of the technical topics that this book covers in depth.<P>If you're trying to learn how to write simple SQL statements, this is not the book for you. If you need or want to understand how SQL Server works inside & interoperates with the Windows environment, this is an excellent guide & reference.</span>

                    <span>Every time Ken comes out with a new Guru's Guide, I'm blown away with the new things I learn just from skimming it on the first day. And what great resources for the long haul.<P>If you're doing anything extensive or elaborate with SQL Server, this and Kalen Delaney's Inside SQL Server 2000 could be the only books on your bookshelf.<P>If, however, you're still learning why you should avoid SELECT *, there are probably better titles aimed at you.<P>Right now, this is the best book on my shelf, bar none... and it has plenty of dog-eared pages. My co-workers will tell you the same thing. [...]<P>Keep up the good work. </span>

                    <span>I have been working RDBMS for more than 10 years and with SQL Server for more than 5 years. I have not seen a book in SQL server which explains exactly how internals of SQL Server is implemented. There are lots of SQL books out there which are nothing but the repeat of SQL books online. This books stand out from the crowd. First 400 pages of the book talks about the windows OS, which crucial to understand SQL Server internals since the database engine lot of OS features. I like this author's straightforward style and the sample programs are excellent in demonstrating the concepts. I would strongly recommend this book for anybody interested in understanding SQL Server beyond its syntax. I wish I had an opportunity to study this kind of book few years back.</span>

                    <span>(...)This book is a large font book with very general information and the insightful parts or the massive amounts of code [...]is not usable, for the most part, on a production system. The vb.net code taking up a full chapter on notification services for example is a take of from the visual studio.net help files except the example code is not usable. Why the author chose his audience would better learn from something that can't be used is beyond me. The first chapter is nothing but the table of contents usually found in most books before chapter one. There is MASSIVE amounts of duplication from the first two books in here. If you don't mind having hundreds of pages of duplication from the first two books, it may be an ok book for you to learn basic concepts from but it doesn't teach any real world practices. Not in the sense of useful information for a developer working in SQL on production code. There are many other titles that don't spend 4 pages at the beginning of each chapter espousing the author's virtues and simple reasons for writing it this way or that. Each chapter being different from the other. One chapter will tell you that you must learn and just giving examples is a bad idea, other chapters will tell you that examples of usage are the way to go. The author is easily swayed in his ideology by those of persuasive pennings, as is evidenced by his changes in philosphy over the three books and the flip flop and contrary statements throughout the book anyone who reads closely will see time after time. <P>Also some of the code loads at boot and spybot search and destroy picks up it immediately. I'm not sure why sequin needs a memory resident piece running at all times using up valuable resources. That is not acceptable from book code, esp. a query analyzer of dubious worth. The other code in this book is looked upon suspiciously by award winning security software. Anytime I find a macro or code written in this manner I'm very leary of allowing it to run simply because it may not be written well enough not to accidently trash my system. I'm not saying any intentional malicious code is on this CD. Not at all, just not written well enough to pass muster with good security products. <BR> <BR>thank you. </span>
