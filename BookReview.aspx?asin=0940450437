                    <span>Abraham Lincoln was a great President.  Where he falls on your list is a private judgment, but most put him at or near the top.  It is true that there is a more vocal element of detractors nowadays, but those voices tend to also advocate versions of America that most of us would not recognize nor care to legitimate.  This volume begins with Lincoln as a young man of twenty-three beginning political career.  
<br />
<br />The letters are quite interesting and cover a range of topics.  It is interesting to note his private correspondence on various topics such as the Mexican War and compare those notes to his public speeches.  While he is clearly a politician and aware of the need to garner votes, he uses his powerful intellect to find the line that will hold to his principles and still be convincing to the electorate.
<br />
<br />This volume culminates with the seven famed Lincoln - Douglas debates when those two candidates contended for a seat in the Senate representing Illinois.  Remember, this was before Senators were directly elected.  These were debates to win popular support, but also to show political viability so when the public selected the legislature, the legislature would choose the preferred candidate for the Senate.  These debates received national attention, which pleased both candidates.  The format was this: first speaker for one hour, response by the second speaker for an hour and a half, the first speaker responds for a half hour.  They alternated who spoke first with each debate.  They went after each other directly with challenges, personal attacks, interruptions, and appeals to the crowd.  Can you imagine any of our candidates even attempting such a risky format nowadays?
<br />
<br />As I read the debates, Douglas seems to be a panderer and clearly supporting slavery in a way that seems odd for someone seeking office in Illinois.  However, he was really positioning himself for the Presidency.  Stephen Douglas did become Senator while Lincoln did not.  However, two years later, Douglas did not get nominated as a candidate for President and Lincoln won the Presidency.  
<br />
<br />This great volume has a chronology of Lincoln's life and notes on the texts and an index.</span>

                    <span>I bought both volumns of this over the summer.  I first bought Libary of America's publication of Jefferson which is a must have.  Then Franklin.  Those two are extremely good and I highly recommend them to anyone  interested in raw historical material.<p>Now as for the volumes on Lincoln,  don't get me wrong; they are also extremely good.  As with all of these  books, it is a rewarding reading experience to peruse collections of  un-edited letters and speeches in their chronological order.<p>These  volumes have every conceivable bit of correspondence imaginable.  Lincoln  apparently preferred the short letter, as there are several single  paragraph letters to generals on the field and the like.  He also wrote  with simplicity and suprising bluntness.  Volume 1 has a number of early  speeches and famous debates which give you a sense of the lawyer turned  politician.  These of course are very lengthy.  But also in volumes 1 and 2  there are numerous short letters which include urgent notes to General  McClellan and others that would have made me quit the post had I been the  receiver!  In contrast there are letters revealing Lincolns more sensitive  personal side.<p>I'm rating Lincoln's volumes just behind those of  Jefferson and Franklin because there are no references detailing the  circumstances for each writing.  I felt a little lost not knowing what the  impetus was behind the letters and correspondence.  This is a departure  from the Jefferson and Franklin books, which provide very detailed notes.   <p>Finally I should say that Library of America's books are of very high  quality for more than their authorship and reading content.  All are bound  nicely and printed on bible paper-like acid free paper.  They are of  exceptional quality just as books.  I would say they are the best quality  available.<p>Additionally, Library of America is a non-profit organization  with the aim of distributing the work of America's essential writers  without commercial gain.</span>
