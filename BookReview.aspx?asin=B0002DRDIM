                    <span>I have been an Eagles fan since I was 6 years old in 1963.  There was a lot to like but a lot got left out.  I particularly was disappointed by the amount of the DVDs that consisted of talking heads, particularly when many of those heads had not worn an Eagles helmet -  who buys this to hear Philadelphia media people?  I would have preferred much more game action and much more on Eagles personalities.  Tim Rossovich, Bill Bradley, Bill Bergey, Tom Dempsey, Harold Jackson, Irving Fryar - never mentioned and barely seen.  Herschel Walker's 90/90/90 season - unmentioned but showing those three plays would have taken only about 30 seconds.  Too much of DVD 2 is just about the Vet and people who live in South Philly.  That's a little tangential to fill up half the set.  On the plus side, they do show due respect to Randall's greatest plays, to the Fog Bowl and to the incredible 1991 defense, so there are definitely some choice moments here.  On to the Super Bowl in Detroit next year and may the Eagles win it all!  I look forward to all Eagles DVD's and may they all get better and better!</span>

                    <span>Cheers to NFL Films for these comprehensive team dvds. But why the Eagles??? You could add in the Flyers and Phillies and still not have enough highlights to warrant a comprehensive video. Certainly there are many NFL teams that could have been looked at in terms of a dvd retrospective. I'm guessing this includes 45 minutes of Terrel Owens dancing like a fool. </span>

                    <span>What a fantastic DVD!! For a lifelong Eagles fan, it's a dream come true to be able to see this fantastic display of the mighty Eagles teams through the years. From the Bowl winning teams in the seventies right through to the unbeatable team of the present-containing such greats as Donovan McNabb, Brian Dawkins, Terrell Owens, Todd Pinkston and Brian Westbrook. These guys know how to get stuff done. They're almost guarenteed a playoff place this year, and they've only played eleven. Take note you crazy Baseball fans. This is how you play a real sport.
<br /> The thrill of pulling off A huge deep pass play in your new kicks to win the superbowl, burning a DB for an 80-yard reception, finding the gap for 40 rushing yards, nailing your kick from 50+ yards, hitting the hurdle and Mike Vick spin move again and again, so the opponents can't get near you and you run it in for 60+ points. That feeling cannot be beaten. Trust me. I'm an Eagles fan.-Plus, you get to see all the cowboys QB's getting their heads mashed. What a rush, foo!</span>

                    <span>I love this DVD set its worth every penny, and I have shared it with friends. I am actually able to re-watch sections because I found it so fascinating. As a history buff and a huge Eagles fan, this was so exciting to me, and it did not disappoint. For those who like the good old days, the history of the team is there. For younger people like me, its a way of discovering your roots. And for current fans, its a way to live some of our favorite plays such as 4th and 26. I also enjoyed some of the special features. I'd like to be able to show my kids the footage of the vet implosion someday, for example. Highly recommended for purchase for the true fan. If you are a casual fan, you might not like it to purchase, but at the price, rent it and decide!</span>

                    <span>    This video provides the most comprehensive, well articulated history of the "birds" ever assembled.  The film footage, interviews and insights combine to provide the viewer with non-stop joy regarding our local franchise.
<br />    I am a lifelong resident of the Philadelphia area, a "dyed-in-the-green-wool EAGLES fan and a believer in the fact that "good things come to those who wait".  This DVD is a "must own" for any true EAGLES fan.  </span>
