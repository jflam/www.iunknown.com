                    <span>This was one of the most enjoyable books I have read in awhile, even if it was light in the philosophy context in certain chapters.  I particularly enjoyed the analysis of what it means to be a fan of a losing team.  As a Cubs fan, I can sympathize with that. The most particularly interesting chapter to me was the chapter on the philosophical aspect of the intentional walk. I would highly recommend this book to true baseball fans. </span>

                    <span>Compiled and edited by Eric Bronson, and enhanced with an informative Foreword by Bill Littlefield, Baseball And Philosophy: Thinking Outside The Batter's Box is an impressive, 352-page anthology of essays contributed by 31 contributors exploring some of the deeper questions and lessons baseball has to offer with respect to the American identity and universal human fulfillment. Addressing such unique considerations as whether or not the Intentional Walk is unethical; can superstition make a player better; do Cubs fans teach us about religious faith; does chance decide who wins the World Series; why baseball is the only American industry exempt from federal anti-trust laws; what the U.S. Supreme Court could learn from umpiring ball games; and a great deal more. Baseball And Philosophy is uniquely and enthusiastically recommended to the attention of two seemingly diverse readerships: baseball enthusiasts and philosophy students.</span>

                    <span>There is something more to baseball than athletes playing ball.  That something explains the lingering nostalgia of Brooklyn Dodger Fans and the fanatical loyalty of Chicago Cubs fans.  Baseball and Philosophy finally explains why our national game of summer grips our hearts and minds.<p>The titles of the chapters in Baseball and Philosophy immediately compel us to read.  The intros to the chapters add the humor and drama that draw us to baseball.  But it is the essays themselves that speak to our hearts and give voice to our passion.<p>Some of the chapters deal with today's and yesterday's stars.  The authors cite Toqueville and Pascal to explain some of our hero worship in the face of adversity, whether it's putting up with the boisterous shinanigans of Reggie or the corked bat contrition of Sosa. We learn how baseball thrives in a Japanese culture of team harmony and in an American culture of frontier-blazing individualism. Legal scholars explain the unique position of the baseball industry in American courts.  Ethicists and statisticians offer reasons for our nitpicking love of detail.<p>So why do we love baseball?  Why do we forgive our heroes the sins of cheating, the anti-social behavior, even the crimes of racism? There is a reason for our madness. Kant, Socrates, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill give cause for our fanaticism.<p>Always humorous, always informative, sometimes controversial, the modern day philosophers who contributed to this book speak for all of us who love the game despite our best intentions.  It's a great read!</span>
