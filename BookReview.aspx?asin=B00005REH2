                    <span>Jim Collins operates a management research laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. Together with Jerry I. Porras he wrote the bestseller 'Built to Last' (1994), which he later followed-up with super-bestseller 'Good to Great' (2001). This article was published in the July-August 1999 issue of the Harvard Business Review.<p>Most executives have a big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG). So what is a BHAG? It has a long time frame (10-30 years or more); it is clear, compelling, and easy to grasp; and it connexts to the core values and purpose of the organization. In order to reach their BHAGs, executives write vision statements, deliver speeches, launch change initiatives, formalize rules and checklists, etc. But most executives never realize their ambitious dreams. However, the author believes that catalytic mechanisms can help organizations turn goals into results. "Catalytic mechanisms are the crucial link between objectives and performance; galvanizing, non-bureaucratic means to turn one into the other." Catalytic mechanisms share five distinct characteristics: 1. It produces the desired results in unpredictable ways; 2. it distributes power for the benefit of the overall system; 3. it has teeth; 4. it ejects viruses; and 5. it produces an ongoing effect. This sounds simple, but it is not. Collins provides us with some principles that can support the process of building catalytic mechanisms. But be aware, developing a set of catalytic mechanisms is an ongoing process, an ongoing discipline, and a habit of mind and action. "BHAG are a company wildest dreams. Catalytic mechanisms are their foundations. Build them both."<p>Yes, a nice article based on the author's book 'Built to Last' (1994). Collins' advice sounds very simple, but it is not that simple is practice. Just look around you, how many times have we seen great leaders and executives fail in reaching their dreams. However, the article makes us think about ways, disciplines and methods to reach those goals and dreams. The author uses examples and exhibits to explain his points. I also recommend James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras' Harvard Business Review-article 'Building Your Company's Vision' (1996) and James Collins' book 'Good to Great' (2001).</span>
