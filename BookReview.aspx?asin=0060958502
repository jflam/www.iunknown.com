                <span id="Label1"><p>This dazzling companion volume to one the most important series in PBS history tells the compelling story of the theory of evolution -- from Darwin to twenty-first-century science.</p><p>Charles Darwin's <em>The Origin of Species</em> was breathtaking, beautifully written, staunchly defended, defiantly radical. Yet it emerged long before paleontologists and geologists worked out the chronology of life on Earth, long before biologists uncovered the molecules that underlie heredity and natural selection. Not until the late twentieth century was the true scope of its power revealed.</p><p>This remarkable new book, featuring more than 150 color illustrations, presents a rich and up-to-date view of evolution that explores the far-reaching implications of Darwin's theory and emphasizes the power, significance, and relevance of evolution to our lives today. After all, we ourselves are the product of evolution, and we can tackle many of our gravest challenges -- from the lethal resurgence of antibiotic-resistant diseases to the wave of extinctions that looms before us -- with a sound understanding of the science. It can help us see our lives in connection to everything that has come before and to every form of life on Earth today.</p><p>Filled with rich narrative, award-winning science writing, and the most up-to-date information on topics ranging from Darwinian medicine and sexual selection to the origins of language, evolutionary psychology, and the controversies surrounding creationism, <em>Evolution</em> tells in riveting detail the story of a remarkable scientific journey, from the emergence to the triumph of an idea.</p></span>

                    <span>Carl Zimmer has done a masterful job of presenting the modern synthesis of Evolutionary Theory. The format is accessible and nonconfrontational. The examples are quite lucid and prolific. I especially appreciate the extensive historical context of the rise of Evolutionary Theory and the difficulties facing it.<P>....<P>As a scientist I can say that both the presentation of the theory and its religious implications are fair and balanced. The author has no need for dishonest rhetoric, he strives for historical accuracy, and ultimately leaves the theistic interpretations for the reader.<P>If you are looking for a well-written introduction to evolution, look no further. This book will serve you well. I would also recommend this book to those looking to increase their understanding of Evolution.<P>You might notice that this book draws comments that appear to be completely polarized. Bottom line-- read it for yourself. Draw your own conclusions.</span>

                    <span>This is the companion volume to the seven part PBS series about evolution. It presents an excellent overview of the rise of evolutionary thought, and how evolution was at first attacked by early conservative scientists in Darwins' day, up to our own time when evolution is accepted by mainstream science, moving beyond a mere theory. Carl Zimmer along the way explains how evolution came to be and the mechanisms it uses, and he gives us many examples. Topics include the dawn of life, the age of microbes, mutation, genetics, disease, the evolution of sex, coevolution, extinctions, the Cambrian explosion of species, geology, fossils, evolution in action today, our own primate evolution, and more. <P>As a scientist myself I am already familiar with the tenants of evolution, still I found this volume fascinating with it's many examples and stories. The life of Charles Darwin is covered in detail, his voyage in the Beagle is sketched, and his personal life as well, as he struggled with his ideas of evolution in an oftentimes hostile social climate. <P>The final chapter of this book illuminates the battle the creationists today are waging against the 'fact' of evolution. As Zimmer points out their latest effort centers around an idea called Intelligent Design. The claim here is that there is an irreducible complexity to some of the molecular mechanisms of life. Carl Zimmer examines this idea over several pages and finds nothing of substance. The creationists will do nearly anything to discredit evolution, but as Zimmer points out several times, science proceeds by someone first forming a hypothesis and this hypothesis has to stand up against evidence, for and against, surviving or not on the basis of this evidence and always being subject to peer review. The theory of evolution has survived this for over 150 years in great shape, and as Zimmer says here it is accepted as fact by the vast majority of scientists, the evidence is indisputable. <P>Carl Sagan once said that we are made of "Star stuff", and Carl Zimmer here documents, with passion, how we have arisen from simple atoms and molecules over billions of years, a beautiful story indeed.</span>

                    <span>what an experience... This book has open my mind up to a new world. I feel that I have a much greater knowledge and appreciation of the origins of life and the world around me.<BR> This book is designed for beginners who are new to evolution and the origins of life on earth.<BR> <BR> the book walks you through fascinating subjects that you could not think of in your wildest dreams: example, did you know that whales and dolphins were once land mammals. Even Today whales still have remants such as a hip bone and tiny hind legs only a few inches long.<BR> This book is long and very time consuming but if you have a alot of time and a GREAT thrust for knowledge this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>Wow, I have to say this is the first book I read of Carl Zimmer, he really impress me. The book is graphically wonderful, it has lots of pictures and some sketches that support the text. You can almost read it as a textbook, but this one is much more interesting. The way Zimmer states the plot (which of course is history, not fiction) and how he explains the current states of affairs (considering herbicides, plaguicides, genetic modified food, etc.) and its impact in ecology is that of a first class novelist. He covers almost every aspect of evolution you can imagine, so he cleverly responds (almost telepathically) to the interior questions nurtured while reading the text. Superb, I love this book.</span>

                    <span>Carl Zimmer wrote a solid account of evolution in the book "Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea". The text is accessible to practically all ages. Serious lay men and people with no knowledge of evolution may find the book rewarding and entertaining. Zimmer begins with an elegant life story of Darwin - his family, his voyage on HMS Beagle, his friendship and discussions with other naturalists, publication of Origin of Species and other details. I was particularly interested in how Darwin's theory and ideas were debated at the time. As the book explains, Darwin earned many loyal friends (Thomas Huxley) and bitter enemies (Sir Richard Owen) after publishing his work. Also, Zimmer provides some information on carbon dating and emphasizes its importance as a method and introduces Lord Kelvin and Marie Curie to his readers as well. When Zimmer moves on to discuss genetics and heredity he rightly introduces Gregor Medel. Readers should pay special attention to the evolutionary tree of whales that show a divergence of species that are actual intermediate forms. <P>Due to the compactness of the text I understand that Zimmer was writing under deep constraint, however, I was surprised by the fact that Zimmer only briefly mentions trilobites that surpassed 300 million years of existence during Paleozoic Era and the dinosaurs (150 million years during Mesozoic Era). At times Zimmer presents only one theory when it is known that several theories exist that confirm to the available evidence suggesting there is some favoritism going on. Graphs and illustrations seem to be up to date and are well picked but I wish he included more of these. Visual information is just as valuable as verbal. <P>Zimmer describes several theories that try to account for mass extinctions (90% of species 250 million years ago, the demise of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, and other 4 mass extinctions): volcanism and cataclysmic asteroid collisions with earth. Zimmer attributes the mammalian rise to dominance to the mass extinction that happened 65 million years ago. He explains that mammals were no bigger than present day shrews at the time dinosaurs ruled. Only after the extinction could the mammals grow in size unconstrained. Zimmer predicts that future extinctions may be possible but this time it is Homo sapiens that are causing it. He explains that humanity has already left a deep mark on environment through carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation. According to him, we are frustrating the evolution of other plants and animals. If this is thrown out of whack the consequences may be catastrophic. <P>Later on, Carl writes about sexual selection and sexual/asexual reproduction. He explains evolutionary advantage sexually-reproducing animals have over those that reproduce asexually. For describing sexual selection and female choice Zimmer uses old established example of peacock's tail. <P>As we approach Part 4 we are headed into evolution of hominids. I was rewarded by the reconstructions of hominids: Australopithecus afarensis and Homo ergaster. Here Zimmer dwells into the theory of mind, human migrations, hominid interaction, and emergence of modern human behavior, symbolic thinking, and other areas. He gives some clues as to why Neanderthals went extinct about 27,000 years ago. Homo neanderthalensis did not seem to interbreed with Homo sapiens. They left no progeny. Zimmer is clearly a proponent of a theory of sudden emergence of human behavior that arose, according to some anthropologist, as early as 50,000 years ago and led to the use of jewelry, cave paintings and other forms of symbolic expression. I personally sway toward the theory that suggests that modern human behavior arose gradually in Africa without taking any sudden leaps. Recent archeological findings of shell beads dated to about 75,000 years ago and other digs may be suggesting that modern human behavior has existed way before Africans began expanding into Europe in several migration waves. <P>The last chapter deals with the idea of God. Zimmer walks his readers through history of American education and its battle with Darwinism. He explains that Darwinism has historically been abused and used to justify xenophobia, violence, and eugenic polices in Europe. This type of Darwinism was dubbed "Social Darwinism" and left a deep gash on the reputation of Darwinism as a healthy science. Additionally, if you are interested about Intelligent Design movement and Earth Creationists then you will definitely like this chapter. <P>Zimmer finishes off his book splendidly. He portrays Darwin's own battle with his religiosity. Darwin's transformation from a devoted Christian to an agnostic was gradual. Deaths of his loved ones left deep marks on his mentality. At the end Darwin himself succumbed to his illness and passed away in solitude and peace.</span>
