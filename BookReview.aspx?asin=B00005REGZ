                <span id="Label1">This is an enhanced edition of HBR article R0301F, originally published in 1968 and republished in January 2003. HBR OnPoint articles include the full-text HBR article, plus a synopsis and annotated bibliography. The negative or positive KITA or "kick in the pants" approach to employee motivation yields short-range results and rarely generates any long-term actual motivation. Positive KITA in the form of raises and incentives reduces time spent at work, inflates wages and benefits, obstructs direct communication between line and management, and overemphasizes human relations. Employee counseling attempts to develop motivation when job participation does not work, but reveals little. These techniques fail to instill a self-generating motivation in workers. Factors that lead to job satisfaction are distinct from those that lead to dissatisfaction. Job content factors, such as achievement and responsibility, are motivators, whereas job environment factors are hygiene or KITA factors. Motivators are the key to satisfaction.</span>

                    <span>Frederick Herzberg was Head of the department of Psychology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland when he wrote this Harvard Business Review-article in 1968. He currently is Professor of Management at the University of Utah.<P>In this article the author tries to answer one of the main questions in management: "How do I get an employee to do what I want?" There is the taditional method to get someone to do something is to administer a kick in the pants, or "KITA" as Herzberg terms it. He then discusses the different myths about motivation and explains how each of them only results in short-term movement. Based on results from various studies he concludes "that the factors involved in producing job satisfaction (and motivation) are separate and distinct from the factors that lead to job dissatisfaction." Or, in other words, "the opposite of job satisfaction is not job dissatisfaction, but, rather, no job satisfaction; and similarly, the opposite of job dissatisfaction is not job satisfaction, but no job satisfaction." This concept has an important impact on management: The growth or motivator factors are intrinsic to the job, while dissatisfaction-avoidance or hygiene factors are extrinsic to the job. Both factors are described in detail, with various tables and graphs explaining each. Herzberg provides us with ten steps for job enrichment, or principles to institute the motivator idea with their employees. But it is important to note that job enrichment is not a one-time proposition, it is a continuous management function.<P>Yes, this is a fantastic article on motivating employees. Herzberg explains in simple words that the things that make people satisfied and motivated on the job are different in kind from the things that make them dissatisfied. It debunks the traditional myths about motivation and explains that people are motivated by interesting work, challenge, and increasing responsibility. Highly recommended to all managers supervising people. The article is written somewhat old-fashioned business US-English.</span>
