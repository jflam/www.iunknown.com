                    <span>This is the book I pick up whenever I need a quick pick-me-up. Whatever I'm feeling, I know Alice K. (not her real initial), will be going through something worse. The best book I've read that thoroughly captures the insecurities, delusions and humor of the 30something female mind!</span>

                    <span>This is a book any female (and male, to understand us better!) should read, but especially when you're 33, single and illogical! Alice K. (not her real initials) is someone you can relate to.</span>

                    <span>I love the writings of Caroline Knapp. Drinking a love story is great book while A Pack of Two is her finest. This book, Alice K.'s guide is her weakest book. Which isn't a terrible criticism as her weakest book is better than most writer's best books! I found the use of initial's throughout the book annoying as h*ll. I'm not sure what the point to that was beyond annoying the reader. The first half of the book is about very trivial matters such as finding the perfect shoes, blouse etc. Luckily, the second half of the book is where Caroline begins to deliver on something well worth reading. In summary, not her best book but not all bad either.</span>

                    <span>Reminding me slightly of Bridget Jones' Diary, Alice K's Guide to Life was one of the funniest, and most fun to read, books that I've read this year. Alice K (not her real initial) is 30 something, not meeting the right men, in therapy, and completely hysterical. <P>Her commentaries on life - from office mates (Women with Boundary Issues, the sniffer), her money (non) management skills, love, and her ideas for new magazines, will have you laughing out loud as you read this book. I just thought of something that made me sit straight up in bed - I LOVED this book.</span>

                    <span>This book hits home to the feminine experience. I can sympathize and empathize with Alice K.. The book kept a smile on my face. I was inspired to read this after reading Drinking: A Love Story, another great book by Caroline Knapp. I recommend it!</span>
