                    <span>Excellent book, I highly recommend it. Carducci really makes you realise that you are not alone, though most shy people feel very much separate from the rest of humanity, and that you can learn to be successfully shy. <p>The book has lots of examples of people who are shy or have become less so. There are sections that may not apply, but that would be the case with any self-help book.</span>

                    <span>Although this book was difficult for me to read (maybe because it is so close to home), I can recommend it for anyone who wants to gain some understanding about their shyness. Carducci not only provides some of the background reasons behind why you might be shy, but also some simple solutions to help you deal with it successfully going forward. <p>There are a few sections that did not pertain to me such as the shyness in your child section but I found the majority of this book helpful and informative even though it took me a while to get through the book.</span>

                    <span>This is a well-written and comprehensive overview of research on shyness at all stages of human development and how it can be applied. However, if one is looking for a very structured and systematic therapeutic approach to alleviating the pain of shyness, s/he will not find it here. Instead, Carducci offers his clinical suggestions in a more casual fashion, incorporating them into the exposition. He covers areas which are significant for shy people, such as work, dating, and parenthood. It is an interesting and useful book.</span>

                    <span>I tottally loved this book and it's very informative. Unlike many books, this one is new as it has been written recently. The information provided is up to date. I'm a shy person and this book has helped me understand myself and have more confidence. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand shyness.<p>The book is divided to four parts:<br>Part I. Welcome to the successfully shy life (4 chapters)<br>Part II. Shyness of the Body, Mind and self (3 chapters)<br>Part III. Shyness through the life cycle (5 chapters)<br>Part III. Shyness in the World (3 chapters)</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I studied five popular books on shyness in the past few months, and I like Carducci's because his approach is based on intimate, detailed knowledge of shy people, as well as on his involvement with a Shyness clinic. Other books approached shyness from the point of view of theory (e.g. cognitiv/behavioral or psychodynamic) and missed the many methods of managing shyness that come directly from knowing shy people well.  Two things I found overwhelmingly strong: 1) he works from a strengths perspective, looking at shyness not as a deficit, but as a personality trait whose inhibiting effect can be greatly reduced with dedicated individual effort, and 2) he has a method which is clear, goes step-by-step without the need for professional guidance, and is extremely easy to follow.  It does take work....but you can get to "the successfully shy life."</span>
