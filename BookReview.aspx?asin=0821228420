                    <span>In this beautiful, historical collection of slave narratives and photographs, we are given a look inside the lives of actual slaves being interviewed as part of a project conducted by the Works Progress Administration.  With more than forty interviews, UNCHAINED MEMORIES is a work of art that provides a well-rounded look at the lives of slaves. It includes insight into their living conditions, thoughts about slavery, their families and even the details of actual slave auctions.  It is a sometimes sad collection, but much needed to help us understand the progress our ancestors have made in the world.<p>Through their accounts, we are able to see the pain and suffering as well as the spirit and pride of those born into slavery, learn from it, and pass it along to our children.  This is a wonderful resource for not only African American families, but for anyone interested in history and the period of slavery and its impact upon the African American race.  It is compiled with the grace and dignity deserving of a people who have been through so much!<p>Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers</span>

                    <span>This book is hard to read.  It is hard to wade through the cruelty.<p>There are stories here of families being split apart by an uncaring master class.  Children were callously sold and permanently separated from their parents.  Husbands and wives were similarly split up.<p>Frankly, it makes you sick.<p>Then there are the stories of brutality.  Again it makes you sick.  How could the slave owners have sunk so low?<p>If you are looking for well written stories that bring the institution of slavery to life for you, this is not the book.  What you get here are very short and very simple reports by individuals.  There's nothing here that you didn't know already.  This is not a great work of literature.<p>This is just a punch right in the nose to make you wonder how slave owners could have been so cruel.</span>

                    <span>"...Oh freedom, Oh freedom, Oh freedom over me.  And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free"<br> __Old Negro Spiritual<p>The words of the spiritual above must not have been uttered to these beautiful human beings who have graciously allowed interviewers from the 1930's Governments Works Progress Administration to chronicle their life stories.  For if the words above had been uttered, the slave experience, from an intimate and painful point of view, would never have received the credence they due.  Tales of slavery are still passed down from generation to generation, and traditions still are followed but to see a book like Unchained Memories is special.  Quite simply, this is a beautiful book.   I'm so thrilled to have been given the opportunity to read it and experience it and learn from it.  I can treat the book as a textbook, a factual accounting of the lives of former slaves who have wonderful stories that they don't mind sharing with the world.  For that reason alone, this book has earned a permanent place on my coffee table, for all who enter into my house to experience.  Something about the actual words of former slaves bound in book form validates an agonizing time in American History.<p>Unchained Memories is well researched and magnificently laid out.  At the beginning of every chapter is an introductory text that accounts for the tenure of the time, followed by a poignant quote and then brief narratives begin.  My one regret is that the narratives are so short, when biographers obviously spent a great deal of time with these people.  I am grateful that there is an extensive bibliography at the back so that I can, at some point, go and read the entire account by the former slave.  Oh where will I find the time?  If you read this book, I would highly suggest that you get a copy of the HBO documentary of the same name and watch it as well.  There is nothing like "hearing" the words spoken by African American actors of today in the vernacular of the time.<p>I'm glad that Unchained Memories was published, and quite fittingly made its debut during Black History Month.  These former slaves are the reason why Black History Month is perpetuated now and a fitting tribute for remembering from whence we as a nation have come.</span>

                    <span>An exquisite pictorial and narrative exploration of the institution of American slavery, this book provides readers with the opportunity to experience from personal recollections what it was like to live under conditions of slavery. The text format, an artistic balance of photographs and primary sources, is composed of interviews with former slaves conducted in the 1930s by the Federal Writers' Project. Each chapter focuses on a particular aspect of slave life - auctions, work, family, special occasions, providing a deeply etched portrait of hardships and abuses as well as examples of strength of character and quiet dignity. A worthy addition to one's library!</span>
