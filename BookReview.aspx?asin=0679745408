                <span id="Label1">Neil Postman is one of the most level-headed analysts of education, media, and technology, and in this book he spells out the  increasing dependence upon technology, numerical quantification, and misappropriation of "Scientism" to all human affairs. No simple technophobe, Postman argues insightfully and writes with a stylistic flair, profound sense of humor,  and love of language increasingly rare in our hastily scribbled e-mail-saturated world.</span>

                    <span>Clever and resourceful. It is fascinating the way Postman interweaves different aspect of life, such as printing press, IQ test, language, education, and polling system, into Technopoly. Postman's argument of American culture becoming too technologicaly oriented and loosing the traditions is a legitimate point. However, he ignors the fact that America does not have a tradition. America is trying to stablish a tradiotion. The tradition that America is "loosing" was not American tradition, it came with the pilgrims. As Postman is full of fascinationg information himself, he argues that we don't need any more information, "Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information...Information is dangerous when it has no place to go...Information without regulation can be lethal." But, he does not prescribe that, how much information is enough information? And how could we regulate information in a democratic society? The system is set-up for gathering infromation. Students are incouraged to collect infromation. One of the main points of Postman's argument is that the rise of technopoly demolished religious believes and therefore the traditions. Although the topics are repetitious, I found the book easy to read. Postman provokes many questions, such as, are we controlling technology or technology is controlling us? What is the purpose of history? Are we happy about where technology is taking us? Is it too late, or can technology be controlled? What about God?</span>

                    <span>I first picked this book up in high school more than 10 years ago. More recently, as a Ph.D. candidate in engineering, I gave it another read. From both perspectives, a teenager with some grade-school science courses and a tech-saavy graduate student, I have thoroughly enjoyed this book.<P>This is a book about how technology affects the way a society interprets and thinks about all aspects of life and culture. Postman starts by looking at the past and very low tech (writing, for instance) and ends up examining the tech of the present. This book was first published in the 80s with a reprint in 1993, so some of Post's observations about computers and TV are very dated. I would love to see a 2nd edition to this book to address the technology of today and it's accessibility.<P>Despite the dated comments on present tech (which in the present age is understandibly difficult to keep up with) the overall thesis is highly relevant and this book should be read by all, science and tech enthusiast or no. It will definitely make you think about things you have previously taken for granted. The next time you use any technology, from a pen to a pda to a dvd player, you will ask yourself how this skews your world view.<P>Highly reccomended.</span>

                    <span>Neil Postman was indeed a celebrity within the mediating sphere where academic resources meets literary preferences meets sardonic humor. From the great breakthrough with the pulse-taking, entertainment industry icon of serious irony from the mid-80's; "Amusing Ourselves to Death", does "Technopoly" provide a brilliant link to our present society concerning the extensive take over from the diverse technocratic spots to a gathering world of technological artifacts, techniques, languages and behavior. <P>This book was written before the major breakthrough of World Wide Web, and certainly before Internet became an ordinary information device connected and used in every family home. Especially the latter point is important to grasp, because one of the deep concerns in this book is the flooding of unnecessary information. The lack of information, claims Postman, has never been a source to conflict. The problem is more truly the complexity of professions and the variety of information channels. In addition to this is of course the human limitation of receiving relevant information. Whether it is entertainment, commercials, scientific populism or just plain methodological junk, the problem rises when the really informative and giving information gets lost in the never ending stream of more or less serious news, advertising and "knowledge". <P>"Technopoly" is above all a book that tries to describe and explain how culture is loosing the war against technology. Postman goes through a wide range of themes to mainframe these losses, and succeeds extraordinary well. The historic aspect is one perspective that Postman deliberates with careful hands. He does not go too far in romanticizing the past, or singing about "glory days", but keeps his position quite tight and narrow concentrated on the main development agendas. From Gutenberg to The New York Times, tower clocks in 14th century Italy to scientific taylorism, and lots of more examples, Postman draws almost straight lines between producing and consuming technology as medium between mankind and culture. Further on he moves through the break down in control mechanisms, especially concentrated towards the rivers of stupid illuminations, quasi-scientific research, the use of intelligence tests, lie detectors, machine technology, medical technology and the moral - not the technological! - ineffectiveness of present bureaucracy. The range of Postman's references is sometimes very complicated, and you have to be in position of rather heavy thesis of social knowledge. On the other hand "Technopoly", both in terms of profession and style, sort of reflects the complexity of flexible interpretation views when it comes to channeling the relevant variables for understanding socio-technical development. <P>The underlining graph of Postmans book is that the technological agenda has overruled morality and traditional values concerning production and distribution of knowledge. Technology itself is no longer only a tool for social systems to function within the industrial way of thought, but also a goal for society. More technology in every area is meant to improve the conditions of for example politics, finance and living in general. Few are questioning the darker sides of this development, where humans instead of coping with actual problems, redefine them to be a matter of adequate technological equipment or scientific progress. Something is lost in between the problem risen from human inadequacy in dealing with human problems, and the blind belief in that better technology or science will set things right and everybody's home free. We believe that technology is the golden key to solving in example our instant need of more time, and that technological gadgets produced to make our lives easier actually does so, by all matters. <P>Another warning from Postman is our belief in technology as final judge in complicated cultural challenges. The transition from religion to science is just a shift from one set of dogmas to another. Reason and revelation are ultimately interconnected with the existing levels of scientific research and development (often named R & D). Computer technology is one of the many versions of technological tyranny Postman attacks, primarily because of humanly developed programs for computers to value the behavior of men and women. The legitimacy of so-called intelligence tests is trashed by Neil Postman's verdict, according to the fact that these tests do not express anything more than the outcome of what the test says it does. At best, they measure a person's ability to respond to a number of intricate theoretical logics. But it has nothing to do with intelligence. Secondly, Postman deliberates the value of medical technology, where it may derive propositions of how to treat physiological deviations, but has no other function. The moral aspect of medical technology is all in all in the hands of pharmaceutical industry and common faith. Thirdly, in connection to these two particular points, the existence of "scientism" is nothing else than a transformation of religion. Everything that is hidden under the carpet of projects fulfilling scientific acquirements is acknowledged as one step closer to the absolute truth. This is rubbish, writes Postman, and says further that nothing in human spiritual life can be arranged as scientific material. It may be good or bad documentation of situations and ideas, but never sheer scientism. <P>In the final chapter Postman proposes a solution to the ever growing technological dictatorship surrounding us, and brings forward a way of though every human being should use when threatened by unnecessary technological crap. Cultural resilience with cynical utilization of the good sides of our technological world is the formal answer, but, there is of course more to it of which I will not reveal here.<P>My mood after reading "Technopoly" is thrilling if we watch the last ten years in comparison. The extension of the Internet, satellite controlled mechanisms, GPS-systems and the explosion of cell phone use, the involvement of technological knowledge in every field of work, the succeeding of science as God instead of religion, and not to forget the faith in more information via technological tools as salvation for human misdeeds, somewhat confirms Postman's prophecies about his lack of hope for a less techno-based society.</span>

                    <span>Neo-Luddite and misoneist Neil Postman lived in terror of the future because he could not contribute to it. In this book, which is his thinly veiled exposition on how great things were in the "good old days" (when slavery was common and a little scratch could give you an infection that could kill you, and the earth was believed to be flat, and human rights were only for the rich), Postman waxes moronic about how the abundance of information is somehow (he never actually gets to it exactly) harmful to society.<P>What postman, in all his mediocrity, never understands is the parts of the "glut" of information are actually useful to people. Human understanding has reached depths of high complexity and with it go the requisite level of information. The processes of a single cell are enormously complicated, and that information is useful to a biologist, while possibly not useful to others. According to postman, all this information is just garbage - he can't see that all the information is simply a grouping of individual pieces of information - each useful to someone. <P>Postman represents the most vile of human short-comings: the belief that your idea of the universe is all encompasing, and that no other information is relevant beyond that.</span>

                    <span>Marshall McLuhan observed the medium is the message. Postman's argument is along similar lines as suggested in the subtitle of this book, "the surrender of culture to technology." He begins with a legend and goes into a question about how we learn in our culture. The introductory section is followed in the next chapter by a look at the tools that paved the way for industrialization and later the information age. In the third chapter, Postman makes a poignant observation, in discussing the assumptions made by Frederick W. Taylor in his classic book on scientific management i.e., "human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unneccesary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking..." (p. 51). <BR>His lucid examination of ideas, inventions, and public adaption continues. In the fourth chapter the quote that stood out most for me was one from H. L. Mencken who said "there is no idea so stupid that you can't find a professor who will believe it" (p. 57). I've been in academe long enough to verify that that observation remains the same now as when it was first written.<BR>Anyone who has ever been the victim of the fill-in-the-blank mentality of bureaucratic thinking can appreciate Postman's comment that "the invention of the standaradized form--a staple of bureaucracy--allows for the 'destruction' of every nuance and detail of a situation" (p. 84). To make his point even stronger, he goes on to define a bureaucrat as "little else than a glorified counter" (p. 86).<BR>Postman never fails to leave his readers with a perspective they didn't have before picking up one of his books. Read this one and learn a little more about how technology is shaping your perceptions often without your awareness.</span>
