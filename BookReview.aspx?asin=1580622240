                    <span>I read Selling to VITO. It is the best book I have read as a 25 year experienced sales person and sales manager. The recommendations WORK. I was a top sales performer for our company using VITO as my guide. All people in our team who read Vito ended there year at least 300% of plan. For anyone that trully wants to over achieve and view sales as a profession this is a MUST read. I read the entire book in one day. Could not put it down. The approach works for small companies and big. I work for a $80B Technology company and I find that Parinello's advice is applicable for both big companies and small.</span>

                    <span>Tony Parinello is a genius. He focuses on one critical piece of the selling puzzle and teaches you how to master it. That is landing an appointment with the #1 decision-maker in an organization. This is the starting point to making REAL money in sales and everyone who sells should own this book and use it to script their correspondence and phone calls. Selling to VITO is also a workshop for sales professionals that like to get some hands-on coaching to implement this strategy. As a fellow author and speaker (The Death of 20th Century Selling), I refer all of my sales and entrepreneurial audiences to Tony Parinello and Selling to Vito. You will be very pleased with the results of this book once you've read and worked through it.</span>

                    <span>Are your sales in a slump? Chances are you're selling to the wrong people. In this A-to-Z primer, Anthony Parinello explains how to get your foot in the executive suite. To be successful in sales, he says, go right to the top. Although well organized, the content at times reads like a stream-of-consciousness speech. Many of the "secrets" Parinello reveals are plain common sense - it's hard to believe that anybody in sales wouldn't know them. His advice about using the Web for research is dated (when was the last time anybody used the term "information superhighway"?), but the principles he outlines are timeless and make this a great read which we recommend to performance-oriented sales people and sales managers. Overall, this inspirational, motivational account should fire up sales people and help them see the forest, not just the trees.</span>

                    <span>Selling To VITO (Very Important Top Officer) is a book dedicated to the science of getting past the proverbial gatekeeper and reaching the executive prospect.<P>The book discusses in detail everything from attitude to the format of letters one should mail to the content of the voice mail one must leave. In that respect, the book is complete and combined with the personal experience the authors bring manages to offer an above average methodology into an important aspect of most sales cycles.<P>Having said that, does the book's advice actually work? Well, the answer is some yes and a lot of no. Having put the methodology to work first hand - letters, labels and all - it is fair to say that VITO helps, but is hardly a silver bullet. In fact, while the book facilitated some headway the final end-goal was never in sight.<BR>The failed experiment might be the result of bad luck or a small and non-representative sample, but the bottom-line remains that the book's effectiveness must be questioned. Furthermore, the book's content is slightly dated as shown by some of the verbiage which might be translating into the same for the content.</span>

                    <span>I first read Selling to Vito more than 5 years ago as a sales manager and sales trainer in telecommunications and found it incredibly valuable. The owner today of a sales training company myself, I recently revisited the book as a brushup. It's amazing how many of the skills Tony taught me way back wehn I still use. <P>From VITO to understanding the power of the "Seymours," those who recommend, his strategies and tips from verbage to letter writing produce dollars in any salesperson's pocket. 5 Stars all the way!</span>
