                    <span>This is a decent reference, if only for the rules at the back. Those rules are organized throughout the book with neat historical commentary on many of them, either with actual incidents or with reasons for why some rules came to be the way they are.</span>

                    <span>This book gives the reasons why there are 39,337 words in the rules to Major League Baseball. Do you want to know why the pitchers' mound is 60' 6"? Read the book. It covers most of the rules and how they developed through the years. If you love baseball and want to know all about it, this is a must read. If you like baseball, you may want to borrow the book from the library. <P>The book does have some great b/w pictures.</span>

                    <span>I got this book, and expected it to be a fun read, and for awhile it was. It's got some great ancedotes on how the various rules in the baseball rule book have come up.<P>However, as the book wore on, it got more tedious. Some of them are very funny, and I enjoyed the book in places, but I felt it too tedious of a read for my personal enjoyment.<P>That's why I gave it three stars instead of a lesser rating. I expect others will enjoy it, but for me *PERSONALLY*, I felt it was tedious.</span>

                    <span>Nice job of interweaving baseball's rules with anecdotes giving you the reasons they were first implemented or else later modified. I found it a surprise that this book was first written in 1994 and then updated for 1999 with almost no effort at all. Because there have been no important changes at all in the rules for a number of years now! Think about that. Monumental player strikes, massive umpiring problems, records toppling almost every day--but the basic game has remained changeless. This book, as a result, may hold up for a long while as the best I've seen on the rules and their history.</span>

                    <span>Terrible title, but the book more than survives it. The Rules of Baseball a fun read? Somehow Nemec makes it happen. Just wish it had been longer. You get the feeling that for every anecdote he used he had another 10 or 12 he could have given us that were just about as entertaining.</span>
