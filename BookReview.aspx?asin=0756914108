                    <span>I have been a collector of children's books for many years and it has been a long time since I have read one that right down to the last line had me saying, "well done". Inch and Miles is that book. This book is well assembled, it is written in prose and verse, beautifully illustrated and is good reading for a wide age<BR>range.The philosophy for success of Coach John Wooden of UCLA basketball fame is presented by a talented team of writers and illustrator in a way that draws the reader from one page to the next. I liked the use of the coach's well used and respected whistle throughout as the story builds toward a completed block <BR>pyramid one Hootie-toot-toot at a time. Each block is cemented into place by an apt verse as the story moves onward and upward to Personal Best from where the flag of Success can proudly be waved. Coach Wooden must be very proud of this presentation. I recommend "Inch and Miles" for every home, school, public library, and under Christmas Trees.</span>

                    <span>I love this book and you will, too. I read it to my 5-year-old as he's doing his homework (kindergarteners? homework??). He and I both find it to be an especially calming activity at the end of each school day. The delightful writing style brings to life Coach Wooden's proven philosophy on the achievement of success and happiness. My son enjoys following the learning adventures of the characters, Inch and Miles, and studying the beautiful, brilliantly rendered illustrations found on each page. Wooden's no-nonsense thoughts on achieving "100% personal best" are appropriate for children of all ages. I truly believe that introducing these concepts to my young son now will give him an early advantage in his lifelong journey to success. (Try this: For variety, try reading aloud just the BOLD-face rhyming sections on each page. The rhythmic flow of the writing will allow you to cover all the "pyramid blocks" in one sitting more quickly!)</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute gem! One of the things we learn from an early age is the faulty notion that in life there are winners and losers. What makes this book so wonderful is that it teaches children how to be the best in what they do and that everyone is a winner!<P>Inch and Miles: The Journey to Success is a book that will empower and affirm the best in our children and in ourselves.</span>

                    <span>Thank you, Mr. Wooden, for writing such a wonderful book for parents, teachers and coaches to share with our children! As executive director of an organization that works with elementary-age children and their families, I'm always on the look-out for books that reinforce important lessons for the children in a format that the children will enjoy and want to read over and over. You have surely done that in Inch and Miles! It is very well written, with a story and characters that guide the children through adventures that encourage them to think about important values -- in a fun way. Just last night, my 10-year-old daughter brought me the book again, and said she wanted to read it with me before she went to sleep! That, if you ask me, is the best review of all! <BR>Midge Wilson, Executive Director of the Tenderloin Family Center at Tenderloin Community School, San Francisco.</span>
