                <span id="Label1">The Highway Angler is the most comprehensive and informative guide book yet published on the subject of sport fishing Alaska's roadside waters. Packed with facts, cross-referenced, and easy to read, The Highway Angler tells you everything you need to know -- locations, access, species available, terminal gear, techniques, timing, and much more! It lists in detail more than 750 rivers, creeks, lakes, and saltwater hot spots along the state's major roads and highways from the U.S.-Canada border and the highland drainages of Yukon and Tanana rivers to Kachemak Bay and the popular Kenai Peninsula, and from the frigid coast of the Arctic Ocean to the surf-swept shores of Prince William Sound.  <P>For well over a decade, The Highway Angler has successfully guided thousands of people, both novice and expert alike, in discovering some of the best fishing in the world. This book is a must for any angler, whether local or visiting, who hopes to wet a line along Alaska's vast road system. These pages provide a thorough look at the opportunities available and the sport fish that inhabit the cold waters of The Last Frontier.</span>

                    <span>Another great job by Mr. Pedersen in describing angling opportunities from the road. Bought all of the previous Highway Angler editions, as well as the ice fishing book and Alaska Fishing (co-authored by Rene Limeres). I have lived in Alaska for many, many years and fished a great number of the locations described in the latest edition and found the information given to be very accurate. For anyone planning to fish Alaska's road system, this book is an absolute must. The price is a tremendous bargain, actually. You would have to spend an enormous amount of time and money to get this information elsewhere. Come to think of it, you won't find some of the information anywhere else, including the Department of Fish & Game and the most popular websites on fishing Alaska. A truly "insider" job!</span>

                    <span>Gunnar has written a comprehensive book in which he covers a *lot* of different fishing across a *huge* state. No matter where you are in the great state of Alaska, if you can drive to a water with fish in it, Gunnar tells you about the fishing there. The descriptions of access to certain streams is very good, especially for someone who wants to find easy access in unfamiliar territory. I just did a road trip from Seward to Homer to Denali and back to Anchorage, and although I couldn't stop very often, I was able to use this book to pinpoint several nice spots to try. <P>The only shortcoming is that while the seasons of fishing are described for each water, that is, he has charts listing what are the prime species to target at what time of the year, he doesn't give enough detail on how to target them in each type of water. It's a bit too broad. I have seen another book that covers fewer streams/bays/etc. but gives a bit more detail on fishing strategies for different species at different times of the year.<P>So, perhaps this and another resource are best. I'm glad I had Gunnar's book. Don't hit the Alaskan road without a book like this unless you are going with a guide, or are only going to one specific lodge.</span>
