                    <span>This book has just the right size and cover, it makes a statement that less is more, just by looking at the size...inside you find so many triggers for your imagination and it is very true that you can not help but smile when you read it! However I do not have any other color book to compare with, but I can say allready that this is the only one that I need.<P>I think his initiative to have cut out masks (1 black, 1 white) at the end, used to separate the colors is really excellent as well!<P>Except for showing RGB, CMYK and HEX values it has a great little example on how to use colored backgrounds that complement a photo or illustration. At least I find it very useful to be reminded of that every now and then!<P>For it is well-known that engaging the reader, student in the process of learning is indeed the best way to keep focus on what is going on - shows the authors insight in psychology as well.<BR>In addition to saying the book's size is great I have to say that the prize is great too..</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book to keep as a reference for any type of graphic design project. The small, but extremely useful, book size allows you to keep the book handy on your desk at all times. Whether you use the book for color inspiration or to pull color combinations (up to 4 colors) from, it's a great tool. The color listings are in CMYK and RGB including a small section of Browser Safe colors in the back of the book.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a designer with a fabulous resource for generating color schemes/combinations quickly and easily. In that respect, it inspires. <P>However, the author provides recipes (CMYK and RGB values) "checked for accuracy", never stating on what media those values may be valid. He then excuses himself by saying that "the potential for error exists". The implication that a set of CMYK values is in any way "accurate" beyond the inks and papers used for this particular publication is so, eh, mid-1990s. A true, but technically more challenging statement of the color values should have been made with device independent Lab values. Then anyone with Adobe Photoshop, for example, could reproduce the samples on his or her own media. This is, in fact, what Pantone does.<P>And aspiring web designers beware! The author clearly has little but old and second-hand knowledge of the facts of color on the web. He describes the anachronistic "browser safe" colors as if most computer users still had old 8-bit (256 color) monitors, and as if there was ever color consistency across them. In those bad old days we fought dithering (the "speckles") in solid fills by choosing from amongst the 216 colors Macs and PC monitors had in common. <P>Those days, except for some dusty intranets here and there, are gone. deceased. expired. However, neither then nor now could we count on consistency on our viewers' monitors--unless we can strongarm our audience into calibrating and profiling them. <P>These particular rants aside (the writer sighs benignly), the color examples are truly wonderful, useful, and inspiring.<P>In short, fabulous for samples, but not for accuracy of data.</span>
