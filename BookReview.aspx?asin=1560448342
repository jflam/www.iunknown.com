                <span id="Label1">There are ancient treasures hidden across the American Southwest.  Tucked away in remote canyons are hundreds of ruins, cultural treasures that provide a wealth of information about the past--and most people never visit them.  Hiking Ruins Seldom Seen is your ticket to these enchanted, little-known sites.  It will lead you on wonderful day hikes and overnight trips to some of the most spectacular areas of the Southwest.  Hiking Ruins Seldom Seen is for amateur archaeologists and those who enjoy heading into the wilderness.  It contains maps and detailed directions to remote sites, provides water availability information, and points out hazards on the way.  A description of each archaeological site is provided, along with notes on the scenery and wildlife of the area.  All of the ruins and rock-art sites in Hiking Ruins Seldom Seen are located off the beaten path and are relatively unknown to the public.  Don't forget to take Hiking Ruins Seldom Seen on your next Southwest adventure.</span>

                    <span>This book was very helpful and exciting! Two days after I recieved the book, me and a friend went out to find Nogales Canyon, NM. We had ALOT of fun and we found it with no problems. The book was extremly helpful and without it we would have never even known about this dwelling.</span>

                    <span>This book opens doors to whole new worlds of true adventure and hiking pleasure, with just the right amount of history and humor thrown in. The hikes to ancient ruins are relatively easy to find using this book, yet they lead you to places that very very few people have ever seen. I was surprised that within minutes from Phoenix or Tucson, there were such easily accessible and unknown Indian Ruins of such spectacular appearance. I would recommend this book to any novice, intermediate, or advanced hiker who is looking for an exciting and unique experience anywhere in the Arizona, Southern Utah, or New Mexico region. Excellent Book. A rare find!</span>

                    <span>"Ruins Seldom Seen" is one of the most interesting and original hiking guides I've ever read. The pueblos, cliff dwellings and rock art sites described in the book are fascinating, and the interpretive information answers all of the basic questions hikers may have about them. Just as important, the book leads hikers into many obscure wilderness areas, making it a "must" for adventurous types who yearn to get off the popular trails -- sometimes off trails altogether -- and truly explore in the Southwest. Finally, contrary to what some people think, books like this help educate the public and increase appreciation of Native Americans ruins, resulting in less theft and vandalism at archaeological sites. Many critics also fail to realize that people who destroy Indian ruins tend to be ignorant, have no interest in learning about Native Americans, and sure as heck will not pay (price) for a book about archaeology. So I give "Ruins Seldom Seen" a big thumbs-up!</span>

                    <span>I own about a dozen Falcon Guides. This is a welcome new addition to the series. The author gives trail descriptions for 36 hikes in Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Utah. Each hike leads to a ruin (Hohokam, Salado, Anasazi, etc.).<P>Although I've explored the Southwest on half a dozen long trips, most of these ruins were unknown to me. Most lie on National Forest or BLM land, not National Parks. Most are hitherto unknown to the general public, with some exceptions (for example, he includes the famous stone lions in Bandelier National Monument). <P>The trail descriptions are reasonably good, and include distance, USGS topo maps, and a difficulty rating. One innovation is the inclusion of GPS coordinates for the ruins themselves (but signficant waypoints might also have been nice). The author doesn't always provide altitude information. <P>There's a brief section discussing ruin etiquette, backcountry hazards, and photography tips.<P>I recommend this book for anyone who loves hiking, the Southwest, and prehistoric Native American ruins.</span>
