                    <span>Travis Burns has it all - a wonderful job as a programmer and two equally smart best friends.  He's quite the eligible bachelor, handsome and by society's standards, fine as hell.  Life is at a point where it just couldn't get any better, until the system forces him out of a job and he decides to take his knowledge to the streets to cash in.
<br />
<br />No matter what, Jackie always has Travis' back.  She's secretly in love with him, but also has a penchant for women.  As she, too, suffers from the recent recession, her only desire is to make money, and keep money.  An excellent chemist, she realizes too late that nothing is written in stone and corporate America takes no prisoners.  With her two friends in tow, Jackie is down for whatever.
<br />
<br />Ronnie is the third leg of the crew.  The hothead and slow thinker of the group, his main goal in life is to be a baller, and the best at it.  After losing his cushy Wall Street job, he doesn't care what they do, as long as it will keep him in his current lifestyle, at all costs.
<br />
<br />With a sweet hook-up from a big-time hustler, they devise a plan to make money like no one's business; but at what cost?  After being in this lifestyle for two years, the robbing game is not cool anymore to Travis; he's been thinking about getting out.  To make matters worse, he's finally found the one woman that can make him dump the lifestyle for good.  The only question is: will she leave before that time?  The pact these three made has lasted for years, but sometimes, you need to get out while it's good or suffer the consequences.  
<br />
<br />M.O.B was interesting, but left me feeling as if there was more to be said.  Roy reached back into his previous book to add characters that fans of his would be familiar with.  But, there were quite a few typographical errors, which at times detracted from the storyline.  While M.O.B. shed some light on the "game" and the interior dealings of this lifestyle, for me, it lacked the individuality that would help set it apart from other urban fiction books currently on the market.    If you're into this genre, it's sure to keep you captivated.  A couple of highlights that kept me going were the emphasis on friendship, and the realization that no matter what, karma will catch you at the most inopportune times.

                    <span>MOB, or money over b*tches, is rule number one for friends Travis, Ronnie, and Jackie.  Friends since childhood, the trio find themselves college educated but unemployed.  In need of money, they turn to a life of crime - robbing.  Along with MOB they live and conduct themselves according to nine other rules including "let no one come between us."  Under the protection of Mike "Vicious" Black's organization now run by Freeze, the trio of robbers are making money hand over fist.  But after a close call, Travis the unspoken leader is having second thoughts about his choice of career.  Addicted to the fast money and lifestyle, Ronnie and Jackie aren't ready to quit.  Further complicating matters, Travis meets the beautiful Me'shelle Lawrence.  As their relationship progresses, Travis find himself in direct conflict with rules "money over b*tches" and "let no one come between us."  As Ronnie and Jackie question Travis' loyalty, can he convince them to get out before their luck runs out?  And ultimately where will his loyalty lie?
<br />Roy Glenn's MOB is an action packed tale of heists, shoot outs, loyalty, revenge, and some good old fashion loving.  There were cameo appearances of Mike Black, Wanda, and Bobby Ray from `Is It A Crime.'
<br />Ready and waiting for the saga to continue with Drug Related.

                    <span>I tried to read Roy Glenn's novel "Is It A Crime" but couldn't get into it at the time.  No problem doing so with "MOB".  Right from the first page you are pulled onto a roller coaster ride of crime, then love, and finally suspense.  The book is written in vivid detail with the right amount of emotion poured into each character without being overdone.  I especially liked the fact that one of the MOB crew members is a woman whose name is Jackie.  She holds her own right alongside the guys.  I can definitely see this book being put on the big screen with the type of action that comes from these heists.
<br />
<br />There are some characters and references that may have come from "Is It A Crime" (i.e. Mike Black) but you can still read this book in spite of that minor detail.  I appreciate the author writing the story in that manner and may even go back and try to read "Is It A Crime".   
<br />
<br />I can't wait until "Drug Related" is released to see if it picks up on the Jackie and Travis storyline.  Buy this book, it won't disappoint.</span>

                    <span>Roy Glenn has crafted an excellent tale of suspense and street drama interwoven with a love story.
<br />Will love conquer all or will the motto of the crew ( Money over Bi***es) be the law of the day ?  You must read MOB to find out. 
<br />
<br />If you read Mr. Glenn's previous novel , Is It A Crime, you can see his growth as a writer. I am anxiously awaiting his next release in April. </span>
