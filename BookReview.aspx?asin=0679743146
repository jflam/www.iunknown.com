                    <span>"Black Women in White America" is outstanding.  Naturally the book provides some remarkable documents about slavery, but there is so much more covered in this fabulous book.  The experiences of African - American women seeking to get (and give) an education, the experiences of African-American women as mere sex objects (and their stories of being objectified by men of all races), the crusade against lynching ... I was floored by the variety and amount of sources contained in this book.  It is quite comprehensive in its breadth and scope.<p>As a historian and teacher, this is a marvelous resource.  As a student and American, it is a moving true-life story that is regretfully often untold.  Highly recommended reading.</span>

                    <span>Compelling enough to keep me from ever thinking that I have it rough.  As black women, we've endured sorrow and acheived greatness...all of which is found in this text.  Black Women... gives an excellent account of the early history of African women in America.</span>

                    <span>This book does an excellent job of documenting the lives of African American women from slavery to the 20th century.  It gives a portrayal of their strong abilities to move forward, their religious faith, and their  degree of hope and self-pride in the meantime.  I sincerely recommend this  book to everyone in hopes that it will serve as a guide in their present  lives.</span>
