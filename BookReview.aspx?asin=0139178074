                    <span>Ken Wydro's "Think On Your Feet" will not only transform your speaking and conversation skills, but it will transform the way you think. Many public speaking help books will fill your mind with mechanical tips that everyone, I assume, should already be aware of...i.e., "put inflection into your voice to emphasize your point..." Duh!<p>Wydro takes a much more top-down, holistic approach to speaking which emphasizes the attainment of an inner stillness (i.e. states of relaxation / self-confidence) as the REAL first step in successful speaking. He not only emphasizes this but gives practical, no-nonsense advice on turning this "inner stillness" into a reality. In this way, Wydro's book is AWESOME, and succeeds where other books fall short. <p>While many books in this genre will mechanicize your speaking thought process, and, sadly, turn you into an even more self-conscious speaker, Wydro's techniques teach much more: that is, to speak naturally, spontaneously, and freely...</span>

                    <span>I first read this book years ago when I began speaking at a Toastmasters group.  At first, it helped me with my impromptu speaking.  Later, it helped me to begin making small improvements in my daily actions (the slight edge technique).  I was very disappointed it was out of print at the time and I couldn't buy a copy for my own library.  Recently, a fellow Toastmaster member found it...and bought a copy for me.  I was so grateful -- this is a book to read again and again.<p>I recommend it to all my clients...Deceptively valuable.</span>

                    <span>I stumbled across this book by accident and found that it short cut my self-discovery journey as it helped me to come to terms with some of my feelings and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, helped me to do something practical about  these feelings. <p>I am desperate to get hold of a copy as the one I had  originally was a library copy...</span>
