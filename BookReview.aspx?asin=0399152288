                <span id="Label1">When wealthy octogenarian Nord Lafferty hires Kinsey  Millhone to help his newly paroled daughter find her way back to the straight and narrow after doing time for embezzlement, the Santa Teresa P.I. has no idea what she's getting into. Reba Lafferty's ex-boss, land developer Alan Beckwith, is the man who sent her to prison--so how come she's meeting him just hours after her release, and treating Kinsey to an X-rated reunion scene played out in his parked Mercedes? And why is he also playing sex games with Reba's formerly best friend, who still works for him? A visit from an old friend from the FBI clears up the mystery--Beckwith is suspected of running a money-laundering game, and they need Reba to make their case by rolling over on him. It&#146;s not until Millhone presents Reba with photographic evidence of Beckwith's two-timing that she agrees to do what the Feds want... but she'll only do it her way, which could get a lot of people killed. Grafton fleshes out this well-crafted thriller with a romantic subplot involving a romantic triangle that features Kinsey's elderly landlord Henry, his brother, and a vivacious widow who can't seem to choose between them. It doesn't add much to the plot, but the fans of this evergreen series (who must be wondering what will happen to Millhone when Grafton gets to the end of the alphabet) probably won't mind a bit. <I>--Jane Adams</I></span>

                    <span>If this book is any indicator, Sue Grafton is trying too hard to maintain her alphabet based series. <P>In this latest installment the central character, Kinsey Millhone, says "In the passing drama of life, I'm sometimes the heroine, but occasionally I'm simply a minor character in someone else's play." That's a succinct description of this listlessly paced book. <P>One of the subplots deals with Henry's (Kinsey's landlord) problems with both his love life and his siblings. When not trying to persuade Henry to deal with his problems head on Kinsey is starting to date a local PD detective named Cheney. By the end of the book Kinsey was unsure, and seemingly unconcerned, about the status of her relationship. I didn't care either. The central story deals with Reba Lafferty, daughter of wealthy Nord Lafferty. Kinsey is hired by Nord to help the newly paroled Reba get back on her feet (and, hopefully, stay on the straight and narrow). Old habits are hard to break and it isn't long before Reba is getting back into trouble. The pace of the book picks up in the last 100 pages when Reba and her former boss/lover start playing a deadly game of cat and mouse over the proceeds of a money laundering scheme involving a major LA drug dealer. <P>By the end of the book all the characters seemingly come full circle and end up pretty much where they started. The journey was hardly worth the effort.</span>

                    <span>The latest in Grafton's alphabet series finds Kinsey along for the ride in "Reba's Revenge". Overall it is an enjoyable continuation of this long-running series. While Reba is getting her revenge against Beck, her former lover and boss, Kinsey deals with new romance in her life and tries to counsel her landlord, Henry, on his love life. She trails along on various illegal escapades with the paroled Reba and doesn't really do much sleuthing. There is nothing new or very exciting, but if you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy spending a few hours catching up with Kinsey.<P>You have to admire Sue Grafton for keeping the series set in the 80's so that Kinsey doesn't age too much (otherwise Kinsey would be 54 this year!). Grafton keeps fairly true to the time period with Kinsey still not owning or using a computer although business use of computers is part of the story. Kinsey still pigs out on McDonalds, gets by without a cell phone and other gadgets we are so dependent upon today. As much as I'd like to get to the end of the alphabet, I don't want Grafton to rush and finish the series just to appease the readers who want a new book every year. I would prefer she take her time and maintain the quality of the series. I look forward to seeing what happens to Kinsey in "S", no matter how long I have to wait.</span>

                    <span><P>Like some others, I'm confused by this change in Kinsey. <P>In R IS FOR RICOCHET, our normally spunky, independent, careful Kinsey is letting recently-paroled Reba Lafferty call the shots. And, Reba's a flaky a character as I can remember in recent fiction. To have so many talents(she learned computer wizardry in prison, as well as how to cover furniture), she has no common sense at all. Addicted to cigarettes, gambling, a horrible man, and the high she gets from walking on the razor's edge, Reba leads Kinsey on a downward spiral, despite Kinsey's good intentions. <P>There is a complicated plot about money laundering, the IRS, FBI, DEA and other federal agencies, but the main thing to remember is ". . . hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." <P>I like the new love interest . . . Cheney Phillips. It's going to be interesting to see where this romance leads, but at least Cheney seems to be good for Kinsey. <P>Also, there's a revelation that caught me completely by surprise. I'll really be embarrassed if it's been in other stories. If it has, I do not remember it. Page 66.</span>

                    <span>After waiting two years for this book to be published, I really expected more. Kinsey has become a different person from the sharp, independent lady that we have come to know, in her previous outings. This time, she allowed a paroled felon to call all the shots.... usually going against her better judgement. Reba is an out of control birdbrain, but Kinsey never challenges her...she just does whatever Reba decides. I am sure that I will buy the "S" book....I will just not be as impatient, for its release, as I had been for this one.</span>

                    <span>This is only the second Grafton book I have read. As a public library director I try to read a variety of novels so that I can recommend, honestly, the best authors writing to my patrons. I have to honestly say that I really enjoyed R is for Ricochet.<P>Kinsey Millhone is hired by Nord Lafferty to baby sit his middle aged daughter, Reba, upon her parole from prison. The assignment seems straightforward enough, but as in most of Grafton's novels, the obvious should never be relied upon too strongly and often what seems to be simple on first blush often turns out to be complicated. It isn't very long before the simple assignment turns difficult especially as some of Reba's old friends begin to make their appearance.<P>Well written....written with the reader in mind....R is for Ricochet will keep you turning pages. Not Grafton's strongest work (I liked Q is for Quarry better), R is certainly worth the time you'll spend reading it. I wonder what S will be?</span>
