                    <span>This is the most practical book among all the XP books ever published. You do only need to read Kent Beck's XP manifesto "Extreme Programming Explaining" before studying this book. Then you may skip all other books from the "Extreme Programming Series" and start to interpret written material about individual XP practices:<p>- Design Improvement: " Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code " by Martin Fowler;<br>- Test-Driven Development: "Test Driven Development: By Example " by Kent Beck;<br>- Sustainable Pace: "Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency" by Tom DeMarco;<br>- Pair Programming: "Pair Programming Illuminated" by Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler;<br>- Whole Team: "Agile Software Development" by Alistair Cockburn;<br>- Planning Game: "Planning Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck, Martin Fowler;<br>- Small Releases: "Software Project Survival Guide" by Steve C McConnell.<p>This book covers most of the XP practices at a glance, but with sufficient level of details. It tells in practice:<p> - How to introduce XP, how to overcome managers' and developers' resistance, how to set the right attitude (Part One);<br>- How to remember XP core values, how to handle exceptions if something has broken, e.g. the customer won't write stories or the number of developers is odd, how to do pair programming or stand-up meetings, how to steer and how to plan the whole project and the individual iterations, how to write tests, to create the pair-friendly space, how to refactor, and how to reduce the risk (Part Two);<br>- How do design the simple, what collective ownership means, how to automate acceptance tests and not get distracted by the code, why the overtime is not the answer and how to coach and keep the score (Part Three);<br>-How to "sell XP" (commercial aspects of XP projects, e.g. how to bill the customer), how to "scale XP", and how to "measure XP" (Part Four).<p>Enough said, this is the most practical book among all the XP books ever published.</span>

                    <span>As a complete newcomer to XP I bought this book based on the review by Peter Lindberg (see below) and I agree with his comments.<p>Some parts of the book assume that you know a little about XP at the start and you have to wait for a fuller description further on in the text to gain understanding. I didn't find this too much of an issue but you may want to buy one other introductory XP book to help.<p>I enjoyed the authors writing style and liked the use of guest experts in reinforcing the methodology.<p>Well worth the cost as you only need to buy this book and perhaps one other to get the XP story.</span>

                    <span>If you are interesting in Extreme Programming or need to evaluate it, I recommend this book.  It is a very readable book but does have some drawbacks:<p>1.  It is way overpriced.  Too thin, not enough info for [price], even if Amazon discounts it.  Ideas are repeated over and over again.<p>2.  These authors (and others who review their buddies' books on Amazon and give biased reviews) are making a living off you buying into XP.  It is funny how they say the last thing you want to do is adopt XP only partially.  <p>3.  So don't waste your money on more than one book from this group of XP diciples who are rehashing the same info over and over in about a dozen different books.<p>4.  You can adopt only some of the principles provided in XP without adopting the whole practice.  I've seen it done successfully in many places.  These principles existed before XP and they can exist without it.</span>

                    <span>This is the first in-depth book on Extreme Programming (XP). If you are at home with the concepts of XP, but have lots of questions that you feel the XP literature doesn't answer -- this is the book for you! I myself have been into XP for little over two years, and I can't think of any questions I've had, that aren't addressed thoroughly by this book<p>The book is focused on introducing XP, dealing with things like how to tackle resistance from developers and managers; which XP practices should be implemented first; what factors are important in order to successfully implement XP, and so on. <p>The authors list six of the XP practices as "the bare essentials". Not that the other practices are unimportant, but they can wait until the first six are in place. The six are: Planning Game, Small Releases, Testing (unit testing only; acceptance testing can be addressed later), Pair Programming, Refactoring and Continuous Integration. These six practices are very thoroughly described, dealing with the how and why a practice works, how to start doing it, and so on. As for the remaining practices, they also explain why each practice can wait until the first six are in place.<p>I tried to read this book with a critical mindset, so I kept notes of things I thought they failed to address properly -- only to find that they returned to them later in the book, forcing me to cross out items on my list. What was left on my list were only minor details, except one item: I would have liked them to deal with the System Metaphor as exhaustively as the rest of the practices.<p>Just as "XP Explained" by Kent Beck and "XP Installed" by Ron Jeffries, et al, this book basically says that, well, it is good if you can come up with a metaphor, but if you can't, that's not too big a deal. In these books, the topic of the metaphor and how it relates to the concept of architecture, is given only a few pages (2.5 pages in XP Applied). This is a pity, because I feel that it is an important issue. (I suggest reading "XP Explored" by William Wake, which has two very good chapters on this.)<p>If you only intend to buy one book about XP, I would recommend this book over "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" by Kent Beck (which is the XP manifesto). This is not to say that "XP Explained" is a bad book, though -- I nominate that book to be one of the most important software development books, ever. But if your aim is to learn as much about XP as possible, this book is in a league of its own.<p>If you can afford more than one book, I would suggest starting with either "Extreme Programming Installed" by Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson and Chet Hendrickson, or "Extreme Programming Explored" by William C. Wake. I think that one of these books is a good start, since they both are very practically oriented. After reading one of them, I think it's a good time to read "XP Explained", which very elegantly describes the philosophy behind XP. Finish off with "XP Applied" to get answers to all your questions. I bet that you'll have a very solid understanding of XP by then.</span>
