                    <span>I really enjoyed the information Higdon had to share. He answered every question I had about embarking on my first marathon, from what to eat to how to train and how to rest. Most helpful is the training guide at the end of the book to help you prepare for this quest. At least 4 times in the book he talked about how he liked to drink a soda right before the race. I thought once was enough. However a recommended buy.</span>

                    <span>Overall, Marathon: The Ultimate Training Guide, is an excellent marathon perpetration book. <P>The book is easy to read and progresses well. For someone preparing for their first marathon, the book answers most of the questions one would have. The book tells you what to expect and how to prepare for the unexpected.<P>Hal Higdon has run loads of marathons and his sage advice is clear chapter after chaper.</span>

                    <span>I am living testiment to the fact that this book works. I'm 31 years old, new mom and a relatively new runner and through this book and the 18 week training guide on his website, I was able to complete the Chicago Marathon this past October. He promises that if you stick to his guide you can finish and it works. <P>The best thing about the book is that it is supportive, but not preachy. Hal uses examples of elite athletes, but never forget that he is writing this for the novice or intermediate runner. As a novice myself (I had only started running about 6 months before), I found I was able to set realistic goals (just to finish, really) and run injury-free. <P>I cannot count the number of times in this book where I would read something and instantly be reinforced that I could complete a marathon. And that's very important because the training can drain you, make you question your ability and scare you.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book has 221 pages. I think the useful information could be condensed down to 20 pages or so. This book makes heavy use of the anecdote pattern. Chapters begin with little stories about elite athletes and experienced runners from which general principles of running are drawn. The problem is that the stories are incomplete and entirely anecdotal. Elite athletes and experienced runners don't need this book and the principles that apply to them don't apply to middle-aged people who truly are beginners. The book doesn't address the subjects of weight and size (very important in long distance running), and it only addresses age at a very superficial level. The good things in this book are: the focus on staying injury free; the incorporation of easy running and rest days into your training schedule; some sample training schedules; some diet advice; and some seemingly useful information about race logistics toward the end. On the negative side, a lot of space is devoted to fluffy stories; evidence to support advice is almost entirely anecdotal; there is practically no advice on runner injuries and how that affects your schedule; and no talk about weight/age; Put simply, this book contains a lot of anecdotal, unscientific, irrelevant, happy, feel-good fluff. The training schedules may work for you, but if they don't you will not have gained enough knowledge from this book to understand how to adapt them to fit your needs.</span>

                    <span>This book is great! I followed Hal's advice and ran my first marathon without any trouble. He told me what to eat, when to eat, how far to run, what to wear, and I listened and finished Pittsburgh and it was fun. Then he told me what to do to recover. I'd recommend this book to EVERYONE! Thanks Hal!</span>
