                <span id="Label1"><P> <B>All eat from the bowl of life. Tiger Woods just has a bigger spoon.</B> <P> So writes Curt Sampson in his ground-breaking account of the current state of golf. Tiger Woods has changed golf forever. His mix of power and skill combines with his extraordinary business savvy to make Woods the biggest global sports figure since Michael Jordan. Like Jordan, Woods' competitive signature is equal parts inspiration and intimidation. <P> But what about the other guys? It's either catch up or give up for the rest of the golfing world, and in <I>Chasing Tiger</I> Curt Sampson exuberantly charts the state of the game as the new century unfolds. There are Duval and Mickelson and a host of other stars, of course, but there are also the junior golfers and their parents, corporate America, agents, instructors, fans, and the media. <P> Just as he did in his controversial bestsellers <I>Hogan</I> and <I>The Masters,</I> Sampson digs deep  to uncover stories that wouldn't otherwise be told. There's the golf course employee in Austin whose admiration for Woods leads him to spend every waking minute mimicking his hero (including the trademark pumping fist, only here it's on the practice green). There's the awestruck unemployed talk show host who stretches the bounds of good taste and hero worship with his Web site, Tigerwoodsisgod.com. At the other end of the scale is Charles Howell III, skinny as a 2-iron, a up-and-coming player who has been tapped by Jack Nicklaus to be the next great challenge to Woods. Howell is the anti-Tiger: a man unfailingly friendly to fans and media, recently married, opinionated, and entirely lacking in caution, yet he struggles to earn enough money to make the Tour.  <P> Curt Sampson has written an affectionate yet wary account of one extraordinary man's impact on the world of sport. By turns moving, hilarious, and eye-opening, <I>Chasing Tiger</I> is a wonderful addition to the golf canon.</span>

                    <span>Beyond the aggrandizing sports articles and simplistic examinations of Tiger's stroke or sheer ability lies the story of his effect on the PGA.<BR>Woods has changed golf the same way an eathquake can change a small, extraordinarily inclusive, community.<BR>The landscape is different. Familar direction markers no longer exist and are replaced by new totems of accomplishment and mountains of greatness.<BR> Instead of toeing the party line of Tiger's perfection Sampson examines Tiger's effect on the PGA community.<BR> Anyone curious about the innerworkings of the PGA, with all its glory, success, and abject drudgery, should READ THIS BOOK.<BR> Anyone interested in Tiger Woods and his permanent effect on golf SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.<BR>This book tells you what he has done to the game and how the playing field has changed for every single player who picks up a club.</span>

                    <span>I have enjoyed Sampson's writing in the past, but this book disappointed. As advertised, it really is a book about the chasing of Tiger Woods -- by competitors, fans and media. One can enjoy the "behind the scenes" looks at the tour, and if you are interested in Charles Howell III, you will get a bunch of info here. I felt the book headed off in too many directions, the metaphors were WAY overblown, and the lack of focus was frustrating. If you are interested in the peripheral insights to be gained, or simply love Sampson -- wait for the paperback!</span>

                    <span>I read this book straight through! "Chasing Tiger" is not yet another Tiger Woods biography, but an inside look at Tiger Woods through the eyes of other professional golfers, groupies, media people, caddies, etc..Curt Samspon tells a truthful, and sometimes shocking, account of what it's like to be on the tour with Tiger. This is a great book, not just for golf fans, but for anyone who is interested in more than what they read on the sports page. Curt Sampson has great style, and you should read this book.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book!...whatcha see is not usually whatcha get on the PGA tour...Curt Sampson has captured the reality of Pro Golf, which is not seen on network TV or The Golf Channel. As a former PGA Tour caddy I can vouch for the fact that while the TV cameras are rolling these guys put on a good show but off-stage they won't give you the time of day...Curt Sampson has the inside track on what really happens inside the ropes on the PGA Tour and he shares it with all of us...Tiger, Phil, Charles Howell III...nobody is immune from criticism...and that's the way it should be...after all... aren't golfers people like you and me?...a good book...fast read...and right on the money...Capt. Randy Brown</span>
