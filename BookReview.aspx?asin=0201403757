                <span id="Label1">B></I></B></U> This best-selling guide to Prolog has been fully revised and extended to provide an even greater range of applications, enhancing its value as a stand-alone guide to Prolog, artificial intelligence, or AI programming.  Ivan Bratko discusses natural language processing with grammar rules, planning, and machine learning. The coverage of meta-programming includes meta-interpreters and object-oriented programming in Prolog. The new edition includes coverage of: constraint logic programming; qualitative reasoning; inductive logic programming; recently developed algorithms; belief networks for handling uncertainty; and a major update on machine learning.  This book is aimed at programmers who need to learn AI programming.</span>

<br />The most challanging language, the most challenging programming book I have ever faced with.
<br />Force your IQ with this one.</span>

                    <span>... a horrible Prolog tutorial.<p>This is not a good first book on Prolog. If you are new to Prolog and Logic Programming, you should read 'Art of Prolog' first.<p>Prolog is quite different from other languages, and you'll need some time to get it. This book doesn't give you that time: after briefly introducing the basic concepts, Bratko dives at breakneck speed into recursion and list processing.<p>Don't get me wrong, this is a magnificent book on how to do AI with Prolog, but it shouldn't be your first Prolog book. It's an excellent second book.</span>

                    <span>Professor Bratko has done a tremendous job of putting all the fundamental concepts of Prolog and its applications in various areas of AI. Although this book is focused on Prolog, the concepts that he has discussed are so fundamental that they can be implemented in other languages like Java as well.<p>I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn Prolog. I would also recommend the readers to use a Prolog system to work out the examples and exercises as s/he goes through every chapter. A DEC10 Prolog system (like SICStus Prolog) would probably be the best companion for this book.</span>

                    <span>I find the book does not adequetly explain the more complex code examples.  First of all the code is not adequetly commented.  Secondly, it does not explain the code well for programmers.  First when introducing a program like in the expert systems shell chapter it should first define an interface for the program, and explain each goal listed.  It should adequetly explain what each goal and clause should hope to achieve.  Also, for the more complicated programs it should draw some type of diagram, maybe a flow chart or something that explains the concepts involved.    It leaves too much figuring out and guessing for the reader.  It is not very user-friendly!<br>On the positive side, it does an adequate job of explaining concepts when complex code is not involved.  I found that I could follow along on even the more advanced chapters mostly everything at least until code was suddenly introduced.  Then it became a guessing game as to what it was trying to do.<br>The author does not seem to realize that it is more difficult to try to understand somebody else's program than it is to write your own program from scratch.  As a consequence the reader wastes a lot of time trying to guess what his program is doing.<br>Note: this review is of the 2nd edition and does not necessarily reflect the 3rd.  But, then again, every other review on this page prior to mine is about the 2nd edition as well!</span>

                    <span>Having just read a book on automated reasoning which covered topics in logic, such as unification and resolution, I was very pleased with the prolog programming language, in that it takes concepts from logic, and uses them in ways that can be applied to a number of interesting areas of AI, such as NLP, planning, and expert systems. I thought Bratko succeeded in making this connection with logic, without burdening the reader with notation and concepts that are really not needed for writing or understanding prolog programs. <p>The book also worked for me on the level of providing a good introduction to the syntax and sematics of the language. The first 200 pages succeed to this end.<p>Finally, the last 13 chapters can be summarized as representing an introduction to AI from a prolog perspective. On the positive side, he shows how to apply prolog to all of the modern, main streams of AI study. However, on the negative, the slant towards prolog in these chapters tends to oversimplify these disciplines.<p>My impression of the language is that it seems good as a prototying language, since it is declarative in nature, but from my experimentation (using SWI Prolog) I think I could write better implementations using c or java. <p>In closing, Bratko's book represents a very good place to start learning prolog and the world of AI.</span>
