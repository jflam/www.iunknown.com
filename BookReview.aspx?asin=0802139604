                    <span>Gately's "Tobacco" (known in Britain as "La Diva Nicotina") is essentially an apologia for tobacco and a celebration of its influence on Western culture.  If you have a problem with that concept, you should probably go elsewhere for your history of tobacco.  One of the themes that Gately explores, however, is the cyclical pattern of revulsion, then fascination for, the killer weed - beginning with Ralegh's introduction of smoking to the Elizabethan court (and, later, King Jame's "Counterblast" against tobacco).  Where this work becomes very interesting indeed is in the history of how tobacco products became marketable - I wasn't aware, until I read this, that cigarettes began as "ladies'" products and that Marlboro started life as an effeminate brand.  Gately loses some of his steam as we get towards the final phases of the twentieth century - where, I think, the relationship of man to tobacco has taken a rather more decisive turn: with scientifi proof of its adverse effects, there has been a permanent shift, with no real historical parallel, against nicotine products.  Still, for the early centuries, a fascinating read. </span>

                    <span>Mostly historic, this book is excellent from many perspectives. The history of Tobacco is discussed from it's origins in Central America, all the way to the production of cigarettes in modern times with facinating bits of well written history at every page. Although written well enough to be scholarly, it's very easy to read and fun to learn from.  I enjoy cigars, and of my tobacco smoking friends who have shared this book, they all read it cover to cover as well.</span>

                    <span>Gately's history of tobacco's effect on humanity is an off-beat but well-written look at a plant that has generated a good share of controversy over the years.  While more entertaining and better organized than the similarly-themed book Salt by Mark Kurlansky, Gately's knowledge of history beyond that of tobacco is sometimes deficient and he often comes off as an apologist for the tobacco industry.<p>Gately starts at the beginning, with the Indians who discovered tobacco and consumed it in a number of fashions.  When Europeans were introduced, they quickly became addicted and tobacco became one of the most valuable crops around.  Although Gately goes all the way to the present day and the decline of tobacco (at least in the U.S.), and he does discuss some of the health problems related to smoking, there is a sense he is downplaying the dangers of the substance and the industry's complicity in avoiding reform.<p>Despite his biases, Gately does present most of the facts and even if you don't agree with his views, he is still a good writer and he covers this topic with a brisk and often humorous style.  This is a good read for those interested in history from the point-of-view of a substance instead a person or a nation.</span>

                    <span>About half-way through this book, I started saying, "Nah, that can't be true." Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but I couldn't shake the feeling. <p>At first, Gately's Tobacco is simply a history, objectively told with an amusing tone. The prose is fast-paced, well-researched and, as far as it goes, honest. Despite Gately's well-reasoned and informative arguments, I have my doubts about the extent of tobacco's influence on historical/political situations, but then, it's difficult to know how seriously Gately takes such arguments himself.<p>But Gately's emphasis of tobacco's role in civilization (Western civilization particularly) gains a certain edginess the closer the book gets to the modern age. Gately is quite honest about the medical/addictive aspect of tobacco smoke. His defense of tobacco rests mostly on the intelligent and defendable grounds of libertarianism. But there is still something unsettling about such a defense in the face of Gately's honest description of the tobacco companies' approach to teen smokers. Although he isn't defending the tobacco companies, the reader almost begins to wish he would. Gately's c'est la vie shrug of the shoulders seems a tad Machiavellian, even by libertarian standards. <p>The trouble seems to be that Gately is too honest for his own good. A less honest man would defend tobacco without reference to the unsavory elements of its history and nature. Gately begins on an engagingly cavalier "Boy, isn't tobacco interesting" note but ends on a panegyric which comes off as a trifle naive in the face of what Gately himself has written. I don't question Gately's right to smoke or even the implication that anti-smoking has become something of an emotional crusade with science being used as a bludgeoning tool, but Gately's own Tobacco: A Cultural History simply doesn't lend itself to a rah, rah approach in favor of the weed. <p>Recommendation: Despite the three stars, give it try. The history is fascinating.</span>

                    <span>As someone interested in the history of tobacco and cigarettes who has read a few tomes on these subjects, I can say that this one, while not as in-depth as some, certainly covers it all. This is a very engaging read and worth the paltry price for anyone interested in the subject. The information on tobacco chewing in the US in the 1800's is wonderful. The bibliography is also very good, as well as the appendix on tobacco cultivation, curing and manufacturing. This is definitely the kind of book you want to reread and refer to at regular intervals. Cheap at twice the price.</span>
