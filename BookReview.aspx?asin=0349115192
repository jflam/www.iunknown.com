                    <span>Holden emulates Alvarez with this book. 
<br />Holden writes about trying to make it as a player for a year, culminating in playing in the World Series and chronicling that event in the way Alvarez does in BIGGEST GAME IN TOWN.
<br />Holden does a competent job.  As you read the book, you'll be entertained, even though the narrator is not always incredibly like-able.
<br />If you haven't read BIGGEST GAME IN TOWN, get that one first.  If you have already read the Alvarez, then BIG DEAL is worth checking out.</span>

                    <span>Big Deal is a vivid, charming tour many famous poker venues and events around the world through the eyes of a full-time writer and wannabe pro.  Mr. Holden is quite skilled as a journalist.  Through his description, one really feels like they are there in Malta as rain causes the roof to crumble.  He has a strong eye for important and interesting details.  Many of his quotations are invaluable and the book flows like words from the mouth of Amarillo Slim.  The narrator has his own issues but one cannot help but be sympathetic towards him and cheer for his doomed attempts in becoming a poker legend.
<br />  
<br />The book will completely appeal to dreamers on every continent who wish to avoid spending the rest of their days working for the man (or mam as the case often is nowadays).  
<br />
<br />His trip to the psychologist and brief discussion of the psychology behind gambling was enlightening.  I learned from his "shrink's" perspective and welcomed the alternative hypothesis concerning what makes people gamble.  Saying it's simply masochism alone is in no way a universal explanation.
<br />  
<br />As a narrator, Holden unfortunately introduces some politics into his text.  He exudes smug anti-Americanism in spades.  (Yawn...)  He appears to think the majority of us are uncouth and disinterested in the finer things of life although his friend Eric Drache obviously belies his stereotyped impressions.   He makes digs about Margaret Thatcher and embraces the foppish left-wing notions of many in the English elite but there is no substance behind his snarky comments.  Holden intentionally describes some hick at the table as predictably being a Republican.  Southerners are also a target and to think, just because a gambling event in Louisiana was cancelled, that nothing has changed in the south in 150 years time is absurd, flawd, and deeply prejudiced. 
<br />
<br />He notes that many poker players are right wing, but why they are is the crucial angle he refuses to explore.  All poker players are capitalists by definition--whether they admit it or not.  Maximizing profit is why we sit at the table.  Those who play should be opposed to redistributionist schemes.  True social justice is about keeping what you've earned which is what poker is all about.  Oh well, such mindless political asides are not representative of the whole book but they are annoying enough to keep me from giving it five stars.  Otherwise, good show London Tony!

                    <span>British journalist Holden recounts a year in his life spent travelling the world playing poker, his training course for the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.<p>A classic of poker writing, it makes me ask whether all poker writers know each other.  The other best-read in the category is A. Alvarez's The Biggest Game in Town.  Alvarez and Holden are regulars at their Tuesday Night Game in London. Another well-known author David Spanier (Total Poker) reports on Holden's playing for a UK newspaper.<p>The book is wide-ranging: from a brief history of the game to exciting card-by-card retelling of hands. It even teaches you the odds in Texas Hold 'Em.  If you like the game, you will enjoy this book.<p>Follow this up with Positively Fifth Street by James McManus, a new poker saga inspired by Holden and Alvarez.</span>

                    <span>Jounalist 'London' Tony Holden, clearly no slouch at the poker table, is emboldened by a boss placement at the World Series of poker (he finished ninetieth).  He decides to see if he can 'run with the big boys,' or become a professional poker player.  Thus begins a year of much intercontinental travel and poker play.  Reading this account, it helps to be familiar with card games, especially Texas Hold 'Em; if you're not you might be perplexed or just bored by the play-by-plays of various hands ('the flop was a Qc-Kh-7c... Did the river hold an ace?').  But you need know nothing about gambling to enjoy Holden's breezy writing style: within these pages lie more than a few telling and insightful remarks on the foibles of gamblers, on his own gambling obsession (courtesy of a shrink Holden hires for that purpose), on the history of gambling and cards, especially in America, and the crazed capitalism concentrate that is Las Vegas.  It's good stuff, delivered with the wisdom of a seasoned traveler and the self-effacement of a confirmed Briton.  The book probably isn't representative of what might happen if Joe Public were to start mixing it up with the pros of poker; given the ease with which Holden mops up most of his competition, and regularly busts out old pros, he must be one of the better players out there.  But if you're looking for a book that takes a hard, sympathetic look at the culture of gambling, this is a good one.</span>
