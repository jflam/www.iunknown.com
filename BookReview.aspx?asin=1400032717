                    <span>A quite stunning book. Picked it up whilst on holiday, and finished it in one sitting. A unique story which in turns will make you laugh and want to cry. Don't be put off in thinking that this is a book for children - it works just as well for adults. A fine insight in to how the mind of an autistic child works. Recommended.

                    <span>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is one of those books that you hear everybody talking about and reccomending to you and that's been on the best seller list for the past couple of months. I felt that the only reason that I should read it was because everyone was talking about it so much;I didn't think I'd actually enjoy it. I was very wrong.
<br />The main character, Christopher John Francis Boone, is autistic. Therefore to enhance the fact that he's autistic, the author writes the book sort of choppily, for example, there might be five paragraphs in a row that begin with the word "and". You come to understand the character's actions, no matter how extravagant and awkward, and begin to understand autistic people in general. As well as this, Christopher is bursting with bits of knowledge that are interesting to know as well as the story.
<br />In the beginning of the book, Christopher finds his neighbor's dog impaled upon a garden fork in her yard. Having read Hound of the Baskerville's, he is very much into detective work and decides to try to figure out who killed the dog. The story just takes off from there and Christopher ends up hip deep in trouble and still manages to weasle his way out of it.
<br />Don't hesitate, read this book!</span>

                    <span>I can't tell you how much I loved this book.  I finished it in just two days, and within a week had recommended it to at least five people.  I keep hearing back how much they liked the book too!
<br />As a teacher, I relish the insight this book gave.  I've had many autistic students, and now I feel so much more of a connection to them.  It's as if I've been allowed to see into the brain of an autistic boy, which makes it so much easier to identify and to understand the autistic students that I meet.</span>

                    <span>I thought the book was interesting, but I was not captured by it. I found it even a little boring.  I bought the book, because I thought Veronica Haddon and Mark Haddon were related, but I was wrong.  I loved Whispers of the wicked saints, but I can not recomend this book.</span>

                    <span>The story of this book is actually pretty cool! I like the whole dog-murder-mystery thing, it was a very neat idea.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, this little bit of story is only filler, used in-between the author's little siderants about reality and science.  It's cool, I guess any way to get a lot of people exposed to science and philosophical ideas is neat...but it's so forced that I found it a bit painful :(
<br />
<br />I think it's most interesting how the author chose to deliver these spiffy thoughts of his, though. An autistic character is a clever background reason to go off on 'smart' tangents.  If only they were just-as-cleverly integrated into the story, instead of just scattering a story around them.
<br />
<br />Good book I guess, if you're into that sorta thing.</span>
