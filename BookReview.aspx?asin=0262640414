                <span id="Label1">". . . the bible of `post-PC' thinking." -- <i>Business Week</i>  <P>"Don Norman has established himself as high technology's leading thinker on user interfaces and on why PCs are too complex." -- <i>Wall Street Journal</i>  <P>Technologies have a life cycle, says Donald A. Norman, and they must change as they pass from youth to maturity. Alas, the computer industry thinks it is still in its rebellious teenage years, exalting in technical complexity. Customers want change. They are ready for products that offer convenience, ease of use, and pleasure. The technology should be invisible, hidden from sight.  <P>In this book Norman shows why the computer is so difficult to use and why this complexity is fundamental to its nature. The only answer is to develop information appliances that fit people's needs and lives. To do this, companies have to change the way they develop products. They need to start with an understanding of people: user needs first, technology last--the opposite of how things are done now.</span>

                    <span>His basic argument in this book is that the computer industry has matured to the point where it can no longer just cater to the early-adopter technologists and must appeal to the masses to continue growth. Unfortunately, the industry doesn't know how to do this and continues to deliver technology for technology's sake, leading to fat computers and technology that aren't that useful or appealing to most people, and are beginning to exhaust the technologists too. He introduces some recent, but standard models of technology adoption for discussing the problems, customer-centered design in cross-disciplinary teams (marketing, engineering, and user experience) for designing products that transcend the problems (explicitly discussing Contextual Design a few times), and "information appliances," multitudes of small, task-focused technology products that will replace our big, cumbersome, general-purpose (but not great at any) PCs.<P>Norman's forte is definitely cognitive and experimental psychology in product design, and not being a technological or product development process visionary. I found very little new or interesting content in the book, and I don't think he articulated even some of the derived ideas very well. The whole book could have been condensed into a long magazine article. His prose is wordy and redundant, and the book is regrettfully lacking in many of the detailed case studies and examples he's used in previous books to elucidate his ideas. I want the idiosyncratic and outspoken psychologist professor back, such as he was in The Design of Everyday Things, or the powerful academic argument of Things That Make Us Smart. His short stint as a VP of HPs "Information Appliances" division, and his earlier work at Apple, was not enough to give him a deep understanding or insight into the problems of the current technology-product market.<P>He does make some good book recommendations, however, and I'll add my favorite articulation of the problem, that I think articulate the problem and potential solutions much better:<P>C. M. Christensen, _The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail_, 1997. G. A. Moore, _Crossing The Chasm: Marketingand Selling High-Tech Goods to Mainstream Customers_, 1991. T. K. Landauer, _The Trouble With Computers: Usefulness, Usability, and Productivity_, 1995.</span>

                    <span>The book is a rallying cry for the technology industry, a call to arms for the geek troops. Sure, the writing is like a beta version that the publisher decided to go live with, but the essential concepts and emotion come through loud and clear.<P>Norman builds a solid foundation for his arguments, citing historical cases and several written works. The book was a fun, easy read. When I finished Invisible Computer, I felt the same sort of illumination and clarity that came after reading Alan Cooper's About Face.<P>His vision of ubiquitous information appliances and devices will undoubtedly come true in ways none of us can imagine. But what will become of the PC? Will I have 100 individual devices replacing the 100 software programs I have installed? Hardly. But the book doesn't really address the ongoing need for a general purpose computer.<P>In the end, I would recommend this book to anyone involved in technology. It definitely altered my personal perception of where tech products have come from and where they are headed. Time will tell if his ideas are strong enough to truly help shape the future of software and product development.</span>

                    <span>I'm a fan of Donald Norman's work so when I finally had a<BR>chance to pick up "The Invisible Computer" I had high hopes.<BR>Unfortunately, this work didn't provide the same insight and<BR>focus as his previous books such as "The Design of Everyday<BR>Things".<P>Throughout the work Norman draws upon "Crossing the Chasm"<BR>and "Inside the Tornado: Marketing Strategies from Silicon<BR>Valley's Cutting Edge" [both by Geoffrey Moore]. Also<BR>heavily emphasized are the ideas put forth by "The<P>Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms<BR>to Fail." All of these books are interesting--but I wanted<BR>something from Norman himself.<P>Chapter 7, "Being Analog", was more in line with what I had<BR>come to expect from Norman. He ends this chapter with this:<BR>"Alas, most of today's machines, especially the computer,<BR>force people to use them on their own terms, terms that are<BR>antithetical to the way people work and think. The result is<BR>frustration, an increase in the rate of error (usually<BR>blamed on the user--human error--instead of on faulty<BR>design), and a general turning away from technology. Will<BR>the interaction between people and machines be done<BR>correctly in the future? Might schools of computer science<BR>start teaching the human-centered approach that is necessary<BR>to reverse the trend? I don't see why not." That's what I'm<BR>looking for! If only the rest of the book had followed that<BR>passion.<P>Instead focusing on human factors and man-machine<P>interface issues, Norman wanders discussing substitutable<BR>goods vs. nonsubstitutable goods, a rehash of why software<BR>is hard to write (and the mythical man month), and even some<BR>embarrassing admissions now that he'd spent some time outside<BR>academia and worked a bit in industry: "Time, or rather the<BR>lack of it, I was starting to learn, is one of the greatest<BR>barriers to quality". As my young nieces would say to me,<BR>"duh!"<P>Finally, although written in the late 1990's with the<P>paperback edition published in 1998, I found the text to<BR>already be a bit dated. You don't realize how quickly the<BR>computer industry moves until you find a book frozen in time<BR>like this one.<P>My recommendation is to read Norman's other works and the<BR>works he recommends here (Crossing the Chasm, Inside the<BR>Tornado, and Innovator's Dilemma). Finally, I recommend<BR>"Machine Beauty" by David Gelernter. It provides more<BR>passion and keener insights than this work--and is generally<BR>more fun to read!</span>

                    <span>This book covers in detail the role technology has pervasively interrupted our lives by intruding into everyday living. His major point is that we should have small, independent devices that do one task and one task well, rather than a general-purpose computer to do many tasks. Personally as a technologist I disagree with his major assumptions and points and found the book and some of it's major themes troubling.<P>An example is the way children interact with computers compared to senior citizens. When a child grows up with something is becomes natural. Most children who have access to a computer at an early stage find it as natural as using a video/DVD player, television or CD player. If the technology is introduced at an early stage it become part of the natural language of the child. Normal disagrees with this, and I think although he is a well researched observer that this is one failing of the book.<P>It wasn't until I reached the last quarter of the book that I could start to agree with his ideas and see the point he was trying to make. That is that some devices work as an appliance. The examples of the TiVo (which we don't have here in Australia) seem best to fit the example. They do one thing, and do it well. Network Computers are the other example, where the complexity of the device is hidden from the user (although he still feels uncomfortable with NC's as they are still "computers".)<P>Norman's style of writing made me think I had skipped back a few pages every now and then as he often will repeat himself in greater detail over points he thinks are important.<P>If you're a technologist you should read it. But don't take it as gospel. Although Normal is correct in some of his point, you need to use your own experience and environment to understand the points he is trying to make, rather than accepting them carte blanch.</span>
