                <span id="Label1"><HTML><P><B><I>C Primer Plus</B></I> is a conversational-style book aimed at those new to C programming. A friendly and easy-to-use self-study guide, this book will be appropriate for serious students of programming, as well as developers proficient in other languages with a desire to better understand the fundamentals of this core language.</P><P>As with all the editions, author <B>Stephen Prata's</B> aim has been to create an introduction to C that is instructive, clear, and helpful. Programming concepts are explained along with details of the C language; the book does not assume that you are a professional programmer. Many short, easily typed examples illustrate just one or two concepts at a time, since learning by doing is one of the most effective ways to master new information. Finally, review questions and programming exercises at the end of each chapter punctuate the most critical information and help readers digest the most difficult concepts. The text has been updated to accommodate the emergence of a new standard for C-C99.</P></span>

                    <span>I am relatively new to the subject (Having purchased K & R's programming c, second edition prior to this--no success) and I have to admit, after only three days I'm already into chapter five and have a vast understanding of the language. What I like, personally, is that they go about explaining the code in a no-non-sense way, being that they relate the practice code to something you can remember (i.e. explaining code using everyday words, such as using days of the week for enum). The only problem I have with the book is that they like to repeat information over and over...I suppose it is a good teaching trick but after a while this becomes rather tiresome. Overall...I'd give it 4 stars.</span>

                    <span>This book is simple enough for the beginning programmer and advanced enough to get you a very solid base in C. It is the best programming book I've read. I cant tell you how helpful it is. In my book all errors have been fixed and since I bought it a few months ago so there should'nt be any errors left anymore. The code for the book is easily attainable through Sams online website www.samspublishing.com too. Excellence!</span>

                    <span>C Primer Plus by Stephen Prata is a well-paced book to learning C. It has examples of the concepts in every section, and he doesn't gloss over important topics that are key to further your learning such as pointers. I would like to give this book 5 stars, but it suffers from quite a few errors. Not just errors in the descriptions, but errors in explaining code and errors in the examples. They aren't critical errors, and makes for a little bit of fun finding the errors.<p>An example of errors in 4th edition:<p>While explaining two-dimensional arrays, here a a glaring error:<br>---<br>#define COLS 4<br>int sum2d(int ar[][COLS], int rows)<br>{<br><code><br>}<p>You can use it with any of the following function calls:<p>tot = sum2(array1, 5);  // sum of a 5x4 array<br>tot = sum2(array2, 100); // sum of a 100x4 array<br>tot = sum2(array3, 2); // sum of a 5 x 2 array<br>---<p>The last example function call is incorrect, and he goes on in the next chapter explaining how the sum2d function would required to be changed to support more rows. There are 3-5 errors per chapter like this.<p>Solid 'B-'.</span>

                    <span>This is the book that you want.<br>This book covers enough for you to use the language well, and it is quite detailed. In fact, this book is great teaching material for people who wanted to learn C. Not to mention the appendix covers many of the library function that came with a typical compiler, and the explanation throughout the book is clear, and easily understood.<br>Prata's C Primer Plus, and C++ Primer Plus, is essential for any programmer who wants to learn C/C++. Once you grasp the basics of the language, you would still want these books for reference.</span>

                    <span>Wow! What an awesome book! First, let me tell you that I had tried many a time to learn C before, but until I read this book it wasn't "sinking in" (important things like pointers, the fact that functions copied their parameters and that's why scanf() uses the address, etc). Of course, the bits and pieces that I did pick up probably helped quite a bit (in fact, I'm sure they did).<p>This book basically teaches you the majority of C's syntax, only the most important library functions, and finally, a little bit about coding style (sprinkled throughout the text). It also does a VERY GOOD job of explaining binary, hex and octal numbers and binary operations like and, or, and xor (among others). Oh, and when I say syntax, I mean syntax; I'm not referring to library functions, which are so numerous that one should use either an online or hard-copy manual for them (although, as I say, the most important ones are, of course, covered). Make sure to look somewhere else for information on realloc(), and strdup() comes in handy if you're using the GCC compiler.<p>The only thing I might say is a tad lacking in this text is something that most introductory texts ("primers") don't talk all that much about. The very last chapter tries to explain linked lists, queues, and binary search trees. They do a good job of explaining them and of how ADTs work, etc., but I am still thinking I can get a better explanation. They did do a pretty good job for squeezing it into one chapter, though.But don't let that slight problem steer you away from this book! If you want to learn C, START WITH THIS BOOK!!<p>I just ordered another book called "Mastering Algorithms in C" (by Kyle Loudon) that I'm hoping will be a good "next step". It covers not only linked lists, queues, and binary search trees, but several other algorithms that are commonly used and seem to be handy. Before teaching you these algorithms, however, pointers, recursion and "algorithm basics" are covered. From reading the user reviews I've decided that's probably the way to go, but don't take my word for it; all I'm saying is that after this book, it's probably a good idea to find a book on algorithms as your "next step".<p>Happy reading! :-)</span>
