                    <span>I loved this book.  As a New Englander who was only 6 years old at the time of the inauguration, I can no longer tell if I remember watching the Inaugural or if over the years seeing the newsclips and videos at the JFK Library have indelibly stamped his words in my brain.  In any case, the book made me want to hear the speech again.  A visit to the Library during my next visit to Boston may be in order.
<br />
<br />One bone to pick.  How is it that a regular person like me constantly finds errors in books that seem to be otherwise well-researched and the editors don't catch them?  Henry Fonda's ex-wife who was at Joseph Alsop's party was named Afdera, not Alfreda.  Errors like that drive me nuts.</span>

                    <span>I found it a fascinating book. Thurston Clarke's painstaking research and subsequent account of JFK's inaugural address recaptures a moment in time in a unique and intriguing way. I felt transported back to being ten years old, home from school due to heavy snow,watching the television coverage, but with the wisdom of Clarke's story on my side. My daughter, who obviously was not alive in 1961, but is a student of the history of the 60's, was similarly transfixed by Ask Not.</span>

                    <span>Thurston Clarke has created a well written account of both this impressive speech and the forces at play that caused it to have an enormous impact on a generation. It is a must read for anyone interested in better understanding the outpouring of altruism fostered by Kennedy's call to service.</span>

                    <span>This is another wonderful book from Thurston Clarke, who is well known for his meticulous research, rich detail, funny anecdotes, powerful writing.   Once again we, the reader, are pulled into a vivid story about which we already have  strong memories and impressions.  ASK NOT illuminates and refreshes and untangles our memories of Kennedy's inspiring and challenging words.  We are reminded of how uplifted we felt on first hearing his inaugural address 45 years ago.  Clarke's complete picture of the preparation for the speech and the inaugural celebrations bring alive a wonderful chapter in our history.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Having come of age with JFK's election, having watched that inauguration speech on an old black-and-white television, Thurston Clarke's book brought it all back to me, the hopes and aspirations, all of the energy and goodness in America that we has lost in America in these days of rage and war.
<br />
<br />Yes, it was a special moment, and what Kennedy said was very special, and having Clarke recall it now reminds us that it is still possible to do good in the world (i.e. the Peace Corps)and still be a friend to other nations. 
<br />
<br />What is also impressive about ASK NOT are all the background details that Clarke has collected, the stories no one has told us how Kennedy built his speech, line-by-line, and delivered it to the world on that cold January morning. It is so reassuring to know that once we had a president who actually wrote the words he spoke. How refreshing and surprising. And how refreshing it is to read Clarke's prose. He is someone who writes like an angel and tells his story as if it were a mystery waiting to be solved. If I could, I'd give ASK NOT six ******.
