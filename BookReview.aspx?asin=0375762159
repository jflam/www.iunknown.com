                    <span>Grammar is boring, frustrating, and complex.  At least, that's the impression I got from taking it in school.  This book attempts to take a fun (well, not-so-boring) approach to explain it all... And for the most part it does well.  It's concise, and the examples are good. Where things fall apart is when the book refers to parts of grammar that haven't been explained yet.  For example, starting with Quick Quiz #8 (page 25), the reader is asked to identify prepositional phrases, but phrases and clauses aren't covered until page 59. Naturally, you'll miss a lot of the questions.  The answers to the quizzes seldom have explanations. If an answer seems to contradict a grammar rule or just not make sense, you're left hanging. Discouraging? You bet. If you were confused by grammar in school, this book may help -- but don't expect it to answer all your questions or eliminate frustration with the topic.</span>

                    <span>A very good no-frills book that is an instant cure for all sorts of grammar problems. Don't expect the flashy, "cute" approach that many modern grammar books have adopted, but rather just sit back and enjoy a straightforward no-nonsense approach to grammar that is understandable to even the most hardened grammarphobe. A great read for those interested in grammar or those wishing to polish up their everyday speech and writing.</span>
