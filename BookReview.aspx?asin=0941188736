                    <span>This book is intended for new filmmakers, film buffs and as reference for experienced filmmakers. It introduces the reader to many types of shots and opens one's eyes to many possibilities. Unfortunately, it seems that the negative reviews about this book are centered around it being too simplistic or basic. I believe those reviewers did not understand the intent behind this book and missed the point entirely. I think all subjects should start with the very basics and describe what the goal is first, then one can address how to achieve it technically (which is not what this book is necessarily about). If I had any complaints, it would only be a couple of minor points. The first is that there are a few technical words used, but are not defined for the reader, who has to then look elsewhere to understand them. Next, although the authors clearly state that they had to invent many terms to describe certain shots, there is no way to distinguish which are the standard terms and which are the made-up ones. Otherwise, this is an excellent first step for any new filmmaker and also a great reference for finding the perfect shot for any scene you need help coming up with. And most certainly, I am not going to complain that is was too simple to read and clearly illustrated! I wish all books were written this straight forward!</span>

                    <span>This is without a doubt one of the most worst books I have ever read. It is written for a child and has a tone which will be insulting to anyone who is intersted in professional film making.<P>In some cases the author is simply incorrect in his terminology. The author is a wannabe film maker who has a snowball's chance in hell of ever doing anything other than to write this innane piece of crap.<P>This book was obviously not written by a professional film maker, but by an amateur for amateurs. <P>The illustrator claims to be a "professional". The illustrations for this book are equally bad.<P>Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper.</span>

                    <span>...open this book and point to the page.<P>A previous reviewer complained that all this book does is show the shot. Presumably that person wanted a to-do list of which knobs to turn, what equipment to set up, how much the rentals should be, etc etc etc.<P>When I write a shooting script, I use the camera terms here as *verbs*. "Dolly past [character] and Spin Around" Anybody in the crew who does not understand is handed the book. Quickly I get "Oh, THAT's what you mean."<P>In fact I bought more books for that purpose alone.<P>Gee, what a shame it's not in color photographs. Gosh it might even be better in 3D. How about virtual camera moves holographiclly jumping off the page?<P>Get real. This is an idea book. Look. Get the idea. Get to work.<P>Got it?</span>

                    <span>This book is a big disappointment for me. It spends 1 page or less on each shot and offers little insight. Be sure to look at the sample pages (particularly excerpts 2, 3 and 4). That's all you get about pan, tilt, and dolly from the book. May be good for your elementary school kid who tells you, "I wanna make a movie!"</span>
