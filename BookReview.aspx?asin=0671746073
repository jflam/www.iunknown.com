                    <span>I regularly give public talks, and am always looking for ways to improve my speaking and organizational abilities. On a lark, I picked this up from a friend's bookshelf, and simply couldn't put it down, eventually buying my own copy. It isn't only that the author offers highly useful, practical information regarding poise, confidence, and organization, but also writes with a level of skill that is truly rare. I recommend this book not only to burgeoning and expert public speakers alike, but also to writers interested in reading truly masterful prose.</span>

                    <span>I was asked to speak to out local church group recently. With little to no public speaking experience, I went out and got this book rather than decline to speak (a thought that had crossed my mind)<p>My presentation went over in a big way. It was very successful. The tips and advice really worked. In fact, they worked so well that I have since joined toastmasters and have bought other books on public speaking.<p>From zero to above average public speaker. Thank you Mr. Carnegie!</span>

                    <span>Let there be no pretenses -- I'm a loser.<br> <br>Always have been, always will be.  That's just the type of person I am, and nothing is going to change that.  So when the guy sitting next to me at work recommended that I read, "How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People", I was skeptical.<br> <br>First of all, I don't even think this guy likes me.  He probably thinks I'm a dork because I've never had a girlfriend.  It's not like I can help it -- girls don't like guys like me.  They want someone that drives a fast car and can drink lots of beer.  Sorry, but I'll never be cool like that.<br> <br>Well, I did what he said, and read the book.  It's good -- I guess -- but I don't see how it's going to help me.  It's not like girls are going to start talking to me now that I've read this book.  No matter what I do, they're always going to think that I'm a loser.<br> <br>There are a couple of things in this book that might help me increase my self-confidence and my ability to influence people, but I doubt it.</span>
