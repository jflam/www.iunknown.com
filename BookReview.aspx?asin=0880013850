                <span id="Label1">Yes, the same Joyce Carol Oates who packs one of the most lethal punches in American literature also happens to be an astute observer of the sweet science. Oates filters her knockout collection of essays through multifaceted prisms of art, history, sexuality, and politics to directly confront and explore boxing's physical and commercial brutality, but also the sense of human struggle and survival that's at boxing's purest core. "In the boxing ring," she writes, "man is <i>in extremis,</i> performing an atavistic rite ... for the mysterious solace of those who can participate only vicariously in such drama: the drama of life in the flesh. Boxing has become America's tragic theater." And from her ringside perspective, Oates, a true heavyweight of letters, analyzes the performances just brilliantly.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I agree with the Swedish reviewer.  This book is too cosmic for my tastes.  In a funny way I think Oates is aware of the trap she has set for herself.  At the outset she says, "if you have seen five hundred boxing matches you have seen five hundred boxing matches and their common denominator, which certainly exists, is not of primary interest to you.  `If the Host is only a symbol,' the Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor once remarked, `I'd say the hell with it.'"  (Pp. 4-5.)
<br />
<br />Having said that a fight is a fight, that generalizations are secondary, that symbolism is worthless, she proceeds to play philosopher for half the book.  There is no relief from the earnestness.  However, when she gets around to Mike Tyson, the pre-road-rage Tyson, I found a lot more to grab onto.  Her rather sweet portrayal of the young champ is satisfyingly concrete, and certainly a kind of bizarre period piece in light of subsequent events in Tyson's life.
<br />
<br />Coincidentally I read the following passage in American Heritage Magazine while I was reading this book.  It's from an interview with sportswriter W.C. Heinz, now 86.  Without coming within ten feet of a word like "homoerotic," it illustrates one of Oates's points and finishes with a memorable, upbeat image:
<br />
<br />"When two fighters fight a hell of a battle, there's later a liking between them.  This was true of Joe Walcott and Rocky Marciano.  Marciano took him out in the thirteenth round of their great first championship fight, but Joe also knocked down Rocky in the first round.  Rocky had never been down before, and the next day I was interviewing him and I asked him, "What were you thinking when you went down?"  He had a wonderful fighter's remark.  He said:  "I was thinking, `This guy can really punch.  This will be one hell of a fight.'"
<br />
<br />I enjoy this kind of writing better.  To my way of thinking, the deep thoughts come off better when left unstated, or sprinkled in carefully within more definite imagery like this.

                    <span>Oates Writes Like Ali Danced<p>4.25 Stars<p>I really enjoyed this book.<p>There's another reviewer (Ensio N. Mikkols) who said it best - "The Lady Knows Boxing" and she really does.<p>I was on the fence about reading this. I went back and forth trying to decide and finally just went for it and I'm glad I did.<p>Oates has a great and unique perspective on boxing as an art and science. She sounds like she's been around boxing her whole life and has a respect for it.<p>Her writing style is fancy, elegant and adds respectability to the sweet science.<p>I love her take on Mike Tyson - I hate that most writers make him sound like a monster. Oates knows he's human and shows him in a fair, understanding and empathetic light.<p>One sign of a great book is what it leaves you with or what it inspires you to do. I'm left with a greater respect and understanding of the sweet science of bruising and am inspired to read and learn more about Mike Tyson.</span>

                    <span>I am still stunned that a person who has never been in the ring could have gained insights into boxing as powerful as the ones Oates pulled together in this book. And I'm grateful (and stunned) that a woman could be as sympathetic, not just to fighters, but to men and manhood, as Oates has managed to be in this book. <p>I am a serious amateur fighter and a sparring partner to the professional fighters I train with. I do gym work or road work five days a week with a former-professional trainer who was also a two-time NY Golden Gloves champion and junior Olympian. I spar Glovers and pros and I love it. I understand boxing and the love for boxing. The gist of my review here is this: After I read this book I realized I didn't understand my love for boxing -- where it comes from and what it all means and what it is I'm doing exactly -- as well as Joyce Carol Oates does. This woman is amazing to me. I've never read her fiction, but I will.<p>The first section of this book, the one in which Oates seemingly tries to take on boxing and what it means from every imaginable angle, is best. This is one of those very, very few books that made me fold down corners so that I can easily return to specific passages. I don't know if non-fighters will really understand this book, or if many fighters will ever bother to read it. But I'm damned glad I did and damned glad Ms. Oates is out there writing.</span>
