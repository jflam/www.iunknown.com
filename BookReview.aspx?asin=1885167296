                    <span>Possibly the best marketing book I have read in years. Ogilvy on Advertising is the book that deserves that title when it comes to solid techniques and guidlines. The Wizards of Ads however goes way beyond technique to human nature and service factors; it is more of a structureless marketing book than it is an advertising book. You will not find any principles of design or definitions of Reach here, but you will definitely find a lot of wisdom.<P>The Book is divided into 100 + 1 chapters and is about 200 pages long. Which means that each chapter averages 2 pages. I could read 2 chapters between meetings. The last chapter being an epic on service, not advertising but plain service, plain ownership of responsibilty for your job. "A message to Garcia" I passed copies of it to my clients and associates.<P>I was very interested in this book when I started reading it. I am currently reading 4 different books, the reviews for which will appear soon (Focus, Unvanquished, Spin Selling, & Management Challenges of the 21st century) - I received The Wizard while reading the first 3 of the above mentioned books, of course it occupied all my reading time for 2 days and was finished before any of them.<P>You will definitly enjoy this book. I most certainly did.</span>

                    <span>In a way, the title of this book (also the nickname of the author, Roy Williams) is somewhat misleading. It suggests that only advertising mavens need read the book, but that is not so. This amazing writer/thinker has challenging insights for virtually anyone who communicates for a living, or who simply likes to communicate well. The short, one page chapters are perfect for quick reading on a regular basis. However, don't be surprised--the Wizard's writing is like Lay's potato chips...you can't eat just one. I would recommend it as a gift for anyone who communicates and wants to grow in that skill.</span>

                    <span>There are two things I really like about this book:<BR>1. Each chapter is small on length and long on meaning<BR>2. Not only does it talk about the power of words, every page is an example of how to do it RIGHT!<P>Use this book to get the juices flowing when you feel you are stuck in a rut, or need some inspiration for that next campaign.</span>

                    <span>I'm rereading this book for the second time. Not that it's impossible to comprehend, but I'm a bit wary of making the leap. The book makes it sound easy, but what book doesn't?<P>My hairdresser suggested I get it and Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired. According to her, her business is growing by leaps and bounds. <P>Nonetheless, I remain unconvinced. My husband thinks "now is the time." I told him to tell it to Ford's Edsel people.<P>Still, in a sense of fairness, I would recommend Williams' book to those who are determined to own their own business. I wish them luck.</span>
