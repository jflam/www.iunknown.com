                <span id="Label1">Whether you are the one who leaves or the one who is left, divorce is a painful, wrenching experience, explains author Debbie Ford. Since Ford is comfortable dwelling in the shadow side of life, it's not surprising that she believes that the excruciating pain of divorce can lead to enormous spiritual growth. "Emotional turmoil can be a powerful catalyst to reconnect us with our divine nature," she writes. "It propels us into a journey of self discovery and urges us to learn how to love and accept our entire being." Herein lies the promise of a "spiritual divorce."   <p>  Because Ford is a highly effective workshop leader, she has a knack for breaking down spiritual matters into manageable bites. She is also willing to share the truth of her own painful divorce, allowing readers to see her initial pain and consuming resentments. Ford divides her book into seven laws, beginning with the "The Law of Acceptance," where readers are asked to imagine a benevolent divine order at play rather than taking a blaming stance. In the section titled "The Law of Responsibility," Ford encourages readers to gently begin the process of taking responsibility for their own darkest qualities. This is the thrust of Ford's highly respected shadow work--illuminating the dark side so we can stand in divine light. Each section ends with "Healing Action Steps," where Ford suggests specific exercises or meditations. For example, in the final chapter Ford asks readers to make a new "divorce vow" that is a lifelong commitment to one's highest self. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent, slim little book.  It's one of those books which improve every time you read it -- and you should read it more than once.  If you're recently separated and feel as if your life is topsy-turvy, read this book.  Then, read it again a few months later.  Your perspective shifts and you get something else, equally valuable and meaningful.  If you do proceed to divorce, read it again. Again, you will find something new which will help you go on to build a wonderful life for yourself.  
<br />
<br />I agree that this book is not just for married people.  It's for anyone who has felt betrayed in an intimate relationship of any sort.  Debbie Ford stresses that it's your life and your spirituality which must be upheld, even in the darkest of times.  This book goes a long way toward helping you do just that.</span>

                    <span>As a guy who was going through a painful divorce, this book was a Godsend. Although portions of it might be described as "psycho-babble", for the most part it is nothing other than gold. The chapters on "Acceptance" and "Surrendering" changed my healing process dramatically and forever changed my perspective on life. In the darkest times of the divorce, I found myself going back to the book time and time again. </span>

                    <span>This book gave me the tools to end my marriage peacefully and amicably with my now ex-husband.  It allowed me to see the end of my marriage not as a failure, but as a success.  As I got more into the book, the more excited I became over the rightness in me.  I read it while on vacation and when the vacation was over and the marriage was truly winding down, I was able to truly thank my ex-husband for the lessons I learned about myself through him.  I could not have done this without this wonderful book.  I have since referred this book to many people and all agree that it changes their outlook on divorce in a most positive way.  <p>Debbie Ford is a talented, thoughtful writer.  As in her book "The Dark Side of the Light Chasers" (another MUST read), she shows you that out of the most painful experiences can sometimes come the most joyful lessons.<p>Everyone contemplating a divorce should read this book.</span>

                    <span>I asked how you spiritually go through a divorce and this book has helped me maintain the path I knew I wanted to follow. A wonderfull look at self and how to recognize and work through the divorce process. How to Identify personality traits, actions that we all do and have happen in relationships that cause difficulties. This book will help you see you and those traits that cause problems. Including real life stories and helpful exercises. This has helped me see a way to be divorced without guilt, or anger. I am a better person for this book and I thank Debbie for her insights! Divorce hurts, but see why and maybe the pain will be a little less.</span>
