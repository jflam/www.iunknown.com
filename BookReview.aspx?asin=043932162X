                <span id="Label1">Now, the classic books from the library of the Hogwarts School of  Witchcraft and Wizardry--<I>Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them</I> and  <I>Quidditch Through the Ages</I>--are available in hardcover in a sturdy boxed  gift set. (These books are written by J.K. Rowling herself under the pseudonyms  Newt Scamander and Kennilworthy Whisp.) Finally, Muggles will have the chance to  discover where the Quintaped lives, what the Puffskein eats, and why it is best  not to leave milk out for a Knarl. The Quidditch textbook explains where the  Golden Snitch came from, how the Bludgers came into existence, and why the  Wigtown Wanderers have pictures of meat cleavers on their clothes. Both books,  designed to look like Harry Potter's actual, used Hogwarts textbooks, feature  silly scribblings from Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Proceeds from the sale of this  gift set will go to improving and saving the lives of children around the world.  Harry Potter fans, rejoice! (All ages)</span>

                    <span>For those of you who don't like Harry Potter, believe its of the devil, or simply can't get past the fact that its classified as a "kids" book - then this review is not for you.
<br />
<br />So now, for those who actually LIKE and appreciate the series -
<br />
<br />Im a big fan of the Harry Potter series... although I didnt become one until 2 years ago!  So - how could I NOT like if nothing but for the cuteness factor of it and the fact that it ties right in with the HP series - as being part of the "curriculum" at Hogwarts!  My favorite part of the books are the drawings, scribbles, and notes "written" back and forth between the kids (harry, hermione, ron).  They totally crack me up at times because they make referance to scenes from the book.  Its as if they "personally" used the books and doodled in them during class just like we all did as school kids during a boring lecture.. ;)  Its very cute and worth getting if you like little "special" additions that enhance the atmosphere of the imaginary Harry Potter world.</span>

                    <span>I used to be really interested in these books, but as I got older, they got less and less appealing. They are great for people who are  interested in the supernatural, and are no older than about twelve.</span>

                    <span>I haven't even looked through these completely yet and I already love them.  I actually haven't even opened the Quidditch book, the "Fantastic Beasts..." book is excellent enough!  Its like a dictionary of the different magical creatures.  And since it is supposed to have belonged to Harry, there are notes written here and there by Harry and Ron.  I would recommend buying this set for anyone who loves the Harry Potter books.</span>

                    <span>These books were excellent, like an extension of the much-loved main Harry Potter books with interesting content about creatures & quidditch history.  Of course the boxed set is better because it encloses two good books in one! I enjoyed them and the humurous notes along the margins, but did find the books somewhat monotonous at times.  
<br />A great reference book for HP fans!</span>
