                <span id="Label1">A master motivator who guided Notre Dame to the 1988 national college football championship, Lou Holtz knows how to win big on and off the gridiron. For business leaders, for recent college graduates struggling on their first job, or for just about anyone who wants to get ahead, Holtz devises a game plan for success: dream, believe, and achieve. "Write down everything you hope to achieve in life," Holtz writes. "Then make sure you do something every day to realize one of your dreams. You are going to encounter adversity but you will also ... take big, satisfying bites out of life."<P>  Holtz believes that people are capable of achieving just about anything if they learn to tap into the unrelenting powers inside themselves. He illustrates his points by drawing from moments in his rags-to-riches career as one of America's best college football coaches. Holtz's formula is simple: He calls it "WIN" or "What's Important Now." Holtz writes that if he can do it, anyone can. Despite being raised poor in a beat Ohio river town, later devastated by his parents' divorce, Holtz ended up with the best college football job in the country. Clearly, Holtz can get into the end zone. Follow his advice, and maybe you will, too. <I>--Dan Ring</I></span>

                    <span>I am a guy who doesn't read as much as I should but I couldn't put this book down. His stories are very motivating and delightful. I have begun to use the Coaches ideas in my professional and personal life. I have established a WIN attitude and I can't stop writing goals for myself. Thank You Coach for your words and enlightening approach to life. I am a big fan of Notre Dame and you but I guess I'll have to stock up on my Gamecocks gear now ! Good Luck and God Bless Lou Holtz and his family.</span>

                    <span>Wonderful, realistic lessons about life and winning. Several memorable and hilarious jokes, a lot of valuable advice. Two jokes come immediately to mind--the one about Holtz's non-request upon leaving Notre Dame, and the one about the fire truck with bad brakes. There are many others. This book really speaks to people where they are, and because it is modern, is probably more valuable than some of the classics like Think and Grow Rich, etc. Besides, coaches just have a special way of telling it like it is. A winner.</span>

                    <span>Online Review<P>	Lou Holtz has written a motivational book based on his coaching experiences. He has taken the lessons he has learned coaching athletes and applied them to everyday living. Coach Holtz will show you how to apply his ten rules for living to your life. He will show you how to become a winner and lead a successful life. I found Winning Every Day to be an interesting book. I believe I can apply his rules to my own life to be a better person. The examples he uses to make a point are interesting. Some examples are funny, some are sad. This is a good read.</span>
