                <span id="Label1">Much more than a quick list of commands and options, the <i>CVS Pocket Reference</i>, 2nd Edition, is packed with a surprising amount of detail-- including an overview of background concepts, thorough descriptions on how to use and administer a CVS repository, and discussions of CVS-related files and how to manage them-- all in a convenient reference format. This edition covers the CVS 1.11 and includes new commands for querying a central CVS repository, new configuration parameters, and new options for setting up a server for remote access. The book is a perfect companion for open source developers. The <i>CVS Pocket Reference</i> also contains tips on common tasks, such as converting projects from other revision control formats to CVS. It's an absolute must for developers who need an on-the-job guide for quick answers to CVS dilemmas. </span>

                    <span>If you are looking for a great quick reference guide for CVS... this is it. "CVS Pocket Reference" provides a substantial amount of information for those already familiar with the CVS tool.<P>If this is your first experience with CVS, this is not the book for you. However, if you have used CVS in the past... perfect reference tool.</span>

                    <span>This pocket reference summarises the basics of CVS. It's enough to get you going, but I wouldn't rely on it for a major project. The explanation of how CVS works is short; the part I've found most useful is the handy table of CVS commands and options in the second half of the book. <P>However, there is extensive online documentation for CVS that goes into far greater depth than this book, is more up to date, and is free. Even though I've had the book, I've still needed to refer to this online documentation to learn the finer points of tags, branching, and other CVS features. <P>So it's really a matter of whether you want to pay to have some (but not all) useful information in a handy booklet. If that appeals to you, great, this isn't a bad book. But you can certainly live without it by using your computer as a reference tool.</span>

                    <span>This book is so inferior to the available on-line documentation you shouldn't waste your money. The book is little more than an incomplete list of the available CVS commands with no helpful explainations.</span>

                    <span>A couple of years ago I started using CVS for large projects with lots of files. I bought this book back then, but have used it very little. Everything is in the UNIX man pages, and there is online documents.</span>

                    <span>This book fails to be a pocket reference. The book's index is a joke and as a result your topic of interest is not listed or, and that is a major drawback for reference books, discussed somewhere else. And if you find your topic the information presented is often not sufficient to answer your question. Although I keep this book within arm reach on my desk, I always use the web for my CVS questions. My advice for people with basic CVS knowledge and the ability to use CVS from the command line: search the web and pick one of the many CVS related web sites as your starting point for more information on CVS. This books does not keep up with the O'Reilly standards and is therefor best ignored.</span>
