                <span id="Label1">Getting the most out of your Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) applications is the goal of Eug&#232;ne Kain's <I>The MFC Answer Book</I>. Though it does not cover newer Internet Explorer-style enhancements, this title offers some indispensable tips for writing more attractive MFC applications in Visual C++.<p> The book begins with an excellent tour of the MFC document/view architecture. As the author notes, Visual C++ wizards let you generate simple, functional multiple-document interface (MDI) applications, but you're on your own after that. To remedy this gap, the author shares his expertise for building better MDI applications. He includes how to manage more than one view, as well as how to save and reload files effectively.<p> The same question-and-answer approach is used for such topics as views, dialog boxes, and property sheets. Standout tips here include how to size and control views, as well as how to change the color and font used for dialog controls. The author also shows you how to create applications that run in full-screen mode, just like in Microsoft Word 97. Toolbars, menus, and printing functions round out the tour.<p> Throughout this text, Kain provides plenty of short, clear programming examples that show exactly how to solve some of the most perplexing and common problems faced by the working MFC programmer. There's little doubt that <I>The MFC Answer Book</I> can save you hours of experimenting on your own; it can help you create significantly more responsive and appealing MFC programs. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>'The MFC Answer Book' has helped me tremendously. The style of the book is exactly what most people need. The table of contents is a list of questions in the form of 'How do I ...?' or 'What is the ...?' In the text of the problem you will find a brief explanation followed with step by step instructions on how to solve the problem. In just a short amount of time, I added the following features to my application: <P>1. A custom dockable tool bar to my application.<P>2. Docked the tool bar beside the default tool bar.<P>3. Added dialog controls to my tool bar.<P>4. Added tool tips to the controls on my CFormView.<P>5. Added UPDATE_COMMAND_UI notification to my CFormView.<P>6. Changed the font of a dialog control.<P>I just wish I had an excuse to apply more of the book to my application! Too bad that Microsoft doesn't provide help like this.</span>

                    <span>Someone who wrote a review on this book said he likes to know the stats of the people writing reviews, so here: Ag 29, Computer Science Major, graduating shortly, I write a lot of code for school, work, and play. I eat, drink, and sleep code, in all languages.<P>First off, this book should be retitled to: "MFC Document/View Answer Book", because what it really covers: documents, views, and a lot of good GUI tricks and tips. <P>That's not a complaint necessarily- for the project I initially bought this for, I only wanted something that handled document/view architecture and GUI tricks, so this book delivered. It's a great MFC resource and the structure (like an FAQ) is refreshing and easy to follow. <P>I can't give it 5 stars though just because I've got a couple problems with some of the code examples, which seem inaccurate or leave small hidden details out (which you then have to deduce from the code on the CD or figure out yourself). Nothing irks me more than omitted details that, in the end, are very important to what you're trying to convey. I'm not stupid- I can figure it out eventually, but I buy books just so I don't *have* to spend hours researching "how" to do something, or "why" I have to perform some bit of trickery to get the code to compile properly. <P>And I was dissapointed by the lack of abstract information about how to do certain things. A lot of the book is tailored toward specific types of implementations and it's up to you to deduce how to alter things to fit your application. Without some basic, general, foundation knowledge of certain things, it can be difficult to take the concepts in this book and extend them, or alter them to fit your application's specific needs. I guess the author just felt like this book was a starting point, and you could get the rest of the information from other sources (MSDN, etc). <P>It's still a great book though, and if you need to do MFC programming then I'd certainly get this book. So far it's the best MFC book in my library and some of the information is stuff that you're not going to find anywhere else without some considerable searching effort.</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for details about MFC this is NOT the book to buy. If you are looking for some "tricks" well then maybe this will work for you. The book is well enough written but lacks some detail about how the code works. But I am not an expert on MFC. If I could I would add 1/2 star to the 3 I gave.</span>

                    <span>This book is not all-inclusive, you should get Jeff Prosise's "Programming Windows with MFC" if you are looking for that. Instead, Kain's book is really the answers to the most frequent, irritating, and time-wasting little problems one finds while programming in MFC. This book should not really be necessary, except that MFC is so badly designed that little things that should be easy to do often end being a great waste of time, while the programmers search for the clumsy and roundabout way out. Should be in every MFC programmer's bookshelf.</span>
