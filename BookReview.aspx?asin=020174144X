                    <span>This is a fine, basic starter book for introduction to Adobe Acrobat 5 PDFs.  But if you are searching for anything more than the basics, be prepared to buy an additional, more-in-depth guide, in the way of follow up.  At several locations within this book, the author states, "... [a particular subject] is beyond the scope of this book."  But this is true of most of the QuickStart guides.  They are *perfect* for introduction to the concepts and basic use of platforms or software - and accomplish the task admirably well. But if you need guidance with the use of JavaScript, etc., in Acrobat, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I found the book a rapid and easy way to get a whole survey of all features of Arobat.  When completed, I knew of features I had no idea were there, and was surprised with many "that's cool" features.  Now when I have a future need, I will recall it from reading the book, and use it for reference to learn it in depth on a real application.  So, if you are looking for a complete survey you can complete in less that two days, this book is quite good for that purpose.</span>

                    <span>I give workshops on Adobe Acrobat to university faculty and staff, and I'm always asked for recommendations for a book on the topic. As far as I'm concerned, this is the ONLY book for beginning and intermediate Acrobat users. Adobe's Classroom in a Book, which could have been such a good idea, is riddled with errors (including errors on the CD that were there in the version 4 book), not very well written, and costs more than twice as much. <br>Jennifer Alspach has done a great job of taking a difficult, complex subject and making it interesting (and even fun, occasionally). The organization of the book is just right, and the topics are thoroughly covered. As an author, I also appreciate the nice layout and design and the high production quality from Peachpit Press. This is a must-have book if you are interested in Acrobat!</span>

                    <span>I teach Acrobat 5.0. I furnish 2 books to students (this book and Adobe Acrobat 5.0 Classroom in a Book). Once you understand the many uses of Acrobat, this book shows you how to perform the most frequently used tasks through step by step screenshots. It is the reference that should be on every users desk. After you have mastered these books, step up to Adobe Acrobat 5 PDF Bible by Ted Padova. <br>Adobe Acrobat is the tool that can take us to the paperless society. These books are your roadmap. May your journey be fun!</span>
