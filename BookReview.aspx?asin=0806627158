                    <span>Editors Paula S. Carlson and Peter S. Hawkins have compiled stories and essays from contemporary writers that reflect people's experience in dealings the life events, boredom, crises, losses, disappointments and unexpected touches of grace.  Some sections are painful to read and others are funny or joyful (like life itself.)  It is interesting that even in our secular society people still ask the questions Job asked and still try to find meaning for themselves like Abraham and Sarah.  The editors provide brief bios for the writers and propose discussion questions for groups.that might be helpful in groups. It seems that the problems of being human have not changed greatly in the last few thousand years.</span>

                    <span>Paula Carlson and Peter Hawkins have over the past several years pulled together short stories and a few essays, three volumes in all, from contemporary authors in which faith concerns of all types are raised.  The authors are first-rate and include the well known--John Updike, Flannery O'Connor, Gail Godwin,  John Cheever and others--to lesser known authors like Tillie Olsen and Tess Gallgher.  Each of the volumes includes a leader's guide, and volumes 1 and 2 include videos with interviews of the authors or of people who knew the author.  <p>These are excellent volumes for discussion groups that bring out the multitude of issues, problems, life crises that each of has or will face.  The relationship to faith and religion are sometimes clear, sometimes not so obvious, but all present situations of interest and, often, deep concern, for individuals.  Having facilitated two of this series, the atmosphere provided by the stories and their general literary excellence leads easily into discussions where people can reflect anew on the importance of grace and  the mystery of God in our lives</span>
