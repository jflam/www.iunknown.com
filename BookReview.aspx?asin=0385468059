                <span id="Label1">"The precious present has nothing to do with wishing. The richness of the precious present comes from its own source. The precious present is not something that someone gives you. It is something that you give to yourself." The parable of <I>The Precious Present</I> is a quiet one to muse upon and sit with, and finally to take into your heart. Spencer Johnson, coauthor of the bestselling business classic <I>The One Minute Manager</I>, has created a simple path for the reader to follow in the search for peace and clarity. While <I>The Precious Present</I> may read like a children's book for adults, its slow pace requires the mind to quiet down so that it can really register the meaning of Johnson's words. "The Present Is Simply Who I Am Just The Way I Am... Right Now. And It Is Precious." We may be familiar with this philosophy in theory, but the experience of reading <I>The Precious Present</I> is truly synchronous with its message. <I>--Jodie Buller</I></span>

                    <span>This book first called out to me from it's bookshelf as I walked by it in my local bookstore about a decade ago. I wasn't looking for a self help book, or a inspirational book, that day ... but for some reason the book just wouldn't let me walk past it. So I picked it up and started reading. And I read the whole book right there in the aisle of the bookstore (it's a quick read). It was so moving it brought a small tear to my eye before I finished reading.
<br />
<br />"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."  ~  Leonardo da Vinci
<br />
<br />Yes, this is a simple book. Simple enough for a child to read yet profound enough for a sage to cherish. If your life seems to have lost it's meaning and joy ... this book may be just the answer to your problems.
<br />
<br />In this book author Spenser Johnson (the co-author of the best-selling "One Minute Manager", and other popular self-help books) addresses both our material and spiritual needs. This is his classic fable of a young boy in search of the "Precious Present" -- the gift with the power to make whoever receives it happy forever ... and of the wise old man who speaks of this wonderful present in parables and 
<br />leaves it up to the boy to discover for himself what it is and how it can be found.
<br />
<br />Take a good look at your life ... if you are constantly living in the past or worrying about the future (and thereby missing out on today ... and who of us isn't these days) then this book could change your life! Let this book show you how to LIVE HERE and LIVE NOW ... for when you do you will live life to the fullest ... and return to the joy you once had for life, back in your childhood days. 
<br />
<br />This book should be kept close at hand and re-read whenever you find yourself forgetting to LIVE in the PRECIOUS PRESENT for unfortunately the pressures of modern day society tend to slowly take us away from this practice even when we have found it to be beneficial ... so a gentle reminding of what we already know is needed from time to time.
<br />
<br />When I first read this book I was not familiar with any of Spencer Johnson's other books. In the years since, I have read many of Johnson's other writings. Johnson has a way of putting self improvement into simple, easy, enjoyable stories that can be read whenever you need reminding of what might be causing your day to day problems. But as good as many of Johnson's other books are ... this one has long remained my FAVORITE. If you've enjoyed Johnson's other books this is a must read ... and ... if you haven't read any of Spenser Johnson's books before than start by reading this book ... you'll fall in love with this writer of modern day parables for a better life.
<br />
<br />Like Spenser Johnson says in this book ..."the precious present is not something that someone gives you. It is something that you give to yourself." So treat yourself to this book ... you'll be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>First introduced to me by a friend, The Precious Present is such a wonderful gift to give yourself.  It's short, but don't dismiss it because of that. Read it out loud to yourself, or read it aloud to someone you love, especially if they are hurting.  This book is very healing.</span>

                    <span>Because I have had some misfortunes in my life, I used to dwell on my past a lot. This also made me plan for the future a lot because I was never happy with myself. This book though, has really helped me live in the present moment! I can really say that I am a happier person because I read this book. The other completely excellent book that has helped put this in even better perspective is "The Ever-Transcending Spirit" by Toru Sato. That one is also a fantastic book! Like Gandhi said, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." These books are very true to the spirit of people like this!</span>

                    <span>How can such a short book say so much?  I remember my mother telling me when I was younger that we always say, "When I graduate, life will be better", "When I get married, life will be better", "When the kids grow up, life will be better".  Spencer Johnson puts my mother's thoughts into words.  Today IS better....and I am grateful for his words.  I have owned this book for 10 years and continue to read it to remind me of the fact that I am definitely living the Precious Present. This one is a keeper!</span>
