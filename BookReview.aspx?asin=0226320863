                    <span>Hayek's book shows how order occurs naturally in society and in very large and complex organizations as a spontaneous response to numerous, disparate, even unanticipated purposes. We do not create social order deliberately; if you think about it, this is the reason why we find some laws contradict each other, and why people have different ideas about love of country and respect for others.<P>As a society, people tend to create general rules to govern as many examples of behavior as possible, to fit as many situations as possible, even those that haven't been imagined.<P>Hayek builds on two premises: (1) that humans have limited abilities to understand and predict all possible consequences of social choices and decisions, and (2) people abstract (verb; refers to how the mind works) reality to understand it.<P>The ideas in the book are not difficult to understand, but to read the book requires the reader to let go of the illusion that people can make rational decisions for society.</span>

                    <span>I read this after reading Road to Serfdom. It's obviously a denser work, though relatively short. Still, the pages come across not so much as theory as just common sense put into more complex language so the academia nuts might be able to understand it also.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Hayek's classical book is against the totalitarians and their thought about legislation. He responses them saying that the legislation is not the tool to reconstruct the people and the economical relationships between them, but it is the method to explain the irrationally and naturally developping law more clearly. Additionally he argues the cartesian method of thinking because of its results which refuse the social evolution. Therefore Hayek finds the philosophical base of totalitarian thought in the belief that "we can create the welfare with law, if we arrange it logically". That's why he calls every kind of totalitarian thought as "constructive cartesian rationalism", because all of them want to reform the whole world, law and order from the beginning to realize their specific outcome like in DesCartes' method. (I think that it's the same as "the social engineer" description of Sir Karl Popper.)</span>
