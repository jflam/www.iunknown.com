                    <span>My husband ordered this book for me and honestly, I was quite put off at first. I mean any real runner like myself, and we're talking darn-good *marathon* runner here, doesn't need any book telling them how to be a better, more successful runner. Sheez, you're born with it or you're not -Right? <P> Wrong! The Runner's Handbook really spells out great advice for advanced runners or those just starting to run road races. The Runner's Handbook is packed with lots of great general information on running, injuries, diet and more. <P> I came to rely on the comprehensive training schedules and benchmark times for every commonly raced distance from the mile to the marathon that Bob Glover included in his book. This is how I came to learn why I wasn't as good (proportionally) at the 5k as I was at a marathon. It's a different training regimen, a different mind-set, and after reading this book it's easy to understand and correct. <P> When I really want to get motivated, I flip back to the Race Predictor appendix, calculate how fast I should be running, and set new goals for myself. Any runner of any ability who wants wants to set new goals (and what runner doesn't)should look to this book as *the* tool.</span>

                    <span>... However, I laughed today when I saw the "sell this book" button on this page and thought to myself NEVER. This and the competitive runners guide (start with this one unless you are definitely ready to start racing and run regularly already) are books that I take everywhere with me. I hardly have time for novels anymore between my running and my rereading of these two books and I've never been happier .... <P>I was until December a consummate couch potato and now I'm running in the New York City Marathon this coming November and I owe it all to Bob and Shelly-Lynne Glover and these books. I don't need to go further as all you have to do is read nigel's review from London and you have my experience with these books.<P>Oh, I do want to say one thing although it was mentioned in another review as well. I think the reason most people try and give up running and say it isn't for them is that they go out and try to run 2 miles or 20 minutes or something that seems reasonable to them, but really isn't. Take it gradually as the book advices and you will love running and avoid the aches, pains, disappointments, and difficulties that others run into or you may have before in your life.<P>Don't bother with any of the other running books. This is the one you want.</span>

                    <span>This book contains all the information a beginning runner needs, and is a good reference for intermediate ones such as myself. Glover's writing style is friendly and inspirational, and the chapter layout makes it easy to find the information you are interested in. Each page is crammed with good advice, and important points are discussed in a concise manner. As noted by another reviewer, some illustrations would be a welcome addition. I'll be ordering Glover's "Competitive Runner's Handbook" as soon as I've worked my way through this one.</span>

                    <span>Just one year ago, I was one of those persons that just couldn't run. If I ran for more than 3 minutes I would be out of breath so fast that you wouldn't believe it. Then, one day I decided that it wasn't normal to just run out of breath after a short run. Looking to learn from someone who would know what they were talking about, I searched Amazon for books on running, and ended up selecting this one. The book is very good, well written, and straight forward. To make a long story short, on March the 28th I ran my fist Half-marathon in 2:20:07. For me it is an absolute milestone in my life. All I can do is give credit to this book for it helped a lot. Thanks Bob Glover.</span>

                    <span>The Runners Handbook has all the average runner will need to train effectively for fitness, shorter races or Marathons. I have been a causal but steady runner for many years and this book, which I picked up at age 38, took my running to the next level, including my first marathon two years later. Bob Glover covers how to train, how to avoid and handle injuries, and gives valuable tips about evertything from hills, cold weather and planning for races. There are specific programs to get in shape for short and long distance races and a great section on marathon running.</span>
