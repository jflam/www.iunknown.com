                <span id="Label1">According to author Vinny Lee, "dark colors don't have to be overpowering or somber." If you've ever considered painting a room scarlet, or allowing a deep blue chair into an otherwise light and unthreatening white room, <I>Mood Indigo</I> will inspire you further in the direction of such bold statements. Lush photographs and commonsense advice are intended to spur on the amateur designer with a penchant for darkness. Chapters and photo galleries are divided by color: blues and greens, reds and purples, browns, and grays and blacks. The introduction explains and explores the irrefutable logic of the color wheel. Whether you're envisioning a "tone on tone" room in varying shades of the same color, or a room where red and gold run up against each other, this book makes a good guide. Highlights include a green room that looks like part of an underwater palace, and a persuasive argument about the beauty of black walls. <I>--Emily White</I> </span>

                    <span>Mood Indigo, like the song of the same name, is smoky, sensuous, and quite beautiful.<P>If you love rich colors, you'll love this book.<P>If you're afraid strong color won't work in your spaces, one look at these rooms will change your mind.<P>Showcasing interiors using browns, blacks and grays, purples and reds, blues and greens 'Mood Indigo' works with all shades from the strongest, darkest of the hues to the lightest.<P>There are tips on how to use strong colors, discussions about rooms size, light needs, finishes, textures, a short history of paint, pigments, and color trends.<P>Color is used not only on walls but in accessories, on fabric, floor coverings, lampshades ... well, just about anything you can think of.<P>Room designs run the gamut from country to traditional to eclectic to rustic. You'll see color used in hallways and kitchens as well as the more usual bedrooms, dining rooms, and living rooms.<P>Inspiration abounds. Add the fact that this is a great coffee table book, if nothing else, and you'll be happy you bought it. Everything about this book is quality.</span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful interior design coffee table book. It is packed with large photos of exquisite interiors that use strong colors including blues, greens, reds, purples, browns, grays and blacks. The wonderful photos are printed on high-quality glossy paper making them appear even more vivid.<P>In additional to the gorgeous pictures there is also advice on color, texture and light. Color scheme basics are covered with a discussion of tone, shade, balance and the moods each color creates. There are also suggestions for sources of inspiration for each color in nature, history and various cultures. <P>The interiors shown are simply fantastic and filled with rich, dark colors. There are no large rooms of empty white here. I loved a relaxing bathroom with shades of plum and a cabinet decorated with multiple hues of green, blue and yellow. I also enjoyed a Japanese style bedroom with red walls, a wood chest and a huge hanging white kimono. A dark blue living room with nude outlines on the wall and an artistic cozy brown couch is another of my favorites. <P>I really appreciated a great list of suppliers and helpful index included in the back. This is a great book of useful ideas as well as being a wonderful display piece or gift.</span>

                    <span>This book was exactly what I've been looking for. Lots of color without being garish. If you want some ideas on home decorating, and you are weary of the tried and tired neutral schemes, but don't want to feel like you are living in a day-glo home or a Fisher Price retail outlet, I definitly recomend this book. It's also not just about paint, but also mentions flooring, trim, wallpapering, accesories and furniture.</span>

                    <span>I had been looking at design books for months now and was bored out of my mind seeing page after page of white-on-white color schemes (most of which were heralded as 'fantastically innovative' -- how innovative can they be when they're filling every single book?!) I knew that wasn't what I wanted, but I needed some ideas to spark my creativity.<P>And then I found this book! It's big, it's beautiful, and as other reviewers have pointed out, it does an excellent job of showing different styles of rooms. (Yes, dark colors don't have to be baroque or ultra-modern! Although those are pictured here too.)</span>

                    <span>I passed by this book and just by accident, the word "Indigo" caught my eye. As I love all things purple, I just had to pick it up and flip through it. WOW. Finally, I found a book on home decorating that didn't include lots of *beige*. I absolutely love the pictures in the book, which range from some very interesting country motifs, to Victorian, to post-modern. The book's divided into sections describing the treatments of different shades; a chapter on reds and purples, blue and greens, browns and so forth. Pick your favorite color, find the chapter, and browse.<P>I have to admit I haven't even read the text, and still feel the money I paid for this book was more than made up for in the quality of the full-color, gloss-page plates... It really goes to show that with a little inventive color selection, you can create a really outstanding, comfortable environment.<P>Now I just have to find a house to buy and redecorate. :)</span>
