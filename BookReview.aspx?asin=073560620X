                <span id="Label1"><I>Desktop Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit</I> provides a review of Visual Basic 6 features for enterprise and Internet development, with an eye toward preparing you for Microsoft's own certification exam. Early sections look at the Microsoft software design process (called the Microsoft Solutions Framework), how to set up Visual SourceSafe for team development, and the advantages of today's multitiered architectures.<p> Next the kit introduces user interface design (with plenty of hints for creating effective UIs) and how to use control arrays and menu basics. Lab exercises give you practice while creating a working hotel reservation system. Business systems need quality data, and the book covers a variety of strategies for data validation. After some material on debugging and error handling, the authors look at using VB classes to model business objects.<p> Coverage of COM and ActiveX basics is notably strong in this text, with chapters on ActiveX Documents; object linking and embedding (OLE) Automation (with Excel); and building custom, reusable ActiveX objects. A standout section here is the thorough introduction to the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) for database access, which includes an introduction to SQL.<p> The book thoroughly introduces the three options for Internet development in VB (dynamic HTML [DHTML], ActiveX Documents, and WebClasses) and then closes with some material on creating help systems and deploying VB applications. Besides a worthy exam tutorial, this book can also serve as an introduction to the newer features in VB for enterprise and Internet development for those who have used VB in the past but want a quick, comprehensible, and practical tour of its newest capabilities. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I suspect that those who are whining about this training kit are missing the main point of the Microsoft Certification program - DEMONSTRATE YOUR EXPERTISE. You can't become an expert by studying a book and working through a few exercises. This book is essentially a very good guide book that points you in the right direction. I used this book and then followed up on each topic by digging into the on Programmer's reference for VB6 that comes with the product. I passed the test yesterday on the first attempt after 2 weeks of evening study. You want to pass this exam? Use the book, follow up in the online manuals, and work through a small VB6 client server project, including deployment. You will pass.<P>You do not need a bunch of fancy, expensive sample testing products. I did not take a single practice test other than the one that came with the book.</span>

                    <span>Three stars seems harsh for how much I enjoyed this book. It gave me a great overview of the new features that are on the exam, and I did in fact learn new things while reading it. If you are newer to VB, I think this is a great introduction to some of the major topics you will need as a professional developer.<P>The book only gets three stars because:<P>It wasn't perfect. There are a few mistakes in the sample code where it looks like they copied and pasted from different examples they were developing. It wasn't flawless, so that moves it down to four stars automatically. The only glaring error I found in the actual writing of the book was near the beginning. You don't actually want to use the "End" statement to be sure all your forms are unloaded prior to exiting an application. They correct themselves later.<P>The reason I lowered the score another star was overall value. The language of the book is clear, readable, and even enjoyable. The demos from the CD are good, and even the sample project has some merit. Overall, I really liked this book. I wouldn't pay $70 for it, though. For the level of detail the authors go into on each part of the exam, this book should have been about $40 - $50, not $70. If it was cheaper, I would definitely have given it four stars. It really is good, but I'm not going to recommend it to my coworkers and friends because it just costs too much for what you get. At that cost level, I want more for my money than a quick overview.<P>For the record, I am VB5 certified with over two years of professional programming experience centering on OOP development with VB. (I think credentials help when gauging the quality of the reviews)</span>

                    <span>The book covers about 70% of the exam. Its coverage of VSS, VCM and Package and Deployment Wizard are very superficial. These topics are very important in the exams (PDW has 10 to 15 questions) and can make the difference between pass the exam or not. The coverage of COM is good but incompleted. If you use only this book you need good experience in Client/Server applications. I used this book for some basic material and, the best of all, MCSD in a Nutshell by James Foxall (good coverage of PDW, VSS, VCM and COM). This last was my main guide to pass the exam. I agree with other reviewers: this exam isn't for beginners, you need at least two intensive years of experience building real applications to catch some questions. Without it, this book -any book- can help.</span>
