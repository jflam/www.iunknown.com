                <span id="Label1">With <I>Amazonia</I>, James Marcus adds to the ever-simmering stew of Amazon.com analysis a new, almost quaint perspective: that of an employee hired for his expertise in literature. Marcus traces the company's familiar climb, plummet, and re-ascent, but this time we witness the pyrotechnics from the book-strewn hallways of the editorial department.<p>  After an abbreviated heydey, editorial talent lost cachet at the burgeoning Internet behemoth, replaced by metrics worship and automated innovations like "truncating widgets." Despite the demoralizing shift, Marcus makes evident the loyalty editors continued to display, a "quasi-religious devotion&#133; almost impossible to explain to outsiders." The concept of making history was just too intoxicating for most to abandon (as were the stock options). <p>  Marcus's writing has enough genuine humor and self-deprecation to squelch any accusations of "optimizing for optics," or worse, whining. Aside from a few sections that feel somewhat adrift (oblique mentions of an imploding marriage and an extended Emerson sidebar) the prose is driving and the voice engaging and remarkably fair. <p>  For anyone who worked at Amazon.com in the early days, reading <I>Amazonia</I> is akin to leafing through a high school yearbook (I was an Amazon editor from 1997-2002). Nostalgia is inescapable--even for the irritations of the time, like All Hands Meetings (pep rallies) and the exaltation of MBAs (the popular kids). The thing about yearbooks, though, is that we're really only interested in our own. Whether outsiders will be as captivated by this surf down virtual memory lane is questionable. For alums, it's a lasting keepsake.  <I>--Brangien Davis</I></span>

                    <span>In Dec 1997, I arrived in America to work for a consulting firm. A month later, I had my first credit card. My pride and joy, it represented to me unlimited freedom to do anything that I wanted and not be constrained by those pesky debit cards (charge cards) that were linked to your savings account. Live within your means! What a horrible thought!
<br />
<br />With this credit card in hand, I looked for newer avenues to spend it where others couldn't. I found Amazon.com.
<br />
<br />The company had been in operation since July 1995. I think I must have been among the first 100, 000 th customer to trust the company and to buy books from them. I used Amazon.com because of three reasons:
<br />
<br />1. I wanted to use my credit card over the Internet. I was a programmer and I had inherent trust in this new economy.
<br />2. The local stores did not have the books that I wanted. They could back order the books. Amazon had the books available for delivery within 2 working days.
<br />3. They took care of packaging/shipping and sending the books to my father in India, which made it very easy for me. I had to select the books over the Internet, provide the shipping address and my credit card details and they took care of the rest. How easy was that?
<br />
<br />So, keeping these things in mind, I read the book titled "Amazonia" by James Markus with great interest. James was employee no 55 at Amazon and was hired as an editor in 1996. The book traces his experiences in the company over a five year period with the help of a range of emotions.
<br />
<br />The book is candid, funny and extremely readable. I want to emphasize the extremely readable part. You would expect a book such as this to be full of boring anecdotal accounts. But no, James does a great job of taking you with him on a journey where you share his angst at the MBAs taking over the company, you share the subtle joy of being a millionaire and you smile ruefully when the AmaBot replaces him to take over the home page duties.
<br />
<br />It is a story well told. James is honest in his opinions and observations. He shows his annoyances at the various automation projects that replaced humans with faceless computers. He is clearly more miffed at the MBAs who talked only about "the bottom line" and "monetizing those eyeballs". He is dismissive of all the meetings that he attends which go nowhere.
<br />
<br />The overall feeling is of a well deserved employee being made redundant and neglected in favor of expansion and commercialization in an organization that grew too big too fast. However, these are the facts of life and James presents them well (with only a subtle hint at his personal problems).
<br />
<br />By Dec 1998, after I had purchased a stack of books from Amazon, they sent me a coffee cup with the Amazon.com logo on it. I cherished the fact that they took care to send me something for free and valued me as a customer. Next year, I bought more books and I did not get anything. The year after, I bought still more books, but still nothing under the Xmas tree from Amazon.com Santa. The company had grown too big, too fast. I know how James felt.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to get a good overview of Amazon.com, so I purchased this and Robert Spector's _Amazon.com: Get Big Fast_.  First, let's look at James Marcus' _Amazonia_.
<br />
<br />The author was hired as an editor in the nascent Amazon.com firm.  Maybe it's because of his position or because of his snobbish attitude that looked down on his own work in "retail", most of his book stands out as a rant against corporations, coworkers, retail industry, office work, and money.  It's clear that he's an aspiring writer and this shows up in unintentionally funny flairs of prose where he tries desperately to show that he's more intelligent than his coworkers.  He loves Emerson and devotes an entire chapter to Emerson, why he loves and Emerson, why he thinks Emerson is great, quotes from Emerson, Emerson, Emerson, ad naseum.
<br />
<br />The story comes to an end when he finally quits Amazon, to the relief of both the author and the reader because his love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with Amazon can now end, at last.
<br />
<br />This would've been a 0 star review, if it weren't for the fact that there are brief flashes of brilliant insight and poignancy, though there are few.
<br />
<br />The chapters comparing the Internet stock bubble to his ancestor's stuffing worthless Russian Ruble notes into their clothes is particularly good, because he opens himself to the reader and tells us something more than his daily petty rants.  Or when he's describing the surreal nature of the hyper growth of Amazon's employee base as well as the stratospheric rise of the stock price, his detachment affords him some useful insights.
<br />
<br />But these brief passages of good reads are few.
<br />
<br />I wish the author opened himself up a bit further.  For example, he went through a divorce during his tenure at Amazon but this is almost left as an afterthought, and is introduced into the story only by another coworker.  Did the hectic worklife at Amazon have anything to do with his divorce?  There are other examples like this, but we never really get to know the author and only get to know the surface, where his petty, know-it-all, above-it-all, I'm-too-good-to-work-in-retail attitude gets tiresome after the 10th time he rants.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, Robert Spector's _Amazon.com: Get Big Fast_ gives a detailed insider view of the startup days of the company, with very good interviews with the key players of that phase, unlike the very narrow first-person-view that Robert Marcus is stuck with.  I recommend the latter book.  For my detailed review (with pros and cons) of Robert Spector's book, check out the review section for that book.</span>

                    <span>In Amasonia James Marcus, employee #55, gives an insider's view of a small dot-com during the boom. Marcus, hired as an editor, shares the ultimate dot-com experience with the reader, from writing the 45-word review to helping out in the wherehouse during the holiday rush.He takes us through his journeys there, the thrill of seeing your stock at $400 a share to the sorrow of losing 95% of it's value. Amazonia is one of my favorites, and I would recomend it to everyone.</span>

                    <span>Amazon.com came to epitomize the rise and fall of the dreams and hopes of the .com world, and AMAZONIA: FIVE YEARS AT THE EPICENTER OF THE DOT.COM JUGGERNAUT probes inside the world's most famous online merchant to examine the history of the bookselling giant. Chapters provide a first-hand account from the perspective of one employee, also include insights on Amazon's unusual caste system, and follow the rise and fall of Amazon's employees in a volatile online world. A fascinating account from an employee insider who was there to watch it all.

                    <span>The relationship between art and commerce has a long and conflicted history. In the newspaper game, for example, the battle between the marketing people and editorial continues to rage to this day. In this case, it's a conflict over space; advertising usually wins out over the extra hundred or two hundred words demanded by the journalist. The half page Mercedes-Benz spread takes precedence over editorial and content. In the late eighties, in an effort to maintain journalistic integrity, the "advertorial" was born. Promotional copy on a product or particular brand was no more in the guise of `real' editorial, either it was journalism or advertising copy, and the twain shall never meet. However, this emphatic separatism has mutated, they have merged, and it is now extremely difficult to distinguish between the two. 
<br />
<br />James Marcus was hired as a senior editor at Amazon.com in 1996. This was a heady period of mind-boggling expansionism and astonishing innovation. Marcus was hired on his skills as a `literary' man, a journalist and critic by trade; he was hired to input his literary insight, his ability to write reviews and articles about books, possibly to guide readers to the pulse of the literary world. But as Amazon evolved, these literary aspirations, Marcus's underlying purist literary sensibilities, clashed with the gruesome reality that Amazon was a business and in the business to sell books, a lot of books. Did he maintain his "literary integrity", honestly assessing a book on its literary merits, or did he "sell out", turning his 45 word reviews into mere advertorial?  Only he can answer that. More than anything else, it is the story about the early days at Amazon itself, the genius of Jeff Bezos, and his mission to hire the smartest people from around the world, to turn Amazon into the phenomenon it has become, that makes this book a fascinating read.
<br />
<br />There is a distinct air of lament in this narrative, a disenchantment perhaps, over a fortune lost or a goal not achieved. Marcus sermonizes in parts of the book, at times imparting a condescending tone, and he is also transparently careful not to tread on anyone's toes. Only a fool burns their bridges, however, that hint of bitterness is difficult to ignore. 
<br />
<br />There is no doubt that James Marcus looks back at his time at Amazon, helping to blaze the trail, working along side extremely intelligent people and contributing to the companies meteoric rise, as a privilege and an experience he'll never forget. This sentiment comes through as well. 
<br />
<br />If you have any interest in the history of Amazon from one man's personal perspective, this text would be well worth your time.
