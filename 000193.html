<h3 class="title">Software co-operative</h3>

<p><P>I spent some time this morning reading <A href="http://www.pobronson.com">Po Bronson's web site</A>. I really loved one of his earlier books, <A href="http://www.pobronson.com/index_nudist.htm">The Nudist on the Late Shift</A>, which captures the spirit of Silicon Valley in the midst of the .com boom of the late 90's. What brought me back to his site is a new book that he just released, <A href="http://www.pobronson.com/index_what_should_I_do_with_my_life.htm">What Should I Do With My Life?</A>&nbsp;I read <A href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">an excerpt from this book in Fast Company</A>, and it has me hooked. This will be the next non-geek book on my reading list.</P><br />
<P>While reading about his history, I read his fascinating description of <A href="http://www.pobronson.com/index_the_grotto.htm">a writer's cooperative called The Grotto in San Francisco</A>. This idea really has me stoked. A few years ago, my friend Michael Lenaghan graciously offered me free office space in Toronto. I have fond memories of the years that I spent hanging out there, and one of our discussions there directly lead me to becoming an instructor at DevelopMentor and being exposed to the CLR for the first time.</P><br />
<P>These days, I work mostly out of my home office. However, it can be a very isolating experience. On days when I'm on a roll, it doesn't matter much where I am. However, on those <EM>other days</EM>, it can be a tremendous disadvantage. </P><br />
<P>So here's what I want to set up: a software co-operative based in Toronto. It would involve renting space either in a traditional office building or renting out an entire house.&nbsp;The members of the co-op would rent individual rooms in the office, and we would share common expenditures such as electricity, heating, and Internet access. Included in the cost would be some shared facilities like a kitchen and&nbsp;some sort of common room. It would be located in a transit-friendly place, most likely in the downtown core of Toronto.</P><br />
<P>The purpose of the co-operative would be to have a friendly place where people can go and get work done. It is not going to be anything more than that. The goal is NOT to create an umbrella "corporate" organization. It's really all about getting a bunch of people with shared interests together in a common space.</P><br />
<P>If you live in Toronto, and work as an independent generating some kind of computer code, please get in contact with me. By generating "some kind of computer code" I mean stuff like (but not restricted to):</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>C# / VB.NET managed development<br />
<LI>Java<br />
<LI>Flash<br />
<LI>C++<br />
<LI>VB<br />
<LI>x86 assembler<br />
<LI>Cocoa / Carbon on Mac OS<br />
<LI>PHP<br />
<LI>Python, Perl, Ruby<br />
<LI>Lisp, Smalltalk</LI></UL><br />
<P>I would love to have a community of folks from different backgrounds. This would let us learn from each other and expand our collective horizons. It would be great to get a mixture of Computer Science researchers together with Flash developers. It would be great to have C# developers talking to Python developers. It would be great to have Mac OS developers talking to Windows developers. It's about celebrating what we have in common instead of letting marketing labels like "Linux", "Windows", and "Mac OS"&nbsp;divide us.</P></p>

<p>This is such a great idea! I have the option to work from home but choose not to most of the time because it is, as you said, very isolating. If only you lived in Chattanooga, TN instead of Toronto! Actually, Toronto does sound appealing...</p>

<p>Dude, think different is wonderful but what is going to do for your bottom line? I mean, this is all a wonderful theoritical excerise but how are you going to make money from the Mac or use it for your career? I'm not trying to be a thorn but I am curious as to your thoughts.</p>

<p>Well, without wanting to speak for John, my POV is: Being exposed to other systems and paradigms is good. Besides, it's cool, who cares about profit (heck, even *I* want one).<br />
That's sort of the reasons I'm trying to learn things like Perl (and Python, in a near future)... it's not like I'll ever make a dime out of it, but it's just more tools in the arsenal...</p>

<p>Great idea, John! I suffer from many the same, shall we say, perils of home-office life. And yet, I don't live in Toronto, sigh. However, to amplify your idea, I'd propose further that what is really necessary is a Software Co-Op Co-Op - a meta organization to setup these Co-Ops different places. I'm not quite sure how that would work, but I'm throwing it out there. Ideas? </p>

<p>Yes! I think right now I'm going to have to go and speak at various user groups in Torpnto so that I can have an opportunity to get the idea out in front of prospective members. The meta-coop idea sounds really interesting too, but I think it needs an exemplar. I'd be more than happy to set a meta-coop up once I've figured out how to do it once. I'm off today to the local Sun Developer Days event here in Toronto. I'll see if I can't bounce the idea past some folks there.</p>

<p>I live in Toronto.  I think this office is a great idea.  My wife is a professional music therapist, and they have a simular office set-up.  It gives her a chance to work in a clinical space, and she gets to share instruments, etc...  The best part though is it's an amazing place for her to network with fellow music therapists.<br />
Unfortunately I don't work as an independant.  Maybe I can drop by and hang out sometimes though?  Please?  </p>

<p>I live in Toronto. Excellent idea. Where do I sign up? Any ideas for locations? What about equipment? Do we co-op that as well? </p>

<p>I'm in too John. Maybe it should be made as a hotelier office space where you can have more people than rooms - kind of an overpriced gym or a time share. Sometimes I'm at a clients, sometimes I'm at home. Sometimes I have a team that needs to be together, but not necessarily at the clients office. <br />
Tell me do I have to wear sandals? If so, I'm out. And there has to be wireless lan access....and a server farm that we can abuse.</p>
