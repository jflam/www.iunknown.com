                <span id="Label1">Robert Thurman--father of Uma, outspoken critic of George Bush's  administration and one of the first Westerners to bring popularize Buddhism  in America&#151;has written what is arguably his finest book. In <I>Infinite  Life</I> he invites readers into a fascinating new way of thinking living  and meditating that might do more to save the world than any political act  known to humans. In recognizing that our lives and even our moment-to-moment choices choices have  eternal ramifications, we are at once free from the burden of petty  pursuits yet suddenly saddled with the weight of infinite responsibility.  Thurman helps students understand that carrying this weight is the only way  we can free ourselves and the rest of the world form suffering. Buddhists  recognize this as the path of "the bodhisattva," dedicated to the well-being  of all beings. In order to help readers make this quantum shift in awareness, Thurman  structure his chapters around the <I>paramitas</I>, or transcendent virtues:  wisdom, generosity, patience, contemplation, justice (usually called  "discipline"), and creativity ("diligence"). He adds a seventh virtue:  art&#151;as in the "art of infinite living." Each chapter includes a lesson on a  virtue as well as meditations and life choices that support personal and  global transformation. </p> "You can try out a whole new approach to life," he promises. "Then we'll  explore how can put your new ideas into practice in the world, turning your  thoughts into action. We'll examine the repercussions of your personal  change on society and on the fragile, opalescent planet. We'll see how  personal transformation is social transformation."</p><p>  He delivers his promise with political and spiritual punch. Some criticize  Thurman for his outspokenness against the current Bush administration. But  for those who want to use their spirituality to create political change&#151;this  book is filled with excellent meditations and lifestyle suggestions for  bringing about global compassion and humanity. --<I>Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent but somewhat controversial work which embellishes the Mahayana School of Buddhism. The author espouses the virtues inherent in selflessness and individual/collective<BR>wisdom. He challenges the reader to embrace creativity and <BR>generosity in interpersonal relationships. Most importantly,<BR>the work demands that we do a critical self-examination to<BR>determine what is within us. It is only by knowing ourselves<BR>thoroughly that we can transcend our current condition. <BR>This self-transformation is a condition precedent to achieving the creativity and generosity of spirit needed to help others.<BR>The book challenges us to transcend ourselves and achieve<BR>levels of learning and experience outside the normal everyday<BR>patterns of life. It is an important contribution to<BR>religion, philosophy and the psycho-social sciences.</span>

                    <span>There are so many facets of Buddhism -one compliments the others-, the true embodiment of emptiness at the very heart of Buddhist teachings that nothing has an inherent existence of its own. No one does a better job than Robert Thurman, one of the most prominent Buddhist scholars representing the Mahayana school of thoughts, in giving a cerebral erudition of the meanings and interpretations of old manuscripts and their relevance to our contemporary life. That is represented, again, in his latest craft.The Mahayana tradition puts a huge emphasis on infinite and universal compassion for all sentient beings, it is the basis of every effort toward self-transformation, that ultimately entails self-transcendence in the selfless spirit of the altruistic mind seeking for enlightenment for the benefits of all. His book works on that basis in a very forceful, dense, idealistic fashion but accessible at the same time.<P>This Bodhisatva ideal is so infinitely lofty to the point that many people might find it impractical and unrealistic. However, as Thurman point-blankly elaborates throughout the book, that ideal isn't an empty dream of a romantic fool, but it's based on the infinite outlook of life with infinite room for personal growth; infinity that stretches to the "past" and "future" through infinite numbers of past and future lives, intimately intertwined and interrelated.<P>In this infinite universe, that is supported by science needless to say, there are infinite possibilities. That is one thing. The other is the proclamation that we are all Buddha now, we just need to be awakened to that fact. So if we are all enlightened beings with built-in infinite capacity for altruism and infinite deadlines to fulfill our Bodhisatva ideal, aiming high isn't that crazily unrealistic. If anything, it jumpstarts and single mindedly focus our commitment to practice to get closer to that ideal in our own pace and time. <P>This notion leads to a troubling theory (at least to some) of reincarnation that in Buddhism is more aptly coined as rebirth. How are the two different? And is there any scientific basis for either theory? Or is it a mere belief as theists believe in heaven or hell as the final destination after one's death?<P>Buddhism goes far deeper than a mere belief system which is an end to itself that gives you a not so comforting alternative of eternal damnation for stubbornly resisting to "see the truth." Buddhism is a sophisticated, surprisingly modern, consistent and scientific system of psychology. Thurman calls it "joyous science of the heart.<P>Some people who belongs to the hardcore materialist camp (usually atheists, scientists and thus, Nihilists) may just lump the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth as superstition and as unfounded as the belief in God, angels, heaven and hell of the theists. Their prejudice and dogmatism assumes that just as theistic belief in heaven is solely founded by the inherent fear of death, then so is the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth, unaware of the point blank assertion of the Buddha that birth, sickness, death are unavoidable facts of life and the failing world is a samsara (a cycle of birth and death) reeked in sufferings, the cure of which is Nirvana (liberation from the cycle which shouldn't be construed as extinction into nothingness, by the way). The Theravada tradition, which in a sense provides a basic interpretation of the Buddha's teachings, stops at that, while the Mahayanese, driven by infinite compassion for all beings, vows to delay the attainment of Nirvana until every single being is liberated.<P>So why rebirth? It boils down to the Buddhist tenet of selflessness. The self according to the Buddha is a relative and subjective reality that is not independent to myriad factors that create it in the first place. There is no enduring, unchanging part of it than in itself makes what we call "the self." The body and mind work together to become self, each of which is breakable into different elements that have also causes for their existence. To the Buddhists both matter and mind exist separately, yet interdependently. And Thurman points out something can't become nothing, it is scientifically unsustainable. The center of the contention between the Nihilists and the Buddhists is whether consciousness resides in the brain, whether the former is a mere side effect of physical activities of the neuron cells which will cease one the brain stops functioning and decays. The Nihilist materialists obviously believe so. The Buddhists don't, hence consciousness (or mind) is a something, a form or energy, and the law of physics dictates that energy can't be created nor destroyed.<P>In that sense both camps part ways in the move that seemingly lumps the Buddhists in the same league with the monotheist eternalists. However, the Buddhists warn us that even though there is a continuation of the mind, this mind is much less personal than the fixed soul that the eternalists hold onto so tightly. The mind (or the Buddhist relative soul) is fluid and so much less identifiable -hence selflessness- and is a fluctuative process driven by karma (in this case can be translated into obsessions and fixations). <P>Hence, Buddhism is literally sandwiched between two extremes of the atheist Nihilists and theist Eternalists, giving a candid point in case that the Buddha didn't call his Dharma "the Middle Path" for no reason.<P>On that basis then the rest of the book goes on with Seven Virtues of wisdom, generosity, justice, patience, creativity, contemplation and the art of infinite living to live a happy bountiful life, a life with minimum ego frictions and aggravations. In the nutshell, we can only be happy if we loosen up our ego boundaries, if we focus less in our self-preoccupations, realize the relativity of our "self" and start to care more about others since self and others are interchangeable. It is mighty difficult, needless to say, but we can gradually get there through practices outlined in this book. This is a message of hope, let's embrace it.</span>

                    <span>All I can say is that this book touched me in the most profound way, after the power of now, and the sedona method, I feel as if I've finally tuned into my true self, at every moment in constant change, no longer stuck in old habits or self imposed limits, although based on Mahayana buddhism, this truly is a bible for contemporary living, every sentence is to be read very carefully, and deeply pondered, for within this text lies the key for unlocking the door to your soul, and making your life fuller and richer. <BR>Mind you buddhism has never been my thing, I'm not pushing any type of eastern dogma, or new age doctrine.This book and it's message have renewed my hope, and made me more aware of my inner psyche,this is our missing manual.<BR>I hope that it's within your dharma to pick up this book,and ponder it , and share it with everyone around you.<BR>Mr. Thurman thank you for this gift.</span>

                    <span>This book (recently released) redeemed my esteem for Thurman. Following his book "Essential Tibetan Buddhism" I thought perhaps his style of Buddhist thought was not up my alley. But this book is much more natural. Robert perhaps is America's most admired and appealing Buddhist writer/scholar. His first book, Inner Revolution, is an international hit and his lectures at places like Harvard sell out to thousands of participants. Infinite Life shows that all of our actions have countless consequences for ourselves and others, here and now, and after we are gone; in short, we are constantly creating some sort of karma. Here we are introduced to the "Seven Virtues" to reforming our body and mind wisely in order to diminish the more harmful karma created and nurture the more positive variety. In a skilled and practical style, he gives invigorating instructions on understanding human virtue and emotion. Thurman calls us to take on accountability for our actions and their consequences by remaining mindful that our lives are truly immeasurable. This book is one of the best guidebooks for understanding our place in the world and appreciating ways which we can universally thrive in serving other beings. This was a good book.</span>

                    <span>This book is not what I expected it to be, yet I am not certain what, exactly, I expected. Mr. Thurman effortlessly tows the line in not being too self-helpy, too New Age, too academic, too boring, or too Buddhist. I think that's quite an achievement given the fact that many (if not most) books in this category are painful to read.<P>I give this book 5 stars based solely upon his very, very readable and effective explanation of "infinite life"----the fact that life is without beginning or end. The argument for reincarnation is so strong and undeniable that I cannot fathom anyone doing a better job. I have been drawn to Buddhism for years and years and never have I understood so clearly its true meaning.<P>I consider this book a must-read for those who are interested in Buddhism or people who are already Buddhist practitioners; this book provides a nondogmatic and fresh-look into the purpose behind the practice that I think even the devoted would find helpful. This book would serve as an invaluable resource to anyone: Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc., because this book is not an argument for conversion, only a plea to open one's mind. This is one book that certainly opened mine.</span>
