                    <span>Wills has a keen sense of the importance of followers to leadership. In the introduction to the book he states plainly "The leader most needs followers". He goes on to explain that in reality followers "have a say" in what they are led toward! The theme of Certain Trumpets is that a successful leader doesn't just trumpet or sound their own certain message, but instead they sound a specific call to others capable of following. He believes that leaders need to understand their followers more than followers need to understand them! What is Garry Wills basic definition of a leader? "One who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by the leader and followers". In other words, coercion of others is not leadership, it is just power.<p> <p>With this introduction in mind the rest of the book consists of Wills discussion of individuals who have possessed leadership in various ways. The author believes that different leaders should be considered notable because of their own goals rather than their personalities, which is the most common perspective. As a result of this perspective, Wills does not treat leadership as a single thing, but mentions sixteen various kinds of leadership within the book. He also goes on to discuss various subdivisions within the sixteen kind's. Certain Trumpets attempts to define these distinctive types of leadership by using examples that range from Franklin Roosevelt (Electoral Leadership) to Dorothy Day (Saintly Leadership). To make this exploration interesting, and to provoke thought, he also provides an antitype character in contrast to each distinctive type of leader presented. It is Wills hope to exemplify the individual's characteristics by providing this contrast. Wills doesn't think we lack leaders today, but sufficient followers. He refers to this as the "real problem with leadership". Certain Trumpets is easy to read, stimulating and creative enough to look at leadership from a different lens.</span>

                    <span>This book is a mess.  The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership  than before he/she read it.  What's worse is that the intro has nothing at  all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right).   The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by  Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of  nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched  and badly written.  I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows  anything at all about some of the people he writes about.  Skip this one. I  suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of  leadership with clear, well researched examples.</span>

                    <span>Good concept to discuss different types of leadership with good and bad examples. However, most of the work seems to be on the positive examples with the anti-types being included as an afterthought.  Nearly all chapters are weak developments of leadership style with the notable exception being  the one on Harriet Tubman.  Additionally, both the types of leadership  styles discussed and the people chosen to represent them appear to fit the  author's preferences rather than true representations of leadership styles  and leaders.  This book was an easy read and parts were even enjoyable but  the content was not as substantive as I had hoped.  <p>The best  recommendation that I can make is to check this one out of a library  instead of purchasing it.<p>(review written by a life-long student of  leadership with a library full of leadership texts.)</span>

                    <span>As Wills notes, "tell me your admired leaders, and you have bared your soul."  Wills has bared his and while I might choose others, his descriptions of each type of leader give me something on to which to hang  my own leadership research.  This is a helpful piece of research.  If one  is able to see that we are all subjective in our approaches to and  understanding of leadership, there is a great deal to learn here.</span>

                    <span>Leadership is an interesting topic, but Wills somehow manages to drain all the life out of it. I did learn a little, though, so that's why I gave it two stars instead of one.<p>I also thought that the author let his  political bias get in the way of his writing.<p>Not a book that was worth  reading.</span>
