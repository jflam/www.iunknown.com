                <span id="Label1">Baseball lends itself to still photography. Photos freeze baseball's  rhythm, allowing the viewer to examine details: Derek Jeter's agility as he  leaps in the air to turn a double play, Ted Williams's beautiful follow-through  after connecting with another hit, the bone-jarring crunch of a collision at  home plate between Ray Durham and Scott Servais. <I>Major League Baseball's Best  Shots</I> celebrates these great moments. Some of these images offer glimpses of  lost practices, such as Burleigh Grimes, last of the legal spitballers, greasing  up a ball, or Joe DiMaggio "boning" his bat to compress the wood. Others allow  for a comparison of styles--such as El Duque's knee-to-ear wind-up vs. Warren  Spahn's straight-legged sprawl, or Hideo Nomo's twisting delivery vs. Dennis  Eckersley's sidearm. Best of all, however, are the photos of superstars at  supreme moments--Rickey Henderson evading an attempted tag, Ken Griffey Jr.  robbing Detroit of an obvious home run by leaping well above the fence, Sammy  Sosa and Mark McGwire chatting in the final week of that magical 1998 season.  With a foreword by Johnny Bench (himself captured in full swing), <I>Major  League Baseball's Best Shots</I> is a wonderful look at the history of the  national pastime. <I>--M. Stein</I></span>

                    <span>"Baseball's Best Shots" professes to be "The Greatest Baseball Photography of All Time." But if you flip through this book expecting to see page after page of memorable photographs you have seen before, then you need to know that is not going to happen. I did recognize almost a dozen of these photographs, almost all of which were old black & white photographs of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner and other baseball immortals. Of course, those old photos are almost all posed shots, and most of this book is filled with color photograph of game shots of more contemporary players. There are some nice photographs (like the one of Mark McGwire's bat bending from the sheer power of his swing as he is about to make contact with the ball), but the vast majority of them are really nothing special. I agree with the earlier review that said this book was not a keeper. Baseball fans will look through this book one or twice, but I have to doubt they will go through the batting order a third time. Even if they changed the sub-title to something less hyperbolic, it is not really going to make you like this book any better.</span>

                    <span>There are hundreds of baseball photo books currently on the market and very few of them capture the true essence of the game like "Baseball's Best Shots." Yes, there are dozens of remarkable action shots, like the magnificent photo of Derek Jeter turning a double play or a graceful Cal Ripken, Jr. going to the hole for a grounder. What makes this book special is the way it captures the action off the field. For example, a photo of kids sneaking a peek of the Hall of Fame game through a fence is pure baseball poetry, it's the game the way it used to be. There's lots to like here: a comic shot of Babe Ruth in cowboy garb, a heroic photo of Ted Williams displaying his brilliant swing, and a lovely snapshot of Scott Brosius and his daughter. Great care has also gone into the captioning of photos, wit and a love of the game makes these fun reading. I especially suggest picking this book up in the off-season--it will make your winter months glow with the unique warm light of baseball.</span>
