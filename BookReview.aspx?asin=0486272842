                    <span>Come to me in my dreams, and then
<br />By day I shall be well again. 
<br />For then the night will more than pay
<br />The hopeless longing of the day. 
<br />~Matthew Arnold (1822-1888)
<br />
<br />Great Love Poems is an inexpensive collection of classic selections. This anthology is a collection of poems from four centuries of literary creation. 
<br />
<br />Many of the poems are classic in themes of longing and loss. There are poems of great sorrow and poems of great passion. Most of the poems either reflect on the nature of love or seem to be written from the perspective of a lover. 
<br />
<br />I have recently discovered the effects of mood on the reading of poetry. These poems may seem overly dreary on an evening when you are missing the person you love or they can be seen more creatively in the light of day. 
<br />
<br />As you read poetry, the beauty is often in recognizing the reflection of your own emotions in the mirror of the poet's world. While reading Edmund Spenser's One Day I Wrote Her Name upon the Strand, we can look back at love lost and see how our attempts at permanence are washed away by the waves of time itself. 
<br />
<br />To die in dust, but you shall live by fame: 
<br />My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,
<br />And in the heavens write your glorious name, 
<br />
<br />You may recognize many famous poems throughout this work, although many were new to me. When we studied Andrew Marvell's "The Definition of Love" in school, how could the poem have meant as much in such an innocent state. Now, years later we understand impossibility, fate's jealous eye, the parallel lines that never meet. So, it is worth reading many of these poems again with new eyes and a more experienced heart. 
<br />
<br />Does Thomas Campbell's poem speak too much truth about love or is he simply focusing on infatuation and the fires of love? 
<br />
<br />Love's a fire that needs renewal
<br />Of fresh beauty for its fuel:
<br />Love's wing moults when caged and captured,
<br />Only free, he soars enraptured.
<br />
<br />In this tiny book, you will find Edgar Allan Poe's "To One in Paradise" and Robert Browning's beautiful "Meeting at Night" with images of a gray sea and a moon large and low. I love the images of miles of warm sea-scented beach and fields the lover must cross to hear the voice of his true love. D. H. Lawrence's Gloire de Dijon was a definite find. I also found quite a few poems with water images, which I love.

                    <span>This anthology has some of the greatest love poems in it. But it also fails to include many great love poems, including those of Wallace Stevens. It too should have stated that it confines itself to English Language poems only. It too has poems of the greatest quality ( the selections of Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth) and poems of much lesser value. I too believe that within many individual authors  it could have had poems of higher quality. </span>

                    <span>This is an excellent collection of love poetry. You won't easily find this many classic gems under a single volume for such a low price. The only thing I regret is I would have liked to have seen some love poems from the second half of the 20th century too. But this collection, spaning 4 centuries, includes most of the greatest romantic verse ever penned by the likes of Shakespeare, Donne, Blake, Burns, Byron, Poe, Browning, Yeats, Dickinson, Whitman, and so on. A worthy addition to any poetry lover's collection.

                    <span>I would not consider myself a big fan of poetry, in fact this is the first book of poetry I've ever read.  But I would highly recommend this book because it contains many classic love poems and authors.  There are many poems in this little collection that will move anyone who has experienced love.</span>
