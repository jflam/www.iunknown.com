                    <span>I am relatively new to card-room limit hold'em.  The book provides valuable instruction on card-room etiquette as well as a winning strategy specifically taylored for low-limit games.   
<br />
<br />The author gives the novice a lot to think about (maybe too much all at once) but if you are too tight a player (as I was), you can fairly easily adopt the author's strategy in a step-by-step fashion that you are comfortable with. 
<br />
<br />The author gives excellent advice on the subtleties of the game such as the importance of position, pot odds, and how to get "free" cards.  These things help you know when it is in your interest to loosen-up your play.  
<br />
<br />I played 3/6 hold'em the night after I finished the book.  I typically throw away small pairs (22-99).  However, on advice from the author I called three times on the button with a small pair when at least 5 people were in the pot.  The odds of making the set are poor but, as the book explains, the amount of money in the pot makes your $3 bet worth it.  Twice I didn't make the set on the flop and lost $3, but once I flopped the set and raked in $62.  The point is: I never would have known this strategy without the book.  It paid for itself the first night I put it into practice.
<br />
<br />Buy it and start dominating your local low-limit table.

                    <span>The system Lee Jones outlines in this book is everything one needs to become a winner at low-limit Hold'em. He covers all the important concepts such as starting hand requirements, pot odds, implied odds, how often you'll convert different draws, and when to try more advanced concepts such as the free card play and the semi-bluff (rarely!). This book and Sklansky's book on the theory of poker have made me a winner at 3/6.
<br />
<br />Every tough loss I've suffered came when I didn't follow Jones' advice, such as raising with the non-nut flush (four flush cards on the board), not betting top pair to punish drawing hands, drawing to a straight with a pair on the board. The book is so short and well-written that it only takes an hour or so to reread different sections. This really helps to solidify concepts and fine tune your play after a bad session. 
<br />
<br />Other books I think have helped are `The Theory of Poker' by David Sklansky and `The Complete Book of Hold'em Poker' by Gary Carson. Sklansky is tough to read but he explains many of the more complicated concepts in great detail (I read this first). Carson's book is really underrated but it really helped me to think like a poker player and pg. 204 is a must (I read this third). Miller, Sklansky, and Malmuth's book (Small Stakes Hold'em) is a very similar book, but is much more detailed and confusing.

                    <span>This book is a terrific introduction to limit hold 'em at the lower limits.  Jones stresses hand selection and discipline, which are the two things beginners need to focus on the most.  The first mistake is the most costly, which is why not playing bad hands is often more importantly than how you play the good cards.  Most beginners think any hand with an Ace, any hand with two face cards and any suited cards should be played.  Jones tries to correct that with straight-forward advice.  
<br />Most players should plan on reading this book a few times -- interspersed with live action play -- to fully digest the lessons.</span>

                    <span>Everyone is into the Texas Hold-em craze. Yet, as a novice to play the game, you can't rely upon watching ESPN or Fox Sports to truly understand how to play. That's why books like this are written. "Winning Low-Limit" gives the beginning player a perspective and strategy for each aspect of playing in a Texas Hold-em game. Things that you never see on TV, such as how to play in various positions, and what hands to throw away, and when to those those hands away are among the many topics covered in detail in this book. I was able to use this strategy after one read, and win our in-house tournament. I would recommend that you read this book several times, and play several games to really let the concepts sync in. There is a lot of information in here, and to be a great player, you have to learn it all.</span>

                    <span>Lee Jones does an excellent job of explaining rock solid Low Limit play. Simply a must-read for beginners. Since reading this book, I am a consistent winner at 2-4 (Atlantic City Casinos). It's amazing how much information Jones packed into such a small book. What is even more amazing is how profitable $2-4 games can be. Most poker books pose that good Hold'em players should make 1 big bet per hour. I average 4-6 times that at low limit, much of it attributed to Jones' book. As a companion to this book I would strongly recommend Gary Carson's book on Hold'em. Carson elaborates on Jones's foundation, and is a great book for taking your game to the next level</span>
