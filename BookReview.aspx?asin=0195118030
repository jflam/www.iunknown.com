                    <span>Prof. Stevenson's book does not attempt to capture the essence of the entire American south or of the entire history of American slavery.  Instead, she attempts a historical reproduction of the lives of American Black women and American white women, two collective voices which are all too often forgotten in the sexualized debate over race relations and slavery.  Rather than seeing that debate as a battle between Black men and White men Stevenson's work is meant to compliment the works of earlier researchers, notably Blassingame, Genovese, Herskovitz, and Jones to provide a complete and concerted picture of slave life for all involved: black and white, male and female.  By providing the evidence of primary sources she lets the dead speak for themselves about their conditions rather creating academic hyperbole in an Ivory Tower.  Any dismissive criticisms of political correctness miss the point entirely.  Stevenson is being academically precise in distinguishing heterosexual relationships from homosexual which are increasingly coming to light as more and more evidence of the truth of slavery is exposed.  Her book is a necessary element in the ongoing narrative of history.</span>

                    <span>I began reading this novel hoping to gain new insights into social life in  the American South.  Instead, I discovered a moderately interesting social  analysis of the South that focuses a bit much on the psychological aspects  of southern life without telling me why they were unique to the time  period.  For instance, Stevenson devotes an entire chapter to the  challenges of marriage and the conflict between financial success and the  marital bond.  She doesn't always say what makes this problem unique to the  South.  I also noticed a creeping political correctness in her writing  (e.g. "heterosexual" marriages among slaves) that she doesn't  justify with historical evidence.  This book served as a reminder of  inequality, but maybe used too modern a standard to criticize a  not-so-modern society.</span>
