It also delves into other aspects of web design, such as the creative design process, and procuring hosting for the finished product.

                    <span>Contents<BR>This book is a reference manual for HTML/XHTML/XML/CSS1/CSS2, in addition to a well-written book on how the different features work (with examples).<P>The book is divided into seven parts with the following contents:<P>Part 1 - Introduction - Introduction To HTML And XHTML; Web Development Overview<BR>Part 2 - Core HTML And XHTML - Core Elements; Links And Addressing<BR>Part 3 - Presentation And Layout - Images; Text, Colors, And Backgrounds; Tables And Layouts; Frames; Multimedia; CSS1; CSS2<BR>Part 4 - Interactivity - Forms; Introduction To Server-Side Programming; JavaScript And DHTML; Plug-ins, ActiveX Controls, And Java Applets; <BR>Part 5 - Site Delivery And Management - HTTP And Site Delivery; Site Management<BR>Part 6 - Advanced Topics - XML<BR>Part 7 - Appendixes - HTML And XHTML Element Reference; CSS1 And CSS2 Reference; Special Characters; Fonts; Color Reference; Reading A Document Type Definition; Index<P>Review<BR>It used to be that when you built web pages, all you needed to know were a few basic HTML tags. But over time, things have gotten much more complicated. HTML has grown, and the different browsers don't support all the tags in the same way. HTML is now morphing into XHTML. You have cascading style sheets (version 1 and 2), and of course browsers support those differently too. Throw in XML, JavaScript, DHTML, ActiveX and applets, and you wonder how any of it works together. To help you keep it all straight, you need to have a good reference manual that explains it all. HTML & XHTML: The Complete Reference by Thomas Powell is an excellent choice to have on your bookshelf.<P>Unlike pure reference-style manuals, this book bridges the gap between information and learning. The appendixes at the end of the book can be used for just looking up a particular tag as well as what browsers support that feature. This information is valuable as you attempt to code web pages that are compatible across browser versions. But it doesn't stop there. Each of the book sections discusses the different features in a learning style, complete with examples. So instead of just seeing a <big> tag listed with browser support, you get a discussion of what it is, how it works, when you should use it, and a code example (with screen shot) to see how it will work. For me, I need that bridge between theoretical and practical. <P>While the book does discuss XML, JavaScript, and DHTML to some degree, I wouldn't buy this book as a reference tool for those technologies. You'll get basic coverage here, but you could buy separate books of this size on each of those subjects. And if that's the only "bad" thing I can say about this book, it should give you an idea of how much I like this book.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you are looking for a good "all-in-one" book to use in your web development efforts, this would be an excellent choice. A great mix of reference and instruction material in a single volume.</span>
