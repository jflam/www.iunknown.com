                <span id="Label1"><p><i>User Interfaces in C#: Windows Forms and Custom Controls</i> goes beyond simply covering the Windows Forms namespaces by combining a careful treatment of the API with a detailed discussion of good user-interface design principles. The combination will show you how to create the next generation of software applications using the .NET Framework. After reading <i>User Interfaces in C#: Windows Forms and Custom Controls</i>, you'll know how to design state-of-the-art application interfaces, as well as how to extend .NET controls, create data-binding strategies, program graphics, and much more. </p> <p>This book contains the following: <li>An overview of how to design elegant user interfaces the average user can understand.  <li>A comprehensive examination of the user interface controls and classes in .NET.  <li> Best practices and design tips for coding user interfaces and integrating help </ul> </p> <p>Although this book isn't a reference, it does contain detailed discussions about every user interface element you'll use on a regular basis. But you won't just learn how to use .NET controls&#151;you'll learn how and why to extend them, with owner-drawn menus, irregularly shaped forms, and custom controls tailored for specific types of data. As a developer, you need to know more than how to add a control to a window. You also need to know how to create an entire use interface framework that's scalable, flexible, and reusable.</p></span>

                    <span>i still can't believe it--that anyone would write a comprehensive book on windows user interfaces and forget to mention the RichTextBox control. The author devoted 3 pages to the Textbox control, but said virtually nothing about one of the the most powerful text display controls. 
<br />As said by another reviwer, there is nothing here on threading either. This book deserves 3 stars but no more because it is incomplete. 
<br />That said, I still must commend the author for a well written book that flows from one chapter to the next.
<br />If you must get this book, bear in mind that you will have to look elsewhere to cover the omitted areas.</span>

                    <span>I've &#34;grown up&#34; in programming working exclusively with the Web, and recently moved into the very unfamiliar world of desktop development.  This is a fantastic piece of work that gives you a very high-level view of the major concepts and considerations you'll need when attempting to conquer the world of Windows Forms.&#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;
<br />
<br />The book starts out with a brief discussion of some of the more visual aspects of great UI design, which, as author Matthew MacDonald describes, is as much technical as aesthetic.  It then dives right into the major concepts of WinForms - forms and controls, and many of the secrets and tips on using them to create familiar, effective UIs for your apps.  Examples are alternate ways of achieving drag-and-drop functionality for on-form controls, creating floating toolbars for and maintaining synchronicity in MDI apps. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;
<br />
<br />It's very real, very practical, and very easy to grasp. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;
<br />
<br />I was found MacDonald only mentioning certain class members for each of the controls, and the &#34;members&#34; tables listed in the book don't explicitly break the members down into properties, methods and events, which clouds a newbie's learning of a new set of classes and their functionality for the first time.  That's about the only criticism I have with the title. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;
<br />
<br />The book's finest moment is evident in what has got to be one of the best written chapters on the often-complex topic of working with data and databinding in WinForms.  It's thorough, yet easy on the brain in terms of laying out how to work with binding in simple and complex environments. &#60;br/&#62;&#60;br/&#62;
<br />
<br />The book isn't a primer on C# or on programming in general, so the code snippets are largely piecemeal, abstracted modules of much larger Windows Forms and components.  But this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

                    <span>No detailed coverage of the Progress Bar control. Reason: so that multithreading and concurrency could be avoided. It is a common GUI programming task to allow a user to cancel a long running operation while keeping the GUI updated and responsive. However, this requires spawning off a separate thread to handle the long-running operation. That thread must also be able to communicate with the main GUI thread. This must be performed carefully but it is easily done by experienced GUI programmers. You won't get coverage of that with this book. Good luck....

                    <span>I'm finding this book to be a tremendous leg up in transitioning to .Net from VB6. For an experienced programmer trying to move from VB language functions to .Net object methods, this book strikes the right balance in showing and describing how to use the .Net control objects. It supposes you've used each control before, and need a reliable introduction to how to employ the .Net replacement.<p>MSDN has all the technical details you want, but is lacking in the kind of "big picture" overviews of a control. This book provides that invaluable introduction.<p>It seems to me this encapsulates most of the knowledge it takes to consider onself an experienced .Net developer. And yes, there are VB to C# copy and paste errors, but this isn't really a C# book so much as a .Net book. And a very fine one, I'm finding.</span>

                    <span>I am very tempted to give this book five stars, which I rarely do. It's that good. <p>I expected the usual run-through of forms and controls, but this book goes much deeper than that. Several chapters devote themselves to design issues in three-tier applications-- how to move information between a presentation layer and a business layer in an orderly, organized fashion. Since VS.Net is used so often for sloppy database front-ends, good advice has been hard to come by in this area.<p>So why only four stars? This book appears to be a port of an earler book covering the same issues within the context of VB.Net. That doesn't detract from the quality of its content, but the editors missed a few translations from VB to C#. These misses are pretty minor; for example, VB-style brackets are used on attributes (<attribute>, instead of [attribute]), and internal classes are described as being preceded by the 'Friend' keyword. <p>Subject to those minor qualifications, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to program WinForms, and to anyone who wants to learn how to design a proper three-tier application in C#></span>
