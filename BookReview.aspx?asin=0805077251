                    <span>Look, If you have a bachelor's degree and don't know at least 75% of what's in this book, you need to go back to school.  Most of this stuff is everyday knowledge to those of us who care about our money.  This book is for those who finally woke up one day and said, "I need to start saving but I don't know how".  The book basically says, analyze your needs, don't overspend, don't buy a new car (vs used), don't have credit card debt, save b/c you can't count on social security, and live in a lost cost area (Iowa).  That's it.  I just told you the whole book.  Net: If you know nothing, get it, its worth it for $6, but me personally?  I wasted my money.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I've seen on financial management for the average person. It is clear, simple, practical and completely workable. It is relevant to anyone, from the guy starting a first job out of high school to a retiring couple with a good income from a pension plan. It works for the well-off, the middle-class, and the "blue collar" worker.
<br />
<br />This is not typical general advice about how to budget and save (zzzzz). This is specific, useful information and advice on the practicalities of credit, debt, home ownership, Social Security, car buying/leasing, education's relationship to career placement and earnings, insurance, banking, and choices in where to live and work to best suit your lifestyle. Some individual chapters are worth the price of the book all by themselves.
<br />
<br />Not only does the author tell exact how-tos, but he also teaches how to think about money and managing it.
<br />
<br />Another big plus: the author includes many references and URLs for further self-education and self-improvement in financial matters.
<br />
<br />I'm buying more copies as gifts for friends and relatives.</span>

                    <span>Brock scores anther big hit. The data he provides on salaries versus cost of living around the country are invaluabnle. Required reading for anyone who wants to lower his or her anxiety level about spending and saving. The chapter on how little things add up is especially enlightening, and the chapter on education costs is a real eye opener.</span>
