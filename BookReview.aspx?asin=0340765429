                    <span>A relaxing read, full of the good humour and descriptive prose I'd expect from Alan, along with a fact-filled poke around the hills and vales of his life experiences.<P>I would recommend it highly to fans of his fiction, gardening books, and TV work.... as well as those who are curious if he has always had that marvelous hair and friendly smile (lots of great pictures)!</span>

                    <span>Reading this was like sitting down to tea and saying to Alan "tell me about yourself" and he does! It was an informative, enjoyable, and funny book. I am sure I will be reading it many more times to come</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Like most people I have watched Alan on the TV and not really thought any more about him. I picked up a copy of this book not knowing really what to expect. What can I say? It is a delight that had me laughing, crying and most of all remembering things that I thought I had forgotten from my own childhood and teenage years. Alan covers all the aspects of his life as a child growing up in a small community, through to the successful man he is today. If like me you are of a 'certain age', read this book, I guarantee it will delight you and bring the memories flooding back. Very well written and extremely interesting, Alan definitely has more to him than meets the eye!</span>
