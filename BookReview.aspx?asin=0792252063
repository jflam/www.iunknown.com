                <span id="Label1">First and foremost, <I>Asteroids: Deadly Impact</I> is a story about how the world could end. Underlying its premise we find the pillars of asteroidal impact theory, the scientists Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker. The Shoemakers will go down in the books as codiscoverers of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, but their story here is of meteorological sleuthing and, quite frankly, the sheer horror of unpredictable planetary collision. An asteroid slightly more than a mile wide would destroy life on Earth in an unforgiving blast of heat and dust. The funny thing is, there wouldn't be much evidence of this other than a crater (to be mistaken later as volcanic) and a strange mineral called coesite. How do they know? The Shoemakers would say the answer is in the fragments long forgotten. In <I>Asteroids</I>, we follow them from airy theory to cold, hard evidence of asteroids and their deadly havoc on Earth. Hauntingly narrated by Robbie Robertson, this tightly written documentary from <i>National Geographic</i> is as heart-stopping as an "earth-crosser" from deep space. <I>--Jamie Friddle</I> </span>

                    <span>It's astonishing that as recently as 1963 the preponderance of opinion was that Meteor Crater was not caused by an impact.<P>After the last lunar landing impact was established as the overwhelmingly dominant process at work on the lunar surface, but such impacts on Earth were generally still denied.<P>Despite the fact that the Alvarez theory gained ground from 1980 until the middle of 1994, impact as a common occurence continued to be denied. After the SL9 impact on Jupiter (well covered in this video) the last significant resistance to the K-T impact as the mechanism of extinction for the dinosaurs was swept away. That this catastrophe on another world brought about an overnight change in the sciences was appropriate.<P>Now there are many impact craters recognized AS impact craters found throughout the world and not just in some comfortably remote location like the Moon or Jupiter. It is now much cheaper to read constrasting views about such events since the anti-impactors' books have appeared in the remainder lists.<P>Asteroids Deadly Impact is my favorite National Geographic video of all time, and I believe I've seen them all. Perhaps it would be a much better world if people would tune out the daytime (and nighttime) tv garbage and watch stuff like this. Certainly would be worth a try.</span>

                    <span>As you might expect, National Geographic scores a bullseye with "Asteroids." Although much of the content has been explored in other specials, the presentation here is nicely done and the material easily understood. Peter Coyote's voiceover work helps to authenticate the very real threat that asteroids pose to our planet. END</span>
