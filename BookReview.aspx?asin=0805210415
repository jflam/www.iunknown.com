                    <span>This book tells parts of the life story of Primo Levi, author, chemist, and Auschwitz survivor.  Levi came of age in Fascist Italy and graduated university with a degree in chemistry just as World War II started tearing apart his world.  Caught by German soldiers in a Partisan camp, he was shipped off to the Auschwitz death camp as a Jew.  He survived the camp thanks to his chemistry skills, which secured him a job in a rubber factory near the camp. When he returned to Italy following liberation, he resumed work as a chemist, but he also took up writing as a means to communicate the experiences he had been through.  Over the years, he published a number of books about Auschwitz, as well as books of poetry and stories.  In this book, he records his memoirs as a chemist, with each chapter dedicated to an individual element.  
<br />
<br />The chapters are quite varied in topic and approach.  At least two of the chapters are fanciful works of fiction, short stories that he wrote as a young man.  The book begins with a chapter on the Noble gases, in which he compares his ancestors, now just memories, to inert gases such as argon.  Other chapters early in the book are also based on comparisons between character traits of favorite people and chemical elements.  The later chapters, however, are centered around stories or episodes in his life that featured substantive examples of one of the chemical elements.  Some of the stories are quite amusing, others interesting in the historical perspective they provide of conditions of post-war Italy, and some, those describing the Nazi occupation and the concentration camp are disturbing.  The stories are written as stand-alone entities, rather than fitting smoothly together as a coherent whole.  Nevertheless, they are they are organized in strictly chronological order so that the reader can piece together the main events of Levi's life.

                    <span>A rather laid back style of writing in a very conversational approach.  The aspect of his holocast experience is very fleeting and somehow I would have wished for a bit more insight.  From a scientific aspect, one has to appreciate his ability to solve problems, sometimes with minimal equipment.  He clearly is a survivor, not just from his Auschwitz experience, but his ability to forge an existence when others were losing theirs. The first chapter put me off, wondering where this would all lead.  Then, it took hold and was delightful to read.  The periodic table relates to how he labels each chapter.  The chemistry involved is really that of problem solving and insights and the ability to dig deeper. One will not need to fear learning a lot about chemistry per se, but will learn about an approach. It is a light read of a fascinating person.  In many ways, it shows the importance of connections;  one cannot exist without others.  There are many lessons to be learned in this book.  It also tells how science was taught and practiced in the 1930's through the post war period.  I would hope that people would not leave the book thinking that is how is is still done, although the ability to solve problems still remains in the forefront.</span>

                    <span>In the third to last chapter of The Periodic Table, the narrator - Levi - goes to his 25th University Anniversary. He meets a colleague of his, one that he did not know too well during university, and they swap stories on chemistry, a passion and an occupation both dear to their hearts and the thorn in their side. Levi informs the man of the latest book he is writing, a small book, one that, he hopes, will convey the quiet satisfaction he derives from chemistry, because it 'did not seem fair to me that the world should know everything about how the doctor, prostitute, sailor, assassin, countess, Ancient Roman, conspirator and Polynesian lives and nothing about how we transformers of matter live.'
<br />
<br />That sentence sums up very well the thrust of the novel. Split into chapters named after a different element of the Periodic Table, Levi takes us on a journey through his life, from boyhood to adulthood, the primary preoccupation of which being chemistry. There is a very large section that he glosses over - the trauma he experienced in a Nazi concentration camp - and this is because he has, in his own words, more than adequately dealt with that subject matter previously. No, this book is not an upraised fist at Nazi Germany, but it does not shy away from the topic, either. First and foremost, it is a series of essays on chemistry. Not the grandiose, world-changing chemistry, but the small achievements, the humble failures, the baffling oddities.
<br />
<br />First, is Argon. Argon is an inert gas, resistant to change. Just like his family, Levi muses, rapidly jumping back a century and recounting his extended family history from there, with liberal doses of Jewish linguistics and customs thrown in for good measure. Now, acquainted as to the sort of man Levi is, we wander through his college years, each chapter focusing both on his growth as a chemist and a person, but also on the element for which it is named. Interspersed throughout are a few, largely unrelated short stories that deal with a specific element in an interesting way, the story of lead being a particular highlight. These are stories that he composed as a young man, polished and presented in an easily consumed fashion in this, his endstone book.
<br />
<br />The second last chapter briefly touches on Levi's World War II experience. Through a 'typical' chemistry story involving Vanadium, he engages in correspondence with a man who is later revealed to have been one of the many German officers in Bruno, where Levi was incarcerated. This story is sad, and for me was the most powerful of the fifteen or so on offer. Levi is frightened at the idea of meeting this man again - not because the German was specifically cruel, but because it brings back a life since over. The German, Dr Muller, is anxious to be forgiven, trying to 'settle his accounts with the past and they didn't tally'. For Muller, this meeting might even the score, for Levi, it could never. This chapter is one of the shortest, but carries with it the full weight of experience, sadness, and forgotten terror.
<br />
<br />For the most part, however, the novel is not depressing or bleak. Rather, it shows the small joys allowed to a chemist who truly loves his occupation. Chemistry puzzles are solved, there are adventures involving chicken excrement and lipstick - don't ask - and throughout, there is a sense that chemistry can be fun, can be enjoyable, can be exciting. No, it is enjoyable, fun and exciting, but only for certain people. And for these people - Levi obviously included - it is a passion, a friend, a lover, and he wishes to share this joy with us, the sadly ignorant reader. I thank him for that.</span>

                    <span>I read a review of this book in a chemical engineering magazine I subscribe to. After reading the review, I purchased the book and finished in about 2 days. After finishing this book, I went and purchased the other books written by this fascinating man. I have an interest in the Holocaust due to a degree in history, however Primo puts a "humananistic" touch on the experience. His books are thought provoking and enjoyable reads. I highly recommend all of his books-BUT Begin with this one as it puts the others in context of this peron's life and experience.</span>

                    <span>Primo Levi's "The Periodic Table" is a personal memoir of startling innovation, the curriculum vitae of an industrial chemist with the florid eloquence of a poet.  Each of the twenty-one chapters is named after an element of the periodic table which relates directly or metaphorically to the topic Levi discusses in that chapter.  For example, in "Hydrogen," he recalls an amusing electrolysis  experiment he performed as a teenager with a budding interest in chemistry.  To prove to a skeptical friend that a battery driving an electric current through a beaker of water produced a quantity of hydrogen gas, he holds a match to the opening of a glass jar filled with this premier element, exploding and shattering it in an inadvertently symbolic demonstration of the Big Bang.
<br />
<br />"The Periodic Table" is not an autobiography because it intermixes other types of narratives with anecdotes from Levi's uncommonly interesting life.  He was raised in the Jewish community of the Piedmont region in northwest Italy during the reign of Mussolini: "noble, inert, and rare," in the chapter called "Argon," is how he describes his Spanish-bred ancestors who never quite assimilated Italian gentile customs.  His education was conducted under the ominous shadow of Hitler's conquest of Europe, and by the time he received his doctorate in 1941, "the world was racing to catastrophe."  Despite civil laws that tried to separate Jews from gentile society, he was offered a series of professional jobs in a variety of analytical capacities.
<br />
<br />His career was interrupted--this is an understatement--by imprisonment at Auschwitz, where he and a friend working in a laboratory came across sticks of cerium which they tried to turn into flint for the sake of bartering goods.  Many years later, while investigating a defective resin for a varnish manufacturer, Levi had an opportunity to correspond with a German man named Muller whom he had known as a civilian inspector at the laboratory and confront him with questions about the atrocities that were condoned.  
<br />
<br />After the war, Levi's work as a consultant brought him some intriguing cases.  A cobbler came to him one day with a parcel of sugar, a gift from a rival cobbler, and asked him to inspect it for poison.  A cosmetics manufacturer hired him to find out why his lipstick was running; here we are fed Levi's opinion that a red dye called alloxan, whose molecule comprises two nitrogen, two hydrogen, four carbon, and four oxygen atoms, has a "pretty structure."  Indeed, it's difficult to deny the neatness of its symmetry (Levi shows us a diagram), for such symmetry usually indicates a durability analogous to that of sturdily designed engineering structures.
<br />
<br />One of the two "external" narratives takes place in the Bronze Age and is told by a sage named Rodmund from barbarian lands of the north who travels the world searching for lead with which to craft useful items; he is a pioneering metallurgist.  Mercury is the subject of another, in which an English sailor discovers a vein of quicksilver under the volcano which forms the small desolate island on which he lives.  These two chapters enter the realm of imaginative fiction and are like the irresistible icing on an already rich cake.
<br />
<br />Levi writes about chemistry and the techniques of chemical analysis with professional assurance but also with the lucid language of a novelist eager to tell a fascinating story.  Non-chemists need not be intimidated by the subject matter because Levi is the most welcoming of writers, willing to share his knowledge but never pedantic and, surprisingly, never pretentious in his literary aspirations; he is as much at home with the pen as he is with the Pyrex.
