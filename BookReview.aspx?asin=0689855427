                <span id="Label1"><P><BR> Boston, 1919. It's been a terrible year for thirteen-year-old Joshua Harper. The influenza pandemic that's sweeping the world has claimed his father's life; his voice has changed, so he can't sing in the Boston Boys' Choir anymore; and now money is tight, so he must quit school to get a job. It's not fair! <P> Joshua begins working as a newspaper boy, hawking papers on the street, but he soon finds himself competing with Charlestown Charlie, a tough, streetwise boy who does not make things easier for Joshua. It seems that fitting in is not as easy as it once was. Then disaster strikes the city of Boston. Joshua must do what he can to help, and in doing so he finds the place -- and the voice -- that he thought he'd lost.</span>

                    <span>1919, Boston, Massachusetts. Life's been very hard lately for 13-year-old Joshua Harper. First and worst, he lost his father to the influenza epidemic. He also can't sing in the Boston Boys' Choir anymore because his voice has changed and now he will have to quit school to support his family. Not fair at all!<P>Joshua begins working for Charlestown Charlie, a mean and tough Irish boy. He also becomes a story hunter for Mr. Muggeridge, a new boarder at his house. Mr. Muggeridge wants to put street stories into the newspaper. Soon, though, Joshua runs into trouble with Charlestown Charlie and the Beacon Boys. Everything about his new existence on the street is in danger.<P>Joshua had a lot of courage and determination when he quit school and tried to find a job to help his family. I also thought he had a lot of bravery because he tried to save a woman's life when a terrible explosion occurred. If I would have been Joshua, I would have done the same things he did, but I would have tried to find a way to get the rest of my education.<P>I liked this book because I thought it was exciting --- I never knew what was going to happen next! How does Joshua come to find his voice, his song, and his place in the new world during a terrible crisis? Read this book to find out!<P>(...)</span>

The characters are all well-drawn and believable, the plot is exciting, and the historical accuracy is impeccable. Youngsters will love this book, and even adults will find themselves caught up in Joshua's life.</span>
