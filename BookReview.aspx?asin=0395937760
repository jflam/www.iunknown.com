                    <span>I can't believe the negative reviews submitted by others on this text.  The text is meant to be used with all of the ancillary materials (Workbooks,Personal Tutor CD-ROM, Notetaking Guide, etc.)  There are also transparencies for every chapter.  The entire mathematics program from Larson is designed with this format.  These are high school level mathematics courses and at the Houghton Mifflin website you will find college level mathematics courses by the same author.  In fact, this author takes you from beginning Algebra all the way to Calculus and Differential Equations (high school thru college).  I was so impressed with the computer tutorial  CD-ROM because everything is explained in detail and there are computer quizzes to take after every lesson segment.  These quizzes were designed to verify comprehension of the material before the student moves forward to the next lesson.  Great job by all of those involved in putting this program together!   </span>

                    <span>Okay, I don't really know what to say about this book. But I try to teach myself how to do some problems out of the book and sometimes it's plain confusing. In the examples they give you steps but they don't really explain why you do the steps. They basically give you answers and it's not really a good book to learn from. A good teacher who knows how to teach would be good to add on with the book....</span>
