                    <span>The title of the book is very grand. However, the content of the book is far inferior to the title. I was expecting the concepts or ideas that would bring about splendors in philosophy, art and science in great magnitudes just like what took place in Renaissance, but instead the author just filled the pages mostly with small and insignificant examples and stories.
<br />
<br />This is just a book on creativity. Its significance is not as big as the recent book, "A whole new mind," or older books such as "At work with Edison." It would be much better if the author can focus his study on how Renaissance came about and on how to replicate or recreate the favorable environment and fertile ground for bringing about another Renaissance on a comparable or even greater scale.
<br />
<br />The biggest flaw of this book is that even though the main thesis of the book is on many people from single-disciplinary background coming together to create something multidisciplinary, most of the examples in the book are about single individuals having multidisciplinary abilities creating something new and not at all at the scale of the Renaissance. Besides the brain-reading program and the British code-breaking group mentioned in the book, all other examples were single individuals. So, where is the Medici effect of people coming together?
<br />
<br />The second flaw of this book is the assumption that when people come together, a Renaissance will happen. The author is asserting that diversity in ethnicity, geography, age, and gender have a greater chance of coming up with unique ideas. This is wrong. What's needed is diversity of expertise, not just diversity. Diversity of mediocrity does not mean increased chance of creativity.
<br />
<br />In summary, I am very disappointed in this book. The title shows great promise, but the author couldn't deliver it. There is much work to be done to understand and promote multidisciplinary creativity. This is one of the very few books that touch on this subject. There is much work to be done in this area. And if we want to create a new Renaissance, then the work becomes monumental!

                    <span>As Johansson carefully explains, this book is really not about the Medici family, although the community of creative people its members funded exemplifies all manner of exciting possibilities for collaborative productivity; nor is it really a "business book," although Johansson asserts -- and I wholly agree -- that there are lessons to be learned from that community which can be of substantial value to organizations in the 21st century. For example, to corporations which rely on multi-lingual communications and multi-disciplinary initiatives to compete successfully in a global marketplace. 
<br />
<br />So, what is this book's core concept? The idea behind it is simple: "When you step into an intersection of fields, disciplines, or cultures, you can combine existing concepts into a large number of extraordinary ideas."
<br />
<br />Johansson achieves three specific objectives: He explains what, exactly, "the Intersection is and why we can expect to see a lot more of it in the future"; next, he explains "why stepping into the Intersection creates the Medici Effect"; finally, he outlines "the unique challenges we face when executing intersectional ideas and how we can overcome those challenges." With regard to the third objective, I am again reminded of a passage in Leading Change where Jim O'Toole observes that there are always unique and formidable challenges when threatening what he characterizes as "the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom." 
<br />
<br />In Part One, Johansson focuses on the Intersection which, for most of us, offers the best environment in which to innovate. Next, he explains how to create the Medici Effect within that creative and collaborative environment. Then in Part Three, he offers specific suggestions as to HOW to make intersectional ideas happen. I share Johansson's faith in what an Intersection makes possible, no matter who is involved, no matter where that Intersection may be located. I also agree with him that we can all create the Medici Effect because we can all get to the Intersection. "The advantage goes to those with an open mind and the willingness to reach beyond their field of expertise. It goes to people who can break down barriers and stay motivated through failures." There are countless examples of groups whose talented members created the Medici Effect. For example, the research laboratory which Thomas Edison established for himself and his associates in Menlo Park (NJ) in 1876; he relocated it to West Orange (NJ) in 1883. 
<br />
<br />Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman examine more recent examples in their book, Creating Genius: the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; Apple Computer which then took it to market; in the so-called "War Room" which helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; the so-called "Skunk Works" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; Black Mountain College which "wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place" for the artists in residence from 1933 to 1956, "it was about creative collaboration"; and Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called "the Gadget." 
<br />
<br />Although the brief excerpt which follows is taken from Johansson's Introduction, it serves as an appropriate conclusion to my brief commentary: "We, too, can create the Medici Effect. We can ignite the explosion of extraordinary ideas and take advantage of its individuals, as teams, and as organizations. We can do it by bringing together different disciplines and cultures and searching for places where they connect. [begin italics] The Medici Effect [end italics] will show you how to find such intersectional ideas and make them happen. This book is not about the Renaissance era, nor is it about the the Medici family. Rather, it is about those elements that made that era possible. It is about what happens when you step into an intersection of different disciplines and cultures, and bring the ideas you find there to life." 
<br />
<br />If there is another book published in recent years which is more intellectually stimulating than this one, I have not as yet read it.</span>

                    <span>Medici Effect opens slowly and at first I was disappointed: just another book of business successes.  But as I began taking notes, I realized Frans Johansson really has a new message for all of  us.  
<br />
<br />I recommend skimming the first chapters to get to the second part of the book, and then going back to understand application of principles.  The heart of the book is about the definition of intersectional innovation and the conditions that must exist for breakthroughs to happen -- a combination of individual qualities, environmental support, luck and perseverance.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most helpful, most widely applicable guidelines involve planning for failure and, relatedly, moving from quantity to quality.  Prolific authors, artists and business people tend to be successful. They might discard a dozen "bad" ideas to come to two or three successes.  So we should reward people for actions, not just success. The only true failure is failure to act.
<br />
<br />I also liked Johansson's discussion of risk, especially the notion of "risk homeostasis." If we take risks in one area, we compensate by avoiding risks in another. And a false sense of security can lead to senseless risk-taking.
<br />
<br />Johansson's examples make fascinating reader and probably helped sell the book. But I couldn't help thinking that he offers little hope to the majority of people who find themselves in environments where they are forced to specialize. Risk-taking and diversity of experience tend to be discouraged and in fact we tend to disparage what I call the "winding road" career path. Richard Branson is an innovator; on a lesser scale, he'd be a rolling stone.  
<br />
<br />Johansson emphasizes that underlying diversity, most people have a core competence where they've developed a solid expertise. I think that point has to be addressed, along with the need for a social antenna that allows innovators to find a supportive arena.  If you're too maverick, you're dismissed; too conformist, you're not innovating. Where's the balance?
<br />
<br />For example, Orit Dagiesh, the Bain consultant, must have paid lots of dues to reach her position. And while Johansson says she defies the consultant stereotype, she does so in a direction that enhances her femininity, with high heels and jewelry.  If she'd been more casual or sporty, she might not have been taken seriously. Attractiveness pays, especially for women.
<br />
<br />After reading this book, I began to see other examples of intersectional innovation. Natalie Goldberg's first book, Writing Down the Bones, mixed Zen Buddhism with writing. 
<br />And Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity argues for creating new networks to make meaningful career changes.
<br />
<br />If I were teaching an MBA course in marketing, strategy or product planning, I'd recommend this book. And I'd recommend this book as a gift to anyone interested in business ideas. Those who liked Malcolm Gladwell's book, The TIpping Point (which Johansson discusses) will like The Medici Effect too.  </span>

                    <span>I admit I had very high expectations for the Medici Effect after hearing some positive buzz about the book.  So maybe it's not surprising that I was a bit disappointed.
<br />
<br />Frans Johansson starts with a great concept: that innovation is most likely to occur at the intersection of multiple fields or areas of interest. He does an admirable job organizing and tying together  a number of relevant ideas and examples. I found some of the examples to be among the most useful parts of the book because they gave meaningful details about how the innovators who are profiled got started and what they went through to acheive their breakthroughs.
<br />
<br />However, much of the book's discussion about the creative process (e.g., "Creating the Medici Effect" and "Making Intersectional Ideas Happen) seemed, if anything, too basic. I'd heard much of it before.  I guess the introduction and the preceding headings led me to expect more in-depth insights.  But the book really "describes" the innovative process more than  exploring how it happens. That's not necessarily a flaw, but if you're expecting finer details, you may also be left wanting more.</span>

                    <span>In schooling we tend to become more and more specialized, learning more and more about less and less. In this book the concentration is on the intersection between scientific disciplines. How does a study of the foraging behavior of ants lend clues to large-scale business problems like factory scheduling and telecom routing? This is not to say that specialization is not important or necessary, you want a doctor that is a specialist on exactly the problem you have, and in building a semi-conductor you need specialists in that field. But the author contends that hte broad new ideas will come from breaking down barriers between departments in the university, in business and in cultures.  
<br />
<br />We all know that there are huge problems facing the world today: energy after oil, global warming, AIDS, just to name a few. They will not be solved by one technology. Energy involves everything from finding oil (and its replacement) to designing cars, to what to do about the mundane filling station that now sells only gasoline. There's no distribution system to provide for electric or hydrogen cars. The answers will come from multiple fields of study.</span>
