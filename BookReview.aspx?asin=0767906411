                    <span>I am a fan of Eric Harr's work. I've read his columns in Shape magazine and have enjoyed his other titles very much. I am dismayed at the review written by "Barbara Jordan "brownsugar76" who is obviously misguided and pessimistic. This book is a tips book -- 100 in all -- that give people basic guidance about exercise and living better. It never promises to be a thick, boring, scientific guide ... and THAT'S the appeal. There are hundreds of fitness books out there. Harr tries to deliver fitness wisdom in 100 simple tips. Granted some of them are a little "soft" for fitness buffs -- but most are very valuable.
<br />
<br />I'm giving this book 4 stars, because it is GREAT for many people getting into fitness, but it's not geared towards more serious fitness people (who work out, say 5+ times a week).
<br />
<br />Barbara Jordan "brownsugar76" doesn't see the book for its incredible value...which is a hearty book in easily-digestible "one-a-day" tips for people seeking to get fit and live and eat better.
<br />
<br />As to her comment about the reviews of others, it appears Barbara Jordan "brownsugar76" is jealous of Eric Harr's success. I checked these people's reviews -- and they're REAL people with real opinions.
<br />
<br />Be wary of green-with-ency reviewers like Barbara Jordan "brownsugar76." This is a great book. Decide for yourself.</span>

                    <span>Finally, fitness advice that will get you off your couch and onto the track / bike / into the pool / or whatever else you do. I just bought the book about a week ago, returned home, and read it cover to cover in an hour. One hundred simple and truly life-altering strategies are contained within that have gotten even my lazy self up and moving. Over the past two days, following the book's advice on everything from nutrition, to technique and motivation, I've run ten miles (and feel great!), and I don't plan on stopping any time soon :).  From his writing, the author is a truly fit individual, both mentally and physically, and his personal perspectives on the wonders of a clear mind and a healthy body are refreshing every time I open the conveniently-pocket-sized book. Humorous, compelling and without pretense, Harr's guide can pull out the passion and performance in anyone (and I mean anyone) and set them on the path to a healthier and happier self.</span>

                    <span>This book demystifies many weight loss, nutrition and exercise issues in a clear, friendly, expert way. It helps to answer why we're getting fatter in America. I read this wonderful book in eight hours--but don't let that fool you; it's packed with good information and moving inspiration. Every word matters. When I started showing results, my friends and family wanted to know the secret. At least 3 of them bought the book for themselves. Eric Harr's advice and motivation really works. Big! How do I know? Because I'm significantly SMALLER! Yahoo!!! :)</span>

It's helped me enjoy exercise more and get more out of life. It's inspired me. I am actually going to train for a 10k run in the New Year. This book makes a great gift. Thanks mom for getting it for me!!! ;) - Jess.</span>
