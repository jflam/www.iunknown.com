                    <span>What is great about this book is that it immeadiately engages you in ancient debates, which is what ancient philosophy is about. Do you really want a list of names and principle doctrines? There are plenty of books like that. There was a different consciousness in ancient times; to read ancient philosophy through our modern consciousness is to misread it. This book helps to engage the reader as the ancients engaged in their philosophy.</span>

                    <span>This little pamphlet is the first philosophy work that I have ever read, and Prof. Annas wrote it for people like me. <P>Her intention is to help people engage with the thoughts of the ancient (Greek) philosophers, and to show how the questions with which the ancients grappled are the same questions that we ask today.<P>I have a somewhat better understanding of Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. Am I a better person? I do not know. Did the ancient Greeks tell me anything I did not know already? Maybe not.<P>Yet I think Prof. Annas might say, along with the ancient Greeks, that philosophy is worthwhile even if we derive no benefit from it at all. This is a book about those who practiced philosophy for its own sake.<P>So I would say that a beginner such as myself ought by all means to engage with both the ancient Greek thinkers and Prof. Annas's exposition of them. You might find yourself wanting to learn more and more about the ancient thinkers, without being sure why.</span>

                    <span>This book didn't strike me as great, but I feel I have to offer a dissenting opinion at least. It provided an introduction to many names and events in an easy style. Its true that its a huge subject, but it begs for an introduction because you will miss so much if you only read about Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. But I think some of the other criticisms voiced in these reviews may be legitimate.<P>And VSI is the best series of introductions I've found. They are mostly easy to read, but not aimed so low as to insult the intelligence of most adults. The one exception to this so far has been the VSI to Socrates by C. Taylor.</span>

                    <span>Every once in a great while comes a book that takes what can be a difficult subject matter and melts it into a coherent, readable whole that can be enjoyed by both student and intelligent reader alike, whether in the classroom or on the commuter train to work.<P>Unfortunately, this book is not one of them.<P>To be effective, a "short introduction" must not only be concise, but also reader friendly, keeping to the subject as close as possible in langauge terms designed to enlighten and entertain with an eye toward expanding the reader's interest in the subject covered.<P>Annas conveys none of the above, mainly because she hardly sticks to the subject matter at hand: philosophy. Instead we get a historical-political-sociological treatise that fails on every level to meet the expectations a reader has coming into the book.<P>Actually, when one applies common sense, this is too large a subject to fit into too small a format. For a couple of dollars more, there is an excellent title called "Greek Philosophy" by the same publisher. Also, for a few dollars more, are the works of popularizers Bryan Magee, Roger Scruton, and Robert Solomon, each of whom will give you way more than your money's worth. Try them; your wallet won't feel used and abused.</span>

                    <span>If you buy this hoping for a quick and easy intro to the names, lives and thoughts of early Greek philosophers, you're going to feel let down. The author seems to think that she's got more important things in mind than organizing and running the essential facts by you. She wants you to wonder about the usual tedious gender/power/class "issues," how perceptions of the Greeks have changed over time, what it all does or doesn't mean to us, and much else I could have lived without. And then she subjects you to pages of "Now, class, what do you think?"-style discussions. Questions for author: how is a reader supposed to have deep or searching thoughts about a field before knowing anything about that field? And: isn't this book meant to be an introduction? By the way, teacher's own deep and searching thoughts didn't impress. All in all, like a day spent at a bad progressive school. <P>There are probably lots of not-bad intros to the field out there. Maybe other reviewers can suggest a few. I've found intro-to-philosophy books by Bryan Magee and Paul Strathern helpful and well-written. There's always the encylopedia, as well as a couple of free online dictionaries of philosophy.<P>By the way, beware this whole series of Oxford "Short introductions" unless you have eyes as sharp as an eagle's. Someone gave the designer entirely too much leeway. The books look attractive but are almost unreadable -- the print is dinky (as in footnote-size)and entirely sans serifs. I could manage only five pages at a time before my middle-aged eyes gave out.</span>
