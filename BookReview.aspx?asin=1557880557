                    <span>Adams' book is wonderful for learning the basics of suspension design.  More important than only learning the concepts of suspension geometry is the application of that into practical use, which Adams shows concisely.  His information is put out in a way that you can actually make a simple system, then understand the 'why' behind it enough to tune it.  Very good for anything less than professional design.</span>

                    <span>The book is very easy to read. You can improve your  car suspension, it's explain all about that. <p>The chapter about frames is good, you can understand all aspect to stiffness and strength of the chassis, and you can design you handling chassis using a model.<p>Es un libro de fácil lectura, explica los aspectos básicos de las suspensiones de vehículos.<p>Es posible mejorar e incluso diseñar una suspensión. Explica como medir la resistencia torsional de los chasis y como mejorarla.<p>Explica como mejorar la maniobrabilidad (handling) de un vehículo.</span>

                    <span>Chassis Engineering, by Herb Adams is a great primer.  When I bought the book it was exactly what I needed.  Not too theoretical, more on practical.  There are many rules-of-thumb that I thought were very helpful in guiding my decisions.  The book provided me with about 80% of what I need to know about designing my own suspension.  Don't expect everything from this book, it's the size a magazine.  I was perfect for me, however, as I knew very little about the subject and I didn't want to get bored learning from a 400 page textbook.  Very high recommendation for $14.</span>

                    <span>Herb Adams' Chassis Engineering is a good introduction to chassis and suspension design for the general reader.  The book is easy to read and well laid out with lots of photos and diagrams.  A cursory reading will reveal many of the intricacies, interrelationships, and compromises involved in designing components and subsystems to engineer a chassis for a given purpose.  Anyone with an interest in automotive design with high school reading skills can certainly gain some insight and appreciation for the complexities of chassis and suspension design from reading Adams' book.<br> <br>As entertaining and informative the book may be for the general reader, Chassis Engineering cannot in any way be considered a reference book.  The informed reader, or anyone with an editorial eye, will quickly spot inconsistencies throughout the text.  The definitions and use of fundamental terms vary from page to page and there are direct conflicts between essential portions of the text and the supporting illustrations.  Those familiar with the subject can easily overlook the errors and get the gist of the wisdom Adams is trying to impart.   For all others:  take all information in Chassis Engineering with a grain of salt until it can be cross-referenced and confirmed by better reference material.</span>
