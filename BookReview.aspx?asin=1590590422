Parts of this book can be used by developers (experienced or not) and managers who want to know about MSF and UML in connection with .NET development. </p>  <p>This guide provides an enterprise development overview, an in-depth introduction to UML, and coverage of various enterprise tools included with the VS .NET Enterprise Developer (VSED) and VS .NET Enterprise Architect (VSEA) editions, such as enterprise template projects, Visual SourceSafe (VSS), Visio for Enterprise Architects 2003 (VEA), Microsoft Application Center Test (ACT), and Visual Studio Analyzer. </p>  <p>Not only will you learn how to deploy your project, but also two hands-on chapters will show you how to analyze your project and model it using VEA, and guide you step-by-step through the process. </p>  <p>For most readers, this is a cover-to-cover book, but it can certainly be used as a reference guide whenever you need information about a particular tool or process. Throughout this book, you&#146;ll find exercises that demonstrate the topic being discussed, making this book a must-have for programmers dealing with, or those with an interest in, developing enterprise .NET solutions. </p></span>

                    <span>Bought this book hoping it was a good guide to developing enterprise applications in VS.Net with UML (visio); man was I wrong. If you have the slightest idea of what UML is, and you know your way around VS.Net, go somewhere else. It just scratches the surface of a lot of things and you have probably read this somewhere else. But, the reason for the three stars is that if you are new to VS.Net, this is actually a good book. It has a lot of heuristics and guidelines for a rookie developer, on how to plan you project, protect your code and deploy your applications. Not exactly what I was looking for.</span>

                    <span>I have been working with .Net for almost 2 years now. This book is a good companion to enhance your over-all skills as a .Net developer. It really helps to see how you would use UML and MSF to complement your .Net coding skills. There are areas of this book that tends to drag (really, we didn't need the comparison to Rational XDE nor did we realy need to cover Visual Source Safe). 
<br />
<br />What I would like to have seen is actual documents that would be produced when going through the life cycle as described in section six - MSF (this is where a lot of books fall short).
<br />
<br />But sections 1 - 4 (with the exception perhaps of VSS) are real gems. Definitely worth the price of the book.
<br />
<br />Good job John & Carsten!</span>

Do check out this book as it is remarkable value which you normally only find in 2-3 books and its very well written.</span>

                    <span>Info, info, info! The book is packed with info for the enterprise dev team. And its good info from page 1 right until the end. If i have to pick a favourite section it would have to be the enterprise tools section as it really gave our team a boost in understanding the enterprise architect tools in just a few weeks. We would have have spent much mcuh longer obtaining this info in other ways.
