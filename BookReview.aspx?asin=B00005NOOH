                <span id="Label1">Sir Jeremy Isaacs highly deserves the numerous awards for documentaries he has earned: the Royal Television Society's Desmond Davis Award, l'Ordre National du M&eacute;rit, an Emmy, and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. His epic <I>The World at War</I> remains unsurpassed as the definitive visual history of World War II. <p>  The Second World War was different from other wars in thousands of ways, one of which was the unparalleled scope of visual documents kept by the Axis and Allies of all their activities. As a result, this war is understood as much through written histories as it is through its powerful images. The Nazis were particularly thorough in documenting even the most abhorrent of the atrocities they were committing--in a surprising amount of color footage. <I>The World at War</I> was one of the first television documentaries that exploited these resources so completely, giving viewers an unbelievable visual guide to the greatest event in the 20th century. This is to say nothing of the excellent, comprehensible narrative. Some highlights:<p>  <ul> <li><I>A New Germany 1933-39</I>: early German and Nazi documentation of Hitler's rise to power through the impending attack on Poland <li><I>Whirlwind</I>: the early British losses in the blitz in the skies over Britain and in North Africa <li><I>Stalingrad</I>: the turning point of the war and Germany's first defeat <li><I>Inside the Reich--Germany 1940-44</I>: one of the most fascinating documentaries that exists on life inside Nazi Germany, from <I>Lebensborn</I> to the Hitler Youth <li><I>Morning</I>: prior to <I>Saving Private Ryan</I>, one of the only unromanticized views of the Normandy invasion <li><I>Genocide</I>: this film is one of the most widely shown introductions to the Holocaust <li><I>Japan 1941-45</I>: although <I>The World at War</I> is decidedly focused more on the European theater, this is an important look into wartime Japan and its expansion--early 20th-century history that lead to Japan's role in World War II is superficial <li><I>The bomb</I>: another widely shown documentary of the Manhattan Project, the Enola Gay, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki</ul><p>  <I>The World at War</I> will remain the definitive visual history of World War II, analogous to Gibbon's <I>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</I>. No serious historian should be missing <I>The World at War</I> in a collection, and no student should leave school without having seen at least some of its salient episodes. Rarely is film so essential. <I>--Erik J. Macki</I></span>

                    <span>This series tells the story of World War II primarily from a British perspective, but the story it tells is powerful and compelling.  The musical score, the graphics, the interviews and the narration from Sir Lawrence Olivier combine to make this one of the finest documentaries ever made.  Looking back with great appreciation to the producers of this documentary getting first hand interviews with such people as Doenitz, Kleist, and other nazis as well as telling the story of civilians who suffered such tremendous losses and went through such incomparable hardships.  
<br />
<br />War footage from the Soviet Union and obtaining interviews during the cold war with Russian survivors of the war is a remarkable accomplishment that leaves their account available and accessible for future generations to understand the conflict and how it shaped the modern world.  </span>

                    <span>I purchased this DVD set because I wanted to see a good WWII documentary and this one was so highly rated. It is a good documentary, maybe a great one. But it has a troubling Anglo bias that ends up being a severe character flaw. 
<br />
<br />Am I being phobic here, or is America's role in the European war severly under-represented in this film? Examples abound: We become intinmately familiar with British generals Montgomery, Alexander and Horrocks. Montgomery is shown in many situations including a long-ish speech excerpt before a civilian group. Horrocks (British 30 Corps commander) is given lengthy screen time to explain how Eisenhower missed a golden opportunity to end the European war in 1944 by not putting all the Allies' weight behind Monty in the North. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, only 4 American generals are mentioned in the whole European war part of this series: Eisenhower, who gets the bare minimum of screen time for a supreme commander, Bradley is in one scene for one second, Clark's failure in Italy is covered in copius detail, and Stilwell is shown as head of Allied forces in Burma. Notice any names missing? How the heck do you talk about the European war and not even use the word "Patton"? I dunno, but this film manages to do that. So Patton doesn't even get mentioned, but we are treated to several long interviews with Lord Avon (who the heck is that you may ask--I have no idea--I never heard of him either). Anyway, whoever he was, Lord Avon gets more screen time than all the US generals put together.
<br />
<br />Sour grapes, you say. This guy is an Anglophobe. He is too sensitive and too proud of his American heritage. Well, check me on this: If you were making a documentary about WWII, would you give the predominately British war in Burma the same amount of screen time as the ENTIRE war with Japan? No? Well, that is the "balance" assumed by World at War. The skimpy coverage of the Japanese war does not even mention Guadalcanal and covers only one of the huge Pacific naval actions--the Marianas Turkey Shoot. 
<br />
<br />Another whole reel is devoted to the U-boats and the British "Battle of the Atlantic". Never mind that the US submarine war in the Pacific, that sent nearly all Japanese ships, freighters and warships alike, to the bottom, was probably the single most successful application of naval power ever. That brilliant naval victory is not even mentioned. 
<br />
<br />The only "Home Front" covered on the Home Front episode is England! 
<br />
<br />The reel about the atomic bomb focuses on diplomacy, never even mentions the incredible scientific triumph that was the Manhattan project, and perversely squeezes in the implication that it was Truman's failed diplomacy with Russia that lost Poland to the Soviets! Paul Tibbets is made to seem like a mass murderer, dropping the bomb in the face of overwhelming evidence that Japan wanted to surrender. The footage of Tibbetts is deliberately drawn out to make it appear that he felt casual and matter-of-fact about dropping the first nuclear weapon. The Japanese diplomat Kase is shown saying that the atomic bomb was "unnecessary". Well, he's right about that--the whole doggone Pacific war was unnecessary starting with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
<br />
<br />The funny thing about the anglo bias of this film, is that the Russians and their war are well covered. Stalin and his generals get big screen time. This is as it should be, given the overwhelming Russian role in the European war. So why is the USA's role almost deliberately downplayed? At one point, Sir Lawrence narrates to the effect that Churchill wanted one big British victory "before the Americans came to dominate the war effort". I guess my point is that American domination of the western allied war effort did eventually come. But you'd never know it from watching this film.</span>

                    <span>When I was recently recuperating from surgery at home, this series was the first that came to mind as more of a study than a diversion. From the narrative to interviews, it is unforgettable. Mr. Olivier's understated delivery was even at release of this series, imitated (early Dan Akroyd on Saturday Night Live), and such lines as in the "Stalingrad" episode where he quotes Hitler "...we've got it really..." at a very late stage of this battle, are simply definitive. It is clear that a great deal of pain-staking effort went into this series, and is like a favorite movie (though hardly a movie); it can be viewed repeatedly, almost poetic. </span>

<br />In an age where documentaries are maybe six one hour episodes at most, seeing "World at War" is quite a revelation. No fewer than 26 one hour episodes, all masterpieces.
<br />
<br />I really loved this series when it aired in the 90s, when I was fourteen. It pretty well started the obsession with history that I still have. But looking on it ten years later, I am even more impressed by this series. 
<br />
<br />Having read thoroughly into World War II, I would have expected this series to begin to appear like other artefacts of childhood - i.e., not as good as I initially thought. But the sheer thoroughness and good judgement shown in these episodes is amazing. There is also some very unusual stuff, such as interviews with Himmler's aide, interviews with Arthur Harris, interviews with Gross Admiral Doenitz (who died an unrepentant Nazi).
<br />
<br />Add to that the superb writing. The spoken narrative is delivered by Laurence Olivier, in a remarkable performance. It is full of choice phrases, such as "The Germans were keeping to the timetable of 1940, not 1914", and, "For one empire, the sun had set; for another, the Sun was still Rising..."
<br />
<br />Overall, this is like the Iliad of World War II. It forms one coherent narrative yet can be watched in individual episodes. One is struck, at the end, by the sheer tragedy of what happened in this, the biggest war of history and THE epic struggle between good and evil in the twentieth century.</span>
