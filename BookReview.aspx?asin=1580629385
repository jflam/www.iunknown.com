<br />I never believed that such books can help someone get a job, but actually this one was very nice to read.
<br />The idea is not to memorize the answer it gave, but actually it builds the base that makes you prepare answers according to your knowledge and previous experiences, make you understand the concept behind those questions
<br />Very well return with easy words to understand. It will sure add something to your job search experience and interview skills.

                    <span>Best known for his "Knock `Em Dead" series of books directed at job seekers, author Martin John Yate (co-writing here with Peter J. Sander) now turns to what happens after the seeker finds a job, does it well and gets promoted to management. He offers the know-how you need for that first management assignment: how to deal with subordinates, how to handle management duties when your subordinates are downsized away, how to create and lead teams, recruit a staff and so on. Yate goes a bit heavy on recruitment information, perhaps because he focused on that area previously. The book is directed at novice managers; anyone with business experience would find it simplistic. Though not novel, it is a useful, reasonably comprehensive collection of the principles that tend to be heavily discussed in business schools, management seminars and motivational meetings. That's not a bad thing, when you think about it. While this may not vault you up to the next rung on the career ladder, we note that it will be a useful addition to your basic bookshelf - if you want to get out of that cubicle and into an office with room for a bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>This book does a great job of helping you answer the most difficult interview questions.  As a training manager, who trains managers and executives on how to interview, I feel I am qualified to say this book works.  <p>This book is a wonderful resource once you get the interview.  This leaves us with the question, "How do you get an interview?" Simple, know the type of job you want and pursue it, if  you do not know what type of job you want you may want to read the classic, "How to find your dream job and make it a reality."  By Jason McClure.  <p>Read this book, and practice for your job interviews and you will be successful in your job hunt.</span>
