                    <span>Having a daughter myself, I was naturally drawn to this book. It is beautiful in concept, and the writings from the fathers and daughters are much more powerful than the photographs themselves. Of particular interest was Vernon Jordan and daughter each writing about their friendship; Nigerian author Chinua Achebe writing how cultural changes in his country are forcing him to publically dote on his children, and how he is reluctantly, enjoying it; and finally the little girl who likes her daddy because he's always fun. <P>Can't beat that, that's what we're for.<P>The problem is that at 132 pages, you can go through the whole thing in a day. There weren't enough memorable letters to warrant reading them over and over. And, as another reviewer alluded, most of the photos are posed, and emotionless.<P>Although this is still a nice gift between fathers and daughters, the editors should have solicited far many more essays, and used a lot more emotion in the photos. Even though I enjoyed it, I wouldn't have paid for it myself, as it feels like it was designed not to be memorable or touching, but to sell books.</span>

                    <span>The heart of this book is a series of photographs showing a father and daughter(s). In many cases, one or the other (or both) then makes brief comments about one another. Although many famous fathers are included, ordinary dads are here, too. The father-daughter relationship is captured only superficially here, because the subjects are protective of each other in both the comments and in the observations. Only occasionally does a glimpse of the core of the relationship come through. I am aware of this from having heard some of the fathers and daughters speak about each other in the past. The introduction by William Styron masterfully captures the father-daughter role in literature, and goes on to explain about his relationship with his three daughters. You see the same transition from openness to great care as he shifts to talking about the women, which shows that the wise father knows how to be both polite and careful in what he says. <P>An exception to this closed material shows up in one of the first comments, in which Charles Waters describes how he taught his daughter, Alice, how to set the table so she wouldn't be criticized by her sister. It's a beautiful, gentle story that can help all fathers and daughters.<P>The only revealing photograph is of Bill Bradley and his daughter Theresa Anne. He has on a terrific looking suit. She is wearing a beautiful dress. They are each relaxed and smiling as they sit on a small seat in the middle of the grass in front of a hedge. Then you look down . . . and see that she's barefoot and he has on old tennis shoes without socks. Suddenly, the whole photograph clicks in a new way and you understand the relaxed relationship they must have with one another, filled with fun. <P>Basically, the photographs fall into three categories. First, there are those where the daughters are dominated by dad. In the most extreme cases, dad is an emperor surrounded by his consorts. The second type has dads who step into the background so the image focuses on the daughter. Some of these seem forced and artificial. The third type shows people who are equally connected to each other in respectful, affectionate ways. I generally liked the third type best, but found them all to be interesting. <P>Here are my favorites: Styrons; Paul Volcker and Janice Zima; Jacques and Bethsabee Attali; Colon, Linda, and Annemarie Powell; Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Christina Schlesinger; Yo Yo and Emily Ma; Mark and Madeline Bromley; George and Mary McGovern and Susan McGover; Colin and Rudi Salmon; Allen and Annie Shawn; Harry Blackmun and Nancy Blackmun Coniaris; James Vincent and Jon Marie Gearen; Niccolo Tucci and Maria Gottlieb; Thomas, Luned, and Rosamund Palmer; Claus and Cosima von Bulow; Ron and Sadie Cooper; and Vernon Jordan, Jr. and Vickee Jordan Adams.<P>The photography is done beautifully from a technical point of view. The lighting is great, the contrasts are powerful, and the compositions are insightful. The only problems occur in some outdoor shots where the background required a scale that didn't quite work, but was necessary for the photograph. The reproduction is also outstanding in this volume. I wager that some of the fathers and daughters don't have a photograph nearly as good as these in their homes today, outside of this book.<P>One of the nice surprises in the book is its conception. Ms. Cook was inspired by her father's looming 80th birthday. " . . . [I]t occurred to me that he would not live forever. My best friend was aging." "I became fascinated with every father and daughter I saw." The photograph they appear in at the end has him holding his 80th birthday balloon, as they both look up at it. Suddenly my heart was full of what father-daughter relationships are and can be. "Each love has its own roots, its own destiny." What a great and thoughtful monument to her father this book is! <P>I suggest that you develop your own album around this theme. You can do the same for siblings and for mother-son pairs. Take photographs at different ages, and capture a few comments at the time. I assure you that this will deepen and expand the mutual love of all involved by celebrating the best of these relationships.<P>Support and help those you love . . . always!</span>

                    <span>...I was pleased, when I received the book, with its size (almost a coffee table-sized book) and with the photography; however, I thought the pictures could have been more intimate. To me, the fathers and daughters looked too much like they had posed. Although a description of the relationship of the figures in the photo may accompany the photograph itself, I feel that the photograph should also depict the closeness (or distance, as the case may be) of the relationship of the fathers & daughters. I won't argue the photography, though. The pictures are beautiful black and white photographs. They just seem to be lacking some emotion...I had hoped that it might seem more personal.</span>
