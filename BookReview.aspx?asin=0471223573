                <span id="Label1">Security is the number one concern for businesses worldwide. The gold standard for attaining security is cryptography because it provides the most reliable tools for storing or transmitting digital information. Written by Niels Ferguson, lead cryptographer for Counterpane, Bruce Schneier's security company, and Bruce Schneier himself, this is the much anticipated follow-up book to Schneier's seminal encyclopedic reference, Applied Cryptography, Second Edition (0-471-11709-9), which has sold more than 150,000 copies.<br>   Niels Ferguson (Amsterdam, Netherlands) is a cryptographic engineer and consultant at Counterpane Internet Security. He has extensive experience in the creation and design of security algorithms, protocols, and multinational security infrastructures. Previously, Ferguson was a cryptographer for DigiCash and CWI. At CWI he developed the first generation of off-line payment protocols. He has published numerous scientific papers.<br>   Bruce Schneier (Minneapolis, MN) is Founder and Chief Technical Officer at Counterpane Internet Security, a managed-security monitoring company. He is also the author of Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World (0-471-25311-1).</span>

                    <span>Well, I can't really recommend the book. It's readable enough,<BR>but I can't figure out their target audience. Only someone actually<BR>implementing a cryptographic system would get anything out of <BR>this book. At the end of the book, they warn you that a good <BR>implementation is so hard that you really should hire an <BR>expert to do it. They also say "The world is full of of bad<BR>security systems designed by people who have read Applied <BR>Cryptography. Practical Cryptography is likely to have the<BR>same effect."<P>They say they wrote the book as an introduction to the state<BR>of the art ("[people] .. must learn it somewhere, and we didn't <BR>know of any other suitable books.") Given that no one but a <BR>programmer or mathematician would get through half the book, <BR>it's unlikely to reach a general audience, or even the managers <BR>who really need their advice.<P>The content level of the book is very uneven as well, with <BR>general, strategic advice mixed with algorithm discussions. Yet <BR>there's almost no nuts and bolts programming advice. They just <BR>point you off to other sources for all of that.<P>They have these little "So what should I do?" sections at the<BR>end of most chapters, but they are pretty cynical. The most <BR>common advice amounts to "there's no way to know without analyzing <BR>your requirements." The other comments are along the lines of<BR>"the software industry is a mess", "the standards process is a mess", <BR>"the patent process is a mess", "(technique X) hasn't been around <BR>long enough to be analyzed much, is a patent minefield, or has been <BR>broken, or nearly broken. Don't use it." And finally, that security <BR>depends on the weakest link, which generally won't be the <BR>cryptography anyway. (Don't even try to do this at home!) This <BR>may all be true, but it's not really helpful.<P>I don't know if you could implement a complete system from their<BR>description of which techniques are reasonably good. If you <BR>trusted their implementation advice, should you also trust their<BR>overall advice, which is to leave this to the experts?<P>The whole thing leaves me with the impression that they are pretty<BR>bitter about the whole field. They want people to do better on <BR>security, but they have no expectation that they will. They want<BR>to be listened to (and hired), but don't expect that either. The<BR>book is mostly to say "see how complicated this is (you idiots!)?"</span>

                    <span>For those of you (including myself) who were expecting an updated version of the Applied Cryptography, this book is NOT it. Based on the pre-publication blurbs here and there, I thought it may be a simple how-to book without too much theory. The book didn't turn out to be that sort of thing either.<P>This book is, sort of an executive summary of Applied Cryptography (AC), with some updates. It touches upon the insights that Scheneier mentioned in Secret and Lies (like crypto is the easy part and that won't solve security). It mentions some newer material, notably AES related stuff. The description is, in effect, a simplified version of AC. Also, it doesn't try to cover everything, and yes, some explanations about the practical applications are stressed slightly more than in AC.<P>So if you want to be practical, just go over the essential and latest stuff, this is a good book to read. But I must say that it's not as fun to read as AC. Not as many jokes, and absolutely no crazy stuff (like bio-computing and the significance of dark matters). Oh well, maybe that's what being practical means... But it doesn't give you the feeling of throughness that AC gave. Maybe this comes from my reading AC too much in detail (I actually translated the whole book into Japanese), but I think it is inherent in the book itself. In trying to cover as much ground as possible, the book hurries a lot.<P>So if you are in a hurry to cover just enough important stuff, get this book. And if you need some explanation on the newer stuff, get this. But I also recommend getting AC as well.</span>

                    <span>I've read a large number of cryptography books. Very few of them come down to brass tacks. They give you a description of a few algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses, and leave it at that. Either that, or they describe in lovingly complex detail the implementation of a particular protocol, one usually so fraught with options and details that you wonder how, at the end of it, that anybody writes a conforming implementation.<P>Practical Cryptography does neither of these things. It presents algorithm classes, why they exist, and what the best known algorithms are in each class. It explains how the various strengths and weaknesses of algorithms in each class combine to make a cryptosystem weaker or stronger. Then it goes on to show you how to use that information to build working cryptosystems.<P>People have complained about the book's seeming schizophrenia. On one hand, the authors are trying to show you how to build a secure cryptosystem. On the other, they're telling you how hopeless a task it is to build one that has no vulnerabilities, even if you're an expert in such things.<P>This can be annoying, but I more find it refreshing. Writing a secure cryptosystem is very hard. People should be aware that it is hard, and they are likely to make mistakes. It isn't something that should be attempted lightly. The current state of computer security is depressingly abysmal. People should be encouraged, as much as possible, to not contribute to the problem.<P>I'm not following my own advice, and I am building a new cryptosystem. I have found this book a more valuable resource than any other book on cryptography that I have yet read. Even if you aren't building your own cryptosystem, I think you will find the insights this book has into complexity and design to be useful tools in evaluating other cryptosystems.</span>

                    <span>If Bruce Schneier has acquired a habit, it is the ability to take the same old material and rehash it into different books, year after year. My guess is that, next year, he'll use another slightly different angle and try to sell you the same basic information. What you need to do, as a consumer, is step back and see this book for what it is: supplemental income and marketing for Bruce Schneier. <P>Years ago, Bruce was laid off from AT&T Bell Labs. Since then, Bruce has been using rubes like you to augment his salary. Let's face it; if Bruce were a Ken Thompson or a Claude Shannon, he'd probably still have his job at Bell Labs. But he isn't. Instead he wrote a book and touted himself as an expert to an industry of people who didn't know any better. <P>What I find truly onerous about his books is the condescending tone that Schneier adopts when addressing the reader. It's if he's saying "I am so much more elite than you, I can't even begin to tell you." I agree with previous reviewers, I was a little put off by the fact that he recommends you hire an expert to implement a cryptosystem. Hire an expert? Then why in god's name should we buy the book? Entertainment value? Please, do tell Bruce, we're all waiting to hear why you made us waste $20.00. Did you buy a new sports car?<P>Recently I spoke with a PhD, from Brown, who performed decades of research in number theory. He recommended "Cryptography in C and C++," by Michael Welschenbach. He also said "I don't know why people think Applied Cryptography is such a good book. He [Schneier] doesn't seem to understand the mathematics very well." Pick up Applied Cryptography sometime and compare it side-by-side with Welschenbach's book. You'll see what that PhD was talking about. <P>The truth is that Bruce Schneier is a lot of style without much substance. He's a businessman who can sell himself to an unsuspecting public. What he lacks in ability he makes up for with moxie. Having lived in Minneapolis, I'm more than familiar with the type of silly yuppie pretenders that live on Hennepin Avenue with their nose piercings and their tattoos. Bruce, that ponytail doesn't fool anybody. You're just another suit with something to sell.</span>
