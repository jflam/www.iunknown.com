                <span id="Label1">Programmers tend to be specialists--they tend to do the same  kind of programming over and over. The MCSD exam is targeted at technical generalists--developers familiar with a broad array of Microsoft technologies and development approaches. With its comprehensive overview of core technology areas, <i>MCSD in  a Nutshell</i> is the perfect study guide and resource to help developers master technologies that are less familiar to them. Most certification books are really  tutorials in disguise. In contrast, this book focuses on the advanced  topics about which developers are actually tested on the exam.</span>

                    <span>This book was worth every cent! I have just recently passed both of the VB MCSD exams with 900+ scores and James Foxall has helped to keep me sane during the process.<P>When studying for the exams you want to be sure that all topics are covered and at an appropriate level. MCSD in a nutshell does better at this than any other book I have seen. (I had access to 4 and only used/needed this & 'Programming VB6' by Balena - the best VB book on the market, but unfortunately not exam focussed)<P>I have good IT experience, however haven't been using VB for a great amount of time. This book made me aware of, & educated me on, all the VB topics needed, with the exception of web classes which Balena covers well.<P>Another bonus is it's size. Being smaller than the useless tomes that are out there, I could take it with me everywhere to ensure a steady stream of learning.<P>If you find this book too much of a slog due to it being too high a level - you're not ready for the exams.<P>Having the exams behind me, I'll be keeping this book on my shelf. (Right next to Balena of course) It's not intended to be a reference book but it will definately have some use as such.<P>Finally, use Trancender! You'll not regret it!</span>

                    <span>I read the book in a month (I'm a slow reader), took some Transcender practice tests, passed the distributed with a 914/1000.<P>Had I known about this book before I began studying for the Desktop exam, I'd have been able to take both tests in the same day and pass them both! It's a great book.<P>The beauty of it is that it doesn't assume you're starting from ground zero. You have to know the basics of building VB apps with forms, built-in controls, database access, etc. That's why it's only 600 pages! However it does start from the beginning on topics a lot of us experienced VB developers have not used much if at all such as building ActiveX controls, using MTS, using property pages, licensing, digital signatures, etc. -- all items you have to know for the first two core exams.<P>If you're going to get your MCSD, GET THIS BOOK and through out everything but your Transcenders, your copy of MSDN, and your Bible. Prayer is always your best resource!</span>

                    <span>I guess i'm late, cus microsoft is now phasing out MCSD! Anyway i did both 70-175 and 70-176 yesterday (April 26th, 2004) and i Aced both exams (900 and 814 respectively). I primarily used this book, it covers everything u need to know. The great thing is that Mr. Foxall actually did thesed xams and understands exactly what they're about and as such does an excellent job in presenting the material. The chapter on Package and deployment and COM are the best i've seen yet! THIS BOOK + TEST KING practice questions EQUALS PASS.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because of all the positive reviews it got.And it seems that everyone that I read was a good review.<BR> So,I started reading it the day I got it.I have only been through the first 3 chapters . I have already learned more about COM and three-tier applications,than any MS Press book I have read.I would have to say the author does and outstanding job at going in depth about topics.Also,he lets you know what is more then likey to show up on the exams.He's not one of those authors who just knows VB,he is actually MCSD certified.I think that has to say a whole lot about him and his experince.<BR> I would say coming from someone who has only read 3 chapters of the book and giving it 5 stars.That should say enough about this book as a study guide or just to sharpen your skills as a VB Developer.I recommend this book for any VB Developer to add to his library. <P>NOTE:I dont recommend it if you are trying to learn VB ,that's probally not going to happen.</span>

                    <span>I just passed 70-176 today and I have to give James Foxall's book a lot of credit. It covered all the areas covered on the exam and does an excellent job at it. I do have to say this, however, that his or anybody elses book alone will not guarantee a passing grade. You definitely need to supplement any book with Transcender. Transcender helped me uncover the areas I was weak in and Jim's book helped me brush up on those areas. The two together will go a long way towards success. I also have very little real world experience in VB. Most of it was through what I did on my own and what seems like a mountain of exercises. So any of you that have day to day experience in VB and haven't taken any of the exams, then this book + Transcender + your experience --- hey, you've got it made.</span>
