                    <span>I'm an engineer who uses Project in my work and this book has been a great help. Every time I've had a problem getting the software to do what I wanted this book has provided a clear and consise explanation that helped me get through the problem. I'd recommend it to anyone who uses Project for major projects and doesn't have time to waste finding an answer on how to get the software to do what you want it to.</span>

                    <span>I recently bought this book in electronic format to save time with delivery and then also to give e-books a try. Afterall, they have benefits, like little storage requirements, portability, you can search them through, etc..<p>Well, it all turned out to be a nightmare experience :(<p>First of all there is Adobe DRM (Digital Rights Management) which obviously limits you from opening the ebook PDF on any computer you like. Each time you want to read it on a different computer, say at work, you must go through a painstaking activation process. Excerpt from adobe store:<p>"Adobe Reader 6.0 ebooks cannot be moved from machine to machine, as the security of the file is tied to the machine on which the ebook is downloaded."<p>Not only that this takes all your time and energy, frustrates and enfuriates you it also does not work it turned out. I got server timeouts, "excuse us, but the server will be up running shortly" notices, you name it. Beware, I'd not be writing this if I wasn't thoroughly frustrated with the service. It gets better, read on..<p>After I searched and searched to find answers regarding the secretive digital rights management I wrote to customer support asking them a few questions just to understand how often and where I will be able to read my ebook (which cost the same amount as the regular paperback) and if at all I will still be able to access my ebook after, let's say, 5 years when I have reactivated it on several computers?! NO answer. Great.<p>You will find that part of their service is to let you activate it on PocketPC so that you can read it both on your computer and on your handheld. I can't find the excerpt right now, but it clearly stated you can do this. Well... as it turned out, not really and neither did it say so anywhere readily accessible. Having myself spent about 1.5 hours trying to get it to work, reinstalling Adobe Reader on both the PC and the PocketPC, reactivating, etc.. I looked into forums and found a post by a man who said he had spent 2 days trying to get it to work and then right underneath his call for help a cold answer apparrently from adobe employee that PocketPC 2003 (available since beginning of 2003) does not work with it yet, and they are planning on implementing it in the future. Tough luck, I just bought a book and should be glad I can read it on my own PC after having activated it. I better read it fast, because who knows, if my windows crashes I might even need to buy it again!? :(<p>The essence of a book for me means that<br>* I can take it anywhere with me and read it<br>* store it in my library for literally 100+ years and still be able to "access" it and read it whenever I like<br>* even borrow it to my friends ocassionally or sell it to a book shop after I don't want it<p>None of these seem to apply to e-books, yet advantages for publishers are enormous considering there are NO printing expenditures involved and they cost normally the same amount as regular books.<p>Last I'd like to say that I hope the ebook business survives, it would be a pitty to use technology to help disseminate. I hope Adobe reads this and takes action, too. I have 8 years of experience in computer support so no excuses on my part, sorry.<p>Good day to all and thanks to amazon for their great service in every respect.</span>
