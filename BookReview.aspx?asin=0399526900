                    <span>I've always admired John Wooden's work as a leader of men. I have his Pyramid of Success on my office wall. Mr. Biro's work has brought the building bricks of the pyramid into focus for me. This a well written work that reaches far beyond the "self help" genre. It was very well organized, inspirational and motivating.</span>

                    <span>I have always been a sceptic of the books located in the "self help" section of bookstores. But a friend bought me Brian Biro's book Beyond Success for my birthday and told me i HAD to read it. I didn't plan on it but one day i was lying in bed, and i looked over on my nightstand, and i saw the book there. I decided to give it a try. By the first chapter of this amazing book, i was hooked. Brian Biro is one of the most talented and inspirational author out there today. I HIGHLY recommend this book all people. Parents should read it to their children, teenagers should read it, everone should!!This author if not yet, will definetly become a bestselling author in the near future.</span>
