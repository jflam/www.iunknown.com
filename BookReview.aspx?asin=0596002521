                <span id="Label1">If you need to create or use formal descriptions of XML vocabularies, the W3C's XML Schema offers a powerful set of tools for defining acceptable document structures and content.  An alternative to DTDs as the way to describe and validate data in an XML environment, XML Schema enables developers to create precise descriptions with a richer set of datatypes that are essential for today?s applications.  While schemas are powerful, that power comes with substantial complexity. This concise book explains XML Schema foundations, a variety of different styles for writing schemas, simple and complex types, datatypes and facets, keys, extensibility, documentation, design choices, best practices, and limitations, with examples throughout.  In addition, <i>XML Schema</i> provides a complete reference to all parts of both the XML Schema Structures and XML Schema Datatypes specifications, as well as a glossary. Appendices explore the relationships between XML Schema and other tools for describing document structures as well as work in progress at the W3C to more tightly integrate XML Schema with existing specifications.</span>

                    <span>This book is very dry and terse. It has all of the required content but it doesn't provide much perspective of how it should be used. You could use it as a reference, but I recommend the XML Schema Companion before this one.</span>

                    <span>Having recently read "Definitive XML Schema" by Priscilla Walmsley I thought I'd learned all I needed to know about XML Schema. That book is more tutorial in tone and content, while this one quickly dispenses with the background material and gets into the technical details. In fact, by chapter 2 you're already developing a schema and the subsequent chapters drill deeper into the mechanics of XML Schema. <P>I like the way each facet, factor and detail of XML schema is covered, including clear descriptions of data types, a direct linkage to XML-based databases, and all of the building blocks along the way. More importantly, the author provides multiple approaches to developing schemas, and sufficiently covers the syntactical requirements and specifications to allow you to become proficient in creating them for real applications.<P>The book is fast-paced and you will need to be familiar with XML and its related vocabularies in order to follow this book. If you need a more introductory, tutorial-based book get "Definitive XML Schema" by Priscilla Walmsley. However, if you understand the fundamentals of relational databases, are currently developing DTDs and understand XML, this book is better suited to your experience level and is the one I recommend.</span>

                    <span>This book had potential to be a definitive guide to XML schema. This is not the kind of book you can pick up and read cover to cover (unless insomnia is a real condition for you, in which case this book may help). It is, by no means, a tutorial of XML schema - or even a reference. It's more of an exploratory academic walk of the W3C recommendation and all of its foibles and nuances. There is wealth of information in this book, if you can glean it out from inbetween the droning prose and historical diatribe.<P>O'Reilly should be shamefully embarassed for ever letting this book go to print in the condition it is. It is replete with errata, typos, and slopped together examples. This book is destined to frustrate those new to XML schema. An uncharacteristicly poor level of quality for O'Reilly.</span>

                    <span>Let's face it; the XML Schema recommendations are complex, academic and often arcane. The book attempt to provide a quite in depth coverage within a limited amount of pages, the result is a solid amount of info, but definitely a dry reading, not practical oriented, almost academic. The author assume a good understanding of XML and its related technologies, it's a useful, detailed book, but beginners should definitely look elesewhere</span>

                    <span>I provide a copy of this book to attendees at my schema training courses (several dozen copies to date). I have gotten a lot of positive feedback from my students, some of the more technical engineers in large IT companies. It was selected by attendees with strong technical experience due to the succinct and complete coverage. In other words, it is an ideal reference book for experienced developers, not a tutorial or graphical book for your first exposure to W3C Schema. Given the complexity of the Schema spec, it is nice to have a thorough reference tool such as this on your desk when implementing the standard. I have provided other Schema books in the past, but have gotten feedback that they have more noticeable discrepancies or vaguaries.</span>
