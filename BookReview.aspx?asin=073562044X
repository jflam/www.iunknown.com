                    <span>This is the book I keep on my computer table standing just to the left of my monitor. And I have to admit that I've never read it. When the operating system is doing funny things, this is the book I reach for. The index is good enough that I can usually find what I need to know with only a couple of trys. And when I get to the area I want, the writing is clear enough that I can fix whatever it is that's giving trouble at the moment. 
<br />
<br />I don't know if it covers everything there is to know about XP, but I don't care. It has so far told me anything that I wanted to know. 
<br />
<br />I'm going to quit writing this review now. Someone just brought me a company notebook that was used by an ex-employee who left no record of the password. The book has an entry in the index - Passwords, Recovering From Lost. What more can you possibly ask of a book. </span>

                    <span>After reading through titles like "Hacking XP" and "XP Hacks" and "XP for Power Users" and finding no satisfaction in any of them, I came across this thick volume which I had initally ignored because it was thick and it was published by Microsoft.  I was skeptical what an official MS book would say about Windows XP.
<br />
<br />I'm glad I overcame my suspicion and picked up this book, which I ended up buying.  It's worth every penny, let me tell ya.  It's packed with information both beginners and advanced users can use anytime, any place, in any mood.  From wi-fi setup to taking full advantage of Windows Firewall to finetuning performance to interface customization, this book has it all.  Best of all, the tips are 1) extremely useful and practical, 2) totally safe (unlike those in some other books which can really wreak havoc on your PC -- probably a conspiracy by some to make unwary users hate XP?), and 3) easily accessible and understandable.  The three authors, veterans of the computer press, write very well and I, not a computer geek by trade or nature, actually felt happy reading through this book.
<br />
<br />The only downside is this is a very thick book at over 1300 pages.  It's packed with step-by-step guides and clear screenshots, so be prepared to spend a lot of time.  Also, because it's big, a lot of real gems are buried, so be prepared to highlight a lot, too.
<br />
<br />I agree with other reviewers: this is the best XP power user's guide, bar none.  Be sure to get this "2nd edition" which was published just recently.</span>

                    <span>Would you like to know more about the Windows XP operating system? If so, then this guide is the one for you. It contains thousands of tips, tricks, and solutions to problems relating to the Windows XP operating system and it can help to expand your level of knowledge by leaps and bounds.
<br />
<br />This reference book has three clear advantages: the overall length of the guide, the organization, and the format. First of all, the length is more than 1,200 pages, which is enough to cover a multitude of issues. Second, the organization is superior, with nine main section and black and blue colored tabs that help a user to find specific sections quickly. Third, the format is very helpful. Not only is the outline format easy to follow and learn from, the use of screen shots makes a tremendous difference by illustrating exactly what you can expect to see if you attempt one of the commands. 
<br />
<br />A book this large can get a little bulky to handle, but it contains so many useful tips and advice that you will likely have no problem overlooking this one small flaw. A person who is brand new to Windows XP can learn all about how the system works by using this guide, and a more advanced user can find out ways to do things that are simple and more efficient. I particularly liked the sections that cover managing and finding folders and different ways to use and manage the Windows explorer. I never knew that so many better, more user- friendly options existed until I found them in this guide. 
<br />
<br />I have read quite a few books about Windows XP, but this is one of the best reference guides of all. It presents an exhaustive amount of detail about Windows XP, covering just about any topic you could ever want to know. It's long, it's big, but it's also a very helpful book to keep close to your PC.

                    <span>Whether you're a newbie or an intermediate user of XP, their is never an end to tricks you can learn. I use this book in the classroom to train my students, they love it. People make a mistake and purchase the skinniest book they can find or one that has in the title "24 hours", or "weekend". Those books are great but their not going to help you at 12 o'clock in the morning when you have a XP or computer question. Buy this book you won't be sorry.

If you are looking to leaern all you can about Windows XP, I think Windows XP Inside Out is the book to get. It's not a quick reference or anything but it is very detailed. </span>
