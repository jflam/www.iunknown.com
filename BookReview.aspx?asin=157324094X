                <span id="Label1"><I>Peaceful Kingdom</I> chronicles amazing true stories of devotion and bravery from the animal world. Included are both well-publicized cases, such as the gorilla who tenderly carried an injured child to safety, and the more obscure--the German shepherd who visited the grave of his deceased owner every day at the same hour. Even ants are caught in heroic acts: they're observed pulling a thorn from an injured comrade. The animals in this book are viewed as compassionate, thinking creatures that experience real emotions--hardly news to animal lovers. <I>Peaceful Kingdom</I> also reflects human acts of kindness to animals. Edward Lear, the famous author of "The Owl and the Pussycat," built his new house as an exact replica of his old one to keep from traumatizing his beloved cat. <I>Peaceful Kingdom</I> is an intriguing and heartwarming journey into the lives of some astonishing animals.</span>

                    <span>I can't believe this book is out of print. Reading it is like opening up a treasure chest and finding one gem after another. Each animal story touched me and opened my eyes and my heart to the world of animals. The stories are short and easy to read, and I found myself having a hard time stopping to take a break sometimes, I kept wanting to hear more stories. A great book to read outloud to your children too, my son was also awed by the stories. I was amazed at how smart and how compassionate animals really are. There are some interesting animal facts included too as side notes. I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>The first time I read this book I thought it was one of the most wonderful books I ever read. I thought the same thing the second time I read it. I loved every story. And the best part is it doesn't just give you stories about animals and what they've done to people to change their lives, or save them. But it also gives you notes on how to return the kindness. And even stories on how people helped animals. Some of the stuff in this book is almost to hard to belive, but if you think animals are wonderous creatures that deserve the love and respect that all living things want, then you will belive everything in this book. I did. After you read the stories in this book, you'll have a different out look on all creaturs, even ants. All the stories in this book are just wonderful and amazing. My 5th grade teacher read two of the stories in this book to my whole class, after that I looked for the book. And obviously found it. Anybody who loves and cherishes their animals will love this book. Or if you just love animals and want a good read, this book would be a perfect choice.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must-have if you know an animal lover or if you are one yourself. It tells many wonderful stories on animals acting in brave ways to show kindness to people and to other animals.
