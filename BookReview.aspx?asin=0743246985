                <span id="Label1"><P> Blending the intimacy of memoir and the panoramic sweep of eyewitness history, <I>Wild Swans</I> has become a bestselling classic in thirty languages, with more than ten million copies sold. The story of three generations in twentieth-century China, it is an engrossing record of Mao's impact on China, an unusual window on the female experience in the modern world, and an inspiring tale of courage and love. <P> Jung Chang describes the life of her grandmother, a warlord's concubine; her mother's struggles as a young idealistic Communist; and her parents' experience as members of the Communist elite and their ordeal during the Cultural Revolution. Chang was a Red Guard briefly at the age of fourteen, then worked as a peasant, a "barefoot doctor," a steelworker, and an electrician.  As the story of each generation unfolds, Chang captures in gripping, moving -- and ultimately uplifting -- detail the cycles of violent drama visited on her own family and millions of others caught in the whirlwind of history.</span>

                    <span>I've studied the history of China for years and even lived in China for a year. I found this book amazing in many ways. First it is a true story covering three generations - three radically different times in Chinese history. Second it is told with a brutal honesty. Most amazing still is Jung Chang's writing style she has the ability to paint a picture describe a scene and you are there. Her words give you enough detail to be in that place and feel the emotions of the situation. You will not get lost in endless descriptions of the background and the weather as in some historical tales. Nor does she delve into a philosophical debates and explanations of political decision making processes at high government levels. (This would have been very tempting to include). There is a great deal of political information in the book. There are details of the political life of Party Members but throughout the book Jun Chang keeps the details wound tightly around the main characters - her grandmother, her mother, her father and herself. Her honest descriptions of the student led cultural revolution are as heartbreaking as they are terrifying. If you have any interest at all in the history of China or of social behavior you will not be disappointed in this book.</span>

                    <span>There are few histories that read as well as this one. It tells the history of three women who see three ages of china. A grandmother who lives during the war lord period, the nationalist and Mao. A mother who is loyal to her party who along with her whole family is tormented and tortured under Mao. And finally a daughter who is raised in the cult and the disilluion of Mao. <P>This book is also a great introduction to modern chinese history. The reasons for the rise and fall of all the political regemes in china are outlined. As well the faith and loss of faith in communism in china is well out lined. This history is factual and personal at the same time. Her is a look at three generation of Chinese who struggled with warlords,the Kumingtong and the cultural revolutions. Women and men of character who were tormented for their belief by there own political party. <P>I loved this books and believe that Chung Jung has created a master work that is for all time. This is hard to say about a history, but the truth is in this book.</span>

                    <span>this is a beautiful book. maybe even my favorite of many classics.<P>it is the story of three women, strong and united with a determination that will get them through the hardships of China from the early nineteen hundrens to the present. optimism and love for each other and their family, as well as tears and sadness, get them through their lives as well as the tyrannical reign of Mao, a powerful dictator of China. <P>i am partly struck with wanting to share this book with you, and invite you to read it, (though it is certainly not children's fiction, but mature, adult fact) or to keep it like the treasure it is to me and i'm sure many others. if you do read it, covet it. is a bargain for what you get in return.</span>

                    <span>This book does something that most people don't get around to doing when they say this or that about China: Provide historical detail. Specifically of interest:<P>1. The reason that the Kuomintang was not successful in China was constant corruption. Some people have suggested that Chinese people love tyrants (Jasper Becker, "The Chinese") and this is the explanation of why they rejected what would have been a democratic government for an authoritarian government. This is partially true, but the Kuomintang blew any chance that it had at legitimacy with its rampant corruption.<P>2. That the Communist Party became popular because they promised to not be like the corrupt and crooked Kuomintang. Her father is an example of one of the wide-eyed idealists that really believed in his cause at the beginning and was left a broken man when he saw what actually became of this grand vision. People at Western universities are always attacking the West and praising the Communist ideology/ governent allocation of resources, and they haven't a faintest idea of the actual RESULTS of the intended programs. Nor do they understand the incentive structures that led to those results.<P>3. Historical accounts of the great famine. I can't believe that this very afternoon, there are still people trying to talk away this historical event in China and say that it was just a statistical illusion. This is the second author that I've read that gives historical accounts of people eating their children.<P>4. Demonstrating how the cult of Mao was created and maintained, as well as what were his motives in the various campaigns (Cultural Revolution/ The Great Leap Forward) that swept the country during his reign. Another author (Anhua Gao) has also noted that Mao generated a lot of morass in the country because the weaker the country, the easier it was to control. But her detail is not comparable to the author of this book. She showed the self-denunciation meetings and the stages of his campaigns to keep the country divided and fighting against itself. It may be another 200 years before China shakes off the residual results of his rule (such as overpopulation and then the resulting sex imbalance that has come about because of population control), but here in this is an example of WHAT happened, and HOW it happened.<P>5. Showing the highly ritualized behavior of Chinese people in things such as foot binding, etc. A lot of people may come to China and wonder where people here get their ideas from and why they are prisoner of them. This author demonstrates that it's been that way for a *long* time. And it may never change.<P>It's hard to recommend this book enough times for someone who wants *actual results* of what happens in the context of a Communist Revolution, as opposed to the vague ramblings of something like the Communist Manifesto or state-sheltered academics in Western universities.</span>

                    <span>(Aug 2003 release) Being interested in Chinese culture for sometime, I finally found a book that has given me something other than state sponsored history facts. I came across this book by accident. I began reading at the bookstore on Saturday evening and wasn't able to put it down until going to work on Monday morning. This book made me laugh, cry and scared the **** out of me in some places. It has definitely given me a wider perspective on the Chinese people and its culture. I'm looking forward to the release of Jung Chang's next book on Mao due out this year.</span>
