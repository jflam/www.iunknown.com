                <span id="Label1">Part P.T. Barnum, part Billy Graham, his vision transformed shopping  in America and made him one of the world&#146;s richest men. Sam Walton started poor as a  depression baby in Oklahoma&#146;s dust bowl.  He became the richest man in the nation,  single-handedly building his chain of Wal-Mart stores into the world&#146;s largest retailer.   SAM WALTON: BARGAIN BILLIONAIRE tells the quintessentially American success  story of this retail giant.  See how he built his empire from a single store to a global chain  in less than thirty years, sneaking up on established names like Sears and K-Mart and  passing them by before they could adjust to his challenge.  Revealing interviews with  associates, including former Wal-Mart board member Hillary Rodham Clinton and ex- CEO David Glass, detail his strategy and trace his incredible road to success.  And family  members, including his wife, son and brother, offer insights into the private man.  BIOGRAPHY profiles the entrepreneur who proved that if there&#237;s one thing everybody  loves, it&#146;s a bargain.</span>

                    <span>As a recovering communist/socialist, I found this riveting film highly entertaining, and enlightening. It is not hard to see why Mr. Walton achieved such great sucess. His hands on ability, and perservience allowed his company to achieve unparalleled greatness.<p>While many do not like Wal Mart in its current incarnation (a fair criticism yet outside of the scope of this review) a lot can be garnered from the success Mr. Walton achieved, by his force of will/personality, embrace of technology, and his careful attention to detail.<p>Therefore since five stars is the highest I can give and since fists are not allowed I must give it five stars. However, if fists were possible I would give it two fists up!!!!</span>

                    <span>This biography does justice to the man behind Wal-Mart, it tells of a quintessential American entreprenuer, whos goal was to make the consumer the number one. Today Wal-Mart is successful because of the principles Sam Walton instilled in it, this biography gives a real feel for this incredible man and his story.</span>

                    <span>I know a long time ago Sam would not let his employees be treated like employees are treated today.Today many are employeed at his Walmart stores are not beeing treated fairly.New assoiates making less money are hired every day to replace their loyal assoiates that have been there through the good and the bad.No one seems to care in management because they to are tring not to get replaced.(Store 1121 for exsample)1121 is laying off loyal assoiates and cutting houres claiming WalMart cant pay them,but hire new ones when we cant live off 20 or less hours.Is Sam Waltons promice rembered now about WalMart beeing a family store?No.The book should make his promice keept say (I hope my promice will be keept.)</span>
