                    <span>Everyone in my office has a copy on their desk (if not multiple copies). I saw Snow Dowd talk at Flash In The Can. She is extremely knowledgeable in all matters flash related. I did not get a chance to attend Mr. Reinhardt's seminars, but I can only imagine the interesting concepts he had to share. The support website (http://www.flashsupport.com/) is also a resource of immeasurable value. All in all, when it comes to Flash and Action Script I would say Snow and Robert are the place to go for up to date cutting edge info (although I'm not sure I agree with Robert's anti-tween stance).</span>

                    <span>I've used this book for my Web Animation class and while it doesn't tell you every little thing you need to know about Flash. It's a great book to get started, especially if you need to work off of real examples then the cd-rom files included would really help. Although I wished that this book covered certain subjects in more detail and included more tutorials . . . This book would be good for beginners and maybe even intermediate users could use this as a reference. It gives you a nice balance of Flash animation and web design. However, after reading this book, you'll probably end up buying more books on Flash like me. If you're going to be focusing more on Flash web design, you might want to buy the Flash MX 2004 ActionScript Bible as well.</span>

                    <span>On the positive side this is a very comprehensive book. This would be an excellent reference book for intermediate to advanced Flash developers. On the the other hand it is not a very good book for beginners. I learn best by actually doing examples or tutorials. Unfortunately, there is not much of that in this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm not the very best with computers, but with the proper guidance, I've always been able to produce good work. After being stumped with variety of issues I hunted down some assistance at www.flashsupport.com. Robert, the flash guru incarnate, easily solved anything I could throw at him... and proceeded to point me to this wonderful tome, which has taken its perch next to my coffee cup and my cell phone.<BR>Keep up the good work guys!</span>

                    <span>I'm new to using Flash and just picked up this book. It's fantastic! I even had a few questions that I e-mailed the author about and he was very responsive, which I didn't expect. <P>The book is clearly written and very logically laid out. I even used the book's forum site to help me with some problems that the book didn't cover. <P>All in all, a very good experience and I'd recommend it to anyone just starting or experienced with FLASH. One of the best purchases I could've made.</span>
