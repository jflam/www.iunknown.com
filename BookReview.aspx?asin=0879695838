                <span id="Label1">Newly appointed principal research investigators have to recruit, motivate, and lead a research team, manage personnel and institutional responsibilities, and compete for funding, while maintaining the outstanding scientific record that got them their position in the first place. Small wonder, then, that many principal investigators feel ill-prepared. In this book, a successor to her best-selling manual for new recruits to experimental science, At the Bench, Kathy Barker provides a guide for newly appointed leaders of research teams, and those who aspire to that role. With extensive use of interviews and a text enlivened with quotes and real-life examples, Dr. Barker discusses a wide range of management challenges and the skills that promote success. Her book is a unique and much-needed contribution to the literature of science.</span>

                    <span>I love this book and only wish it was published when I was first starting a faculty position.  Definitely a biologist's perspective (and a lab-oriented one at that), but it covers many of the trials and tribulations of starting a new faculty position: setting up a lab, assessing priorities, making hires, managing committees, managing colleagues, etc.  <p>The worst part of the job is often maintaining harmony in the lab (which, of course, we're never taught in graduate school), and Barker has great advice on building or rebuilding lab morale, dealing with lab member disputes, and the dreaded firing process.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly!</span>

                    <span>Scientific faculty are chosen for their ability to do science; not to manage it.  Indeed, many young scientists fail precisely because they are unable to shift from the bench to the office.  Kathy Barker's book provides a wealth of information for new investigators.  The advice, gleaned from interviews with a great many scientists, from Nobel laureates to those that have failed miserably, provides an outstanding road map for those embarking on this critical new phase of their career.  No postdoc will leave my lab without receiving a copy as a parting gift.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book.  The author interviewed about a hundred new and seasoned lab leaders, and not only summarizes their advice clearly and succinctly, but also includes lots of anonymous quotations presenting a spectrum of opinions on any particular issue.  And the book covers _many_ issues of interest to those setting up a lab, and those who wish to improve the way they run their lab.  It focuses mostly on academic labs, but also presents  some issues peculiar to industry.  It really goes into every detail about people-managing issues.<br>Each chapter has tens of references to other useful books and articles.  Kathy really did her homework.  I can say nothing bad about the  book.  Get it.</span>
