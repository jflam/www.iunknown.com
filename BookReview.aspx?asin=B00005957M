                    <span>This is a very good travel series and this particular DVD showcases England beautifully, taking the viewer to familiar places as well as showing us new and intriguing sidetrips. The emphasis is on England itself and not on the show's host, which is a relief. <BR>I've watched this video many times and the pleasure never fades. It's like having a magic window in your living room that opens onto England.<BR>The entire Video Visits Travel Collection is excellent.</span>

                    <span>This video is an excellent pictoral guide to England...circa 1970-something! The video is entertaining, though a bit dry, and centers mainly around historical and scenic sites. There is nothing about modern London or modern life in England. The clothing and grain of the video give it away. What it does show is beautiful and interesting, no doubt, but alot can change in 30 years. Problem is, you wouldn't know it by watching this dvd.</span>

                    <span>I have many videos on England but this one is a real gem, I think the first day I watched the whole DVD twice, well done.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent value for those looking for a visual overview of England. The scope is amazingly broad, covering almost every region From Cornwall to Hadrian's Wall. Unlike many travel videos, there is very little "filler" material here (no chintzy theatricals or human interest fluff), leaving much more room for real content. The narration is clear and informative, although somewhat sparse - the emphasis is obviously on the visual presentation, which I thought was very well done.<P>The Main Feature (82 minutes) covers not only standard tourist highlights such as London, Bath, York, the Cotswolds etc. but also includes lesser known spots such as Boston, Ely, and Lincoln. The only obvious omission is the Industrial Midlands (Liverpool, Coventry, Ironbridge, etc - perhaps not a great loss), which as I recall was not mentioned. <P>The breadth of the Main Feature is well complimented by the three "DVD Extra" segments (approx 35 minutes), which provide more detailed looks at several castles and stately homes, including Castle Howard, Warwick, Chatsworth and several others.<P>If you're hoping to see a specific locale, you may be disappointed, but if you just want to enjoy well-presented scenery and architecture, "Discovering England" is quite rewarding.</span>
