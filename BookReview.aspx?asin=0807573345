This awesome book holds eight incredible, fantastic narratives - each about a dog, its new family and a chalanging task they have to complete. Ivan, Joey, Zoro, and Kirby each have a differant implausible story. In Kirby's story something strange happens to his faithful owner.

                    <span>This book has only some examples of shelter dogs who become part of a family. Zorro,Kirby,Ian,Tracker, and Joey are some of the characters, or dogs, in this wonderful book. Kirby is a westie who's owner died. Kirby was left alone in his house without food or water for seven days before he was discovered. When People came to get him, he snarled and snapped. They could not put him up for adoption. Right before they put him to sleep, while they were trying to get a leash on him, a woman asked if he would like to go for a walk. When he heard that word, he turned into an affectionate, loving pup. That was one example of the interesting stories in this book. With shelter dogs who become seizure alert dogs, actors, and family dogs, this is truly a great book!</span>

                    <span>Zorro,Tracker,Kirby,Joey,These are a few of the amazing dogs I read about in Peg Kehrets book called Shelter dogs . Amazing storys of adopted stays. This book will take your heart away when you read how these dogs survide there tragical lives. This story is about dogs that were given to the Humane Society because the owners cn't take good care of them.<P>I liked this book because it taught lessons on responsibility, trust, and courage. I would recommend this book to others because if you're a dog lover you'll like it. It teaches good lessons about being nice to animals. My favorite story was about a dog named Zorro. Zorro was a very big dog with a lot of energy. He had something called kennel cough. Zorro was a very loving and caring dog and thats what I liked.</span>

                    <span>Shelter Dogs: Amazing Stories of Adopted Strays is the coolest book ever. I checked it out of my school library tons of times, and I read Shelter Dogs: Amazing Stories of Adopted Strays about 5 or 6 times and it got better each time. This book is a really easy book to read, but it is really sad too. I know these are true stories, but if you would go to the humane society you probilty will not get as good of a dog as these people did, in the book so I think Peg Kehret should have put at least one dog in her book that was not as good. But it was still a great book.</span>

                    <span>If you like to read books about dogs, this book would be great for you! This book has eight stories about amazing dogs, who have gone to the animal shelter and have been adopted. One dog was kept in a locked house, because his owner had died in the hopsital and the dog was forgotten. Then someone found him and brought him to the shelter. The dog wouldn't let anyone touch him, open his kennel or do anything with him. One day a helper at the shelter, asked the dog "do you want to go for a walk?" - ever since then the dog has been nice to everyone. I'm sure that if you like to read about dogs, this book would be great for you.</span>
