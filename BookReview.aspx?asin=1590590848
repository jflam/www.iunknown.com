                <span id="Label1"><p><i>Web Service Patterns: Java Edition</i> describes architectural patterns that can guide you through design patterns (service implementation and usage) and illustrates the different ways in which you can use web services. </p>  <p>Author Paul Monday had two primary goals in writing this book: to show some interesting design patterns that are applicable to web services as well as the broader computing community and to give some hands-on experience using a web service environment. </p>  <p>Monday achieves the first goal by presenting many original, and a few already available, design patterns. The patterns he chooses to discuss illustration the entire web service environment&#151;from the patterns that make up web service implementation platforms to the patterns for building your own web services. Each pattern covered has a web service implementation section that builds a common application throughout the book.</p>  <p>To fulfill the second goal of providing hands-on experience with web services, Monday chose a single web service environment, Apache Axis, and implemented each pattern using this environment. </p>  <p>By the end of this book, you'll have deployed more than 15 working web service implementations that show the strengths and weaknesses of web services.</p></span>

                    <span>This book is a good description of how to bridge traditional OO designs into a web services world. It takes a Java perspective and describes quite well where the differences are in a distributed component model such as WS. It describes very basic GOF patterns, how they have been adapted to J2SE and J2EE, and how these patterns need to be modified to fit into a WS environment.<P>If you have a Java/OO perspective and some J2EE background building web apps, this book is a very good way of understanding how you will have to modify some approaches to move to distributed, message-based systems with adapters and coarsely-grained data transfers.</span>

                    <span>Now that we have read all the books on the basics of web services and have a good understanding of how they are supposed to work it is time to get down to actually trying to create some decent designs for our web services applications. That is where this book fits in. The book shows how to apply design patterns to a web service architecture in order to solve common design problems. If you are designing a web service architecture you will want to read this book before drawing another UML diagram.<P>The book starts out by looking at the design patterns used in web services itself. These are the patterns utilized by software such as Apache Axis. This part of the book was interesting but not overly useful. The next part, making up most of the book, covers design patterns that you are likely to need in developing web applications. This part of the book is excellent. Each pattern is discussed in detail and then demonstrated in a case study that is developed throughout the book. Some of the patterns covered are event monitor, observer (with a good comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the two), business process, asynchronous business process, physical tiers, faux implementation, and service factory. The book covers twenty different patterns so if these don't sound applicable to your application there is bound to be another that will be applicable. <P>The book contains only snippets of code from the case study so you will need to download the code in order to get the full value of the case study. The book does include the parts of code that apply to the pattern under discussion. The reader of this book should be comfortable with web services and design patterns in general and be ready for an in-depth discussion of web services architecture.</span>

                    <span>This book is all about illustrating architectural pattern for Java Web services development. It presents a collection of design patterns,for the Java Web services patterns for the development community. If you plan to do Java based Web services architecture development, this book makes a case for how to build a Web services architecture using patterns and serves as a guidelines manual with catalog of design patterns.<P>This Sun author presented this book truly unbiased on choosing the Web services implementation. The book chooses to use Apache Axis 1.0 for illustrating the architecture of Web services and applying patterns for development. <P>With Web services specifications still evolving, I feel this book dictates the patterns for the early adopters. In the next two years, this book may require a revision based on the upcoming SOAP 1.2 specs and a series WS-* specs. <P>I strongly commend this patterns book for architects and tech leads who wish to build Web services and related projects.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the first book which shows how to build Webservices using well defined architectural patterns. This book has an excellent case study based introduction and discusses Web services architecture to begin with and tides over how to apply Java based design patterns to ease development. This books contains an excellent catalog of 20 Web services patterns and its Java implementation.<P>The authors managed to introduce all patterns while anchoring the presentation with a practical and interesting discussion of real world case study. This approach makes this book succeed on all levels, both in presenting essential patterns and demonstrating how these designs often work together in real Web services.<P>This book is a perfect companion guide for choosing patterns in real implementation. This book does not introduce and walkthrough Web services standards and Java APIs, for that we chose to use "Developing Java Web services - Wiley Press" book, very helpful.<P>In all, this book will be absolutely required reading for anyone who lays claim to be an Architect on today's Web services.</span>

                    <span>This book is not a typical Web Services hype book. It covers the practical issues of developing Web Services, through the age old patterns approach. Paul Monday takes the standard Gang of Four and J2EE Design Patterns and shows developers and architects how these patterns would be applied in a Web Services world.<P>The book is targeted at developers and architects who have alreadt have a solid understanding of Web Services and Design Patterns. <P>The code samples are based on Apache Axis and work great. I strongly recommend that you go through them in detail to get full value from this book.</span>
