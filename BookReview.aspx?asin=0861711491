                    <span>Ama Adhe's story is one of the most amazing and powerful I have ever read. You may have heard of the Tibetan struggle for independence, but Ama's story will blow your mind! This book is incredibly moving, honest and one of the most important historical accounts that has ever been written. Only if you read this book will you truly understand the fight for a Free Tibet. Ama Adhe is a true hero for what she survived, for standing up for her beliefs and for not viewing herself as a hero. If you have any interest in human rights and believe in standing up for a cause, read this book.</span>

                    <span>I have read a number of books on Tibet, but this was the first from a womans point of view. To learn not only about women in Tibet but women in general was very educational. Being one of very very few to survive her prison ordeal Ama has taken the task of sharing the story of many of her dead friends. The attrocities have been played down to some extent, compared to other books I have read. Good for the sensative but curriouse reader. Worth while.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite books of all time--among thousands of books I've read. Writing with great honesty and humility, Ama Adhe's courage and compassion shine like a lamp for anyone faced with oppression, torture and brutality for their beliefs and devotion to their homeland and people. My heart goes out to her with great gratitude for sharing her story with the world. I hope others will read it and treasure the example of her spirit. I think her book made me a better person.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a very powerful and moving account of one woman's life of incredible hardship and suffering. Ama-la lost her family, her friends, and her country... but she kept her identity, her dignity, or her compassion. What makes this story so inspiring is that Ama-la's sincere good-heartedness triumphs, against appalling odds, over the systemic evil that the People's Republic of China unleashed on her and on her Tibetan homeland. Prison, privation, brutality, and hate fail utterly to undermine this amazing woman's sense of what it means to be a decent human being. Here is a role model for everyone, everywhere.<P>The basic goodness of this remarkable woman is conveyed perfectly in this simple, honest narrative. This is a story that one finds difficult to turn away from. Ama Adhe is a person the reader will care about deeply after reading this book.</span>

I really can feel for the Tibetan people and am taking strides to help liberate their homeland. May this book also inspire you.</span>
