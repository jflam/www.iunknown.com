                    <span>I'd never heard of Major Taylor.  Have you ever heard of Major Taylor?  Possibly, since you've come to look up reviews of this book.  Now there are a lot of African American greats out there that have, for one reason or another, sunk into relative obscurity.  I don't think I'm amiss in saying that Major Taylor is one of those greats.  This is the man who won the 1899 World Championship title in America and made a successful European tour of 1901, yet died a pauper's death.  Now at last there is a proper book commemorating his life and times.<p>Born in 1878, Marshall Walter Taylor (later to earn himself the nickname of "Major") led a surprisingly good life for a black man in the late nineteenth century.  Belonging to a household that educated him and gave him his own bicycle, he quickly learned to do a variety of tricks on it.  When the chance to race came along, Taylor quickly started earning himself a variety of accolades.  Just as important as the races he won, however, were the ways in which he dealt with the open racism and poor treatment of other cyclists.  Taylor was patient and a winner.  His mantra, "I simply ride away".<p>The book itself has a couple flaws here and there that I found it hard to get around.  The story of Taylor's life really take a wonderful turn when he joins up with the racer Louis "Birdie" Munger.  Yet no picture of Birdie, important as he is, ever pops up.  Also, the book culminates with a huge race between Major Taylor and the already established French champion.  But try as I might to find out what the name (and significance) of this race was, I came up short.  The race, oddly enough, is never named.  In the end, the appeal of the book may or may not be all that great on the part of kids.  Some may be interested in a bicycling champion that began by doing bike stunts.  Some may not.  The book is followed by a quick note at the end of what the rest of Taylor's life led to.  It is not a particularly happy ending (he separated with his family, died a pauper's death, and was buried in an unnamed grave until exhumed and placed in a better spot).  Just the same, it reflects on what Taylor meant to the rest of the world and what he stood for.  Though this is not the most thrilling book in the world, it's a useful one and serves its purpose as well as it can.</span>

                    <span>Lance Armstrong dominates today's Grand Prix cycle races, but Marshall Taylor dominated the late 1800's. This beautifully illustrated book  shares   the life of this  extraordinary African-American athlete fondly acknowledged as "Major."   He became a World Champion in 1899 because of his  proficiency with a bike.  His competitive spirit and courage paved the way for those other fearless African-American Athletes, Jack Johnson, Jesse Owens, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson  who would follow and excel, in their time,  in other sports.    This is an excellent read.   Highly recommended.</span>
