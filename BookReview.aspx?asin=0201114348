                    <span>This book teaches a product independant step by step approach to design a relational database. The autors clearly differentiate between data modeling (ERM) and Relational Database Design. Even if the book is older than 10 years, it is very helpful to design databases with current products like Oracle 9i, DB2 V8 etc.</span>

                    <span>Database design has taken so many leaps since this book was written, but the concepts you'll find in this book are still very sound.  As a beginning data modeler you would gain a lot from these pages.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because it was a mandatory reference in database course. This contains lots of fundamental concepts of relational database. It is a well-organized book starting from LDM rules then to RDD rules with tons of practical examples. The authors does a very good job in explaining and clarifying all the essences, even a trivial point is made clear. This is a must-have for all of you who have to deal with relational database.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the best intro RDBMS book out there.  It explains everything you need to know to design a database.  It isn't vendor documentation and isn't trying to be.  There are some areas that would benefit from a second edition but nothing in it is patently "wrong" or "out-dated."</span>

                    <span>This book is basic and lacking anything new - perhaps becauseit is more than 12 years old. I picked it up at a library, and wasthankful that I didn't pay for it myself. <p>Don't you just hate when you pay for a book that doesn't tell you anything and is basically out-of-date. I read the other comments about this book and was awed at their comment. I guess it's the old saying "To each his own".  END</span>
