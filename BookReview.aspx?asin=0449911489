                    <span>... <P>This book, for me, was a guide in how to conduct myself in this difficult environment in an ethical manner, yet still succeed. I'll never forget reading the maxim, "Don't get mad, DON'T get even". After observing the behavior of those around me, many from the nation's top B schools, I was stunned to read this. They don't teach these types of ethics in MBA school. Anyway, I was dumbfounded when I read this simple rule, but Mackay deftly explains how this will not only help you rationalize your situation, but actually excel in this environment. <P>This is just one example. The book lays out Mackay's extremely wise philosophy. It is important to read this book and learn how to work with the sharks, reduce your anxiety, create win-win situations, and not be eaten.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I came across this book a few years ago during a difficult time in my life. I was in the process of failing miserably at yet another professional endeavor, and in the throes of a major personal upheaval. It was shortly after these calamities that I seriously began to read this book. Internalizing just a few of the simple but important lessons in this book has made all the difference for me, and has allowed me to pursue life very much on my own terms.<P>From this book, I learned that in order to satisfy a demand, you first have to create the demand, the very first lesson of the text, and one that I applied to maximum benefit repeatedly shortly after internalizing it. I also learned that while money is nice, good information is priceless; otherwise, you will not have the money for long. Too many people never learn that lesson. Finally, the most important lesson for me came in the first few pages and had to do with salesmanship. As MacKay says, anyone can get the order if they are willing to say anything and do anything to get it. The real question is whether or not they can get the reorder, as that is the mark of the true salesman. I work with people at the moment that should have learned that lesson, but did not, and let me tell you, it is excruciatingly frustrating to interact with such individuals. People who have not learned this crucial and important lesson simply can not be trusted, and lack integrity. They develop reputations that, in a word, are most un-flattering, and can bring out the worst in people. An appropriate analogy for such people are scurrilous and reproachable politicians- all talk and promises, but very much non-action and non-delivery. Most important, once entrenched in a position with a fancy title and of some limited power and authority, they can and do frustrate any and all attempts at progress and forward locomotion. You would do well to cease contact with these people at the first and most convenient opportunity.<P>As an aside, I liked his musings on the old cliche 'Sell Yourself'- truly a meaningless and overworked phrase if there ever was one. As MacKay remarks, we as individuals often make for lousy products. I also concur with others who found Mr. MacKay's admonishment, Don't Get Mad, and DON'T Get Even, to be wise beyond words. I can affirm that stewing over personal and professional slights and plotting revenge wastes precious time and energy which could be directed towards more constructive and fruitful pursuits. However, I must admit that I have yet to internalize this truest of truisms, as some tresspasses are difficult to forgive. Still, as for most of the other lessons the reader probably already knows them or is familiar with them, but having them placed before you by an unrelated and credible third party always makes for good, sound, positive reinforcement. While some may dismiss most of the lessons in the book as common sense, I have to commend Mr. MacKay on his key insights on the human condition and human relationships.<P>Which, in the end is what business, and for that matter, everything else, including my profession, science, is all about. I especially recommend this book to those from non-business or professional backgrounds (especially scientists, as many of us are, perish the thought!, unfortunately severely handicapped in the people skills department, this reviewer included) who nonetheless must interact with people. Obtaining this book solely for the lessons on good, effective salesmanship alone would justify its purchase. I have also found that reading this book, in combination with a handy and powerful little volume, Soft Selling in a Hard World: Plain Talk on the Art of Persuasion, by Jerry Vass, can turn even the most reluctant, shy non-people-person into an effective salesperson. One of these days I am going to read Mr. MacKay's follow-up, Sharkproof!, as there are quite a few of those carnivorous, maneating fish in The Business of Science.</span>

                    <span>Some worthy information about particular business issues are raised and noted, and for the most part this is an off-the-cuff soliloquy talk about how Harvey views business, and the world. There is nothing more amusing than some wealthy person in business who thinks they have the answers and the remedies for the rest of us. Written in the late 1980s, some of the attitudes presented towards hiring potential employees will become evident. All in all, this is an easy and quick-read. <P>I read "Swim With The Sharks" front-to-back, however each chapter concerns a different topic, so one does not have to read this book straight through from page 1 to the end. <P>One thing I found a bit quirky were the consistent references to allegedly "successful" collegiate and professional sports coaches. I don't feel it's an appropriate analogy to commonly equate coaches with the situations outside of the sports world. The sports culture is often not applicable to making a business deal, dealing with corporate culture, and/or avoiding mistakes with people socially. The sports in itself is a microcosm of society, but a separate world within its own. Time and time again I would chuckle to myself as I would read a quote made by Vince Lambardi, some NBA coach, or read a personal anecdote from the now disgraced coach Lou Holtz. Having to read Yogi Berra's lobotomy-like quotes and philosophy was quite dull, and not very informative. <P>Some helpful and practical information is the "66 question customer profile," as well as the "12P Competitor profile." I liked his noting (book written 1988) of how people who usually don't have money go out and buy a brand new "prestigious" car that depreciates. <P>Mackay also reminds us (or me atleast) of the importance of writing small yet important things down on paper and/or notepads. <P>One of his tips on how to save time is to drive near the front of a grocery store you plan on shopping in. Then look for how many people are in line. If its too crowded don't go in. Thanks Harvey. You've changed my life with your insights. <P>He also tried to break an attempt by his employees to form a union, which he lost. He openly stated how he conned very employee into thinking they were "special" and "important" with his one-to-one meetings with them. It didn't work. They didn't buy it. <P>He does understand (see "Dig You Well Before Your Thirsty") the art of the schmooze in talking with celebrities such as O.J. and world figures such as Castro about things that they do, and interest them in their free time and NOT about what they do for work. <P>All in all, useful things can be gleaned from "Swim With The Sharks," and it's a very quick read.</span>

                    <span>A bunch of feel-good stories about the author. The only real meat is his list of questions about his/your customers. The substance of the book is: find out all you can about you customers AND find out how they fit in and see the companies they represent. <P>The only good news is the book has so little substance it took me only an hour to read it.</span>
