                    <span>Yes, I picked up a few tips in reading the book - mostly things that were "reminders" to check on my websites.  There's a pretty good one-page checklist of things to do.  But a lengthly discussion of network theory felt like padding, and the section of Pay Per Click through Google Adwords and Overture covers a lot of material that is available in the online help for people who use those services.
<br />
<br />I'd hoped for more detail on optimizing keyword strategies, and more on creating effective content.  
<br />
<br />As a previous reviewer posted, this book is a good place to start, but it's really very basic.  </span>

                    <span>I actually read this book two times over a period of a week. It's a short book with some great tips, and tips that just make you say... "duh... why didn't I think of that". But then on the other hand, it is 95% customized towards Google. What about the other SE's? The authors spent a good portion praising PPC and Googles Adwords, which could have been condensed into a shorter chapter... leaving room for tips, tricks, and need to knows for the other SE's. On one page of the book 2 URL's are listed for Yahoo and DMOz, and that's it. No other advice was given for any other site. 
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, for the money, and for a beginer... It is a great start. But don't stop at this book, for it is not as complete as it could be.</span>

                    <span>The Insider's Guide to SEO is a short book, but well organized and an easy read.  It seems to cover the ins and outs of optimizing for Google almost exclusively, which is probably OK, being that this year Google has well over 50% of searches.  It's advice seems mostly common sense, but sometimes stating the obvious can be good.  As a relative newbie to SEO, I feel I picked up a lot.</span>

                    <span>We wrote this book so everyone could understand how to use SEO to get their websites ranked higher in Google. SEO depends on the theory of search engines, but other books and resources don't explain that. We lay it out in clear English.
