                <span id="Label1">For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to.  But  not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle,  and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry  Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p>  As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face  as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

                    <span>In this third installment Ms. Rowling contines the story of the hero Harry Potter.  As with the two previous books in the series, this is some of the best fiction written in recent years.  It is absolutely timeless.  At 60 plus years of age, I still (thank goodness) enjoy them.  Actually, I fell a bit sorry for those who are unable to do so.  They (as is obvious in their reviews) are missing a bit of the spark in their lives.  The story in this work is well constructed as are the characters.  The story gives us some wonderful lessons as to life and how we should live it.  Strongly recommend this one.  Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>I'm a big potter-head and this book, in my opinion, is the best of them all so far. Rowling really had a trning point in this novel and it is much more gown-up. You do not have to read the first two to understand this book and the plot is very quick. harry is being pursued by Sirius Black, the man responsible for his parent's deaths. harry must come to terms with his own anger and find out a lot about his father's past. The ending is really exciting and very well written. i don't waant to give away what happens but i was really surprised aboout all the twists and turns at the end. the book is anything but predictable.</span>

                    <span>The third book in the Harry Potter series follows 13-year old Harry as he runs away from home and returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, the Minister of Magic himself is taking a personal interest in Harry's safety. It seems convicted murderer Sirius Black (who was instrumental in the deaths of Harry's parents), has escaped from Azkaban wizard prison after muttering ominously, "HE'S at Hogwarts!"
<br />
<br />The second half of the book concerns the days when Harry's parents were students at Hogwarts with Sirius Black, Severus Snape, and Remus Lupin, who happens to be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and a wonderfully sympathetic character.  With the help of his pals Ron and Hermione, Harry finally comes face to face with Black and learns what really happened to his parents.  This is an exciting page-turner that HP fans will love.</span>

                    <span>                  This book is not sutable for children of any age!!!!    Harry and his wizard friend go to an amaganary school called Hagwarts. An evil devil type of  thing is after Harry Potter. Harry trys to figure out why, He also trys to figure out why the evil thing killed his parents in the first place. I know the reason is because the were doing witch craft and wizardy. But insted they were killed to be killed. Never let your child read this book because if they do they will try to use witch craft an wizardy. They always win, but really they should be killed with the parents. I am very angry at JK Rowling for writing  this book because it is not a Christain book. Also I am very discusted by the publishers for publishing this book.
