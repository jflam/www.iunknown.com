                <span id="Label1">Che Guevara, the man with the beret with the star, embodies one of the strongest myths of the 20th century. He was a combination of a saint and an adventurer; somewhere between Don Quixote and a latter-day Jesus Christ. In his relations with Fidel Castro, he is the hero of a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Che Guevara became a symbol of an entire generation. Today he is a myth. Some still draw inspiration from him - others condemn him; sometimes bitterly. For all, he is a subject of controversy and passion. This film examines the myth, and contains: His voyages of discovery through Latin America, the meeting with Fidel Castro, when an instantaneous friendship was born, his travels around the world, and footage of his tragic end in Bolivia at age 39. <p>  Special Bonus Feature: <I>Tracing Che</I>. In this documentary, a Canadian film director goes in search of the man behind the myth, re-creating the legendary road trip through South America on an old Norton motorcycle that Che documented in <I>The Motorcycle Diaries</I>. On his way, he encounters many of Che's family and friends - including the friend who took the trip with him - who shed light on the truth behind this icon of the 20th century. This is a film that discovers the humanity, the passion, and the free spirit of a young 22 year old whose eyes were forced open on a relentless road trip.</span>

                    <span>Che Guevara was a true idealist Marxist who saw firsthand, unlike many of us Americans, the sheer brutality and injustice of US imperialism in South America. He stood up for his people much like our US forefathers stood up for their country - using rhetoric, intelligence, politics and violence towards their cause. After quite a search, this is far most the best and most complete video piece I have found on his life. The interviews are rare and filled with information. The footage - especially of the Cuban Revolution - is alone worth the price for those of us who have never seen it. It is a documentary in the truest sense of the word. It draws a few conclusions for the audience but always delineates between fact and interpretation. Weighing in at 150 minutes you can't go wrong. Viva El Che!</span>

                    <span>This DVD in my opinion was pretty good in the sense that it portrays Che Guevara as the man who he really was but I found that certain key acts of his life that were being explained in this DVD lacked the proper explenations and just leaves you wondering or wanting to further investigate the truth...

                    <span>the feeling i walked away from the film was that che was a martyr. martyr, someone who bears witness. unlike castro, unlike so many of the idealogues/revolutionaries who compromise after their success, che's lived his conviction to identify with the poor/oppressed, literally, to the end of his life. che's death was not a tragedy, but a beautiful testimony to faithfulness and steadfastness. and documentary let the story of che be told without getting in the way. good job.</span>

                    <span>Che Guevara is the ultimate hero's people... Why?? because nobody has lived a live like his and no one ever will, You will never see people around the world wearing a Bush t-shirt because he is no hero to nobody, he only serves the interests of the powerful and was born with power and bought his way to the top (That's why a college student with a "C" grade average is ruling the U.S.!!!)... in the other hand Che was always a free man and will live forever in the hearth of the truly free people of the world!!!
<br />Che will outlive the imperialists pigs in the white house and the Gusanos in Florida!!!</span>

                    <span>The fog of time and the strength of anti-anti-Communism have obscured the real Che. Who was he? He was an Argentinian revolutionary who served as Castro's primary thug. He was especially infamous for presiding over summary executions at La Cabaña, the fortress that was his abattoir. He liked to administer the coup de grâce, the bullet to the back of the neck. And he loved to parade people past El Paredón, the reddened wall against which so many innocents were killed. Furthermore, he established the labor-camp system in which countless citizens--dissidents, democrats, artists, homosexuals--would suffer and die. This is the Cuban gulag. A Cuban-American writer, Humberto Fontova, described Guevara as "a combination of Beria and Himmler." Anthony Daniels once quipped, "The difference between [Guevara] and Pol Pot was that [the former] never studied in Paris." - Jay Nordlinger</span>
