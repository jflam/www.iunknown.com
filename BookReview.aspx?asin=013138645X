                <span id="Label1">This book covers the Prolog programming language thoroughly with an  emphasis   on building practical application software, not just theory.  Working through   this book, readers build several types of expert  systems, as well as natural   language processing software and utilities  to read foreign file formats.    This is the first book to cover ISO Standard Prolog, but the programs  are  compatible with earlier dialects of the language. Program files  are available   by FTP from The University of Georgia.</span>

                    <span>The book is well organized with fluent exposition especially, in comparing the traditional and logic programming. The efford spend to create a bridge  between these programming paradigmas is interesting and remarkable. It  contains the examples that were prepared intelligently about how to think  writing a program and AI examples. It also contains some hints about  elegant programming techniques in prolog and for those who want to write a  prolog interpreter. Moreover, how a programmer makes mistakes in  programming were determined. In this mean, it has a spectrum from novice to  expert. Reader can find differencies between different prolog  implementation and prolog standards and can find good explanation about  some special topics such as cut operator, recursive definition, file usage,  reading data in foreign formats, tree structures and operator definitions  special to user. <p>It would have been better to write a whole chapter  which includes how to write a prolog interpreter. There is no knowledge  about prolog can interact with what languages and how it is done this. For  example, how we can use C in prolog and vice versa.<p>Mehmet Fatih Hocaoglu</span>

                    <span>Lots of practical tips early in the book, particularly on I/O, get the reader off to a fast start in Prolog. This reviewer  felt lost in Prolog until he read this text.    The breadth of examples is impressive. <p> The only flaw on this book is the author's tendency to fight some ideological battles  that the reader does not care about.  Their tone is unnecessarily hostile, particularly in the introduction to Chapter 4.  But that's only one paragraph in an otherwise wonderful book.  <p> It is a great book for getting started, and getting a feel for Prolog, but it is no substitute for a thorough text that includes some theory. <p> Theory is not a bad word.  A working understanding of how the logic interpreter works is important for debugging. <p> In my opinion, Chapter 3 is denser than it appears, and should be studied carefully.  cf. the discussion of append.  This reviewer has done the exercises using SWI prolog with only minor adaptations.  <p> All told, a solid introduction.  A good book to read before (but not instead of) a more theoretical introduction such as The Art of Prolog. <p> Even though freeware prologs exist on the internet, the appeal of this "practical" book would be greatly increased if the authors arranged to have a CD of some freeware prologs included with the text.</span>

                    <span>This book has been an excellent material for me to  develop my Logic Programming skills. That is because it provides not only theory of Prolog programming but also very useful artificial intelligence applications and expert system shells even with uncertainty. Another useful feature I liked much is; the book makes comparisons (where needed) between how to do the same thing in Prolog and in a conventional programming language, Pascal.</span>
