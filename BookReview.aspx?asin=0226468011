                    <span>This book disappointed me, because I expected to be able to somehow apply or utilize the information within.  So what do I do with such concepts as:
<br />
<br />TIME IS MONEY (or a PRECIOUS COMMODITY)
<br />ARGUMENTS ARE WAR
<br />THE MIND IS A MACHINE
<br />CREATION IS BIRTH
<br />IDEAS ARE A COMMODITY
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong.  It's interesting that we apparently DO think in metaphors.  However, unless this knowledge can somehow be applied to improve one's life, what's the point?

                    <span>After hearing nearly every anthropology professor I've ever had reference the work of Lakoff and Johnson in some way, I decided to try reading this book for myself. I'm very glad I did, because it completely changed my view of language, thought, and truth. 
<br />
<br />Starting with the (deceptively) simple premise that the way we talk about certain things shapes the way we think about them, Lakoff and Johnson launch into a stimulating deconstruction of what they term "conceptual metaphors", and the complex way in which they interact to structure our experience of reality. These aren't just metaphors in the rhetorical sense though; the authors examine how common ways of speaking and thinking actually reflect a relatively coherent metaphorical system. 
<br />
<br />For example, you might not think that the statement "He strayed from the line of argument" is metaphorical is any significant way, but it is grounded in the metaphor that AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY, and the assumption that A JOURNEY DEFINES A PATH. Put them together, and you get AN ARGUMENT DEFINES A PATH; a path which can be strayed from. Lakoff and Johnson explore these interactions in great detail, and suggest some fascinating philosophical and political implications. 
<br />
<br />This book is very readable (nice short chapters) and I highly recommend it if you are at all interested in anthropology, linguistics, or philosophy. </span>

<br />The authors have undoubtedly created a captivating account of the pervasive role of metaphor in human cognition. We certainly use metaphors in the way we communicate, but primary their focus is on how metaphors are used in how we think. That is, how do they affect our understanding and perceptions? 
<br />
<br />Metaphors seem to be visually oriented pictures by which we condense a greater concept into a manageable instance. These predefined packets of ideas are then used interchangeably as we think and evaluate choices. 
<br />
<br />One item I wished the authors had included is how metaphors originate and how they are introduced into culture. Are they usually a simplistic example from everyday life, which captures the imagination and is easily impressed on the mind? Do they develop from years of common sense wisdom? 
<br />
<br />Another aspect of metaphors which I believe to be worthy of consideration is the tendency to use them as a crutch. That is, it's easy to spout off the same old jargon and to speak in clichés. It's even worse to think in clichés. Does the person who relies too heavily on metaphors cease to `break new ground' in thinking originally and independently? I wanted the authors to address this possible darker side of the metaphor. 
<br />
<br />Lastly, I was looking for instances of when commonly held metaphors were later proven to be faulty. In other words, when have metaphors caused a culture or people group to be stuck in a rut (um...is that a metaphor?) and prevented them from progressing? And, what means of cognition can be used to determine if metaphors are true or false? 
<br />
<br />In the end this is a thought provoking book on a subject which effects every person, every day - whether they realize it or not.

                    <span>*Metaphors We Live By* seminally remarked that language is metaphoric at a much deeper and more pervasive level than had previously been understood. For example, the metaphor ``time is money'' is built into the language: we spend time, invest time, waste time, squander time, borrow time, and so on. It further argued that humans reason using metaphors that ground abstract concepts (like time) in concrete ones (like money, which you can hold in your hand). We use these metaphors in an extended way (both borrowing time and spending it) and coherently (merging different metaphors to reach sensible conclusions). These conclusions have stood the test of time and if anything increased in impact over the years. Lakoff, Johnson, and their students have followed in later work with preliminary models of how neural circuitry for controlling motor actions is reemployed in other thinking, thus shedding light on how thought is grounded, on how the working of neural circuitry acquires meaning.
<br /> 
<br /> Roughly a third of *MWLB* is devoted to philosophy, arguing that because thought is so heavily metaphoric, ``there is no reason to believe there is any absolute truth or objective meaning''. They have since rethought this conclusion, and their 1999 book *Philosophy in the Flesh* claims to have accepted the existence of objective reality, but still argues that there is no objective metaphysics of such phenomena as time, causality, or morality. Since many different metaphors are used in understanding causation that each describe something different, they argue there can be no essential causality. This is such a radical conclusion that we should be loath to accept it without strong evidence, but from their perspective it appears inescapable. 
<br /> 
<br /> These ideas also feed into Lakoff's book *Moral Politics*. Conservatives often argue that liberals are emotional and irrational-- a noteworthy magazine of the right is thus called *Reason*. Lakoff, because he doesn't believe in an objective reality or an objective morality in any ordinary sense, accedes to this without firing a shot. Rather than dispute that liberals are emotional and irrational, he argues that rationality is a mirage.
<br /> 
<br /> *Metaphors We Live By* greatly impressed me, and was an important stimulus for my 2004 book *What is Thought?*. *WiT?* proposed fundamental organizing principles of thought, from which Lakoff and Johnson's empirical observations regarding metaphor emerge in a natural way. *WIT?* explains ''understanding'' as the computational exploitation of the underlying structure to the world, and argues (based on discoveries in computer science made in the 20+ years since *MWLB* appeared) that it is produced through evolving a compact computer program. This program can only be so compact yet so powerful by reuse of meaningful subroutines-- which gives rise to metaphor. Thus simple fundamental principles that explain many other aspects of thought also organize and cause Lakoff and Johnson's observations. Note however that my proposal, rather than denying the existence of Platonic structure as do Lakoff et al's various books, is built on top of it: the underlying compact Platonic structure explains how understanding is possible. Yes we have many different metaphors for dealing with causality, but they all exploit the fact that there is a very simple description of the physics of the world, and this simple description presumably includes or implies ''essential causality''.

                    <span>This book will change the way you look at language. Often, when we think we are being literal and direct, we are using metaphors. And we don't even know it. After reading this book you will catch yourself in metaphorical folly. This will help you think more clearly and argue better; you will be better able to spot false analogies and arguments based on misleading metaphors. This book is a bit dated now, but still worth a read.</span>
