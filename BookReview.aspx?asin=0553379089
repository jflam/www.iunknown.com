                    <span>I was never moved to write a review for Amazon before, but there are several aspects of this book and the way George Crane wrote it that I found extraordinary. Crane has achieved something that must be one of the most difficult in writing: getting across an authentic cross-cultural understanding of both a person, Tsung Tsai, and a place. <BR> I appreciated that Crane did not clean up Tsung Tsai's English; presenting his words as he really spoke them, along with Crane's misunderstandings,created an immediacy to the story and the interactions between the two friends. Crane manages to make the reader feel that we get to know the real Tsung Tsai; I feel that Crane does this largely through being so very honest about himself, his doubts, and his own reactions to the monk and to events. Crane gives us just the right details to enable the reader to know what it felt like to be in this obscure corner of China.<BR> Crane's writing about Inner Mongolia is so well done that I felt a sense of authenticity of place, people, and events that usually occurs in only the greatest of novels. I stayed up most of the night to read about the climb up the mountain to the teacher's cave; my sense of the mountain and all it meant to Tsung Tsai and his teacher was so powerful that I can sense that meaning just by looking at the picture of the mountain.<BR> As a student of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, it has been easy for me to forget that the Chinese and Chinese Buddhists also endured extreme persecution and suffering. Through Tsung Tsai's story we come to understand this, and also that the religious aspirations of the people continue to be deep and real, even though almost all vestiges of Buddhism have been stamped out. As Tsung Tsai says, "They are hungry for Buddhism. They never forget."</span>

                    <span>I read this book right on the heels of Victor Klemperer's diary, "I Will Bear Witness," chronicling the day-to-day life of a German Jew during the Third Reich. Tsung Tsai lived in China, a world apart from Victor Klemperer, but it seems that the heroism of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances transcends boundaries. As a child, Tsung Tsai watched as the Japanese fed poison to his mother and burned his family. After becoming a Ch'an Buddhist monk in Inner Mongolia, he narrowly escaped the Red Army's destruction of Buddhist lamaseries and literally walked to Hong Kong during the Great Famine. He was picked up, starving and near death, by some boat people who nurtured him to health despite his dangerous monkhood. Then he crossed a Hong Kong border teeming with red Army soldiers, spending the next 40 years in exile as an ordinary citizen of New York. This is the story of his return to China, at age 70, in a spiritual quest to honor his master, whom he had left in a cave on Crow Pull Mountain and who died during the Cultural Revolution without a proper Buddhist burial. His quixotic journey is enabled by George Crane, author, friend, journalist, poet and self-styled Zen Jewdist, who joins him on the trip as his spiritual Sanch Panza, full of Western vinegar. Together they both encounter and reflect the imbalance of China as it teeters between modernity and old customs, between heartless Maoism and a reawakened spirituality, between collectivism and family.<P>Ancient hills echo<P>The vrrroom of a Harley D<P>With polyphony.<P>The determined journey of Tsung Tsai, against real danger and the advice of all concerned, is awe-inspiring. Throughout this book, he becomes its and China's centered soul, giving life a perspective worthy of the Master Himself. He has visited death and has no fear of it. He is concerned only with that which is honorable and morally right. His selflessness is palpable. For example, he gives to the needy all of the equipment he brought to protect him on his arduous mountain climb. And his sense of self is equally palpable. Revered, almost worshipped, as a surviving Buddhist monk, he takes the time to minister to the people, to fulfill their long-ignored desires for Buddhism. Do not miss this book. It will move you.<P>And be sure to read the book to the end, right through the acknowledgements. There you will find that George Crane sent a physician back to China to reconstruct the face of a burned child they had met. As an adept, George Crane has learned from Tsung Tsai just as Tsung Tsai learned from his master. And so it goes, throughout history. We can learn as well, just by reading this book.</span>

                    <span>I found the writer, Crane, dying to interpose his bad poetry, bad jokes and whining, obnoxious self into what could have been a thoughtful story about a monk and his religious beliefs. Too bad!</span>

                    <span>What you are looking at is a travelogue masked as a desire by the author to legitimize the only thing that ever (apparently) happened to him (aside from maintaining some sort of marriage w/child), and then corrupt that thing into a self-serving manuscript that actually undermines its own goal of bringing about an understanding of Ch'an.<P> Here's the deal: He meets an ex-patriot Ch'an Master who stumbles out of the woods and into his life. The Master includes this otherwise n'er-do-well on a mission to Mongolia to retrieve his Master's bones, put them in a new Ch'an monastery, and return Ch'an to China. The voice of the book is ostensibly cultural reportage, and is idiomatically told as truthful, although the author doesn't outright say "this is the truth" and that's part of the problem with this book: The author, intentionally or not, manipulates perceptions and lines of thought in the book in a manner that is ultimately self-serving and distracting to the person who actually seeks to learn anything real about Ch'an.<P> Here's what's good about the book: It's an interesting travel story that's well told structurally, a gripping read, with interesting (albeit a bit simplified) characters. <P> Here's what [is not good]: At the heart of the book is the theme of a) delivering an understanding of Ch'an to the reader, and b) communicating some sense of the author's experience in Ch'an. (Remember, we're supposed to believe this is true.) Problems arise in communicating Ch'an when the author basically tells the audience, "I tried to read the Diamond Sutra, it was too hard, but I offer this poem I translated instead." <P> This part of the author's subversive intent: It is clear that the author would prefer the audience to use his poem as their reference for Diamond Sutra (made entirely approachable by Red Pine, by the way) than approaching the text. This is troublesome because it subverts the nature of the Ch'an tradition of learning texts. Sure, why read the freakin' text when freakin' Joe Author is available to command a speaker's fee at your freakin' charity event in Woodstock?<P> In terms of the author's own experience with Ch'an, there is a gap here that is just too big to be crossed. He narrates his experiences with sitting meditation by saying he gets bored on the several times he tries it up until about halfway through the book. Then he says, all of a sudden, "I sat empty for an hour." (or something to that effect: I don't have the text on me at the moment.) Anyone who has tried sitting meditation knows that sitting empty for an hour just suddenly does not happen after a few half-hearted attempts. Sitting empty for one second would be a miracle in itself: What is it, then, that the author is attempting to do? Legitimize himself in the audience's mind as a direct practcioner, nee Master, of meditation. Clearly this m-f'er doesn't have the chops as he seems to prove throughout the book. And then all of a sudden, he dvelops a habit that is developmentally, neurologically something that actually takes time to reprogram your biology to do ??? Just like that? Not bloody likely.<P> This author is just trying to establish himself as a religious authority which clearly, he shouldn't. He would probably not own up to it anyway if you were to ask him directly. But he's not a direct guy. He's sneaky. Subversive. Perhaps even unaware of his own hubris. Which would be acceptable if he were just a guy sitting sitting on a buckwheat pillow in the den. But he's not, because he's in a (self-assigned) position of responsibility. He tells things that are both religiously and journalistically unacceptable. I don't know what his intentions are. I can't say as he does or doesn't, but I'd be surprised if he were honest enough to say, "Yes, I'm just trying to establish a little corner of the publishing world here. I said a few things that weren't exactly true." In this author's drive for legitimacy, success, and establishing himself (which poses a huge problem for anyone in search of a their not-fixed self), he bends the truth to sell the s-word as Shine-ola.<P>Not to mention, by the way, this author has a preoccupation with mentioning many incidences of body function, i.e., I took a ____, we p____'d, blah blah blah. ...</span>
