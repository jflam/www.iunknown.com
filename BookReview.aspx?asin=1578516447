                <span id="Label1"><I>What would you be willing to do for the rest of your life . . . ?</I><P> It's a question most of us consider only hypothetically-opting instead to "do what we have to do" to earn a living.  But in the critically acclaimed bestseller <B>The Monk and the Riddle</B>, entrepreneurial sage Randy Komisar asks us to answer it for real.   The book's timeless advice-to make work pay not just in cash, but in experience, satisfaction, and joy-will be embraced by anyone who wants success to come not just from what they do, but from who they are. At once a fictional tale of Komisar's encounters with a would-be entrepreneur and a personal account of how Komisar found meaning not in work's rewards but in work itself, the book illustrates what's wrong with the mainstream thinking that we should sacrifice our lives to make a living.  Described by <I>Fortune.com</I> as "part personal essay, part fictional narrative and part meditation on the nature of work and life," <B>The Monk and the Riddle</B> is essential reading on the art of creating a life <I>while</I> making a living.<P></span>

                    <span>While this book may appear to be a period piece from the glory days of Silicon Valley, I think that the author's main points are important in any business environment.  His distinction between "passion" and "drive" was helpful:  too many of us mistake the latter for the former, assuming that our level of commitment and work ethic equates to "passion," and pouring our energies into sustaining a business or a job that doesn't sustain US.
<br />
<br />Having been there and done that, I wholeheartedly agree with his criticism of the "deferred life plan."  If you start out to earn a living based on your passion, you may fail at a particular business, but you'll learn a lot that will help you with the next one, and you'll still have the passion to sustain you.  But if your ambition is to make a lot of money from a business that doesn't engage you so that you can quit and follow your passion, then if it fails you'll be no closer to following your passion;  if it succeeds but doesn't make you a billionaire overnight (like most businesses), you'll be stuck running a business that diverts you from following your passion.
<br /> 
<br />The book is well-told and amusing, and I felt it was well worth reading.  (My answer to the monk's riddle was:  drop the chicken before it lays the egg.  I guess I'm not Zen enough.)</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most impressive books on entrepeneurship and business that I have read. As we grow older, we focus more and more on the immediate. We often lose touch with our larger goals - goals that may have lead us to our chosen profession and path in the first place. For most of us, we may not even sense the inner void and lack of direction that this creates. Randy's book is a timely reminder of the importance of higher level goals. It tells us we can work for what we care AND be successful. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Randy tries to present an old concept in an old way. There are tons of books that tell you to do what you feel passionate about, how to succeed in investing and how to love life.<p>Randy fails miserably in delivering his story that is a mix of all of the above.<p>With less than 200 pages and big font, there's not much space to say in the book.<p>Randy, get a lesson on collecting thoughts before you write a book.</span>
