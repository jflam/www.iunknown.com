                <span id="Label1">The world's most business-critical transactions run on Unix machines, which means the machines running those transactions attract evildoers. Furthermore, a lot of those machines have Internet connections, which means it's always possible that some nefarious remote user will find a way in. The third edition of <I>Practical Unix & Internet Security</I> contains--to an even greater extent than its favorably reputed ancestors--an enormous amount of accumulated wisdom about how to protect Internet-connected Unix machines from intrusion and other forms of attack. This book is fat with practical advice on specific defensive measures (to defeat known attacks) and generally wise policies (to head off as-yet-undiscovered ones).<p>  The authors' approach to Unix security is holistic and clever; they devote as much space to security philosophy as to advice about closing TCP ports and disabling unnecessary services. They also recognize that lots of Unix machines are development platforms, and make many recommendations to consider as you design software. It's rare that you read a page in this carefully compiled book that does not impart some obscure nugget of knowledge, or remind you to implement some important policy. Plus, the authors have a style that reminds their readers that computing is supposed to be about intellectual exercise and fun, an attitude that's absent from too much of the information technology industry lately. Read this book if you use any flavor of Unix in any mission-critical situation. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Security risks (and ways to limit them) under Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Coverage ranges from responsible system administration (including selection of usernames and logins) to intrusion detection, break-in forensics, and log analysis.</span>

                    <span>Being relatively new to unix security, I've found this book to be an immense help. It provides both a quick and easy reference to the generalities of security, while providing more indepth information when necessary. With its help, I feel relatively confident about the security of my home network.<P>I was also pleased to see that many of the concepts covered for larger implementations were noticable in the security policies and paradigm of my workplace, which makes use of numerous LANs and WANs for day to day business, many of which requiring security anbd confidentiality.<P>I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in unix and internet security, be they new to the field or firmly established.</span>

                    <span>Practical UNIX and Internet Security by Garfinkel and Spafford is a fundamental work on the subject. The authors not only are widely respected professionals in the field, but good writers as well (or is this O'Reilly's editors? :-). Anyway, this book despite its size is readable, still has lots of information, and comes highly recommended. As one of the other reviewers of this book has written, the details of systems and software may change, but the underlying security and good management practices will not. The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it is published a while ago.<BR>Edgar Danielyan CCNP(Security) ISA www.danielyan.com</span>

                    <span>I hate to repeat the cliche, but if you can only buy one security book this year and you are a *nix geek, this should be it, hands down. As some point out, you can probably find everything in this book online, but then again you can find anything online, so why buy any books at all? I don't like giving 5 stars; this book left me no choice.<P>The strength of this book lies in several areas. First, the authors probably have 50+ years experience between them and it shows. You really get the impression that they've "been there, done that". But they don't try and "wow" you with their intelligence and they aren't condescending, in fact they write quite clearly. <P>The "mile wide" crack I made in the title refers to the fact that this book covers everything from physical security and social engineering, to how to setup up integrity checking with tripwire and use PAM. Basically I found this book to be invaluable because while I could breeze through certain sections, there was a ton of material that I needed more knowledge about, but either never got around to it, or didn't even know I was lacking. An example is NFS. I knew I needed more background about NFS because I work in infosec, but every place I've ever worked has banned NFS outright, which makes it a little more difficult to learn.... Another 2 technologies pop into my mind: LDAP and PAM. I knew what they were, but now I know how to set up the basics and can branch out on my own.<P>In our infosec world it's simply not possible to know everything. This book gives the reader a solid grounding in a ton of stuff, which enables him to go out and Google around intelligently for more advanced information. In a pinch it can also be used as an anti-theft device since it weighs in at 900+ pages and is quite heavy.</span>

                    <span>As a Linux administrator, I ordered this book hoping to find out how hackers typically gain access to systems and neat little tricks for locking down my system, as well as detecting and dealing with intruders. While Practical Unix & Internet Security did cover these topics, it covered little I didn't already know.<P>Significant time is spent explaining how unix-based systems work. The book covers things such as file systems, partition structure, file ownership/permissions, users and groups, inodes, ssh, backups, etc. Each command, utility, procedure or feature is detailed over several pages followed by an explanation of what you should be doing with said topic.<P>There are also a few real-world examples here and there; stories most of us have heard before, like the admin who had . in his path.<P>Unlike many computer books, this one is well written and an easy read, and it's certainly a lot more friendly than some unix geeks who's advice consists of RTFM.<P>I think this book would be great for someone who has a very basic understanding of unix-based systems but has never administrated one before, but for those of us who've already had some experience running unix there's probably not anything new here for you.</span>
