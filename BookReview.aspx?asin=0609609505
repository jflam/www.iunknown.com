                <span id="Label1">Rob Adams--an ex-Marine and former technology executive who now runs an "accelerator venture fund" that works like an entrepreneurial boot camp--offers <I>A Good Hard Kick in the Ass</I> to wake up and shake up today's would-be business owner. The era when virtually any wannabe could turn an intriguing idea and slick presentation into a hefty bankroll is long past, of course. Adams believes the current environment calls instead for a return to elementary but oft-ignored rules expressed here through blunt admonitions (good ideas are a dime a dozen, you don't know your customers as well as you think you do, you don't need big bucks right out of the gate) meant to counter the "startup myths and misconceptions" many hopefuls still harbor. Each chapter breaks down one delusion-busting assertion into specific suggestions (assemble a team with solid "execution intelligence," validate the market, forge a strategy for getting out there quickly) and is fleshed out with the real-life experiences of both big-name techno-ventures and some of the embryonic participants in Adams's AV Labs. Any time you step up to the plate to start a company, you take a chance on striking out, he says, but following these steps should at least get you into the game. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>This is not just another look into the day-to-day activities of a VC. It is a very useful and resourceful tool for any entrepreneur who needs access to an expert who knows what works and what doesn't in building foreword thinking businesses. This book provides a very common sense approach to building a technology business although the fundamentals could apply to any market. <P>We have implemented many of the books components into the framework of the company we are building. Two of the biggest are market validation and insisting on remaining focused on what matters most to the successful advancement of our company. Most companies will perform market validation at some level but Rob's approach will make the process extremely productive for you. It is strategic, milestone focused and will ultimately assist in your determination of whether your new product or service is viable or not.<P>Many of the book's "take aways" are posted in our office to help remind us what to focus on. The ROI on this book has been unbelievable for our emerging company and I highly recommend it. Kevin Adams - Metrics Partners</span>

                    <span>I'm told that the best time to start a company is during an economic slowdown. Rents are cheap, people are available, by the time you get going the rebounding economy will help grow sales. Fair enough. If timing is important, Rob Adams' book is a necessity. It gives the practical advice to get your company started with the right foundation and attitude.<BR> As you can guess from the title, Adams' takes a very practical and challenge-conventional-wisdom approach to building a company. He provokes company managers to think critically and objectively about their situations and the decisions they	 need to make, more as a primer than a textbook. <BR> Organized around nine essential "kicks", Adams covers many of the most common misconceptions about starting businesses and offers his direct advice on ways to achieve success. The book is full of examples from his recent venture capital investing experience and it rings true throughout. Though the book is heavily technology oriented, his thinking can easilyt be applied to all products and services.<BR>It is time to return to basics for creating companies which can survive and grow and this book offers strong and sanguine advice. I recommend it to anyone thinking of starting a business or trying to make one better. As the president of a small company with ambition, I keep his book in my office as a touchstone. You should too.</span>

I've actually been taught first hand by Rob Adams over the last 6 months and his insights and wisdom for anybody starting a business is truly eye opening. Rob focuses on the most basic things that most people starting their own companies completely ignore!

                    <span>I am writing this review a year after reading the book and putting the ideas to work. I feel compelled to let you know that the book was not only entertaining and a quick read, but full of ideas that really work! I am CEO of a start-up operating with seed money. We used specific ideas from the book on how to evolve our product idea quickly and also focus on execution. We entered the market with minimal funding and built a market for our product in a 6 month period. Now we are moving quickly to the next stage. Regardless of whether you are an entrepreneur, engineer with an idea or product manager in a larger company, " A Good Hard Kick in the Ass" will focus your thinking and efforts. Good luck and get back to work!</span>
