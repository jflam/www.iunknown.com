                <span id="Label1"><div><b>Winner of the Governor General's Award</b><br><b>A <i>Library Journal </i>Best Book of 2001</b><br><br>Part autobiography and part social history, <i>Notes from the Hyena's Belly</i> offers an unforgettable portrait of Ethiopia, and of Africa, during the 1970s and '80s, an era of civil war, widespread famine, and mass execution. "We children lived like the donkey," Mezlekia remembers, "careful not to wander off the beaten trail and end up in the hyena's belly." His memoir sheds light not only on the violence and disorder that beset his native country, but on the rich spiritual and cultural life of Ethiopia itself. Throughout, he portrays the careful divisions in dress, language, and culture between the Muslims and Christians of the Ethiopian landscape. Mezlekia also explores the struggle between western European interests and communist influences that caused the collapse of Ethiopia's social and political structure&#8212;and that forced him, at age 18, to join a guerrilla army. Through droughts, floods, imprisonment, and killing sprees at the hands of military juntas, Mezlekia survived, eventually emigrating to Canada. In <i>Notes from the Hyena's Belly</i> he bears witness to a time and place that few Westerners have understood. <br></div></span>

                    <span>Nega ought to be commended for having written a rich and poignant book depicting the abundantly tragic story of Ethiopia at a segment in time. His recounting of some minute details--from the comical and bittersweet incidents of his early childhood years to the ominous political and social turmoil was certainly worth reading about even for a person who was born and raised in Ethiopia such as myself. We were all Ethiopians back then, but alas, we lived on different planets.<P>Having said that, I wish the book explained some important issues more clearly.<P>Case in point: When the not-so-beautiful girl recruited Nega as a foot soldier for EPRP, I thought he was going to join that party. But that seemed to have never happened. In stead he joined the Western Somalia Liberation Front. What transpired for him and his friend to join this front? I admired his open mindedness and his desire to change what he can, but it still struck me as odd that an Amhara had to join a Somali ethnic based movement. Was it just that they stumbled onto the rebels' camp by accident? <BR>I wish the author also mentioned his father more and gave us a sense of what the man was like. Mentioning "Mam" so much gave the impression that Nega and his siblings were raised practically in a single-parent home with no father figure whatsoever. (Father was mentioned in very rare occasions).<BR>The author also seemed somewhat embittered and cynical in many locations. Having lived through the experiences he did, these emotions may just have to be displayed, but I wish he took more effort to provide us with some insight into the sunny sides of Ethiopian life.<BR>Also the book could have used more editing. But these incidents do not take away from the overall richness of the book.</span>

                    <span>Nega Mezlekia takes on an ambitious project (and is successful) in writing this book about his Ethiopian childhood. By using his own experiences (some of them quite harrowing), he connects us to the larger picture of Ethiopia with its social, political, and economic struggle.<P>Nega intersperses fables (many of them having to do with animals) within the body of his own story--a technique that gives his autobiographical account clarity and richness. I loved stepping aside for a moment in the text to read a mini story or fable that shed light on a particular passage. Since human beings learn best about their envirnoment through story, this technique allowed me, the reader, to better understand the whole. Mam seemed to be a virtual story repository, garnering wisdom from those stories as she passed them on to her son. It is evident that her son acquired a good bit of that wisdom as well.<P>It is also evident that Nega respects all forms of life. I enjoyed his threading animals (hyenas, monkeys, lions, snakes, camels--even flies and beetles) and their behavior into the weave of his story. Human beings are not the center of the universe, but co-exist with other life forms. Nega's work reflects that understanding and that refreshes my spirit.<P>Great job!</span>

                    <span>This book is full of meaning, often insightful and completely unforgettable it is written with candor and wit despite its serious edges.<P>Nega Mezlekia has written a memoir about his boyhood growing up in Ethiopia during the fall of Emperor Selassie. He experiences all of the curious playful things that all boys are reared with yet he also discusses the harshness of the environment during the rise of Junta communism in which thousands of young people were ruthlessly slaughtered. He writes on page 183, "Apathy in the face of continual violence is something someone who has never lived through a war cannot understand......People simply gathered about themselves, like rags, what life there was left, deafened and inured to the inevitability of death." Although Mezlekia has many horrible atrocities to write about this is not all he adheres to. At times this memoir is very witty and I laughed out loud several times imagining some of his shenanigans. His adventures with medicine men and native cures is hilarious as well as his attempt to capture the loose cattle in his village with pepper. <P>I am always impressed with the attitude of Africans who survive the atrocities they have faced in their home countries. Their spirit and survivalist hearts seem to always prevail despite the horrible circumstances they are often forced to endure. Mezlekia managed to escape his country at possibly its worst moments, not without heartache, not without suffering, but with a true gift as a storyteller. I would recommend this memoir to everyone interested in a great true tale but especially to those concerned with the plights of our fellow human beings who suffer so gracefully for their native lands.</span>

                    <span>I read "Notes From The Hyena's Belly" because my 7th grade English teacher assigned it to me personally. At first I honestly thought that it was going to be just a stupid autobiography, but it turned out to be excellent!!!<P>"Notes From The Hyena's Belly" was a book that started from the very second Mezlekia was born, and told his story until he left Ethiopia later in his life. But this is not just a long autobiography that stuck strictly to the facts. It was VERY funny, and generally politically correct... :-D <P>Combining fact with humor, Mezlekia creates an image of his life in Ethiopia so vivid, you feel that you are there, following him around. From school to church, each part of the book is beautifully orchestrated so that everything makes sense. The book moves at a quick pace, but not so fast that you don't have time to enjoy the occasional joke. :-D Hehehe. A good book. And the moral of THIS story is, if your teacher tells you to read a biography/autobiograohy of choice, take the fun way out and read this one!!!</span>

                    <span>I mistakengly judged this book to be rubbish based solely on the cover. To my surprise, it turned out to be an exciting and adventurous story about growing up in eastern Ethiopia, in a town called Jigjiga. The author's aptitude for narration is pleasing, as he does not leave the reader to digress.<P>One of the funniest parts of this book is when he talks about the farmer boy whom he befriended, and his hillarious use of the Amharic language.</span>
