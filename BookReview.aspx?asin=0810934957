                <span id="Label1">Three years ago Yann Arthus-Bertrand's Earth From  Above-the result of a five-year airborne odyssey across five continents-was published around the world to critical and popular acclaim.  Now, Arthus-Bertrand's monumental achievement is available in a revised and expanded edition: Here are all the astonishing original photographs together with 17 new images and authoritative new texts by world-renowned environmentalist Lester Brown and other well-known ecologists-all at the new low price of $45.00!  <P>Arthus-Bertrand's remarkable aerial photographs offer the most revealing and spectacular portrait of our world ever created. Produced under the sponsorship of UNESCO, the book is also a unique documentary record of the state of the world's fragile environment.</span>

                    <span>I originally saw Yann Arthus-Bertrand's work in the May 2002 issue of "Reporters without Borders". It contained 79 of his photos (approx 8 1/2 X 11 with great print quality and paper I might add - what a deal for ...). I then immediately looked to see if he had released any of his work in a book. <P>This book is absolutley breathtaking! I haven't even gotten half way through this book yet, but feel that I have a new appreciation for the earth. He accompanies each photo with a description. Unfortunately Mr. Jensen doesn't read too well, otherwise he would have noticed that the author makes statements about the harmful things that ALL COUNTRIES are doing to the planet, nor did he realize the fact that most of the photos are outside of the U.S.! This is a shame!<P>Everyone should have a copy of this book, if not for the stunning photography, for the lessons we can all learn by seeing the terrible destruction we are doing to our planet! This book is a must! I have given this book as a gift several times and everyone has loved it!</span>

                    <span>When I first saw this book, I figured it was exactly what I was looking for - striking perspectives and colors of the earth like the Orbit book, but from a lower altitude. The amazing images on the front and back cover make you belive this. Although there are a good bunch of these types of pictures, most photos are neither close and abstract enough to feel artsy, nor wide and far enough back to encompase an entire scene. It felt as though it wanted to be one way or the other - as though many shots were cropped arbitrarily from some greater image. The wide format of the book has potential for dramatic compositions, but few of the images seem to take strong advantage of this. <P>However, the printing and binding of the book is so excellent, its worth the price of admission alone. The prints themselves could use a bit more saturation, but the 365 glossy photos, heavy duty spine, and massive color and subject variety make this a good find none the less.</span>

                    <span>I seldom buy books on impulse. This volume? I saw it and bought it. Use all the superlatives here. Not that the photography is spectacular which it is, not that the subjects are perfectly framed which they are and not that the colors are strikingly vibrant which as you will see is true. But even if all these things were not true this book transports me to hundreds of places I want to go. They are pictures of places I dream of all over the world. And let me tell you a story. My dad is in the hospital with little chance of recovery [82 and has had a good life] I know he has always wanted to travel but because of life circumstances he has not. In this book there are 365 pictures of all the places he's always wanted to go. I held each one up to him as he lay in his hospital room and he wept with the dreams that never happened. I love this book and have bought two more since as gifts. Simply the best and I never buy picture books.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book, one that you can spread in front of yourself and a loved one (it is a big, heavy tome). The captions do tend at times to "leap" to moralizing remarks about matters ecological, but that's fine with me, especially given the depressing political attitudes toward conservation over the last few years. Anyone who can nudge public opinion back to concern for the environment is doing a real service. A few minor complaints about the book, though: 1. Those who have seen the outdoor exhibition of these images in London or Paris will find the versions here are not quite as tight or vibrant. 2. The spreading of the images across two pages breaks many of the powerful views down the middle. (I wonder if the 24-hour format is bound differently, as it appears on the Amazon site.) 3. Perhaps the most striking image, one of the great dromedary caravan photos (P. 173) appears only on the caption flap in miniature form. The large image to which it supposedly refers (pp. 178-79) has been replaced by a slightly different, and less powerful, image (cropped differently and with darker shadows obscuring the surreal Z-pattern of the dune-and-dromedary shadow). But these are petty objections. A wonderful book for fans of photography and nature, and a great gift.</span>
