                    <span>I've read a number of introductions to object-oriented design and programming. This one is the best all-around introduction that I have seen. It starts in the real world, with a discussion of how one plans and organizes a task (sending flowers to a significant other) that requires more than a single person to get done. That's a pleasant change from texts that begin with Dauntingly Dry Definitions ("encapsulation", "inheritance", and my favorite, "polymorphism"). <p>To the author's credit, he avoids launching into inheritance until Chapter 8, by which time he has laid enough groundwork to reduce the concept to common sense. Other concepts are presented in a similar manner.<p>Note that this book is a survey book, not an in-depth programming manual. You won't learn C++ or Delphi, or any of the other half-dozen languages used for the book's examples. And the book focuses on concepts, rather than implementation. you won't learn how to implement a Singleton pattern in C#, although you will learn what it is and why it is useful. Finally, the book assumes familiarity with traditional, procedural programming. This is not a Programming 101 text.<p>I would recommend this book enthusiastically as a starting point for anyone making the transition from traditional programming to OOP. If you are moving to the DotNet platform, I have created a list ("So you'd like to ... Transition to DotNet") with some other recommended texts.</span>

                    <span>I've been using classes more as a means of organizing and improving the maintainability, understanding of various applications I've built over the past 3 years (VB). As I am about to develop solutions using the .NET platform (C#, VB.NET), I thought it would do me good to formalize my understanding of OOP/OOD. After reading this text (3rd Edition), I not only formalized my understanding, but was able to see OOP as clearly as I could structured programming (Code Complete). In my opinion, all should use this as the first book before trying to participate/apply J2EE or Microsoft.NET as it will allow you "properly" communicate, design and code systems from abstraction to detail.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. The author covers all the important oo concepts in several languages. This allows you to get an excellent perspective on each concept without being distracted by each language's implemention of that concept. I also appreciated the writing skills of the author. He was always clear and precise. A lot of information is packed into a relatively slim volume. Of several introductory oo books I've recently read, this one easily tops my list.</span>

                    <span>I had a great opportunity to know the author of this book in person: I took Dr.Budd's course on Object-oriented programming in Oregon State University in Fall 2000. We used this book in class throughout the term, and thus all of us were compelled to read this book from cover to cover. <p>The principal point I would like to emphasize is that the book really is about the Object-Oriented Concepts. It is not a "guide how to aply OO-principles in C++", it is not an "Object Pascal OO-programming". No. The book is about general concepts of Object-oriented Programming not bounded to any particular OO-language. Although sometimes it was really difficult to understand some of the ideas, the good point was that the author did not try to make the things simpler. If something was difficult to understand - this only meant that it was that Real Blue Thing whose perception makes you a cool programmer.<p>However, the illustrations in the book (at least in the edition I obtained) were not very good, but rather poor. Had they been made by a profeccional designer, I would have rated the book with 5 stars. So far, it's only 4.</span>

                    <span>This text book is one of the worst text book I have been forced to read. Having to read this text book as part of the University requirement, I found it very confusing, especially when explaining any concept. In short, there is was no simple straight forward explanation of any topic. The book is filled with complicated sentences through out. Some times you would read a bunch of paragraphs under each topic/section and would still be wondering , which part actually talks about the topic.... I would never recommend this to any one who is new in learning OO or to anyone is already buried in Structured Programming and trying to make a transition to OO.</span>
