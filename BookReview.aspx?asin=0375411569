                    <span>That's the central point of this engaging read by Mr. Fromkin, that what's commonly referred to as 'The Great War' was actually 2 different wars---Austria-Hungary versus Serbia being distinct from the greater conflagration.  So, when enquiring as to who started it, one must be precise in specifying which war one is speaking about.  In this book, the author persuasively makes the case that Austria-Hungary had it in for Serbia and simply used the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as the excuse for doing what they were already planning to do---ie., deal with the problem (as perceived by them) of Serbia.  Germany acquiesced in support of Austria-Hungary and expected the issue to be settled (ie., Serbia weakened) forthwith & that would be the end of it; BUT, Austria-Hungary took its sweet time---so much time that what ought have been a fait accompli before other European states would be able to object, became contestable.  Thence members of the "war party" in Germany began to maneuver for action; operating under the assumption that Germany was losing power vis-a-vis other European states, and that since conflict was inevitable, better to have it now than later.  So Germany started The First World War, but the war didn't begin with Archduke Ferdinand's assassination.  Rather, Germany chose the path for general war even after it had been given ample opportunity by other powers to disengage from escalating tensions brought on by Austria's mishandling of that country's crisis with Serbia.  The First World War thus was no accidental happenstance, but was brought about by Germany's willingness to bring the then almost decade-long turmoil in European political affairs to a head; before its perceived position further weakened vis-a-vis Russia, in particular.  Mr. Fromkin's book is extremely detailed and relate solely to what it purports to address---the summer of 1914. (Read John Keegans "The First World War" for what happened once the guns started & "Paris 1919" for treaty matters sorting it out after the fact.) (05Mar) Cheers!</span>

                    <span>First off, let me say that Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace is one of the best books about why there are still problems in the Middle East.  It should top anybody's list of great historical works.  I really enjoyed it.  I was expecting the same with this work, but unfortunately this book comes up short.  Fromkin's thesis is that there were two wars comprising World War One.  The first one dealt with Serbia and Austria and the second one dealt with Germany versus Russia and France.  It generally paints the Serbs and Russians as peaceful people with just a few bad apples among them.  The Germans are depicted as warmongers and military supremecists.  I am not sure I agree with this depiction.  The Serbs were engaged in some very disturbing activities not just in Bosnia but elsewhere.  Half the Serb population wanted to dissolve Austria-Hungary and pick up pieces to reconstiture a great Serb Empire.  Russia wanted to support its ally in the Balkans after its ruin in the Russian-Japanese War.  Both these nations were not babes in the wood looking for a peaceful solution.  They actively participated in starting the war and that is why I can't accept Fromkin's thesis.
<br />I was interested in the politics of the blank check.  It does add color to what is generally understood about the treaty situation in WWI.  Germany needed to back Austria, even though Austria would never back Germany in a similar crisis.  I think that part is believable.  This book gives an interesting theory, but it is the same samo.  Blame the Germans and Austrians because they started it.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book.  It reverses decades of liberal and
<br />marxist lies about the first world war.  By showing clearly
<br />the total responsibility of Germany for the war, he restores
<br />the war to its proper role as a moral crusade against evil.
<br />
<br />After the war, in the 1920's, liberals used lies about the
<br />war to convince people that wars were somehow wrong and 
<br />immoral rather than being a natural part of national and
<br />international life.  Liberals and their false ideas of peace
<br />infected intellectual life for the next 80 years.
<br />
<br />Fromkin shows that the first world war was totally the creation
<br />of the germans.  It was no accident.  It was an expression of
<br />evil from an evil culture.
<br />
<br />The defender nations of freedom in the world, then as now, the
<br />US and Britian had to eventually stand up to that evil and
<br />fight it in a war.
<br />
<br />This book tells us that there is nothing evil about war.  Wars
<br />are fought against evil for the sake of freedom and they are
<br />a necessary part of the lives of countries.  The only thing
<br />that saying war itself is evil accomplishes is to empower the
<br />enemies of freedom to attack without fear of retribution.

                    <span>Forget  or at least set aside much of what you think you know about the onset of the First World War. David Fromkin has some `new' ideas. And three hundred dense if not overwhelming pages of analysis of old and new records, makes for a pretty compelling case. He uses new studies and records, some previously unavailable or hidden, to make his case.
<br />
<br />Prior to the start of the war, the seemingly quiet period among the great powers of Europe was mostly a charade, a shadow dance, while behind the scenes most of those great powers were trying to determine when - not if - the next war would commence. Better, each thought, that they commence it, less they be caught unawares.
<br />
<br />Those twenty-five years before the war were also a period of almost regular assassinations. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Serbia, while often singled out as the event that precipitated the war, was not a singular event and, as Fromkin shows, did not really bring about the war. At least not the "great" war.
<br />
<br />As Fromkin notes, "It takes at least two to keep the peace, but it only takes one to start a war. (282-3) Germany especially, fearing the development of Russia and the Slavs, with industrialization financed by France, saw war with Russia to be inevitable. This was a racial struggle, the Teutonic race against the Slavic. Germany even imagined England as an ally in this crusade; some of this assumption was reasonable, based on blood ties. Germany had plans for war before Sarajevo. But after Sarajevo, Germany also thought that Austria-Hungary could quickly declare war on Serbia, wipe out resistance, and immobilize the Russian forces before they moved against Germany or Austria-Hungary. And all the while, Austria-Hungary saw Germany as their insurance against a Russian attack. Both sides counted on the other to thwart Russian intentions. It is almost ironic that Germany invaded France, through Belgium, to stop Russia. And that Britain, facing civil war at home in Ireland and looking for peace on the continent, turned almost overnight when Germany violated Belgian neutrality. Fromkin notes that Britain would not have been so upset had France done this to Belgium; Britain's concerns were with balance, including keeping French power, not Belgian sovereignty or neutrality.
<br />
<br />And it was not a German appetite for colonies that drove the war. Fromkin notes, "[I]t was not imperialism that caused the war; it was the war that produced a new wave of imperialism." (278) This was a period when wealth meant taking it by conquest. But much of that grwoth in colonial imperialism had run its course. Nearby, European lands offered more tempting targets and insurance against invasion. 'Invade or be invaded' seemed to be a prevailing credo of the time, and no colonies were likely to be doing the invading.
<br />
<br />Besides, there were two wars. Fromkin writes: "Two wars, not one; that is the key." (274) Adding, "Germany instigated the war against Russia on its own account." Serbia was almost an afterthought, a diversion. Expected to be quickly crushed by Austria-Hungary, it offered Germany an excuse for a initiatives against enemies, real or imagined, current or future.
<br />
<br />War, in the time before the "great" war, came to be accepted as the natural course of human and national events. Some of these problems of war remain with us today: Pre-emptive attack, misguided assumptions, bad intelligence on the enemy, subterfuge, distrust, racism, greed, paranoia. It may be both comforting and disconcerting to realize that our problems are not recent. Perhaps they are timeless, inevitable. Let's hope not.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book.  Not only is it well written in an engaging, sometimes humorous manner, but it opens the door to an entirely new and fresh look at the origins of the mother of all wars in the 20th century.  Everybody knows about the assasination of the Austrian Archduke.  People with little knowledge of history know that this "triggered" the outbreak of the First World War, but cannot explain why.  Barbara Tuchman's famous work "The Guns of August" was for me the foremost work on the subject and a great read as well.  However, using newly discovered material, Fromkin surpasses Tuchman in providing the most compelling analysis of the true origins of the war.  It is as if he has put the final piece in the jig saw puzzle that Barbara Tuchman almost finished.  In her day, without the most recently discovered historical materials, her version of events was the best.  Now we have come full circle.  The leaders of Versailles were not as badly informed in blaming Germany above all for starting the war as was fashionable to think.  This does not excuse the rather bad peace they imposed which played such a large role in triggering the next world war, which was in large part a continuation of the first after a two decade pause.  Nevertheless, lessons abound for todays leaders about how a military elite can influence and even compel a country to self destructive wars without strong and competent leadership.  Kaiser Wilhelm was too discredited and Kaiser Franz Josef too old and weak to stand in the way of their military chiefs who wrongly thought that to delay war would lead to inevitable doom for their respective countries.  In manipulating their monarchical masters, they wrought the very destruction on these two central european empires that they thought they were avoiding.  I have a great interest in this subject, and felt that a revolutionary light had been turned on this very old issue the implications of which will take quite some time to sort out in historical and literary circles.  A must read for any historian interested in this era and these issues.</span>
