Author  Nigel Calder  explains how the systems work, helps you troubleshoot and identify problems, and  presents clear and concise instructions on how to repair them.

                    <span>I don't give out many 5 star reviews. But this one definitely qualifies. If you have an electrical or mechanical problem start here. Lots of good, well explained information for those of use who are not experts. This book was a great help in redoing my electrical system, as well as helping me understand numerous systems on my boat. Calder covers how things work, limitations, purchase and design considerations, integration with other systems and practical pros and cons. Would I buy this again? ABSOLUTELY-I can recommend this book with no limitations.</span>

                    <span>When electrical or mechanical systems go wrong on a boat afloat, you have a crisis. An uneducated repair can be costly. This book needs to be handy. <P>The book devotes 113 pages to aspects of the electrical system, then addresses auxiliary sources of power, electric generators and motors, marine electronics, diesel engines, transmissions, refrigeration and air conditioning, toilet systems, pumps, steering systems, stoves, heaters, lights, rigging, deck rigging and hardware. Its a gold mine.<P>Its guidance in the toilet repair and generator troubleshooting has been a great help to us.</span>

                    <span>If you were going to be stranded on a desert island and could only take one CD with you, which one would you take and why? Years ago I used to listen to a program on the BBC that asked famous guests that question, only they said record, not CDs. Well I suppose I'd take Bob Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" if I were in that fix. And if I were to go to sea on a cruising sailboat and could only take one book with me, it would have to be this excellent, well written book by Mr. Calder. It's big, heavy, expensive and if you need it, you'll be glad you have it and you'll think it's worth it's weight in gold.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book. Too many books only explain what is wrong and then instruct to perform a service without explaining specifically how. This book shows how with lots of illustrative photos and test data and detailed instructions for using test equipment. Practically everything in this book also applies to maintaining RV vehicles and trailers as well. I use it for my boat and RV.</span>
