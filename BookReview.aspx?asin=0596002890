                <span id="Label1">Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Java, VB.NET and C# (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl, MySQL, <em>awk</em>, and Emacs.  If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener.  A command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i> will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert.</span>

                    <span>Plain and simple, this is the definitive work on regular expressions...  Mastering Regular Expressions (2nd Edition) by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl (O'Reilly).
<br />
<br />Chapter List:  Introduction to Regular Expressions; Extended Introductory Examples; Overview of Regular Expression Features and Flavors; The Mechanics of Expression Processing; Practical Regex Techniques; Crafting an Efficient Expression; Perl; Java; .NET; Index
<br />
<br />I've always been a bit reluctant, hesitant, perhaps even fearful to work with regular expressions.  I mean, when you're presented with the following:
<br />
<br />s!<emphasis>([0-9+(\.[0-9]+){3})</emphasis>!$1!
<br />
<br />who wouldn't start to fear for their sanity?
<br />
<br />I recently started to explore the subject a bit in the Notes/Domino arena, and I quickly realized I needed more information than I had.  This book fills in all the gaps and then some.  It's one of those rare books that starts at an introductory level, simple enough (given the subject matter) that beginners can start to grasp the concepts.  If you're past the beginning stages, you can head into the chapters on how to write efficient expressions, as well as how arcane commands interact with each other.  If you're not there yet, just keep the book around for reference when you do arrive.  To finish the book off, there are chapters on specific implementations of regular expressions in certain languages.  This ties the whole package together...  introduction through advanced techniques, finished by focused information specific to a particular area of use.  You can't ask for much more.  It's also nice that the 2nd edition came out after Java had implemented the regex package in 1.4, so you get the latest information.  
<br />
<br />If you have a copy of this book, make sure your name is in it.  This is not one of those titles you want to have turn up missing at the exact moment you need to figure out a nice single line statement to correct a 100 MB text file...  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Like the other Oriely books I've read, this book tells you everything you ever wanted to know about regex and probably a lot of stuff that is interesting but not practically nescary. This book covers regex egines and most common implimentation of regex. It's all good stuff but I would like a book that is more focussed on the practical details of this how you write a regex to validate a phone number or a data etc....</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be really useful.   It was an easy to follow step by step descriptioon of the regular expression language.   It also provided valuable insight into the regular expression evaluation engine which is critical to creating efficient and performant expressions.   
<br />
<br />A must read for anybody that wants to really write effective regular expressions.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is one of the few O'Reilly books that I read cover to cover.  What?  A book on regular expressions read cover to cover?  If you have read the book, I suspect that you understand.  If not, read it.  Even a cursory skimming (if possible) will provide valuable information in HOW regular expressions work - the syntax, the underlying engine, differences in implementation.  Highly recommended.  
<br />
<br />On a sidenote, the regular expression in the back of the book (a full page long) has been the topic of conversation in my workplace more than once.  I suspect that it will eventually become one of those "geek indicators" like the number 42 or PARC.</span>
