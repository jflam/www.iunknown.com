                    <span>This riveting narrative, a kind of polyphonic chorus giving voice to American black women, adds an important chapter in the ongoing project of understanding our nation's history.  Covering a span of almost 400 years, the work moves beyond stereotypes, beyond idealization, to recognize the richness of the stories they tell.  With superbly crafted prose, the authors document difficulties and challenges along with achievements and triumphs as they interpret the profound complexities of gender, race and class in the lives of African American women.</span>

                    <span>It is close to impossible to reconstruct a history of African Americans.  Indeed, part of our common American heritage is the destruction and unrecorded depiction of non-European and non-male histories.  The authors have dilligently researched their stories and they are to be congratulated for their tenacity.  However, the book fails to elicit "hope" from the reader.  The writing is dry and unimaginative.  With such a lively history, it is a shame that it reads like a dead history. The most egregious flaw in the book, however, is not found in its writing style but rather in how the authors attempt to boost the qualities of the women portrayed in the book by drawing comparisons between the accomplishment of these women and the accomplishments of men and white women.  This is a completely unnecessary element.  The accomplishments of these African American women stand on their own.  The purpose of the book is largely diminished  because the authors have touted "whiteness" or "maleness" as  standards. "Whiteness" and "maleness" are not standards by my measure and should not be used as one, particularly in a book about black women.  I would hope that  the authors eliminate their references and comparisons to men and white women in future editions so that the history of these women can be properly relayed to future generations.</span>

                    <span>A Shining Thread of Hope:  The History of Black Women in America is a book for the country.  This book is not just a history written on a specific race and gender, but it offers invaluable insights on the lives of a group of people who simply did not give up hope.  A Shining Thread of Hope is a book seems to be in a class by itself.  It's both academic and non-academic.  It proves to be a wonderfully written narrative that any age, class, gender or race can learn from and enjoy.  I applaud the authors for their collaborating efforts to bring to life the stories of Black women, who seem to be forgotten.  I would encourage all people to read this book, for it will provide them with food for the mind and soul. A Shining Thread of Hope leaves one's heart full of warmth and love for all humanity.  It encourages us to fight for what is right and demand respect of each other as human beings.  (Marshanda Smith)</span>

                    <span>I have read a number of books about Black Women and this one is in a different league from the others. It if, as far as I know, the FIRST book to tell the narrative history of African American women in the United States and it tells it in a riviting fashing "warts and all." I had planned on spending several days working my way through a "history" book and stayed up till 4:00 in the morning to finish it in a single sitting. I can without qualification say that I think anyone who cares about American history should read this volume.</span>
