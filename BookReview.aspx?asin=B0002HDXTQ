                <span id="Label1"><I>Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism</I> uses the inflammatory  tactics of the Fox News Channel to demonstrate the conservative bias  that's handed down by Fox's owner, media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The  documentary gathers interviews from media watchdogs and former Fox  employees (including a former anchor, Jon Du Pre, who describes his flailing efforts to create a celebration for Reagan's birthday when the one he was sent to cover never materialized), but their overwhelming condemnation of Fox's skewed news  practices isn't half as effective as footage taken directly from Fox  itself--an appalling montage of pundit Bill O'Reilly telling guests to  shut up; repeated efforts to paint Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry as weak  and waffling, while President Bush is captured in respectful, reverent  images; and management memos dictating language, subject matter, and point  of view. <I>Outfoxed</I> is unlikely to persuade Fox News fans to change  their views, but it may spur outraged liberals to take action. <I>--Bret  Fetzer</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>During the last election, when speaking out against the dichotomizing of conservative (i.e. patriotic, God-fearing, right) vs. liberal (i.e. a traitor, heretic and radical), I was looked at like I was a nut.  When pointing out America's role in the rise in terrorism, I was branded a liberal (as if that's a bad thing).  All of these counter views have been effectively squashed by big media.  These dissenting views are unwelcome and the media has effectively swayed a large portion of our population to believe this.  
<br />
<br />So of course I was beginning to think it was me and that I was alone on this, that all liberals are required to put on the uniform of bad hair and bad clothes so we can be set apart, branded and quarantined.  
<br />
<br />Thank God (yes, God) for this video.  Sure it's one-sided.  So what?  It makes no bones about its intentions.  And it pulls out all the stops.  That's what is necessary to awaken us from our desensitized slumber, taking in what we are fed by most news outlets.  We can no longer just accept what's given; we must hunt out what is really happening.  And so, this video.  Fox 'News' is exposed for what it is - an adjunct of the GOP.
<br />
<br />Former Fox associates being interviewed with snippets of Fox talking heads corroborating their statements (Sean Hannity's comments that we are 'X number of days from Bush being re-elected' should make your hair stand up on end) make up the bulk of the documentary.  
<br />
<br />Bill O'Reilly is taken to task.  Yes, we get to see an update on the Jeremy Glick's appearance on his show.  For those who may not remember, Glick was the young man whose father had been killed in the 9.11 attacks, who signed an anti-war petition.  O'Reilly had claimed that no one who had lost family in the attacks would dare do such a thing.  Mr. Glick did.  Fox got him on the show.  O'Reilly nearly accosted the young man.  Fair and balanced my a**.  
<br />
<br />It's about time someone exposed this stuff.  Again, the video is not claiming to be 'fair and balanced'.  It merely takes Fox's outrageous claims of being fair and balanced to town, revealing that this is nothing but advertising, as if by stating it it makes it so.
<br />
<br />The video is segmented into various sections (e.g. Election Day coverage, etc.) and is a whirlwind of editing prowess, composed of soundbytes - fitting, in my opinion, considering that the 'world update' on most news channels comprises about three minutes, just a bit longer than the feel-good story they tack on at the end.
<br />
<br />Though a bit tedious - we get the point very early - this is an eye-opener.  You'll laugh or you'll cry, or even through things at your television, but it's important to watch this.  You are being lied to.</span>

                    <span>I gave this documentary two stars because the Bill O'Reilly "shut up" montage made me laugh out loud.  That may be worth the price of this DVD, as long as you buy it used for about five bucks and then sell it used for about five bucks.  
<br />
<br />Other than that, I was left unconvinced that there's anything all that wrong with Fox News, or at least that there's anything more wrong with Fox News than with any other news network.  Now for some particulars:
<br />
<br />First, why is "corporate control" of a news network suddenly so bad?  I remember when the "big three" were independent corporations, and now ABC is owned by Disney, and NBC is owned by General Electric, right?  Oh, and there's MS(Microsoft)NBC.  Isn't Microsoft a corporation?  
<br />
<br />Second, the editing made the heads of interviewees jerk around almost like that old "Max Headroom" character of the 1980's.  I felt like the tapes of the interviews had been extensively rearranged for propaganda purposes.  It also gave me the impression that the people behind this documentary didn't know how to do their jobs very well.
<br />
<br />Third, I'm really not impressed by a voice telling me bad things about Fox while I'm staring at a microphone, a recorder, and volume meters bouncing up and down.  Anybody could phony up something like this.  
<br />
<br />Fourth, the technique of taking quotes out of Fox memos, highlighting the first and last sentences, and greying and fading out the middle before I even had a chance to read the entire quote seemed like blatent in-your-face twisting of facts.  I suppose I could have hit pause and carefully analyzed those quotes anyway, but by then I was so let down by the amateurishness of this production that I didn't really care.
<br />
<br />Fifth, what totally discredited this entire documentary is what seemed to be a condemnation of Fox simply for reporting good things our military people are doing for the people of Iraq.  The not-so-subtle implication is that any "smart" and "enlightened" person knows that there is absolutely no way our military could possibly be doing good anywhere in Iraq.  Thus, showing our military doing good is bad journalism and that's all there is to it. 
<br />
<br />Finally, I watched this after Dan Rather "memogate" fiasco went public.  That made the entire premise of this documentary seem dated and wrong.  
<br />
<br />I'm not convinced that Fox News is as "fair and balanced" as they would want me to believe, but I am convinced that this "documentary" is little more than red meat for the Howard Dean segment of the Democratic Party; meat that is already spoiled and rotten.

                    <span> This film is an excellent (although depressing) look at the "fair and balanced" FOX news. The idea behind the whole thing is this: Pretend that ALL the news channels are liberally biased. Pretend that you are 'balancing" that problem by this: two heads, each with a point of view, yelling at each other. This has worked very well for him. A LOT of Americans think this mess is "fair and balanced". This film is a fine illustration of the sickening truth. Here's the future of American "news" :two heads hollering. No matter WHAT the issue, there must be two points of view. "Here with an opposing view, please welcome Benito."</span>

                    <span>This skillfully-crafted film uses the same propaganda techniques it exposes to illustrate the overwhelming bias machine that is Fox News.  Although it may be propaganda, that does not dismiss the content.  Much of it still rings true to intelligent, educated viewers.  This film offers the best in the documentary tradition:  It educates, informs, and challenges.  Even when viewers disagree with the film's conclusions, we may still enjoy the clarity and provocative nature of a presentation that respects our intelligence.</span>

                    <span>I first became interested in the issue of biased journalism after reading Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them."  It touched upon the hypocrisy of the Fox News Network.  I was intrigued, so I waited to see this documentary with much anticipation.  
<br />
<br />While I have respect for the vast amount of research, the hours upon hours of tapes that went into making this documentary, I have problems with how it was edited.  The filmmakers interviewed many credible people, and when someone would make an incriminating statement against Fox, footage from the news network is shown to support the statement.  The problem, however, is that the footage would be just a few seconds, and therefore difficult to know what kind of context it was taken from.  They would also use ten or twenty different examples of similar footage (for example of bill o'reilly saying "shut up") to get the point across.  while this editing style is amusing at first, it gets overused and repititious.
<br />
<br />The documentary would be more credible if instead of using twenty 1-second shots, it spent more time on a few and allowed us to see what was happening in context.  As it is, the documentary is just full of opinions, and dare I say, no less biased than fox.</span>
