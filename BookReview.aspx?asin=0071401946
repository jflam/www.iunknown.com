                    <span>	I found this book to be very helpful on many different levels.  It was written in a format that made it very easy to understand and follow.  The first few chapters were dedicated to describing different types of communication and what things contribute to breakdowns in communication.  I liked that the authors gave several examples in many different situations to illustrate what they were talking about.  Often people do not even notice that their own actions are contributing to the reasons that problems are not being solved.  The book helps to define some of the ways people can look at themselves in order to find out if their actions are incompatible to getting what they want.  
<br />	The book also describes several different ways that these problems can be fixed.  I liked that the authors did not try to act as if communication problems can be easily fixed.  It brought up problems such as what to do when the person you are talking to does not trust your motives, or when you and that person have to entirely different desires.  There is even a chapter at the end of the book that allots for problems that are seemingly impossible to fix.  The authors also admitted that conversations happening in real time are not always as simple as the examples that they provide.  These sections made the book a little more believable to me.  
<br />	The solutions that the book describes are presented in a format that is easy to remember.  Most of them are acronyms, and the reader gets the sense that they can be applied to real life.  I also liked that the book is helpful to people in a variety of communication situations, whether you are trying to talk to colleagues at a board meeting or your spouse about possibly moving.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for ways to communicate with the people in their lives.

I run a training division and have ordered books and will order cd's for our library!  If enough of us learn to implement the techniques detailed in this book, imagine the positive outcomes we can achieve from all of our converstations,especially the 'crucial' ones! </span>

                    <span>This is a super book, filled with lots of examples, of how to skillfully conduct crucial conversations - of many kinds.  Even if you're not in a situation in which you expect to have a crucial conversation, get this book, read it, and benefit from it in your daily life.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because: 1) I want to be better in communication (in general) and; 2) it had great reviews (Steve Covey!!). I finished it in 4 days and must say I was not all that impressed. 
<br />It reads like a text-book in that they (the authors) are always asking us to apply some new system of operation. They remind us that one reading is not enough and much time must be spent in mastering their principles. The principles do appear correct, well considered, and are clearly proposed. They are certainly getting back to the basics of communication and there are a few wonderful revelations (but nothing earth shattering). 
<br />Further, the book has a behavioral science/study feel to it but no footnotes or extensive referencing is made. The case studies are general and simple- the examples throughout the book are slightly feeble and even more simple. I was continually bothered in reading a book based on years of "research" which was void of notated study/notes/details. In the end, it lacks experiemental conviction and convincing.
<br />I appreciated the effort made to present information and models in simple ways. I appreciate the motivational tone of the book. But, I was seeking something new and exciting- some earth shattering information based on years of study. 
<br />In the end, this book is a simplistic discussion of healthy dialogue which is presented in clever models. It is not a page turner!! 
<br />Its greatest flaw is the absence of solid case study or examples; its greatest strength is its simple presentation and kind tone. 
<br />There has got to be better texts available on the subject....  </span>

                    <span>The book's thesis is simple: master the few critical conversations that either make or break your career and personal relationships and you can greatly enhance your satisfaction. Unfortunately, we often bungle these crucial conversations precisely because these conversations are important and emotionally charged. Our own bodily functions and emotions block our own ability to rationally and calmly analyze the situation and speak in the language and tone required to resolve delicate and complex situations.
<br />
<br />The main problem with the book is its explaination on how to master these crucial conversations. The author writes 150 pages worth of conversational techniques. From my experience, communication is not a technique, but a blend of one's experience, emotion, intellect, physicality (body language and voice), and genetic disposition. Although everyone can improve their communication skills, I believe reading about few steps in a book is hardly effective or worthwhile. 
<br />
<br />Instead, I think the author should have focused on the crux of his methdology. That is, mastering crucial conversations involves controlling one's emotions (emotional intelligence) in a way that one does not lose emotional equilibrium despite one's almost irresisitble desire to do so in critical situations.
<br />
<br />But I have a feeling the book would have been less than 100 pages if the author had chosen such route. And such a short, albeit more effective, book does not make for best sellers.
