                    <span>I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus and interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's "Texas Hold'em Odds" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book.

                    <span>The Theory of Poker is the best book written on poker.
<br />You will not find information on how to play specific hands but you will find the theory that will teach you how to think-and that is more important. 
<br />Unless your are a poker expert The book requires studying for many hours and quite a lot of readings.
<br />The book writes about every poker theory you need (pot odds, effective odds, implied odds........).
<br />This should be your second book not the first one
<br />If you have poker experience and comprehend some poker books, this is the book for you.

                    <span>I re-read this book every few months, and learn something new every time.  
<br />There are concepts in here that were so revolutionary when first published that they changed the game.  Now, some of them are old hat, but you must know them inside and out.
<br />If you haven't read and understood this book, you shouldn't play poker for money.</span>

                    <span>Sklansky is the best writer on poker theory and strategy, and this is his best book, period. This is not a light read or an easy read, but its not poorly written either, its just that he examines his Fundamental Theory of Poker with a good bit of math and logic. This is a book that is meant to be highlighted and notes should be taken along with it, and re-reading it is a must.
<br />Once the basic theory and its more specific applications of this book are internalized and come out in your play effortlessly and without conscious thought, you will see why this book is so highly regarded by the poker community, critics, and even the most skilled players in the world.
<br />Has sections on every aspect of poker - expectation, his Fundamental Theory of Poker (amazing), odds (effective, implied, reverse, pot), deception, bluffs & semi-bluffs, raising & check-raising, loose vs. tight play, position, reading hands, and the psychology of poker. he covers in section better than entire books that focus specifically on any of them.
<br />I can't say enough good things about this fantastic book. It will give you a better and more complete understanding of the game than any other book ever made; it will make you a better player, period.</span>

                    <span>This is the best poker book ever written. It makes everything that is unclear clear. After reading this i did not have to trust my inuition any more, instead I could apply cold logic into every poker decision. </span>
