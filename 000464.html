<h3 class="title">Baby Boot Camp</h3>

<p>Inspired by being at <a href="http://sill-www.army.mil/">Fort Sill</a> for a week, we decided to begin "baby boot camp" when I returned. Matthew's sleep habits have been, um, not so good shall we say - and recently they took a turn for the worse. Carolyn's been worn down to the bone - especially having to deal with my being sick and then away for a week. </p>

p. On Saturday night we decided to let him cry it out. After reading from cover to cover Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child we watched for drowsiness signs, settled him down by a bit of rocking, put him into his crib, kissed him goodnight and walked out of the room. As expected, there was some protesting. But it only lasted 9 minutes before there was ... silence. After checking in on him and making sure he was sleeping soundly we declared victory - prematurely. </p>

<p>An hour later he awoke and protested for an hour and twenty minutes! That was really difficult to take, but eventually he settled down for another 3 hours. He awoke for two feeds - at 12am and 4am, protested 5 minutes and 30 minutes respectively before awaking at 7:00am - his normal wake-up time. He was his normal happy self in the morning, much to our relief! </p>

<p>Last night, he was even better. He slept from 8pm until almost 3am before he woke up to feed just once. After, he protested for what seemed like an eternity - another 40 minutes, but he clearly got more sleep on the second night than the first night.</p>

<p>Matthew's definitely learning how to fall asleep by himself, and he's also learning how to fall asleep after awaking in the middle of the night - we'll hear brief yelps occasionally, but they're becoming less frequent. With any luck, we should have a more rested family soon!</p>

<p>Every child is different but here's my observations.</p>

<p>My daughter ( now 14 mos ) slept through the night at 8 months, and only woke once a night from 6-8 months old.</p>

<p>Two things which are paramount:<br />
1. They MUST get enough calories during the day so that hunger doesn't wake them.  This may have accounted for the long crying period.<br />
2. The must not get too much or too little sleep during the day.  Too much and they don't need a full nights rest. Too little and they become overtired ,powersleep a few hours and wake somewhat rested.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>My son is now 1 year old and we did the sme kind of 'sleep training' around 7 months.  After a few rough days he had learned how to fall asleep on his own and ever since then we put him down at 8:00 PM, within 5 minutes he is asleap and he sleeps right through to 7:00 AM - every single ight!  Bottom line - although every child is different, you are on the right track and the payoff is well worth the effort!</p>
