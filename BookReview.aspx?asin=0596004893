                    <span>The key purpose of a tutorial is to teach you the language, and in this case to then show you how to use the language to build applications. The topic of .NET is very large, but Liberty provides an excellent explanation of every significant aspect of C# specifically, and then he applies it to creating applications and using the .NET Framework.<P>This book is divided into four parts (three in the book and then one on his web site).<P>Part I is a solid, comprehensive, well written tutorial in the language. He covers it all, but he does so in a way that is clear and understandable. Advanced concepts like delegates are explained carefully and illustrated with meaningful examples.<P>Part II is a brief introduciton to programming with C#. He covers ASP.NET (which he covers in more detail in his ASP book), Windows Forms (is there a book on this coming?) ADO.NET and Web Services. The latter two are introduced here but expanded on in his ASP.NET book.<P>Part III goes beyond the language to show how C# is used with the .NET Framework, and this part alone is worth the cost of the book.<P>C++ and Java programmers will find part I easy going, C and VB programmers will work harder. Part II is just an overview, and part III is simply terrific. <P>The final part is the extensive support Liberty provides on his web site. Not only does he offer a FAQ and errata, but he has a link to a discussion group where he answers questions about the book!<P>Finally, the writing is excellent, the examples terrific and the overall quality of this book superb. O'Reilly continues to produce excellent books and this is no exception.<P>I highly recommend this book, unless you have no prior programming experience at all, in which case you might prefer to start with his other book, Learning C#.</span>

                    <span>This is the classic book for learning C#. It is little wonder that it has been outselling all other C# books on Amazon for months and months.<P>Liberty's writing style is clear, and is use of examples is terrific. Each example is kept simple enough to illustrate the point at hand, and not distract with fancy footwork that confuses the reader.<P>Liberty starts with a full explanation of the language. The book is targeted at programmers with some experience in some other language (VB6, C++ and Java are the clear targets) but a bright reader can get through this book with little or no previous experience.<P>After teaching C#, Liberty shows how to use it to create applications. He demonstrates simple Web and Windows Applications, and a Web Service.<P>Finally, in the third part of the book Liberty goes beyond the basics to show advanced ideas in the .NET Framework and how they are used by C# programmers.<P>This is the best book money can buy, and Liberty supports the book at his web site where he provides all the source code and a link to a private support discusssion center where you can get additional help from him and others.<P>This book, combined with his Programming ASP.NET (now coming out in a second edition) helped me become a proficient ASP.NET programmer. I'm looking forward to his new book on writing desktop applications (Programming .NET Applications) and I hope he continues to write for O'Reilly, because the quality of these books (editing, etc.) is very high.<P>All in all I can recommend this book very highly.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very good read for people who have some prior programming experience. However you don't have to be an expert programmer. This book is one of the best books for Java or C++ developers who want to learn C#. Perhaps, a Java developer will have the easiest transition. This is a compact book that covers the fundamentals of the C# language. It will give you a solid foundation.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books on C# available on the market.<P>Be aware that it is not for the programming beginner, in my opinion. This book is perfect for seasoned C/C++/Java programmers or those who are fairly comfortable with C#.<P>If you're just starting out learning C# and the .NET Framework, I would definitely recommend buying this book and reading it AFTER you have read a more basic book on learning C# programming.<P>But one thing is for sure --> This book NEEDS to be in your .NET library!</span>

                    <span>Very very easy to read. Full of good examples. It grabs you by the hand and teaches you step by step everything about C# in simple, understandable words. Provides examples on every topic, makes comparation between C#, VB.NET, C/C++ and Java. I was eager to learn C# but I did not want to read from a hard, meticulous book. I found this book and it was awesome reading it, and when you less know it you are finished reading these +600 pages book and already programming C#. If you are still deciding which book to purchase, there are good books out there, but THIS ONE is a definitive good decision to acquire and read.</span>
