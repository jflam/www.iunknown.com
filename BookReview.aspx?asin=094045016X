                    <span>What a difference of few decades make.  When I was a youngster the founders were all revered and taught in school.  Nowadays, they are almost ignored and condemned for not conforming to our modern view of morality.  Of course, the present view is both arrogant and ignorant because we assume that future generations will believe as we do and lacks the humility to realize that the human condition is fraught with weakness and sin as well as triumph and wisdom.
<br />
<br />Thomas Jefferson was one of the most remarkable men this country or any country has ever produced.  All you need do is sample these writings and you will begin to understand the powers of his mind, the charisma he manifested, the range of his interests, and the paradoxical foibles as well.  The writings included here are his autobiography, his Notes on Virginia, all kinds of essays, letters, speeches, and selected other papers.
<br />
<br />He writes of philosophy, English prosody, natural history, political observations, the history of the Founding, theological beliefs, and many other topics.  Both of his inaugural addresses are included as well has his notices to Congress (what we now call State of the Union Addresses used to be handled in a letter).  There are also letters to Indian tribes that are quite interesting.  
<br />
<br />The idea that the Indian tribes would want to remain as they were seemed a mistaken to notion to Jefferson and his contemporaries.  They needed to understand that realities of their world had changed forever and they had great opportunities for improving their lives (as he saw it).  Their rejection of overtures to assimilate seemed evidence of an imprisoned mind rather than what we would call a "lifestyle choice".  
<br />
<br />This is another of the great volumes from the Library of America.  It includes a chronology of Jefferson's life, great notes on the texts included, and an index.
<br />
<br />Something you really should have on your shelf of American History and our Founding.</span>

                    <span>This edition of Jefferson's writings is an excellent comrehensive collection. Edited by Jefferson biographer Merrill Peterson this volume is a treasure.<p>It includes Jefferson's Anas, Autobiography, The Notes on Virginia( complete), Summary View of the Rights of British America, his version of the Declaration of Independence, numerous public papers, and addresses. This volume is a must have for the Jefferson reader. It also very necassary for the current state of the American Republic which would be wise to hear the words of this great man. A great buy!</span>

                    <span>This book is a treasure: it contains many of the writings of Thomas Jefferson, and his letters.<br>They are reveal a crisp thinking, like Voltaire, Rousseau, the abbey Gregoire, Rabeau Saint Etienne, and other geat thinkers of the 17th Century (T.Jefferson meet with most), as well a Pascal who was way ahead of his time. TJ try to explain the rational for generosity, compassion, respect for life, respect for people, respect for justice, and more: anyone who claims to be president of the  USA (or any sovereign nation) should read and understand this book. Unfortunatly this is probably not the case... Politicians love to use a citation of TJ, but their policies would often be despised by TJ.<br>Let's hope that the future will give the US presidents with the values of this great thinker, and for the time being let's just be patient.</span>

                    <span>As a student in England, doing work on military academies, I came across the notes, papers, writings, etc of Thomas Jefferson in the bibliography of "West Point", by Norman Thomas Remick. I'm absolutely thrilled that Merrill D. Peterson has put it all together in one 1600 page book. It makes this part of my project almost like one stop shopping. The book is marvelous as a research reference, while at the same time being very interesting reading. By the way, as I see that the book "West Point" is not among the Amazon books on Thomas Jefferson, I hereby highly recommend it to you. It was marvelously interesting, as well.</span>
