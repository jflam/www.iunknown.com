                    <span>This book is helpful for a coach trying to start a program.  There are many things that a new coach could use.  The ideas worked well for Wooden 30+ years ago, so some of it could be outdated.  But most of it is pretty good. The diagrams are confusing.  You need a magnifying glass to follow the cuts of the players.  More time could have been spent on the stall section.</span>

                    <span>When you think of Success, you should recognize John R. Wooden as the leader in this area. This book expands upon his Pyramid of Success philospophy through his coaching regiment. Here again, what was the reason  for UCLA's success. It was through the attention to detail and preparation.  This book is very detail oriented. It is a working example of what it takes  to become successful in coaching basketball. If you are coaching youths  that are below the high school ranks, then this book is probably to  advanced for knowledge transfer. But, there are many drills, offensive sets  and defensive alignments that are teachable to young basketball players.  For coaches involved in youth leagues, CYO, AAU, Intramurals, Junior High  School, this book can help if you are trying to improve upon specific areas  of teaching basketball. For instance, I found the 3-1-1 or "T"  Half Court Zone Trap to be quite effective and provided a new look defense.  There are a multitude of offensive sets, systems, and drills that may help  as well. What you'll find in the book is there is no magic to winning as  the label "Wizard" would suggest. It is accomplished through hard  work and for coaches it is the details. Thanks again Coach Wooden.</span>

                    <span>Once again, coach Wooden enlightens us with his tremendous insight, not only to the game, but in all aspects of life.<p>At 31 years of age, and starting my coaching endeavors, I can remember back in my high school  playing days, seeing my coach reviewing this book that looked like a text  book, over to one side of the gym.  This is it, the one book that shows and  says it all....From the Wizard himself....John Wooden the legend...There  will never be another one like him!</span>
