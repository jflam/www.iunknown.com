                    <span>This book is the perfect way to get up to speed with the feature set and architecture of Reporting Services. It's an easy read, and the quality of the book itself is way more than I expected for the price. It's not an intimidating book due to it's size and layout, so others on your team may also want to read it. In fact, my boss and a co-worker of mine were caught flipping through the copy that was on my desk before I was done with it :)<P>Keep in mind that you'll rely on the online documentation and possibly another more in-depth book for advanced details, but the Rational Guide is a great way to start your evaluation of Reporting Services. Well worth the money!</span>

                    <span>This book has a reasonable return on your investment. You won't spend much to put it in your library, it won't take long to read and you can expect to learn the basics of reporting services from a number of view points. There two things to keep in mind, though about this book. First, this is very high level overview of the product -- sort of like looking down from a jet cruising along at 30,000 feet. Second, this book covers a lot of topics very quickly. The combination of those two factors means that this book isn't a great introduction to Reporting Services as a whole. That said, it is a very good way to become aware of the major features and issues you're likely to encounter with the product. I would recommend it in two either of two cases:<P>1.) As a primer to Reporting Services before moving on to the Books On-Line which ship with the product or another, more in-depth technical book.<P>2.) As a "map to the terrain" of Reporting Services so you can plan your own learning expeditions with the product.<P>There are a few short comings to the book I'd be remiss not to discuss. Most irksome is the number of times the concept of a Data Set is defined differently. Both the writing style and presentation are choppy. Some times information will be presented as a walk-though with screen captures, some times as bulleted lists and sometimes as just a paragraph of text. While variety in writing is a good thing, inconsistency in presentation is not, pointedly for a title like this. It would have been better to have consistently used a database for the examples that the user should have access to. Finally, the author occasionally references a concept before introducing it. This happens a both the detail level -- like reference the meta data database before defining that that is and at a conceptual level, such as when the author provides a front (what the user sees) to back (what the parts of the service) overview of Reporting Services.<P>I would certainly recommend this book to anybody who is looking a quick and easy introduction Reporting Services. It probably won't be the only book you'll need, but its definitely a step in the right direction.</span>

                    <span>You can hardly get a new (current) book for as little as this book costs (under $10) and, for what it costs, it's okay. I just wish it didn't advertize itself as helping me to use Reporting Services. It really just helps me start to use this platform. While the book rates itself for beginners/intermediate, it is certainly no more than a beginner's beginning. <P>This book provides series of basic lessons on using and managing Reporting Services and I was left at the end of the book feeling as if I'd wasted my time. There are so many areas where the auther simply explains what is possible but really doesn't teach me how.<P>It also does not go into how to create new reports using Visual Studio .NET. The customization alluded to on the cover is really about parameters and filtering.<P>In the final analysis, I'd rather pay more and get the information and learn the skills necessary to use Reporting Services effectively, not only as an end user and sometime administrator.<P>I would have also given the book a different title to properly set up the reader's expectations before turning to page 1.</span>

                    <span>While this book provides a very broad overview of SQL Reporting, a lot of detailed information is left out that will cause a good deal of frustration for the beginning user. With the lack of information, you often have to relay on the help screen information or Microsoft's web site to fill in the gaps.</span>
