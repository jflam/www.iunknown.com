                    <span>This book was preceded in my conciousness by high critical praise and so I approached it with great expectations. And in great part it met these expectations.<p>More than anything else, this is a work of love, being the excavation of forgotten facts in the history of gay life as it was lived by decades of gay men, experiences now mostly forgotten or scattered in obscure and fading documents. It is an extraordinary work of social archeology, resurrecting a world I never knew exisited. And Chauncey does this in exceptional detail, using clear prose, so that by the end the geography of this world has been salvaged and reconstructed, like Combray from Marcel's teacup.<p>As the book proceeds, the writing becomes stronger, particularly as the facts become more readily available, and the arguments and conclusions become more convincing. The last chapter is especially good on the submergence of gay life after Prohibition. This book is clearly one of the masterpieces of gay history, on par with John Boswell's work especially in it's dependence on primary sources.<p>The only criticism I have lies in the fact that Chauncey often has trouble shaping his information and often can't create a forest out of the trees. Especially in the earlier chapters, he often fails to make a summary statement without such a host of qualifiers that you wonder why he bothers in the first place. And as a previous reviewer has noted, there are alot of repetitions that a good editor should have corrected.<p>Despite all these reservations, for those interested in discovering a lost world, this book will be a revelation.</span>

                    <span>Chauncey's book offers serious and original thinking about queer history and about general urban history as well.  Freed from the myths that have persisted about the place of homosexuals in U.S. society, the author paints a new portrait of what transpired just before the turn of the last century and into the early decades of the 20th century.<p>The most important idea he explains is that the concepts of "homosexuality" and "heterosexuality" as we understand them today didn't exist one hundred years ago.  Chauncey's research shows that it was adherence to traditional gender role, rather than choice of sex partner, that labelled a man as either a "fairy" or "normal."   The author provides detailed descriptions of the process by which working class men in particular could have sexual relations with other men and perserve a "normal" identity so long as the sex partners were effeminate.  He uses extensive supporting materials that undergird his conclusions, including accounts of the "pansies" who were not, in fact, demeaned or ostracized but instead were tolerated, courted, and may even have served a vital purpose to working men who had relocated alone to the city to support families that lived elsewhere or to make their way into adulthood.<p>Chauncey shows how the definition of "invert"-- detour from  standard gender role-- shifted gradually to the notion of "degenerate" or "homosexual"-- men who chose other men as sex partners.  He makes clear how the emerging definition of homosexuality depended on a similarly new definition of heterosexuality.  These subtle but powerful social mores are detailed at length, in convincing prose.<p>The book explains that there were places in early 20th century society for gays, countering the mistaken belief that the 1960's rebellions brought people out of the closet.  The author hints, but doesn't explicitly state, that societal needs may have some not insubstantial effect on how prominent the gay people will be in our communities, or even how many young men may experiment with homosexuality for identity, financial need, or other reasons.<p>Chauncey's prose is vivid and evocative.  He many times, especially in the early parts of the book, uses a hair-splitting preciseness with terms that can become tiresome to a reader.  He also shows an academic's obsessiveness with source material:  his book is chockful of lengthy source notes in the appendix and footnotes at the bottoms of the pages.  These practices make his work explicit for purposes of academics but also tedious for general reading.  <p>He employs other techniques that I believe weakened the impact of the reading.  Chauncey summarizes a great deal at the end of each chapter, which dilutes the momentum of his historical survey.  He is prone to repetitions of concepts and quotes.  He also divided his themes such that each chapter covers expansive times.  This has the reader continually moving back to the beginning of his chosen era, which diffuses the reader's sense of progressions over time.  My sense is that he was not able to decide if the book were to be textbook for teaching, academic document for university colleagues, or general historical account.  Nevertheless, his interesting prose, his unique perspectives,  and his strong synthetic thinking make this an important work.</span>
