                    <span>If you live a busy, hectic life and are not happy with it, then I recommend this CD. I listened to it in my car on the way to work. I had heard of FISH! in the workplace, but this CD focuses on your home life and relationships. The idea comes from the FISH! philosophy started at the famous Seattle Fish Market. The book describes the changes that one couple made after they applied the principles that they already knew so well. They realized that they could have more control over their personal lives. They wanted to live life to the fullest. The best take-home point from the CD is that "you can choose your attitude"--it is something you have control over!  </span>

                    <span>Fish ! was an exciting book that no doubt brought in a fresh perspective to light up our lives at work. Pike Place Fish Market ranks # 1  among the places that I would like to visit during my lifetime. Mary Jane , Lonnie and the kids now seem to have become a part of our own family. In this book, there is a happy homecoming for Grandma too. <p>Frankly, this book is the next logical extension of the author's first book Fish!. It brings the powerful philosophy from workplaces to our homes. Written in very simple words, the frankness and the depth of conversations between Lonnie and Mary Jane have the power to change the way we live at home. The Fish! philosophy can work wonders at home as much as it can at the workplace. <p>Read this book aloud with the family, ten pages a day and experience the joy of living . Thanks Stephen, my family joins me in thanking you for this wonderful book. We are grateful to Fish! and are committed to adopt it at home.</span>

                    <span>If this book does not inspire you to come alive and get going with your life, nothing will. And it is not some philosoper's old boring stuff; it is real life from ordinary fish mongers. It is down-to-earth information that is easily read, easily undetstood, and easy to apply to your own life. I plan to reread this little book several times a year to remind me what any person can easily do to become "great."<p>The whole idea of the Pike Place Fish Market is inspirational. If you have ever been to the market in Seattle, you will be quite inspired and maybe even a happier person right away because if it. The people who work there are inspirational. They are succeeding personally and as part of a team. They are very happy to be working where they are. They have a formula for success that is really working, and working for ordinary people. This is why they sell tons of fish on the Internet. This is why they perform training programs all over the country. This is why they sell so many books and videos and T-shirts. <p>If you do not check into this source of inspiriation you are losing out. I'm so glad I know about Fish!</span>

                    <span>This book is the latest in a string of books by this company that is very disappointing.  They capitalize on the great work the Fishmongers in Seattle do, and don't represent their real philoshophy well.  People would do better to get the Fishmonger's real book!</span>
