                <span id="Label1">The cerebral thriller <I>Codex</I> drops up-and-coming investment banker wunderkind Edward Wozny into the musty realm of medieval literature, where he finds an unexpected break from the rat race--a powerful client's commission to uncrate and organize a library. The diversion quickly becomes an obsession after he enlists the help of the quirkily attractive scholar Margaret Napier. Together they discover his employer, the mysterious Duchess of Bowmry, is in a race with her husband to locate an apocryphal codex that could destroy the Bowmry name. Meanwhile, Edward becomes engrossed in an addicting computer game that bears an uncanny similarity to the object of his search and accelerates his transformation from Wall Street wizard into shiftless dreamer. <p>  For the most part, Edward moves through his adventure merely following Margaret's dedicated lead. As each new twist unfolds, he slips further into the comforting daydream of a life that isn't his but is as thrilling as the race for the codex. <I>Codex</I> wrestles with notions of dreams and reality that commingle as Edward finds himself adrift in a sea of passionate scholars and Old World plots. In all, Lev Grossman's novel is excellent entry into the emerging genre of literary history thrillers with an added twist for the technophile. <I>--Jeremy Pugh</I></span>

                    <span>Rare books, a codex, a computer game that becomes an obsession! Wow, this book is awesome. Edward Wozny, an investment banker, who is taking a new job in England from New York, becomes enmeshed in a quest to find a rare book by Gervase of Langford...a codex that may cause upheaval in the house of the Duke and Duchess Went of Bowmry. We never know if the codex is a fake or reality. He enlists the help of a young graduate student, Margaret, who may be with him or against him. He plays a computer game, MOMUS, that takes him to sites that are scarily related to events in his life. Only at the very end will you find out the answers to all these mind-boggling questions. A<BR>most entertaining book, especially for lovers of rare books.<BR> PS...two books in one week with the title CODEX...also read<BR>"The Codex" by Douglas Preston...another awesome read!!!</span>

                    <span>At a loss how to occupy himself during a two-week vacation before his transfer to London, whiz-kid banker Edward Wozny obeys a summons from some eccentric, titled clients - the Duke and Duchess of Bowmry. Although outraged to discover they want him - an acknowledged financial wunderkind - to organize their moldy old books, he finds himself oddly intrigued.<P>Before he quite knows what he's done, he's agreed to catalog the books - something he knows nothing about, and to look for a 14th century tome by Gervase of Langford, someone he's never heard of.<P>Before the day is out, Edward takes on another unaccustomed activity - computer gaming. A college friend foists the disk on him and while it's not an activity that has ever appealed, Edward becomes hooked by the unusually vivid graphics, losing swaths of time in the game's strange landscape.<P>The Langford codex soon becomes the focal point of his daytime world. His search takes him to a rare-book repository where he meets the serious and possibly attractive young medievalist Margaret Napier, whose Langford thesis has bogged down in the tedious obscurity of the man. She reacts frostily to Edward's ignorant query - the book he seeks does not exist. It's an 18th century fabrication, she tells him, " a sensational and occasionally salacious allegorical journey culminating in a mystical vision of the end of the world."<P>Nevertheless, she succumbs to the lure of the search, which becomes increasingly convoluted, romantic, mysterious and threatening as they delve deeper into the arcane world of books and intrigue. In his spare moments, Edward plunges into the computer game. The apocalyptic world it - or he - is creating begins to bear some startling resemblance to his real world activities and strangely echoes the codex he seeks.<P>Grossman's witty, atmospheric prose draws the reader into a vivid surreal world, in which it's possible to believe that ambitious young bankers lose themselves in ancient texts and seductive computer games, and old books can reach through centuries to affect the fortunes of modern dynasties. The finely tuned characters have elusive depths and the booklore, fascinating in itself, fits seamlessly into the plot. Grossman, book critic for "Time" magazine, delivers a literary thriller to stand with the best.</span>

                    <span>As I read this book I kept turning each page feeling the potential that at some point I would become engaged in the story, but it never materialized. None the characters are ever fully developed. I never felt like I was rooting for Edward Wozny, the young investment banker turned medieval book sleuth, or developed any emotion against the antagonist, a super-wealthy aristocrat who everyone says is a jerk. The plot tends to drag on without any real drama, never hooking the reader in to the story. There is quite a story-line investment in Edward playing a dream-like computer game called MOMUS. I kept wondering how the game would tie into the rest of the story, but was left disappointed when it finally occurred. He never is given the chance to apply what he learns from the game about being a hero. Even Edward's love-interest comes across awkwardly and is never fully developed. As the reader limps into the ending, he or she is left with a bit of a hollow feeling that mirrors the development of the characters and the plot. Calling this a thriller is a bit of an exaggeration. Lev Grossman shows promise as a young author, but he should have taken one or two more stabs at the plot and characters to make this a more compelling novel.</span>

                    <span>Okay, here are the issues:<BR> The lead character, Edward Wozny, has the depth of a gum wrapper. There is barely a character there at all. We are told he has made more money than God, but he seems devoid of understanding even the simplest human responses.<BR> The premise, that life is imitating a computer game, is intriguing, but can't sustain any dramatic tension. There's a point near the end where the energy virtually hisses out of the novel -- and the ending reminds me of the worst of John Grisham. You know, the "all books have to end, and here's as good a place as any" ending.<BR> The biggest issue is that it reads self-consciously like a screenplay. Grossman evidently sees a movie in this, and it is episodically visual. But like bad movies, there are points where you simply can't ask for too much logic -- the plot can't offer it. You find yourself asking again and again, "But, why...?" And then finally you realize there is no why. I can see this becoming a movie -- what I can't picture is it becoming a successful movie.<BR> So, is the book a film-wanna-be? A computer game gone madly awry? Revenge of the Computer Geeks? Or slacker on the brink of self-revelation? Sorry, it succeeds at none of these. The best that can be said is that it is not-particularly-strenuous beach reading.</span>

                    <span>A Codex is the earliest form of book. That is a series of pages sewn together, usually with a spine and a cover. The codex form replaced the scroll as the most common form of manuscript in the early Christian period.<P>Lev Grossman uses this as center stage in this book about a mystery in three parts: the codex itself, the computer game, the character.<P>The character is interesting as he is an ordinary person, not a bibliophile. But as he delves further into the manuscript he becomes adicted (as all of us visiting this web site probably are).<P>The computer game seems to be an analogy of the book. I can sit and read for hours, engrossed in a novel or a history. My son cannot, but give him a computer game and he gets the same glassy eyed look.<P>Finally there's the Codex itself. An ancient manuscript that may or may not exist, and I'll leave that part to you.</span>
