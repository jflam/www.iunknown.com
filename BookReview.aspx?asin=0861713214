                <span id="Label1">If you'd like to read about meditation and then go back to your regular life, don't get this book. Henepola Gunaratana, a monk from Sri Lanka and venerated teacher of Buddhism, warns us that vipassana meditation is "meant to revolutionize the whole of your life experience." In one of the best nuts-and-bolts meditation manuals, he lays out the fundamentals of basic Buddhist meditation, the how, what, where, when, and why, including common problems and how to deal with them. His 52 years as a Buddhist monk make <I>Mindfulness in Plain English</I> an authority on a living tradition, and his years of teaching in America and elsewhere give it the clarity and straightforwardness that has made it so popular. If you'd like to learn the <I>practice</I> of meditation, you can't do better. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>  This book is an outstanding piece on how to be mindful. Completely mindful! For those with any doubts, this will clear up any questions along the line of "what will mindfulness do for me?" or "why meditate?". Selfish questions we all have. But as far as I know, have never been tackled so completely and directly as in this book. 
<br />
<br />  Henepola Gunaratana is so thorough and qualified to be teaching this stuff. You will bring out of these pages a complete understanding of mindfulness and its role in life and meditation. Obviously you will want to eventually bring the illuminating rays of pure mindfulnes/meditation to all aspects of your life. Henepola will help give you the confidence to feel you can make this great spiritual progress. And even though things will always go wrong, this book will help you learn that problems are invaluable learning tools when it comes to "waking up". That is if you just watch with "pure awareness!". Just step back, dont meddle and experience with pure awareness, all those troublesome thoughts, feelings and emotions. That is how you see they are transient phantoms that have no power over you. This is liberation, completely openness. Not supression. No one teaches this better than Henepola Gunaratana. 
<br />
<br />  Henepola also clears up the fact that some people think mediation is to stop thoughts. It's NOT. It's about becoming more aware of your mental universe. This is more about being a compassionately creative and open being, who deals with problems head on without fear or rejection. Rather than a robot who cant feel or think anything out of its programming range. 
<br />  
<br />   This book is much more than a meditation guide. It's more than just another "buddhism book". I bought it for the vipassana instructions, but got a whole lot more. If there was a must read list for the world this would be on it. This book is for anyone.

<br />This is the book which brought my meditation practice into focus and brought me to Theravadan Buddhism. I first read it just after it was published in the early 90s. I have reread it several times since, each time gaining more insight - literally and figuratively. I cannot make the claim that it will have the same effect on you, but as the Buddha might say, try it and see for yourself.
<br />
<br />I like the precision of Bhante G's writing. This work is far more than a transcript of spoken discourses, like many contemporary Buddhist books. It is specifically created to be read, absorbed, reflected upon and practiced.
<br />
<br />When I come across a work that effects me so strongly, inevitably I wonder if the writer is as good as his word. I traveled to West Virginia to sit with Bhante G and the other monks and lay people at his monastery. As intellectually stimulating as his book is, sitting with him in the meditation hall was sublime. The man is a true living Buddhist master. He's a great writer too. Read his books.</span>

                    <span>Having meditated for over 30 years and having digested many books and teachings, I must say that the venerable monk has really done a great job!  This book is for the novice and for the long term practictioner.  I was delightfully humbled and learned as much as I have ever learned about meditation.  HOwever, please don't read this quickly.......digest it, read a few pages every day or so, and practice!  You will find a wonderful combination of great fun and serious self-work.</span>
