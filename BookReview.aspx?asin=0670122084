                    <span>This is the most detailed book I have found on Elephants. It not only informs you all about the elephants history, it tells you all about the Authors many many years living with them and getting to know each one personally. You are glued to the pages and will not want to put it down. It is so captivating that you actually feel as if you are there with the Douglas-Hamilton family. You become involved with each elephant's life. How they are each an individual just like us. How each has their own personality. This is riviting !!! There are parts that you will laugh with, and cry with, as well. If this does not touch your heart, does not open your eyes to the beauty of one of God's most magnificent creatures put on this earth, and enlighten you to the desperate need to help protect these wonderful animals, then this is not the book for you. I highly recommend this for all ages. A MUST read for anyone who loves elephants!!</span>

                    <span>In the late sixties and early seventies of the former century, young biologist Ian Douglas-Hamilton set out to study the elephants around Lake Manyara in Tanzania. He learned to distinguish each individual by such characteristics as the tusks, ears or (ear) markings. This approach would later on aid Cynthia Moss with her elephant research at Amboseli. When Ian met the energetic Oria Rocco he fell in love with her and she would lend her hand to his studies and provided the wonderful photographs in this book. Among the elephants is not a scientific study but more a highly personal account of a family who lived with elephants. The Douglas-Hamiltons care deeply about the elephants and truly became their champions (they still battle for the elephants). They instilled love and respect for elephants in their two daughters as well. Among the elephants is an idyl of humans and elephants living together quite peacefully. I certainly can't forget the gentle Virgo with whom the Douglas-Hamiltons shared a unique bond or the matriach Boadicea.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the greatest pieces on elephants ever read, the pace is swift and makes you not want to put the book down. I have always have been interested in elephants and read everything I could on them, and one day last summer I saw "Among the Elephants" at a small library in a suburb of my town, and before I returned it I had read it twice. The book was so good that I wanted to read it many more times, so instead of constantly checking it out I decided to buy it, so others could read it. This book was wonderful and should be read by anyone who wishes to work with elephants, or by those that just want a good book to read.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitally my favorite book ever! I have loved elephants for a long time. I thought that I had no intrest in non-fiction books until I read this book. I started renting it from the library, and I continued to rent it until I was more than half way through the book. At that point my dad bought it off amazon.com. This book is full of facinating facts on elephants, and the writers, Oria Hamilton and Iain Douglas are two favorite non-fiction authors. Iain Douglas has made me want to be an elephant biologist. The book is almost like a fiction book in that it is so exciting.</span>
