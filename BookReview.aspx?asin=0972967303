                    <span>I read Rita's book first and I had a big mess in my head about PMP. Then I read this book - a huge difference!!! Mr. Crowe's writing style is excellent; the book is very easy and fun to read...and most importantly, it is the BEST source for the exam prep. 
<br />In my experience, his final exam in the book is a lot like the actual test (except for several questions that will throw in there to make sure you do not score 100%).
<br />If you are choosing between this one and Rita's, choose this one. However, it is better to study from several sources.
<br />Great book!!!</span>

                    <span>I read the book two times (cover to cover), took all exams (at the end of each chapter and the final one) and was able to pass the exam the first time.  Yeah!!!!!!!! The PMBOK guide is also helpful as a reference.  Certified PMP 2/9/2005.

                    <span>I cleared my pmp exam on my first try yesterday.  As you know, PMBOK is a reference instead of a textbook.  It is very useful, but definitely not a good starting point to learn about the PMI methodology.  I knew I have to turn to other sources, which eventually lead to a procurement process.  My requirement is very clear, I need some materials which can enable me to clear the exam ASAP (i.e. a short payback period).  The specifications of the materials are as follows:
<br />
<br />1. Explain everything straight-forward, so that I can capture the key points immediately
<br />2. Light in weight, so that I can carry it around
<br />3. Without lengthy-case to confuse me, so that I can focus on PMI methodology and principles, not the background information of other companies
<br />
<br />According to the comments (expert judgements) here, I "procured" two text books, one by Andy Crowe and another by Rita Mulcahy, the two most popular reference books about PMP.  Two books were studied instead of one as I'm not sure whether one book is adequate or not, two books can mitigate the risk, the "unknown-unknown".  
<br />
<br />I finished both within one month and was fully satisfied with their contents.  Their only drawback is, the exercises provided are much easier than the actual exam. But I don't blame on the authors because the objective of these questions is let you verify your understanding (inspection).  I checked the questions I missed and clarified my misunderstandings steadily (progressive elaboration).  PMBOK is helpful in this stage to provide the official definition of key items.  We all know that PMP means Project Management Professional, but it also means Practice Make Perfect.  I passed my PMP exam (objectives achieved) as promised by Andy :)  Based on the score sheet, I understand that I have some weak areas where I need "continuous improvement". Unlike PMI methodology, there is no closing process in learning. We have many similar idioms in Chinese. 
<br />
<br />I've cleared the PMP exam on first try with both books.  But I still believe that, the critical success factor to pass the exam does not lie on the tools only, but also the methodology how you prepared the exam.  There should be many other textbooks available which can help.  I am just lucky enough to use some of them.  </span>

                    <span>I passed the PMP exam this morning on my first try.  Thanks to this book and Rita Mulcahy's Exam Prep, I passed it with a wide margin.  This is my favorite of the two as it gets to the point and really focuses on the key concepts in each knowlege area.  I would recommend that you start out with this book as it gives you a good foundation without drowning you with minutia!  Then switch to Rita's book to add the polish and finer details. 
<br />
<br />The questions at the end of each chapter and the Final Exam in the book was a good representation of the actual exam.  I really like the fact that Andy added a totally different final exam and didn't reuse any questions from the chapters.  In this regard, this book was far above Rita's book.
<br />
<br />Summary:  No regrets at all about buying this book. Will keep it as a quick reference at work.  </span>
