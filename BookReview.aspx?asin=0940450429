                    <span>Unlike the political commentators of the late 20th and early 21st century (watchers of Sunday public affairs programs and AM radio listeners know who they are), the commentators of the 18th century actually had something of substance to say.  This was a time when education was rare, but when done was done well.  The New American Library does its usual exceptional job in assembling the material in this book including some of the more important selections from the Federalist Papers as well as some of the writings of the anti-Federalists.  Here the role of the government and the nature of freedom are really explored.  Life was better before politics became about feeling and emotion.  Every American should read this book, but only if he wants to really understand the basis of the American experiment.</span>

                    <span>Study of the Federalist Papers, of course included in this two volume series, is a conduit for understanding the American ethic. When the Federalist Papers are viewed as included in this chronological deliberation between the Federalists and Antifederalists, they become even more profound than the enormous depth they can achieve when read alone. The concerns of Brutus and Agrippa are answered, the repititive call for a 'Bill of Rights' revealed. Madison wrote to Jefferson in 1825 defining the Federalist Papers as  'may fairly enough be regarded as the most authentic exposition of the text of the federal constituion, as understood by the Body which prepared & the authority which accepted it.'   The enormous insight gained from tracking the arguments and concerns of the proposed Constituion , and the responses of the Federalist cannot be easily estimated, yet the result is a much more informed conscience of the American experience.  Madison in the same letter mentioned above stated that Federalist Essays did not foresee all the misconstructions which to that date had occured, nor prevent some it did foresee. For the concerned and deliberate citizen of today many of these issues remain, issues such as Federalism are current topics and all too often the opinions of the few become the conscience of the many, examining these volume will do much to alleviate this vexing condition. More alarming is the realization that many of the fears of the Antifederalists have become a reality in todays polity.   An excellent and comprehensive collection thank you Bernard Bailyn.</span>

                    <span>Editor Bernard Bailyn has assembled a first-rate collection of letters, circulars, pamphlets, speeches, and what would be the colonial equivalent of modern op-ed pieces that allows today's readers to witness the founding  of a government through the eyes of (and with the voices of) those who were  really there.  But don't be fooled into thinking this is going to be the  stilted, polite prose that often belongs to 18th century philosophers or  debaters.  Many of the pieces Bailyn has selected are remakrkably spry and  teeming with understated wit.<p>Those who think that mud-slinging, negative  campaigning, and assaults on the integrity of the opponent are modern day  creations may be surprised to see that those in the 18th century could be  just as nitpicky, petty, and ascerbic as their present day decendants --  and yet still remain surprisingly gentlemanly about the whole thing.  Some  letter writers absolutely seethe with irritation at their opposition, and  by presenting his debaters in roughly chronological order, Bailyn ensures  that for every "Oh yeah?" uttered by a Federalist, there will  soon be a responsive "Yeah!" from the anti-Federalist side.  It  all makes for lively and informative reading, and one wonders if such a  critical debate could be carried out with such manners in today's  media.<p>It should come as no surprise that most of the  Hamilton-Madison-Jay Federalist Papers are in here, as are the  level-headed, persuasive anti-Federalist arguments of James Wilson and  George Mason.  But the real jewels in these volumes lie in the thoughtful  and frank correspondence that passed back and forth between not only the  Major Players, but also between some of the lesser-known writers, who make  their cases for or against the Constitution with genuine passion and  conviction.<p>Bailyn wisely leaves the spin to the writers themselves, but  when he does step in, Bailyn is a most helpful editor, and the final 240  pages contain short biographies of every writer (or letter recipient) in  the book, an informative chronology of events (and Bailyn makes sure  readers have a perspective for the debates in this book by starting the  chronology in 1774, some 13 years before the first words in this book were  spoken), and competent notes on the text to help readers unfamiliar with  some of the players or events keep everything sorted out.<p>Even though we  all have the luxury of knowing that Everything Came Out All Right In The  End -- the Constitution was ratified -- there is still quite a bit of drama  here, particularly in the debates in the State Ratifying Conventions, which  are carried out with suitable handwringing and bluster on both sides.   Appropriately, then, the final piece in here is the dramatic speech the  previously skeptical John Hancock delivered in the Massachusetts  convention, informing his colleagues he would, indeed, vote for  ratification.  Hancock's words are as stirring now as they were then -- but  I'll let you read them for yourself.<p>If you have the opportunity,  purchase both Volume I and Volume II together.  Not only will you get the  complete debates (Volume I ends in February 1788; volume II is needed to  make it to August), but you'll also get one of the Library of America's  typically attractive slip-cases.  It's a little more expensive, but worth  it.</span>

                    <span>Part one opens with Benjamin Franklin's speech at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, September 17,1787. Two pages long, this speech and all the others that follow, are short, easy to read and in tolerably modern english. Both sides of the argument are presented, not just the federalist opinion but also the anti-federalist.
Many concerns the anti-federalist writers had have proven true. We have created an aristocracy. We do have trouble with our standing peace time army being used to oppress the citizenry. Thank God they had the forsight to require the inclusion of a written bill of rights.
