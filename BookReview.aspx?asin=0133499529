                    <span>It goes into great detail about the smallest parameters for SCSI (and other types of disks), RAID architectures, memory and bus timing and much more. Learn why RAID may not be the best means of getting faster disk access. Figure out when you *shouldn't* upgrade that old server in favor of that shiny new one. Most explanations and suggestions are backed up with plenty of real-world data and graphs. It's goal is to help administrators get the most from what they've got and how to scale and appropriately purchase what they want. A very thorough and technical book, and it's rather current (Ultra Enterprise servers are covered throughout). In addition, it details (much) older systems and their architectures. Highly recommended reading for database, system, and web server admins.</span>

                    <span>Brian Wong has written an extremely useful book. <BR> In the first part he shows techniques for analysing the more common types of servers that exist in the UNIX enviroment. Among the types are the NFS server, the Web server and the RDBMS server. Although Mr. Wong is brisk in his treatment of this material, he sucessfully imparts the flavor of the "back of the envelope" calculations that are most useful in the real world.
<P>
The second part of the book is a deeper look at the issues associated with Sun bus architectures, disk subsystems including a good discussion of RAID, backup subsystems, and aspects of the Solaris kernel. Much of this material can be generalized to other vendors by relating published benchmark results of these vendors to the comparable published Sun benchmark results. The Solaris Kernel material was valuable in it's discussion of UFS file system which are widely found in most SVR4 variants.
 <P>
 All in all this is a book that deserves a spot on your bookshelf next to the more formal mathematical treatments of this subject. You'll find yourself reaching for it when you need to write up some quick and dirty analysis to justify a purchase request or to provide a quick estimate of what kind of hardware you'll need to support the next big project your company comes up with.</span>

                    <span>Some of the basics are still relevant but this book could use some updating since 1997. Also more information on how to figure out how the servers are performing would be nice.</span>

                    <span>Yes, like the other reviewers I'd like to see a new edition where the examples are based more on things like 36 GB 10k rpm disks instead of 9 GB 7200 rpm disks. The chapters on how the SCSI bus really works, how a disk stores data, what really happens when you use NFS, and how raid works were eye openers for me. Sure some of the topics are a bit out of date but this is a great starting point on your path towards total performance enlightenment.</span>
