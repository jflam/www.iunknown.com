                    <span>Kevin Holland Crossley's King of the Middle March left me wondering. I absolutely loved the first two books, but King of the Middle March is....a bit dull. I never cared for the stories inside the stone, and this book takes away for Arthur de Caldicot's life experiences...the chapters about King Arthur are longer than those of our young narrator. I wanted to know: What's going to happen to Gatty? Will Serle ever return?? Will Serle marry Tanwen? Will Arthur marry Winnie? Will Arthur marry Gatty? Will Arthur ever be happy if he doesn't marry Winnie or Gatty?? Will Arthur ever get Bonamy back? And will Arthur ever see his little friend Bertie again??....many unanswered questions..I read quickly because I was eager to see what would happend with Arthur's life in the Middle March. On the topic of Arthur's mother, I like the way it ended...but everything else...was slightly disappointing. This story felt very rushed towards the end of the book. Mr. Kevin Holland-Crossley's first two books were excellent, but the third doesn't quite live up to it predessesors as most books don't.</span>

                    <span>I read both other books in the trilogy and was pretty eager to read the 3rd. It was to me, boring. I read about half untill I got distracted by another book and forgot all about this one. I returned it to the library and I haven't wondered about the ending at all.
<br />
<br />If you did not read the other books you'll probably be very confused and bored reading this one. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it which is very unusual for me. 
<br />
<br />I didn't enjoy it.  </span>

                    <span>  This story begins with our young squire Arthur beginning his long journey to the Holy Land on the crusades with Lord Stephen.  From there, we spend about 100 pages sitting around Saint Nicholas, talking about the foot soldiers being dirty swine, and doing a generally large amount of nothing, with small bursts of fairly interesting parts, that I will not name so as not to spoil it for those who have not read the book.
<br />
<br />  Arthur still has his seeing stone, where things are going on with King Arthur not so swimmingly as in the last book.  Here the knights are beginning the quests for the Holy Grail.
<br />
<br />  Those of you hoping Merlin would pop up in the book fairly often will be dissapointed, but rest assured that he is still in the book.
<br />
<br />  Warfare and sprigs of info from the Authurian legends.  I admit that there were small sections of the book that I enjoyed, but sadly, they were outnumbered by rather large boring and over explanatory sections.  That is why I rate this book with a glowing three stars.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited to read the final book in the trilogy, only to be disappointed. The story didn't keep my attention, but I kept going because I wanted to see what would happen to the characters. The ending wasn't horrible but, I was left with questions. I want to know what will happen to Serle and will Arthur ever see Gatty again? Will Arthur marry Winnie? Everything felt rushed. I don't think Crossley-Holland took the time he should have to end the trilogy. And did anybody else notice that the first book was actually quite funny, while the other two were not?</span>

                    <span>The first two of this set were interesting and intriguing. "What will happen next" was constantly a thought. Any reader would wonder how the two Arthur's worlds would intersect, what would happen to our protagonist. This third book, by a respected and experienced children's author, is simply a time server, an incomplete story to fill a deadline. None of the story lines have any sort of climax; they just end. Lazy writing: quite frustrating to anyone who cares about books.</span>
