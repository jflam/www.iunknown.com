                    <span>I found The Art of Facilitation to be an easy-to-read, complete guide in helping to better understand facilitation.  I suggest that every beginner facilitator should read this.  The authors wrote it specifically outlined and detailed, yet not too complicated. It is a good book to keep close by as a quick reference source. The breakdown of the book allows it to be a wonderful training guide complete with a toolkit to assist your every need of facilitation.</span>

                    <span>The Art of Facilitation is written in simple language. It cuts through the academic tendency to complicate this domain, and in doing so displays the authors mastery of it.  <p>The Art of Facilitation elucidates what it takes  to facilitate groups powerfully and provides pathways, tools and processes  for this.<p>This book will provide people new to facilitation with an  intellectual analysis of it and old hands clear pathways to doing complex  things simply.  I use it all the time as a resource in my pratice as a  professional facilitator and it is the required text in facilitator  training courses which I lead for Zenergy.<p>I would also recommend Hunter  et al's other books: Co-operacy, The Zen of Groups, The Essence of  Facilitation.</span>

                    <span>The Art of Facilitation is a must read for new facilitators or trainers. It is easy to read and offers practical advice and activities for newcomers to the field of facilitation. This is one of the few facilitation books to  offer a chapter on facilitating yourself. Not as advanced as other  facilitation books (Masterful Facilitation or Facilitator's Guide to  Particiapatory Decision Making) but recommend this as part of any  facilitator's library of resources.</span>

                    <span>I have found this book a great resource to augment the training of first  time facilitators and coaches.  It provides many practical exercises, with  numerous tips that help to demystify facilitation and increase the first  time facilitator's success.</span>
