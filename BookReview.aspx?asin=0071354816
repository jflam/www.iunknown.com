                    <span>Those who think Jack Welch is such a visionary should think again since in my opinion he cost the company billions. In the eighties I was involved in General Electric's GEnie which was the #3 online system online community with a very loyal customer base. AOL had not existed at the time. GEnie had a chance to dominate the online market because it had the knowledge and expertise at the time and a very loyal community. I remember one infamous meeting when I stood up and said basically "it's the Internet stupid." My comments went over like a lead balloon and basically the executives said ok any other questions and went on as if I had not made a statement at all. With just a few thousand dollars GEnie could have been one of the first to emphasize Internet access but GEnie was short-sighted with little or incorrect guidance from Jack Welch who supposedly was engaged in GEnie. With a very small capital infusion GEnie could have been the #1 online system. Where was Jack's six sigma? Make a long story short, GEnie never got real support from Jack just talk. The death knell for GEnie was when one infamous weekend the online resources were pulled to run some back office accounting program and thus denying online access to its GEnie customers. The customers weren't even informed why they couldn't access their email and never any apology. Where was Jack Welch? GEnie quietly faded away after that. Why haven't the hotshot investigated reporters reported this part of GE and Jack's history?

                    <span>This book is quite simply, horrible.  I could overlook the fact that it assumes the reader just graduated first grade, if the ideas, methods and tools were any good.  Reading this book, I have to believe GE got where it did in spite of Jack Welch, not because of him.  These are not the concepts that revolutionize a business.  The first great idea offered? An employee suggestion program.  Wow, thanks.  An entire book could be written on the futility of such efforts.  Employees can't change the bad systems they are trapped in.  Then we get the 4 E's.  This is Jack Welch's idea that all managers in the organization must posess four ingredients: energy, be an energizer, edge, execution.  Anyone familiar with Myers-Briggs, or True Colors personality type methodologies will see that Welch is basically saying he's after one personality type (I'll let you guess which one).  This is nuts.  The strive should be for diversity in personality types, especially on a leadership team.  A good mix of idea people, action people, detail people, people who care about people, etc.  And on that topic - caring about people, I hope the Jack Welch way doesn't become "the way".  The ideas presented here about performance appraisals and forced distributions are not only stupid they are inhumane.  I would refer you to the fine book "Abolishing Performance Appraisals" by Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins for a more enlightened view on people and performance.  <p>The stuff about six sigma is not bad, although I'm not a big believer that you can problem-solve your way to excellence.  It is possible to make entirely defect-free that which you should not be making at all. <p>In short, skip this book.  The ideas are nothing new, and in many cases wrong, and the tools and illustrations are too simplistic to be of value.</span>

                    <span>The text of this book could be reduced to 20% its original size if the author addressed the reader as a competent, intelligent manager. Instead, it's filled with cute pictures and 'how to's' I've heard the GE Way is good; don't opt for the Fieldbook.</span>

An easy read that is filled with key information to turn any company into an industry leader and any manager into a corporate leader.  This book details everything a manager will ever need to know.  A MUST BUY !!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I wish I had purchased the hardcopy.  Ebooks have a long way to go!  I have a laptop and a desktop but there is no way to share this between the two devices.  Also, I can't tell how to back this up and restore it if my hard drive crashes.  When I'm done with it, I can't give it to someone else.  The bookmarking and highlighting is kind of cool, but nothing you can't do with a paper copy.  I'm very unimpressed.  I'm really regretting that I bought this in electronic format!</span>
