                    <span>In the book Keesha's House , the main character, Keesha, is more than a teenager; she acts like an adult, and she is generous, kind and supportive. The other characters are Katie, Harris, Dontay, Jason, Carmen, Stephie, and Tobias, teenagers who work hard to meet their basic needs.  The teenagers who are at Keesha's house have a common situation in their lives; they are neglected by their parents. They spend time at Keesha's house, the only place they trust.  Even though there are some conflicts that hold them back, they never miss a day of school or work, and they are kind to each other. Their lives are not great compared to some teenagers who live with their parents but they manage to live. They feel welcome and comfortable at Keesha's house.  More mature than their age, they support themselves and comfort each other. Their life experiences orient them to be courageous and more grown up than most teens.  I strongly recommend that you read this book.</span>

                    <span>	Why do kids have to figure their own problems when someone should be there to help them? In the novel, Keesha's House, the author uses the characters as a version of kids that we see in our everyday life.  This book, in my point of view, should be highly recommended because it deals with kids in our society today and their issues.  It is good to know what is going on in this world with our kids.   
<br />	 
<br />	I think that this book is a must read.   It made me stop and think about myself.  I wondered how I would end up if my mother was never there for me.  It really reminds me of the people that were there for me in addition to my mother.  The best audience of this book would be teenagers, and also highly recommended for adults.  If you have kids, it will give you a better understanding on what they want and their needs.   This book gives an overview about what is happening in this world today with our sons, daughters, and also parents.  It explains that with the struggle with our everyday life, you will always need someone there.

                    <span>       Keesha's House is a brilliantly put-together story about seven individuals who are struggling through a period of their teenage years. The book relates to situations that teens face today in the real world. Every character feels lost and has trouble finding their place in the world. They all struggle with two things in common: what or where they consider home and who they can trust. 
<br />
<br />	Keesha, the main character, holds one thing that is key to all the others in the book who are going through struggles. That is the idea that her house is sanctuary for the others. Everyone feels wanted and in place at Keesha's house, the house that is "set back off the street" (103).  Each character has a quality that one of the other characters is lacking and is in search of. At Keesha's house, the characters complete the circle by gaining and exchanging qualities such as hope, compassion, and trust. 
<br />
<br />	I recommend strongly that this book be taken into consideration for reading. I especially recommend it to teenagers who are feeling doubts in their lives and cannot find where they belong in this world. Even though the book has made-up characters, the story paints a clear picture of serious teenage situations in the real world. Keesha's House serves as a reminder that you are not alone and there are millions of others out there who are struggling too.

                    <span>I really liked this book because of the life situations that happened in the book. Normally I don't like the set up of a book going from character to character just explaining what they are feeling and what they think because it confuses me, but i really did like this one. I like the way it seems so realistic. It made me think of how these situatuations really do happen to people in the real world and I just wanted to reach into the book and help the troubled teens out and just talk to them. I guess I will have to say my favorite charater was Keesha because of the way she had to do with helping out the teens even though the house wasn't her own. I really like this book and would recommend it to other people to read!</span>

                    <span>Years ago, young Keesha ran away from home, from her verbally abusive, alcoholic father.  Since then, she has found comfort in the home of a local resident, Joe, who had a large house and an even larger heart.  Joe provided Keesha with a roof over her head and a fresh start in life.  Now it's Keesha's turn to give back.  As she meets young people in trouble, she invites them to Joe's house, so that they may have a chance to sort out life's problems.  Though unconventional and not in line with the state's plans for runaways, Keesha's solution is helping many local teenagers, including Stephanie who is pregnant, Dontay, who is a runaway from foster care, and Harris, a young man whose family will not accept that he is gay.  We eventually watch these characters meet and learn from each other.  The tragic ending serves to remind us that there's not always a happy ending, but success comes from making the most of your life.<p>Helen Frost has created a wise and thoughtful character in young Keesha; however, she's not perfect, which makes her more believable and more likeable.  When Stephanie is accepted back into her parents' home despite her pregnancy, Keesha's comments reflect the jealousy you'd expect from a 14-year-old who always hoped that her own father would come looking for her.  All poems in the book are written in sestinas and sonnets, and each contains multicultural references that will connect the readers to the characters and their environment. The situations are real and prevalent in society, and even though they're sometimes uncomfortable to talk about and read about, young readers from ages 15 on up will appreciate each character's candid, poetic narration.</span>
