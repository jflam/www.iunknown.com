                <span id="Label1">Too many writers of books about software let the software determine how they organize the material. If the File menu contains commands A, B, and C, the writers put A, B, and C in the same chapter, regardless of whether they're functionally similar. <I>AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual</I> is organized more logically, tackling the functional units--including Internet integration, macro programming, and table creation, among others--in separate chapters. It's an approach that makes sense for AppleWorks, in which the spreadsheet module can be used to create tables for word processor documents and all the modules rely on a common graphics editor. For those who want to know what a particular menu command does, there's menu-by-menu documentation in an appendix.<p>  You get the requisite instructions: explicit steps to follow if you want to transpose rows in a spreadsheet, for example, or export button graphics for use in Web pages. Other procedures, like making calculations that refer to cells in multiple spreadsheets, are explained in text. "Workaround Workshop" modules call attention to shortcomings in AppleWorks (such as its two-palette limit when you're working with colors) and explain how to get around them (use a custom palette). Throughout, the instructions are engaging and fun to read. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> AppleWorks 6, the multipurpose office-productivity suite for Mac OS; the suite's capabilities, comprehensively--including word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, databases, and presentations; how to create documents and databases from scratch, as well as from existing materials. </span>

                    <span>I have used Appleworks since it was Clarisworks 4, then Appleworks 5, and now 6.  I love this program with it's ability to drag and drop between the Word Processing, Database, Spreadsheet, Graphics, Drawing and Painting. I create all of my fliers, newsletters, etc. with it. You can create slide shows and presentations, too.
<br />
<br />This is a great book for anyone who already uses Appleworks, or would like to learn. It truly is "The book that should have been in the box" as the subtitle indicates. It is full of step by step instructions for understanding each part of the application. It has plenty of graphics to show you what it should look like and what your menu choices are. 
<br />
<br />The layout is easy to read cover to cover, or to skim for tips and tricks. The index and table of contents make it easy to find what you're looking for.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book for beginners or veteran Appleworks users. From O'Reilly Books, it is one of the Missing Manual Series which you can always count on to be helpful. </span>

                    <span>Had to get this book because Appleworks comes on Apple's stuff and you may as well get up the energy to use it instead of spending MEGA-dollars on Microsoft Office for the MAC. Why get a MAC so you can buy Microsoft stuff - get windows and run it there.  The book is well written and actually covers the things I needed, for example: label generation, integration of graphics and spreadsheets, etc.  Excellent index and table of contents, which are features on which so many books fall short.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to your book, AppleWorks 6, I am, for the first time ever, understanding how to create a database. Your chapter on that subject is suburb. It is easy to read, takes me carefully through each step, informs me of the quirks I might encounter and offers such a deep look into the program that I can see its application to a lot of my projects. I actually feel successful at setting up the complex database I am creating for my research.</span>

                    <span>Why is AppleWorks 6 popular in classrooms and small businesses?<p>AppleWorks 6 has a word processing, graphics, database, web design, spreadsheet, and slide-show functions in a single, integrated application. Plus, it comes free with your iMac and eMac computers.<p>Like a good Swiss Army knife, AppleWorks 6 has a smart interface design and  smooth integration with various AppleWorks 6 modules. Plus, it's accompanied by templates, art libraries, and fonts--and no printed instructions. AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual is the book that should have been in the box. <p>Pages Worth Bookmarking<p>Page 279 -  Clippings Artist in a Box<p>Page 310 Replacing the Font Menu with Buttons<p>Pages 365-366  MacLinkPlus, importance of RTF and Appleworks 6.1 (in Mac OS X, 6.2) You are eligible for the Missing Manual Discount at 60% off the street price for  MacLinkPlus.<p>Page 394 - Properties, Compact filing card.<p>Page 395 - AppleWorks 6 Macros under Mac OS X cannot be created or played.<p>Page 397 - Script Menu<p>Page 441 - Colophon<p>The authors regret that they did not write their book in AppleWorks 6. The blame goes to the publishing industry staffers and the mistaken premise that Adobe Pagemaker 6.5 accepts nothing but Microsoft Word.<p>Personal Observation<p>RTF (Rich Text Format) is the "Rosetta Stone" needed for translating word documents to Mac OS programs and Windows non word applications such as Microsoft Works. Note: Adobe PageMaker 6.5 for the Mac works very well with RTF (Rich Text Format).<p>Pro Reaction<p>The authors place emphasis AppleWorks 6 interface, its Internet hooks, the Starting Points window, and the Presentation module.<p>Part by part coverage. The early chapters delve very deeply into the six core AppleWorks modules, including 85 pages on the word processor alone.<p>Power tools. Much of AppleWorks's power comes from its macros, templates, assistants, customizable Button bar, and web-based clip-art libraries.<p>Document exchange. File import and export transfers.<p>Troubleshooting. The authors freely acknowledge the AppleWorks's program's weaknesses--and offer work around solutions.<p>Con Reaction<p>Missing was a Quick Table of Contents. Also, missing was saving files into Microsoft Word documents as RTF (Rich Text Format). <p>Missing was the mentioning of Spreadsheet Menus on page viii of the Table of Contents Appendixes (should have between Word Processing Menus and Database Menus).<p>Final Words<p>AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual  treats AppleWorks as a serious productive tool. AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual shows the Mac user how to get the most out  AppleWorks. The manual has over 250 illustrations, a 2,000-entry index, and a menu-by-menu explanation of every command.</span>
