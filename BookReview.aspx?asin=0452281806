                <span id="Label1">Is your investment in that new Internet stock a sign of stock market savvy or an act of peculiarly American speculative folly? How has the psychology of investing changed--and not changed--over the last five hundred years? Edward Chancellor examines the nature of speculation--from medieval Europe to the Tulip mania of the 1630s to today's Internet stock craze. A contributing writer to <i>The Financial Times</i> and <i>The Economist</i>, Chancellor looks at both the psychological and economic forces that drive people to "bet" their money in markets; how markets are made, unmade, and manipulated; and who wins when speculation runs rampant. Drawing colorfully on the words of such speculators as Sir Isaac Newton, Daniel Defoe, Ivan Boesky, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, <i>Devil Take the Hindmost</i> is part history, part social science, and purely illuminating: an erudite and hugely entertaining book that is more timely today than ever before.<br><br>"Entertaining, useful, admirable scholarship . . . Chancellor seems to have read everything." --Adam Smith, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Anyone contemplating a stock market venture and certainly anyone now involved should read this book."--John Kenneth Gailbraith</span>

                    <span>This is not just a history of financial speculation. This is really a history of mankind, of greed, of all the evil that we have repeated again and again through history. The author finished writing this book in Dec 98. Theoretically, if more people had known and read this book, much fewer would got "drown" in the internet bubble. However, when the Greater Fool theory was in full throttle, as prescribed by this book, that made no difference. <P>Basically this book had covered all the financial catastrophes of the past 5 centuries: Tulipomania, South Sea Bubble, Fool's Gold, Railway mania, Great Depression, Japanese Bubble Economy ba ba ba. You name it. The most valuable thing being that the author had not just given an exhaustive account of what happened, but some reasoning why things repeated themselves, and how. Say, the government officials were corrupted, there came a so called technology innovation or a new market (the terms "New Era/Never coming back of the business cycle" were also there in 1929), the Greater Fool Theory in full gear, all the simple things you can tell from hindsight. <P>As a CFA Level III candidate (I might become a charterholder this August, ha ha), I strongly recommend AIMR to put this book into the required list of reading to warn its members of the limitation of the financial techniques/theories/calculations we try to preach. Anyway, a must read for anyone, especially serious players!</span>

                    <span>Chancellor's book is a highly entertaining history of market speculation taking in everything from the Tulip Mania of 17th century Holland and the English South Sea Company bubble to Japan in the '80s, the Savings and Loan Rip Off, Michael Milken's Junk Bonds, the Long Term Capital Management fiasco and the Internet craze of the late 1990's. Chancellor even covers the 90's art market.<P>One constant stands out about market piracy: what is new is old - only the names and games have changed. Markets have always been manipulated and always will be. The reforms that follow in the wake of each bubble plant the seeds for the next. Often because the legislators who enact the reforms are beholden to those positioned to benefit from the loopholes.<P>There are several phrases that seem to pop up with every bubble:<BR>"This time it's different."<BR>"It's too big to fail."<BR>"The business cycle is no more," or some nonsense about reaching a plateau of permanent prosperity.<P>Reading this book will make you think twice about investing in the market.<BR>It'll make you doubt the foundation of the efficient market hypothesis.<BR>It'll show how often the experts are wrong.<BR>It'll show how often Nobel Laureates in Economics turn out to be fools.<P>It will make you think three times about investing in Japan.<BR>Four times about investing in Latin America.<P>And you'll run away screaming from derivatives of any stripe.<BR>In fact, one wonders why the whole shooting match hasn't imploded yet, ala Baring's Bank or LTCM.<P>Devil Take the Hindmost is a fun read. More important, the next time a Mania strikes - and it will - this book and a general understanding of the history of speculation just might just save you from rushing over the cliff with all the other lemmings.</span>

                    <span>Published at the height of the 1990s technology bubble and two years after the onset of the Asian financial crisis, "Devil Take the Hindmost" offers a remarkably insightful examination of historical asset bubbles. Chancellor first takes us to ancient Rome, where currency crises were the norm due to currency speculation, and where the Forum Romanum served as the venue for shady deals in stocks and bonds. Indeed, speculation as an economic activity was ab urbe condita, or literally since the founding of the city of Rome. He then takes us to Venice circa the Middle Ages, where, in all probability, some of the earliest instances of insider trading took place. A spectacular panorama of financial shenanigans then unfolds, chapter by chapter: the overblown demand for tulips in the Netherlands during the 17th century; the British debt conversion scheme during the 1700s which led to the South Sea bubble; the Gilded Age in the US; the Wall Street crash of 1929; and the bursting of the Japanese economic bubble.<BR> <BR>Speculators absorb risk and provide liquidity in the marketplace. Arguably, their insight into market fluctuations and their intrepidity in assuming risk help lower the bid-ask spread of a certain asset. Speculation itself is not demonstrably malevolent, but is an intrinsic component of a functioning asset market. But at many junctions in history, as Chancellor prolifically demonstrates, excessive speculation had reached a point wherein prices had ceased to serve as useful signals of the intrinsic value of an asset. <BR> <BR>Chancellor contends that speculative activities, at their crescendo, are intrinsically irrational, and convincingly argues that asset markets all too often went to excess. The potential for amassing gains through trading and speculation are nearly limitless, yet the social cost of market collapse due to manipulation and abuse cannot be ignored. <P>The book in effect questions the dogma regarding the seemingly omniscient ability of free markets to assign prices to assets, and the ability of prices to serve as an effective signaling mechanism. This is not a new argument. In their 1934 classic "Security Analysis," Dodd and Graham wrote that "[i]t is customary to refer with great respect to the bloodless verdict of the market place, as though it represented invariably the composite judgment of countless shrewd, informed, and calculating minds. Very frequently, however, these appraisals are based on mob psychology, on faulty reasoning, and on the most superficial examination of inadequate information."<BR> <BR>Ultimately, however, unfettered speculation may be due to the incontrovertible propensity of people to hitch their wagons to a star, and this propensity is unduly magnified by a "vita brevis" (life is short) mentality. Through this depressingly short--given the significance of the topic--yet highly edifying volume, Chancellor gives us the opportunity to reflect on speculation, which he considers "an anarchic force."</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>That's the central thesis to Edward Chancellor's book on the history of financial booms, busts, swindles, panics and manias: the more things change, the more they stay the same. As a law student taking a few securities classes and a dabbling buy-and-hold investor, the book provides incredible insight into the way markets have worked and failed since they came into existence. Written in chronological order and ending in 1998 as the tech bubble burst, Chancellor is your tour guide to the cheats, robber barrons, over-rated innovations, emerging markets and herd mentality behind financial euphorias and depressions from Holland to Japan, Britain and the States. Chancellor's greatest accomplishment is pointing to the commonalities behind every crash and letting people know how to identify the signals of future bouts of irrational exuberance. The book demands limited sophistication, but the less you know about currency exchanges, derivatives and hedge funds, the more you will be resorting to an online investment dictionary. You will have to learn in order to enjoy this book. Chancellor's subject matter necessarily demands a critique of economic and political theories, and it is clear that he champions Keynes and greater government control over markets. His criticisms of conservative political/ economic philosophies, however, are relatively restrained, intelligent, and do not irritate those of opposing viewpoints. In the end, you may not be thinking on the same page as George Soros, but this book is a great education that may even have you making better investments.</span>

                    <span>At first, I sort of waded through this, but as it moved into the 20th Century, it really got interesting. I highly recommend the book. You realize that the latest boom, from the internet to Enron is nothing new; use useless collateral (stock/land) to finance spurious schemes, pump the price, and watch the suckers pore in. <P>The section on Japan is awesome.</span>
