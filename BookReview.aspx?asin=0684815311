                    <span>I have read more than ten books about adult ADD since I was diagnosed a few months ago. While this one does not provide a lot of technical information about ADD, it is by far the best self-help book I've read. Hundreds of pages are devoted to teaching the ADD adult better ways to manage paperwork, housework, time management, social events, relationships etc.etc. It highlights the many positives of ADD, and sheds light on how to control the negatives. If you feel that you are fairly well-educated about what ADD is, but want to know what you can do about it to improve your life, this is definitely the book for you.</span>

                    <span>My daughter has ADD, and I probably do as well, so I've read quite a bit on this subject. While the book is very informative and does give personal accounts of what it's like to live w/ AD/HD, I found it hard to get through. It seems to ramble a bit at times and the organization and even the choice of print size and font made it hard for me to stay interested after a while. Basically, it reads as if was written by someone with AD/HD-- (which of course, it was), but that's what makes it hard to get through at times! I found Driven to Distraction by Hallowell and even Women With Attention Deficit Disorder by Solden much easier to read and just as (if not more) informative, especially for an ADDer with a tendency to lose interest if the book doesn't captivate me early on. Also, if you are very well informed on the biology/neurology etc. of ADD the first three chapters don't offer anything new. Bottom line, worth reading, but there are better choices out there.</span>

                    <span>the first one I read along with "driven by distraction".the fact that the authors have ADD too is kind of conforting.they tell about their long struggle to finding proper back up and treatment,It is written in a fun way with illustrations.After reading I finally took an appointment with a psy specialized an ADD ,just to be sure I was not self-diagnosing wrongly.</span>

                    <span>Finally, someone has written a book on this. For the longest I just thought I really had something mentally wrong with me, but after reading this, I don't feel like I'm the only one in the world that can't concentrate on things or that has trouble getting started. If only we (as a society) had known this stuff ten, twenty years ago when a lot of us were in school, we could have been saved a lot of heartache. And saved our parents and teachers a lot of suffering and frustration also. There are a few books out there now even on this and other types of "disorders." One that comes to mind is "The Curious Incident" which is told from the point of view of an autistic teenager. Another is "The Bark of the Dogwood" where the main character either suffers from DID, ADD, BPD, or Aspergers (or any combination thereof). But as far as self-helps, this one takes the cake. The good news is this: We now know what is "wrong" with us. The bad news? We now have to get others to believe it.</span>

                    <span>Oh my God what a book. I was shocked to learn that I have many abilites and not disabilites. I now have a positive outlook on ADD. This book has changed my life and I came back to Amazon to order 4 more for some of my freinds that struggle with ADD. I now can have my sons teachers read this and they will finnally understand my sons. I am so moved by this book and if you have ADD or know someone who does you should order this book today. I have read other ADD books but this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST EVER!!!</span>
