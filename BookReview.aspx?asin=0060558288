                <span id="Label1">Secular liberals and religious conservatives will find things to both comfort and alarm them in Jim Wallis's <I>God's Politics</I>. That combination is actually reason enough to recommend the book in a time when the national political and theological discourse is dominated by blanket descriptions and shortsightedness. But Wallis, editor of <I>Sojourners</I> magazine, offers more than just a book that's hard to categorize. What Wallis sees as the true mission of Christianity--righting social ills, working for peace--is in tune with the values of liberals who so often run screaming from the idea of religion. Meanwhile, in his estimation, religious vocabulary is co-opted by conservatives who use it to polarize. Wallis proposes a new sort of politics, the name of which serves as the title of the book, wherein these disparities are reconciled and progressive causes are paired with spiritual guidance for the betterment of society. Wallis is at his most compelling when he puts this theory into action himself, letting his own beliefs guide him through stinging criticisms of the war in Iraq. In his view, George W. Bush's flaw lies in the assumption that the United States was an unprecedented force of goodness in a fight against enemies characterized as "evil." Indeed, although both the right and left are criticized here, the idea is that the liberals, if they would get religion, are the more redeemable lot. Wallis's line between religion and public policy may be drawn a little differently than most liberals might feel comfortable with, and while he pays some lip service to other faiths most of his prescription for America seems to come from the Bible. Still, for a party having just lost a presidential election where "moral issues" are said to have factored heavily, <I>God's Politics</I> is a sermon worth listening to. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I think the American nation needs this good, thought-provoking book (whether Democrats or Republicans, believers or no-believers).  "God Politics" puts the right things right. Although I might not always agree with Mr. Wallis's views on certain issues, I like the fact that he separates the dirty, shameless politics from the religion. Mr. Wallis strikes me as a very objective and down-to-earth person. I am as much impressed by him as I was by Mr. Tombak after buying his book Can We Live 150 Years?</span>

                    <span>I had high hopes for this book, but was sadly disappointed.   I heard Mr. Wallis on the radio and thought to myself, wow, this guy sounds pretty good, so I bought the book.  I never finished it.  It was more a book about what the Democrats need to do to get back in power and what the Republicans are doing wrong to us.  As a Libertarian I think it is up to the individual to decide where their money goes, whom we would like to help, not the government.  Mr. Wallis say's again and again how the government should take care of the poor.  I was hoping for a balanced effort to show how religion, which shouldn't have a part in politics anyway, works in politics, not a bash fest for the right and a lesson for the left.</span>

                    <span>Do not get thrown by the title.  READ THIS BOOK if you want to understand what is going on in this country.  I am one of those folks who go to church every Sunday and could not figure out what happened in 2004 when Jesus suddenly walked on Wall Street.  It is the best book on politics and society I have read in a decade.  Buy it, read it and then give it to a friend.</span>

                    <span>What saddens me about this particular book is that is has such great potential.  As a progressive Christian myself, I seek out books that are able to hit the mainstream with a reminder that a great deal of progressive thought is right in line with Christian beliefs.  To his credit, Jim Wallis has propelled this book to the forefront of the literary scene - and coming in the aftermath of an election cycle defined by "moral" issues, this is a great sign to see that their is serious evaluation of the Nation's choices.
<br />
<br />The problem is that while the topic is great, Wallis' writings and the style of this arrangement are just not made for a 300+ page book.  This whole book could have been more fine-tuned into a 25 page essay.  Note that Wallis regularly publishes essay-style writings in the Sojourners magazine.  That type of media is a much better fit.  
<br />
<br />What results from this book is more of a "Jim Wallis' Greatest Hits" featuring numerous letters that he wrote, speeches he gave, and articles that he penned.  If I wanted to review his personal history of thought, I might just order older issues of the Sojourners magazine.  Sadly I think the book bends from a real discussion of the role of religion in modern politics, to a study of how Jim Wallis has addressed the issue.
<br />
<br />At the time of this writing, this is easily the biggest literary disappointment that I've had in 2005.  Not by any means was it the worst book, but the content just didn't meet the hype.  If potential readers are serious about learning about Wallis and his discussions, I would suggest you check out some of his online writings at the Sojourners website.  They are more consise and to the point, while the book is harshly repetitive.</span>

                    <span>As the content of this book illustrates, it would be incorrect to assume that all people that profess belief in Christianity or some other religion are enemies of those that don't. For those who think there is no intersection between secularism and religion in terms of values will definitely find counterexamples to that belief in this book. Too much emphasis has been placed in the media on the "Religious Right," giving its members an aura of invincibility as well as intolerance. This has seemingly caused many in the secular community to view religion in an even more hostile light than they did before. This is definitely unfair, and does not square with the facts. In the scientific and engineering professions in particular, one observes an interesting statistic, namely that most of the advances in these professions have occurred with the assistance of scientists and engineers who also hold to religious beliefs. Indeed, if the statistical abstracts are correct in stating that ninety-five percent of the world's populations believe in some sort of divine being, then it follows straightforwardly that the other five percent who do not are not responsible for all of the scientific and technological advances. Whether they are scientists who sometimes engage in prayer and supplication or people of faith who sometimes practice science is a matter perhaps for debate, but the fact remains that the current state of technology is due to in large measure to the efforts of people who have spent their time in churches as well as laboratories. 
<br />
<br />But the illegal and immoral war in Iraq, coupled with the strange and hysterical dialog engaged in by many religious "leaders", is cause for alarm, and those in the "secular Left" can therefore gain a great deal by recognizing that they have much in common with the author's dialog in this book. A lot of his values are the same, and an alliance, even if not formalized in common institutional action, is warranted with those that the author represents. Genuine concern with what is happening in the world, and an utmost respect for human life, are the values that form a non-empty intersection with the author and the secular community. One might call a common call to action a pragmatic philosophy, but however it is labeled, there should not be anxiety among secularists that the joining of hands with people of faith is a form of compromise or intellectual suicide. Sound judgment, and not arrogance, must be the predominant mental attitude for all who oppose the brutality of the war in Iraq. Standing with those who share the same values can alleviate more suffering than working alone. 
<br />
<br />There is much in this book that is refreshing, and it is certainly one that stands in contraposition to the lunacy proceeding from the current administration and in some extremist religious circles. There are some mistakes in the book, like any other, but there are some gems of thought that deserve careful reflection. For example, some of the wisest advice given in the book is in the last chapter entitled "The Critical Choice." The author cautions, rightfully, against the monster of cynicism, realizing fully its potential to cripple the human intellect. The author shows great insight into the reasons why people choose to be cynics (and yes, he thankfully views it as a choice): essentially to protect themselves from disappointment, to find a "refuge from commitment." Cynics though, contrary to what the author states, do not really know what is going on in the world. They fancy themselves "realistic," but in fact view the world via sweeping generalizations and ignore consciously and deliberately counterexamples to their viewpoints. The author recommends action not optimism as an antidote to cynicism, but both are needed, along with an insatiable curiosity to figure things out, and absolutely, and without any doubt: pure intellectual honesty. 
<br />
<br />In the last chapter, the author also makes some predictions for the "new millennium." Some of these are relevant only to those who have some type of religious beliefs. Others are certainly ones that many will hope for, such as the prediction that the "Religious Right" will lose control of religious discussion. It is doubtful though that Internet pornography will "quietly undermine" human relationships. On the contrary, people will become jaded to pornography, and due to its lack of imagination and creativity, it will no longer influence anyone to any large degree. Indeed, pornography will decline because of its banality, not because of any restraints placed on it. This goes also for the author's prediction on the "moral pollution" of Hollywood culture and corporate advertising. Hopefully though prayer and Bible study will not become more important to people than it is now. What we need is more thinking and less prayer; the prayer/thought ratio must be kept as small as possible. The "secular Left" will not give up its hostility to religion, even though for reasons given above, they should not be hostile to it. But secularism will not die; it will grow without conscious effort. The secularists of the twenty-first century will be busy with technological development and scientific research and will not, and need not, concern themselves with the perusal of ancient religious texts. These developments are rapidly accelerating and will continue to do so, with or without the assistance of people of faith. But if the past is any indication, one can expect their assistance, and it will be extremely efficacious. </span>
