                    <span>I did not read the reviews before I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  I made a big mistake.  The critics are right on target.  This book needs major editing before it will be an aid to anyone.  And while I've marked mine up and cannot therefore recover my $30, maybe I can save you yours.
<br />
<br />Maybe if sales of this book die as a result of the reviews these publishers will think twice before rushing out so flawed a product.  They should truly be embarrassed.</span>

                    <span>I just purchased Teach yourself Visual Studio .NET 2003 in 21 days from Amazon.  In the introduction the book advertises itself as a book for novices: "nothing is taken for granted in any of the days"... this is clearly misleading as upon reading the book I have found that the content of the book is quite obviously targeted to experienced VB programmers who have previously built windows forms apps.  As a professional teacher I am appalled at this ruse and at the instructional design of this book.  I think it is misleading (read dishonest) to positionf this book as something for beginners.  The lessons do not progress from simple to advanced as should be the case... but jump from beginner to advanced to intermediate in random order.  For example.. object lifecycle is an intermediate concept that should be dealt with after a learner has mastered more basic ideas and yet it is covered on day three.  This concept is covered at a MUCH later time in all the other tutorial materials I have purchased and seen.  There are too many other examples of this haphazard approach to instruction to mention...
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Instructional design flaws aside, I have found glaring errata.  For example..Figure 3.14 shows a web form instead of  "Multiple MDIchildren open in an MDIparent form".  Most of the code samples imple don't work.  Did anyone actually proofread this book before it went to press?  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I have to say I was surprised to be disappointed this way.  Sams usually provides much better books than this.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />At any rate, I have resigned myself to simply using this book as a pointer, or introduction to things that can be done in Visual Studio.  To this end I needed the code samples which were also advertised in the book.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I had hoped to gain access to the code samples and errata on the web site advertised by the author in the introduction: www.vbasp.net
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />This address routes to a 403 error... I cannot go to the site.  From looking at other reviews I see that many others have had the same problem.
<br />
<br />Mr. Beres purports to be a .NET evangelist... he does a disservice to the .NET community by producing such misleading and flawed material and targetting it to beginners.
<br />
<br />Bottom line... if you are an experienced programmer you'll find the flawed code samples frustrating and unprofessional.  If you are a beginner you'll wish you hadn't wasted your money.

                    <span>I was intimidated by the .Net Visual Studio IDE, but this book really helped me to understand how to use it. I tried most of the sample code and did not have problems with it.  It is a very pratical book.  I'm reading it a second time since last year to more fully understand this complex topic. Good job.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book a while ago but I am now just going through it for my new job.  I am about 2/3 of the way thru and while it does have some good information, the code samples are complete and utter TRASH!!  My god if one simple application of his actually worked without hours of figuring out what HE DID WRONG I would believe Bush is an intelligent man.  Stay away from this garbage -- the authors website doesn't work either so basically you're screwed.</span>
