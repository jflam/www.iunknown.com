                    <span>I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 because it was published in 1997 and is somewhat outdated now. I purchased it in mid 99 because I liked the other book in the series, Win32 Programming by Brent Rector.<p>Feuer's book  is consise and I like his approach of explaining some of the internals of  MFC, such as what BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP expands out to. Feuer talks about the  Win32 API too and I agree with his philosophy that MFC programmers can't  hope to get by without knowing anything about the API.<p>The sample code  applications on the CD are great. They are simple to understand, but show  you most of the options possible. For example, there is one app that  displays all kinds of buttons, including owner drawn ones. Most MFC books  don't even say anything about owner draw stuff. At the end of the book,  Feuer shows you how to make a wizard-based install program.<p>I recommend  reading this book after you've read a beginner's book on MFC and/or Visual  C++. Also, the author does not reproduce all of the sample code in the book  itself. You should install the CD and read the actual code as you read the  book.</span>

                    <span>After making relatively successful forays into MFC armed only with MS reference materials or books written by MS employees and I have finally found a book which explains MFC without marketing it. Very lucid and  well-written. I think the Document/View model is a bit less generic and  useful than is presented, but at least now I understand most of its  underpinnings. One error - Delphi has never been interpreted (p.5);</span>

                    <span>As a 4th year CS BSc student I might claim to be the owner of the greatest number of MFC books. Most are like the curate's egg - good in parts. It is with regret that I came upon Feuer's book so late in the buying sequence.  Had I discovered it earlier my bank account would now be better and that of  Amazon somewhat less! <p>My MFC library ranges from the 'Do it in 24 hours'  variety (often laughable - but even they often have something to offer)  through to MS professional tomes which seem like those job offers where you  need not only the ability but a few years experience as well. Another  excellent book is Kruglinski but this only proves it's worth once you have  nearly got the whole idea well understood. Feuer - much better as a starter  - assumes little except a good C++ base and then takes one forward step by  step.<p>I very strongly recommend Feuer for anybody with a good C++ basis  wanting to move to VC++ and MFC. This is the one to start with if you want  to protect your cash. Kruglinski should come after and then you're ready  for the MS serious stuff! Happy coding!</span>

                    <span>I have not read this book, I have mostly browsed through it to find information that I need.  This book has not let me down.  I have a variety of programming books, many that were more than twice what this book costs,  that don't cover important topics the way this book does.</span>

                    <span>Have been looking for a MFC book for sometime now, I came across this  book, it wasn't as large as most other MFC books but I own many programming  books and larger is not always better, most of the time the larger the book  the more BS it includes. The book includes "real world" examples  like the tree view example isn't just a tree view which includes 1-9 or  some other BS it is you local drive structure! I have only been skimming  through this book for about an hour and it has already answered about 50%  of my questions! If you know C++ and want to learn MFC then this is a great  book! It teaches MFC not the C++ language structure or how to use all of  the wizards which most MFC books waste the first 3 - 4 chapters on!</span>
