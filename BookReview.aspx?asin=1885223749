                <span id="Label1">What do you wish you had asked your dad?  <P>What did you feel the first time you cradled me in your arms?  <P>What was your proudest day as a dad?  <P>A little book that asks big questions: some serious, some playful, some risky.  "I had ample opportunity to ask Dad these questions when he was alive.  But it seemed that a million reasons not to do so could always be found.  It was a waste of everything Dad had ever seen, done, and thought about not to hear his answers, and I regret not finding out more about him when I had the chance."  This book was borne of that regret and has one underlying objective: to develop a blueprint for discovery so that children of any age can start to build a clearer, deeper picture of the man behind the word Dad.  <P>"So this is for my dad.  And for all dads, past, present, and future.  And for their sons and daughters.  And for the simple pleasure of talking to each other."--Vincent Staniforth</span>

                    <span>The questions in this book allow the reader to muse on their own relationships with their parents and others close to them, and hopefully to realise how important it is to make time to communicate within families. Buy it to read, think and keep it visible on your bookshelf as a reminder of what is important and that there is always time to talk to those close to you, however busy you think you are.</span>

                    <span>At first glance I thought this was just another "quick-fix" book offering [bad] platitudes about the quest to reveal the mythical father-figure. <P>I started to leaf through it and three days later I'm still excited and troubled by what "Questions" has revealed to me.<P>The questions are, quite simply, stunning in their originality and form. There's stuff here I wouldn't have thought of asking in a million years.<P>And then there's the narrative that is sprinkled throughout the text; a dark and troubled trans-America motorcycle trip during which the author has an eerie insight into the importance that his father has played in his life. Too late, of course. Staniforth returns to England just in time to watch his Dad die, and so begins the internal intellectual voyage of discovery about his father.<P>Read it, use it, buy it for a father or a child. This book can save families.</span>

                    <span>Great book for learning about yourself and passing along your feelings, foibles and future wishes to your children. Works well for those that had a great relationship with their own father and want to continue the tradition; works even better for those who weren't close to their own father and want to make the most out of that special relationship with their own children.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I found this book in a store in Seattle. I wasn't looking for anything in particular, I just picked it up and flicked through the pages and before I knew it I couldn't put it back down as my eyes began to cloud up with tears. I had a special relationship with my father, but never really, really knew him. The questions in this book seem to allow me to touch his memory with a much deeper insight than ever before. A wonderful, pleasant, and lovely book to read. It brought back special memories.</span>
