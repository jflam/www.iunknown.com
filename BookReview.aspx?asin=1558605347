                    <span>... because it is the first coffee table book that I've ever bought and then proceeded to mark up - underling passages, writing notes, questions etc.<P>It is a totally unique book on many different levels. A computer book with photographs? I am attracted to bizarre juxtapositions, loved the concept but was confident that the execution would be lacking. I was wrong. <P>I didn't understand everything (this book has a good deal of code (which I skimmed over)) but at the same time is both quite accessible and an incredible resource for non-programmers. An extraordinary accomplishment.<P>Greenspun makes a compelling case for what he believes a web site should be and at the same time manages to offer lots of specific, practical advice. His core advice - what to do and the technologies to use - has to be on target. It's what smart people pay lots of money to smart consultants for. Unlike any other book I've read, I got the feeling that I had hired a really smart consultant who was telling me exactly what to do and what not to do. <P>If all of this were not enough, the book highlights several free services his site offers to other web site owners interested in providing different kinds of collaboration and interactivity. The services run on his monster machine. Cost, zero. <P>In closing, I'd like to give some examples of his sense of humor. <P>"CORBA circa 1998 is a lot like an Arizona housing development circa 1950. The architect's model looks great. The model home is comfortable. You'll have water and sewage hookups real soon now".<P>"Johnny drives to the bookstore and spends $30 on an 'I stole the program and now I need a book on how to use it' book". <P>"Desktop apps promised to deliver the power of computers to the ordinary citizen; in fact, they delivered the pain of a corporate administration job right into the ordinary citizen's home or office".<P>One other thing - if you're really technically inclined - he basically gives you a blueprint for making a truckload of money. With that, I'll conclude with one more quote. Just bear in mind that this is from a guy who gives away CPU cycles, gives free seminars, and will let you download this book from his web site.<P>"Not being a materialist in the U.S. is kind of like not appreciating opera if you live in Milan or art if you live in Paris".</span>

                    <span>The web really isn't about flashy graphics and other assorted eye-candy. It's about information delivery and user interactivity. Far too many books out there simply include a short section on the purpose of a site, another short section on the site's hierarchy, and then spend the rest of the time on page design and little whiz-bang features.<P>This book is about web publishing. It's about designing information delivery systems that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. It's a serious book that should be read by anyone who is serious about publishing information on the web (as opposed to simply "creating web pages").<P>But don't let all that seriousness scare you away. The book is highly readable and entertaining, and the author is greatly skilled at weaving humor, opinion, and real-world examples into what could otherwise be very dry subject matter.<P>The examples in the book are heavy on Unix, AOLserver, Tcl, and Oracle. But they don't detract from the concepts being discussed. I personally know next to nothing about any of these but was still able to follow the logic and I know I can apply the same concepts on other systems. Much of it is actually SQL which can be applied anywhere.<P>Add to all of this that the author has a super content-rich web site you can visit to learn more, includes interesting photographs throughout the book, the book is printed on high-quality paper, and it STILL costs less than many "Kewl Web Site in a Day" books, and you've got a winner. I give it my highest rating.</span>

                    <span>Philip Greenspun is the creator of photo.net and a very entertaining author as well. This a great book for beginners to get an overview of web publishing, online communities, and databases. Some of the specifics of the book are a little dated but the concepts are not. I often refer back to this book for ideas and inspiration. The online version of this book is free, but the print edition has great glossy pages and is packed with gratuitous, full-color pictures from Philip's image library.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book covers such a wide range of subjects - HTML, web design, SQL, server configuration, e-commerce, accepting credit cards, scalability, futurology, search engines, choosing a database, the nature of buying software, system admin and loads more, all in great depth - that it's almost impossible to characterize the contents. It's also packed full of beautiful, but completely unrelated, photographs; all taken by the author!<P>Philip Greenspun runs a successful web consultancy with several very busy sites, and seems to have tried to distill all that he has learned into one book. A lot of what he says is very wise, and although I disagree with some of his technology choices, he has thought everything through in great detail. There are quite a few sections which I will re-read and study for my own projects, but many others I will never bother with again. The book's main drawback is its size, which makes it hard to cherry-pick just the bits you need.<P>If you are looking for ways to use the latest technology to make a web site look cool, this is not the book for you. If you are building or running a site or business with lots of users, and you want to keep them and avoid going crazy in the process, you need this book. And the photos really are good.</span>

                    <span>It's interesting how a lot of readers complain about the book being all about Phil's ego and Arsdigita,(the company he created that is now part of redhat). It seems those people didn't understand much of the book or found the subject disappointingly tougher than they thought... Yes, web publishing requires more intelligence and thoughfullness some would like to believe. And this book makes you realise that, whether 1998 or 2002.<BR> Most web sites that are data driven these days still use the same principles explained in this book. Most don't use the ACS but the whole idea behind the ACS is one that comes from a sincere desire to facilitate the creation of dynamic (data driven) web sites.<BR> One can tell Greenspun is more than a technologist, but a humanist as well. This would explain the appearance of the book some like to critisize. Certainly Greenspun ego is present, but what can you expect from someone who's got a vast array of knowledge and wisdom to share. Definitely a book any intelligent person will love.<BR> I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what it takes to create web services. Also, this book is the perfect reference for teaching a class on website development, in a manner that gives students a broad perspective before they delve into the inevitable geek stuff: web application programming, data models, and SQL queries. I've used this book at work to educate some of my cooworkers who were programmers or designers, and to give clients instructive lectures on the subject.</span>
