                <span id="Label1">Bestselling author Bob Rotella, the guru-cum-sports psychologist of  choice among the world's top golfers, lines up a perfect double entendre with  <I>Putting Out of Your Mind</I>. To putt out of your mind--to master this  crucial part of the game--you've got to get putting out of your mind--to make it  so second nature that you're not actually thinking and stressing once you're  standing over the ball. <p>  As Brad Faxon, a Rotella devotee and one of the best putters on the PGA Tour,  emphasizes in his introduction, "The secret of great putting is not in the  stroke. It's in the mind. When you putt, your state of mind is more important  than your mechanics." Once you can imagine yourself sinking a putt, you've  exponentially improved your possibilities of actually knocking it in. It's an  important lesson, and he learned it from Rotella.<p>  Rotella demystifies the mechanics, accenting instead the importance of a  pre-shot routine to help you more effectively visualize your putts and serve as  a security blanket when you're facing a breaking downhill five-footer with the  match on the line. Most important, Rotella preaches the idea that putting is  actually fun for good putters. It's the part of the game they relish most.  You'll no doubt find yourself relishing it, too. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>I subscribe to a bunch of golf magazines. I own and occasionally re-read many of the best-selling golf instructional books ever written, including Golf Is A Game of Confidence. Most are good for knocking 1-3 strokes off your game per round over the course of 6-9 months. But this tape, with its suggestions for a simpler pre-shot routine and mind-clearing suggestions has taken 3-5 strokes off my putting alone in just 2 months. I listened to it 10 times before even trying out the suggestions, just to make sure they were ingrained in my thinking. It has actually made putting fun for me, rather than an afterthought. His bottom line: we let far too many thoughts run through our mind when we play golf, especially when we putt. His simple drills will help to keep self-doubt off the putting green. Spend the $....</span>

                    <span>If you are looking for a book that is a once informative and entertaining, you have to get this one. What I found interesting in this book are the insights that the author gives us as to how pros and ordinary players think, or should think when preparing to putt. He discusses the importance of the pre-shot routine . As 40% of the shots made in the course of a game are putts, it's simple logic that such a book should interest all golfers whatever the state of their game. If you wish elevate your game another notch, this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>My golf game has been transformed by this CD. What is so valuable is the perspective he offers on the mental side of the game. I was a horrible putter only a couple of months ago, shooting in the mid to upper 80's, and my handicap of 8 was rising. After listening to this,practicing what he recommends, I just won my flight and low net champion at the Club, shooting a 1 over total for 2 days! It does work.</span>

                    <span>This book was great. Rotella guides you right off that path you've been walking that's called the mental approach to putting. One of the biggest things you should learn from this book is that you won't make every putt you look at. What's more, is that Rotella tells you why you won't make every putt and then goes on to show you how you can think that you're a great putter even though you're not sinking every putt. Read this book carefully, once your putting improves your whole game will because you won't put pressure on yourself to hit everything close. <P>Buy this book now!!!!</span>
