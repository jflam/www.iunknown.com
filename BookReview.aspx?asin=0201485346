                <span id="Label1">The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the related Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) standards make it possible for network administrators to control and monitor even the most complicated networks. In a textbook-style treatment, William Stallings's <I>SNMP, SNMPv2, SNMPv3, and RMON 1 and 2</I> explains what's behind this family of popular networking standards.<p> The book begins with some theory about what tasks network administrators need to do, such as monitoring performance, faults, and accounting, along with configuration and security control. The guide then describes SNMP--which was introduced in 1989--as a successful solution to the basic problems of network administration. (One of the strengths of SNMP is that it allows administrators to work with disparate networks running on TCP/IP.) The author details how an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB), which stores network information, is organized and also how the protocol works to collect and store network information.<p> The RMON standard actually uses SNMP with its own MIB format to collect statistics about a network. The author provides detailed descriptions of this information, along with RMON filters and alarms, which can be used to troubleshoot a network.<p> New and improved standards RMONv2, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3 comprise the remainder of this book. RMONv2 allows network administration of more kinds of networks and devices. SNMPv2 provides enhanced administration capabilities, while SNMPv3 adds the security and encryption that was lacking in earlier versions of the protocol.<p> This textbook is crammed with tables and statistics, and shows off the author's command of the relevant networking standards. Much more readable than the Request for Comments (RFC) documents that describe these standards, this title provides a comprehensive reference work on SNMP and RMON for the working Internet professional. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I had been searching the web and other printed text on SNMP network management and found that most do not go into enough detail or the explanations are very vague. If I had picked up William Stalling's book 6 months ago, I would have saved myself a lot of time. If you decide to get a book on SNMP network management, make it this one. It is very comprehensive. Discusses and provides in-depth information on all topics relating to SNMP network management written in a clear and easy to read style. This book is essential for both students and working professionals, thanks to William Stallings.</span>

                    <span>I can't understand why Mr. Kale cannot see the high value of this book. I have developed SNMP applications for 10 years now (I currently work on an SNMP development toolkit, in a group with one of the authors of the v3 RFCs)--the first edition of this was the first book on SNMP that I read and it's still the most comprehensive. I have five other books on the topic, and this is the one I turn to most often.<P>If I had a criticism of it, it would be that it's a bit pedantic and its overview of the fundamentals and history of SNMP are a bit heavy, but the use and implementation of all Internet protocols should be rigorous, and those who work their way through the front matter will be better SNMP developers for it. There's been quite enough blatantly improper usage of SNMP already, thanks.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book I found on SNMP. I found Essential SNMP to be lacking in detail and the descriptions in Managing Internetworks with SNMP were not so clear. So far it has been able to answer every question I have had regarding SNMP.</span>

                    <span>I had to buy this book as part of a Network Management class and have found it to be utterly useless during and afterwards. It is definatly the worse book that I have ever had to buy. First, it was mighty expensive for the quality of the writing/material. Second, the material within the book could have covered in a much better way. It was very difficult to understand because it travelled much to far into SNMP/RMON. I found it almost useless as a reference, because it did not cover anything in a way that was pertinant to actually using SNMP/RMON on a network. It lacked real world examples and uses. Perhaps this book would be great for someone who develops apps based on SNMP, but for someone who wants to learn about using it, its a massive waste of time.</span>
