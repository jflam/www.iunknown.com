                    <span>The Samskara gives out the exact character of a normal brahmin. He practices the rituals blindly, but he can't think it scientifically. The humanity is the best ritual, irrespective of time and space i.e. the message of this novel. His one more novel Bharathipura is having the clear idea about the samskara.It may be the extended work of Samskara.</span>

                    <span>There are two outstanding features of this book. The first being brilliant storytelling. The tale is a critical look at the life style of the "upper classes" of Hindu society during the early part of the  twenthieth century. The plot is deftly interwoven with Hindu philosophy and  the result is quite remarkable. The second feature is the tralsation.  Having read the original Kannada version, I found the traslation to be very  lucid . This is a must read for everyone familiar to the the Indian social  setup and also for those who are interested in getting introduced to it.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Murthy's book is delicately told, with exquisite attention to detail. I did one of the inside jacket illustrations for a book of his when I was six, and have liked the man and his work ever since. Look for the new  Penguin Paperback of his, _Bhava_ (co-translated by my mom... OK, so I am  unfairly partial to his work). Read it and decide.</span>

                    <span>This is quite an interesting book.  It's a shame that Ananta Murthy seems to have lost inspiration two-thirds of the way through the book, and fails to provide a conclusion.  As any storyteller, Indian or otherwise, will  tell you, a good story requires a beginning, middle, and end.  I hope that  more publishing houses in England, India, and the U.S. take the initiative  to publish such graceful translations of literature from the rich  traditions of India's many regional languages.</span>

                    <span>I was not excited when I learned that I had to read this for my Religion 1 Class at Dartmouth College because it looked long and boring.  In reality,  it was a gripping story that ranks up there with the greats.  And if you  liked Hesse's Siddhartha, you'll like this too.</span>
