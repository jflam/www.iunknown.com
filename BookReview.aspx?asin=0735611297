                <span id="Label1">If specialization is for insects, those of us who have only two legs are  bound to need reminders when we sit down to perform a specialized task. For  those times in which the specialized task at hand involves the latest version of  Microsoft's high-end database management system (DBMS), <I>Microsoft SQL Server  2000 Administrator's Pocket Consultant</I> will provide how-to answers on the  double-quick. This small, inch-thick volume fits nicely into a briefcase, and  opens flat for easy reference. It makes little attempt to explain how SQL Server  works, assuming instead that the reader knows what he or she needs. For example,  a quick scan of the index for "Logins, Assigning Roles for Multiple" yields a  reference to a page that explains exactly what to do, step by step.<p>  Procedures are a large part of the appeal of this book; value tables and  Transact-SQL syntax documentation contribute the rest. A typical value table  lists all standard database roles, along with commentary on what sort of user is  appropriate for each role. Transact-SQL documentation includes generic "all  available options" statements of syntax, followed by usage examples. Deeper  explanations of what each option does would make the syntax documentation  stronger, but what's here is certainly enough to jog readers' memories and point  them to heavier reference material, if they need it. Keep this book handy if  your job requires you to hop from DBMS to DBMS. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Installing and configuring Microsoft SQL Server  2000 <li>Creating databases <li>Controlling access to databases <li>Manipulating  database contents with Transact-SQL <li>Backup, recovery, and performance tuning  <li>Data Transformation Services (DTS)</ul></span>

                    <span>As a web/dba I use sql server, IIS and windows 2000 server extensively. Last year when I was just getting started I discovered this little gem and it was what set me on the right path. I found this book to be utterly indispensible. I actually have two copies that one I use at home when I work in my own projects and one I use at work.<P>Again in this book as with others in the series I have found single chapters that alone were worth the price of the book, and in a book filled with such chapters you cannot go wrong. The chapter I use the most is 2. In this chapter covers configuring and tuning the sql server database. The chapter starts by looking at guidelines you can use to choose server hardware covering memory, CPU, drives, and more then goes into tools, services and more that you can use to optimize the sql server. In addition to covering the graphical interface, the book covers command-line tools extensive and I found this to be invaluable. <P>Mr. Stanek includes a best practice tip on page 35 that caused a light bulb to go off in my head and helped me resolve a problem with our databases. This tip covers memory usage in various situations and how you can optimize the memory configuration. The chapter goes on and on like this giving out secrets that other admins didn't want to share with someone like me who was just getting started. In short I think the chapter gave me the equivalent of several years worht of in the field knowledge and since I didn't have years to prove myself this was incredibly helpful.</span>

                    <span>Reading through the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Administrator's Pocket Consultant, I was was immediately impressed by the breadth of the information in the volume, despite its small size. Of course, to call it a pocket consultant, you would have to have large pockets (perhaps Microsoft pocket 2.0 -- bad joke).<P>The downside to this work, is that it is largely a rehash, in simpler terms, of the SQL books online. If you are a consultant, and own a laptop, you will probably get more mileage out of carrying it around. However, for those who have not gone completely e-book, this work occupies little space and has more than enough information for most admin tasks.<P>I also recommend this book for admins moving up to SQL Server 2000 from either 7.0 or 6.5, as it gives a concise overview of the adminstration of the new server. <P>While it does not cover every aspect of SQL Server 2000, it covers a large percentage of the material a heavy duty admin would need to know and near-100% (if not 100%) of the information for every day administration.<P>I would give this one 5 stars, and probably should for the intended audience, but I feel the fact that a great majority of the material is just more concise books online information, that the major appeal is the fact that it is on paper.</span>

                    <span>Overall this is a concise good overview of a complex product. It covers all the basics and in general the author did a good job of writing in plain language. Instead of typical Microsoft mumbo jumbo. I do find fault with the chapter on Security. The author refers to the built in "Guest" user account as a login. Which confuses the issue. I think he was confused about MSSQL's security schema as I am. (The security schema can be thought of in 3 layers: logins, users/serverroles/dbroles, and the actual object& statement permissions.) One last note, last time I checked Microsoft's Technet has a free online copy of this book. The book is still worth the full price I paid for it.</span>

                    <span>I knew nothing about SQL Server 2000 before picking this up. It took me from knowing nothing to knowing a lot. The author has an easy writing style which made it easier for me to learn this subject. I looked at a lot of SQL Server 2000 books and at least from my perspective, this is the one to own. Great information makes it well worth the money. <P>If you're anything like me, you may be considering this book as a study guide for 70-228. I recently took this exam and passed. This book is without doubt a text you can buy to prepare for the exam. Sure it doesn't cover everything in the exam, but it comes close.<P>Great chapters on replication and DTS. Very few screen shots. Packs in a lot of material in 450 pages. Absolutely useful for admining. <P>Here's my exam study sheet...

                    <span>This book makes a good administrative tool, particularly for people for whom SQL admin is one of many responsibilities and who therefore can't spend the time for in-depth training. One main flaw in this book is that it pretty much ignores the design aspect of setting up a new database and/or server. For example, the book lacks any information on best practices for the physical layout (files, drives, RAID, etc) or security. It assumes someone (a consultant?) knew what they were doing and set up the server and databases. Personally, I see this as part of the administrator's role. Another major shortfall of this book is that it excludes clustering completely, and as databases are more and more critical to companies, clustering is gaining in popularity.<P>This book is designed as a reference book and it does a decent job as that. The layout, contents, and index make finding what you need very easy. If, however, you want a book to read cover-to-cover in order to learn SQL administration, this is not it.</span>
