                    <span>This is a very good translation of one of Mahayana Buddhism's greatest sutras/canon. I find it to be well written, easy to follow and understand (although not so easy to comprehend--will explain later), and a pleasure to read. Each chapter entails some fascinating tales and fables [as in the chapters that discuss the lost son searching for his father, the expedient methods our beloved Buddha use to deliver and rescue us from our burning house (an analogy for being trapped in our own ignorance) along with the myriad of the virtues and conducts of some of the Great Bodhisattvas such as Guan Yin/Avalokiteshvara (aka Contemplator of the World's Sounds)]. Like all of Mahayana Buddhism's scriptures, you will find that the meanings and intents of the original author(s) conveyed in this sacred literature are much more profound than what seem to be provided at the surface. Therefore, if you are like most people, this is not a book that you would want to read just once. Repeated readings will help the readers become more familiar and better at understanding the different metaphors and analogies, and especially the intent, provided by the Buddha when he first preached the doctrines contained in this wonderful sutra. Kudos to Burton Watson for the excellent English translation.

                    <span>You may do better with the Huvitz translation, "Blossom of the Fine Dharma". The Watson version seems too influenced by the Soka Gakkai, who are a bit dogmatic about the Lotus Sutra. They differ in small ways, but enough that it can obscure the message of unification the Lotus Sutra presents.
<br />
<br />This doesn't mean the Watson version isn't worth reading, just understand how skewed a translation can get, if the people involved in the translation have an agenda. By Watson's own admission in the book, the Soka Gakkai played a big role in helping create this translation. 
<br />
<br />For those in the Soka Gakkai, who might take offense to my opinion of this translation of the Lotus Sutra or anything else. Realize it is only an opinion and if you take offense, come to anger, or seek to hurt me in some way. You may want to investigate what you're really gaining from the Soka Gakkai "vehicle" of Buddhism. I wish you all the best.

                    <span>This is the first copy of the Lotus Sutra I purchased. Even though I had it for years, I didn't have enough background knowledge in Buddhist history and studies to understand it. It is a very complex sutra, so a person just starting off would not understand it without a teacher or at least a manual to guide them through the maze of metaphor and grand images the text presents.
<br />
<br />Aside from the content, this translation of the Lotus Sutra has some weak points. Some of the terms Watson uses are out of place, or are too strong and do not respect the delicate nature of what the sutra is attempting to communicate. It also cuts out much of the Sanskrit terms and reduces the word count. It is easier to read, but is missing important elements. This work is good for English speakers to compare with other works, in particular Senchu Murano's version. 
<br />
<br />Despite some of its faults, however, the verse translations are wonderful. I think Watson has a good feel for such verse translations and are uncluttered and beautiful versus the simplicity and functionality found in other versions. The verse sections are easy- to- remember repetitions of the prose, but Watson is able to breathe life into them and they don't become heavy or dull. In particular his work in chapter 5,"The Parable of the Medicinal Herbs" is stunning:
<br />
<br />"The sun's rays are veiled and hidden,
<br />a clear coolness comes over the land;
<br />masses of darkness descend and spread-
<br />you can almost touch them.
<br />The rain falls everywhere,
<br />coming down on all four sides,
<br />its flow and saturation are measureless,
<br />reaching to every area of the earth,"
<br />
<br />Overall, though the text lacks the feel of the literal translations, it makes up for that it is wonderful verses and ornate but simple language. I have found that this version is much easier to memorize because of its beauty, which has been helpful in study of the text and Nichiren Shonin's commentary.

                    <span>I bought this in the hope, I guess, of finding out more about Mahayana Buddhism, having read a little on the 'Lesser' vehicles such as Zen. What I found in this sutra was a self referencing text with little to offer in terms of teachings you could hold in your hand. This is not to say that Burton Watson didn't do a good job in the translation. (I would have no idea how close it would be to any original text) My problem lies with the message itself. Whereas most sutras I've read will give practical information regarding morals or metaphysical concepts, this text seems only intent on proclaiming that one should have faith alone in the Lotus sutra, as an expedient & most efficient way to enter final extinction. However what the 'lotus sutra' actually is remains a mystery even after the last page is turned. Despite many promises of the 'lotus' about to be revealed by the Buddha, you eventually get to the point in the book where it starts talking in terms of 'Having thus expounded this most wonderful sutra' & wondering where you missed the turnoff. 
<br />The whole book is like an artichoke without a heart. It does however talk of such things as the benefit of parable & simile as ways of describing this elusive message. Perhaps the message may in fact be Zen like in the sense that it cannot be held & can only be talked around, however as an inquiring mind I found this book of faith wanting. If I had no prior Buddhist concepts of 'oneness', 'emptiness' & such things as the eight fold path, the lotus Sutra would be useless as it only refers to such concepts, & spends no time explaining them, not even in simile form as is utilized in Zen. For this reason, despite this being a book written with simplicity, I would recommend it to people only with prior understanding of Buddhist ideas. Having said all that, I might just be missing the point. Perhaps the message of this sutra is in fact not to be disillusioned at how infinitely difficult it may be to become enlightened but to simply have faith that you already are, (even if this is a reference to the future) & hence you only need to ...(?) 
<br />If anything, it is a richly written text spanning countless eons & including innumerable beings. It uses such symbolism to suggest the infinite nature of time, matter & mind & reminds us that we are very small indeed. It is in fact an enjoyable read & does imbue a sense of 'Right action' & 'Noble thought'. It is certainly a worthwhile read for those with some Buddhism under their belt.

                    <span>Watson's translation of the Lotus Sutra is an incredibly scholar work, and instead of using verbose words that may confuse the reader, he makes it applicable to the most simple direct language that the reader can easily read and understand. <p>Many who bought this book revere the text in itself because of the profound message that this sutra teaches. Its Buddhist message on the importance of Bodhisattva and the equality of Buddhahood has been very easy to access to read, unlike previous translations of the Lotus Sutra in the past.<p>The original translation of the Lotus Sutra are many, I suppose that one can easily pick a choice of the Pali text, or Japanese text, but that is the simplified purpose of this new translation of the Lotus Sutra, and since that Watson is a reliable translator who produces scholarly unbiased work, his work is accepted into the mainstream public approval.  <p>Classical Chinese can split in its meaning, and Burton Watson truly notes the many times that the classic interpretation might be used in the text. Footnotes on these split translations may be found in the book. The word "Ho" is easily translated as Dharma, Law, etc. Watson's incredible powers of translation puts into the meaning of the word "Law" in its proper context within the book.<p>The Threefold Lotus Sutra is what many are also familiar with, this is a general title of a compiled 3 independent sutras. But one must realize that the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful law is an independent sutra of its own. All fascicles of the 28 chapters of the Lotus Sutra are intact and complete, with NO omitted chapters whatsoever.<p>All in all, I find this sutra without flaw but with great ease, style and scholar quality for all people to read.</span>
