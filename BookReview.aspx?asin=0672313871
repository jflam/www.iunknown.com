                <span id="Label1">Written by a team of authors, <I>Visual Basic Source Code Library</I> presents dozens of useful tips and plenty of sample code for novice and expert Visual Basic developers alike. Samples here range from just a few lines to several pages of code, grouped by topic.<p> Early examples extend the functionality of simple Visual Basic controls such as list boxes and combo boxes. The beginning of the book also includes tips for getting better control of Visual Basic forms and for better process control, including starting and stopping applications and parsing program arguments. Additional topics include working with serial ports and fonts.<p> Later the book explains functions for retrieving error information and converting back and forth between hex, decimal, and binary numbers. This section features an excellent and extensive sample that simplifies the Remote Data Objects (RDO) object model for easier programming with SQL Server. Graphics examples include a variety of techniques for using bitmaps and animations.<p> When it comes to files, there are superb samples for reading and writing INI file entries and working with ZIP files. There are relatively few Internet examples here, but there are several useful techniques provided for sorting arrays and playing WAV, AVI, and MPEG files for better multimedia applications.<p> Final sections provide a variety of useful miscellaneous tips, such as how to reboot Windows and work with the taskbar. The very last chapter provides a library of Windows NT network administration functions in Visual Basic (with support for such features as adding and deleting users and changing passwords).<p> Throughout <I>Visual Basic Source Code Library</I>, the authors provide access to many useful Win32 functions through Visual Basic and provide a grab bag of tips and tricks that can speed the development of your next Visual Basic project. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>There are some issues with the code in this book, and it is obvious that the files on the CD were NOT bug tested. For example, the Zip32.dll file is an outdated version and does not work with the code given and the website for the new .dll file is gone. Even though there are some issues I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK! It is the best resource out there for small problems that you would otherwise need to go to a forum and post a question. If you are new to VB or are semi-experienced, GET THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>I will say upfront that I have only just started using this book.<BR>But it doesn't take long to realise that at least some of the code has NOT been bug tested (or tested to see if it even works).<BR>Specifically (so far) the Thayer encryption routine (doesn't work - had to download an alternative) and the Getfile routine (locks up after multiple uses).<BR>Will post a further review if matters change for better (or worse).<BR>The book still has a good layout and has lots of useful routines for everyone just dont expect them to work without a little 'tweaking'.</span>

                    <span>While building my own comprehensive Visual Basic library (inproc DLL), I found that I had to browse the web for hours looking for a particular routine that I needed for my newest programming projects. I came across this book while browsing the VB library at a book store, and found that it contained a lot of the code I was looking for to complement my growing library. <P>What really sold me was the ZIP compression code included with the book. The code as presented is based on the freeware Info-Zip DLL library, and the example was not done well. The author didn't spend any time developing the ZIP routines other than showing how to access the DLL. So I took the sample and built a wrapper for the code, which gave me access to individual files inside the ZIP. I can now add and delete any file stored in a ZIP using my new wrapper. But it was based on the code and hints included with this book. <P>There are just TONS of routines in this book that I have found very useful, including a number of network API functions that are very difficult to come by without a reference like this. <P>If you are building a Visual Basic library of your own, then this book is a great asset, and I believe provides more functionality than many of the "commercial" Visual Basic libraries out there. The benefit is that you can see the code for yourself and make use of it in any way you see fit.</span>

                    <span>For a beginner or a intermediate user this book is definitely a must have. It contains a lot of useful codes that are commented and easy to understand. For the advanced user there isn't much to get. If you consider the fact that there are 11 authors to this book then the book seems to be a bit thin. I had hoped for much more code. The language can sometimes be a bit confusing: The code analasys is sometimes more difficult to understand than the code itself.</span>
