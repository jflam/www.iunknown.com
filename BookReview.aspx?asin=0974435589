                    <span>Either the author has no knowledge of java or has paid very little attention to quality on this book. Most of the questions are flawed. Looks like someone did a web search and compiled some questions together in this book.
<br />
<br />Q46 says:
<br />Will the following code snippet compile? Why or why not?
<br />
<br />class A {
<br />static void foo(int x){}
<br />}
<br />class B {
<br />void foo(int x){}
<br />}
<br />
<br />The author claims that this code will not compile. Try it out it compiles fine. It is obvious that the author wanted to say "class B extends A" when he wrote this question, in which case, the answer makes sense.
<br />
<br />This is just a small example of a series of flaws that book comes with. People who claim this book to be good are surely java-ignorant folks.
<br />
<br />Each question is followed by a big empty lined writing space. The author/publisher's idea is to raise the book volume without providing enough material. The 289 page could fit in 50 pages on a regular print.
<br />
<br />The book is not just misleading but also unfair to the smart candidate  who gives the right answer, but is assumed to be incorrect by the recruiters who use this book.</span>

                    <span>Attention Rampart Books: Please hire an editor!!
<br />
<br />The questions were very helpful - not as finicky as the SCJP questions, but useful at determining a person's level of Java understanding.  However, the answers contained a number of inaccuracies and errors. Example: p. 142, wrong signature for toString() is given; p. 143, "In this example, 22=4..." should be "Since 2 (superscript) 2 = 4...".  
<br />
<br />I would have given it four or even five stars had these problems not existed.  </span>
