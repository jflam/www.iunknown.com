                <span id="Label1">This title presents students with real-world system analysis skills and techniques within the framework of the systems development life cycle (SDLC).  Examples and cases are drawn from actual systems projects that enable students to learn in the context of solving problems, much like the ones they will encounter on the job.  Students will find concepts easy to understand through the clear writing style combined with figures that illustrate current technology and concepts.</span>

                    <span>For beginners to Systems Analysis & Design I would recommend this textbook, however do not rely on this for a serious study of Systems Analysis & Design. This book is easy to read, but the "This technique is so great, note - there are some disadvantages" can get annoying at times. Maybe this book could be used as an overview of SAD for managers. Also, the Student Study Guide provided on CD-ROM with the text is not useful for quick review of the text for an exam as each chapter takes up 80 slides and each review of each chapter takes a while to read.</span>

                    <span>Ok, firstly this book has excellent presentation and pedagogy. Somebody took some serious care to ensure this book is visually pleasing and well organized. It contains a CD-rom with summaries of each chapter as well as well as weblinks, glossaries of each chapter and chapter outlines. There are no design tools CASE tools however.<P>Content: This book is a very good introduction to systems analysis and design: the operative word being INTRODUCTION. It paints a very broad picture in reasonable detail. There are enough examples and explanation to be able to extrapolate how to do very basic structured systems analysis. Object oriented analysis on the other hand while covered, is done so in a fairly rudimentary manner (in a toolkit- ie. appendix- rather than in the body of the book). This book is less about the mechanics of how and more about the why and why not and what you're likely to need before you do do some systems analysis. Personally I think the book by WHitten (isbn 0072552360) provides more bang for your buck in that it covers functional decomposition, functional primitives, decision tables, databases, ERDs, prototyping, OO analysis and design in greater depth and with more reality and for significantly less money. WHitten is far less accessible though, the price of being far more technical than this one- and it is fairly old now. This book is very accessible, but that comes at the cost of content. If you want deeper how-to, try Whitten...if you want a easier overview then try this. However the price is quite significant for this book.<P>Pedagogy wise, this book is very good. Lots of pratical examples and expositions of real life situations, review questions (no answers) directions to a web site to chase down further understanding and knowledge. A case study permeates the book which makes it very accessible because the case study I found was interesting and quite 'likely'. The toolkits (ie. appendices) are quite interesting, if somewhat 'lite'. To me, they seemed more of a checklist and point of reference than a substantive learning source.<P>So, in all, a nice, neat book, if rather expensive though. Look at it if you're looking for a broad overview and/or a jumping off point for systems analysis and design. ELsewhere may provide you with work of a more concrete, down to brass-tacks (leveling) nature. It can also serve as a reasonable adjunct to a more technical text, to clarify concepts and provide a philosophical overview of systems analysis and design as well as clarifying some concepts in a clear, concise way. It probably won't teach you 'deep thought' systems analysis and design however.</span>

                    <span>This is a very digestable text for an introductory class to software analysis and engineering. I particularly liked its parallel between traditional structured and OO analysis. It is very readable. My only criticism is that it should have had the discussion on CMM and other development models to set the tone earlier on the importance of this material to the industry.</span>
