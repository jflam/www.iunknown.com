                    <span>As an experienced programmer new to c#, .net and even asp, I found Harold Davis' book to be very good and bringing me up to speed in a wide variety of areas.  Don't expect to become an expert after reading this book, that's not the intent of this book.  It gives clear, concise explanations and examples in a wide range of topics.  I believe it makes an excellent introductory book to .net and c# for experienced programmers.</span>

                    <span>Granted, the author states "this book is to teach you and OTHER EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS..." but he also states something along the lines of "no previous programming experience is absolutely necessary..." but in the first chapter about web services, he never says more than 2 sentences about what a web service really is.  How is it different from an ASP.NET web application?  I had to get the answer from the book "Introducing MS.NET."  Also, the author assumes you have experience with VB, because he doesn't note when he uses VB-exclusive features (such as a Property Get statement) in C#.  Not recommended for beginning programmers with no experience of VB.</span>

                    <span>Who ever heard of a programming book that demonstrates an application enabling users to set up and follow the fortunes of whole societies? A sort of SIM-CITY in miniature. Meanwhile Harold Davis enables you to master Microsoft's new C#.NET programming language with all of its object oriented features and its power in designing web applications.</span>

                    <span>This is the book to buy if you want to learn C# and the .NET Framework. But, specific topics aside, it is just really a very good read about programming. I particularly have found useful the material on type conversion and regular expressions. <p><p><p>I found some other things cool and lots of fun -- the "Guns, Germs, and Steel" OOP application simulating the life cycle of tribes, city states and nations, for example. (Let's hope we don't run into the "Borg Civilization" <g>). <p><p><p>I also enjoyed the "Dinosaur" class examples, the demonstration of how to use map data from TerraServer, the MSMQ apps, and the material on web services as architecture. <p><p><p>In addition to the good programming information, this is a lucid and literate book that uses quotations from Dickens, Thackeray, and others to make its points. Highly recommended!</span>
