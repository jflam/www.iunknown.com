                    <span>Barbara Chase-Riboud did an amazing job with creating fiction using true historical documentation.  It was a compelling and informational read.  One of my friends recommended it, and I am glad she did.  If you want to read about Sally Hemings and get as close to an accurate information, this is probably as close as you can get.  The quotes from Jefferson's writings and other documents connect this story like nothing else I have read.  Definitely a must for history buffs.</span>

                    <span>The story of Sally Hemings, slave mistress to Thomas Jefferson, could easily become a sensationalistic botch for a novelist with unskilled hands.<br>Chase-Riboud writes with such delicacy of feeling, with a fine flair for historical setting, that makes for a strong story. If you want to get a sense of Sally Hemmings, her life, and her surroundings, you might want to skip a history book and start with this excellent novel.</span>

                    <span>This is the most incredible book i have ever read in my life.  Barbra's ability to weave such an amamzing story around the life of Sally Hemmings, brings a complete picture of her family and times.  I could not put this book down!  I have since read its follow up, The President's Daughter which is the story of the children she had with Thomas Jefferson.  That book is also 5 stars.  DNA Test proved in 1998 that Sally's decendents are from her union with Thomas Jefferson.  Why is America so affraid of parenting between masters and thier slaves?  She had his children is for sure, the events of her life is what Barbra researched and brought together for us as a stunning 10 of a book!</span>

                    <span>After watching the miniseries, I was determined to find out as much as I could about Sally and 'Tom'. I did not have to search for long because this book quenched my thirst.  Barbara equisitely researched this novel, which makes the story line flow like a motion picture. The sensitive yet controversial topic took me on an emotional rollercoster. Pick this one up.</span>

                    <span>Barbara Chase-Riboud did an excellant job of writing this book. She creatively writes about the life she presumes Sally Hemings had and the love that she might have shared with Thomas Jefferson. Sally is the narrator of the book and it is mostly about her memories in Paris, at Monticello, and after Thomas Jefferson's death.  The reason this book is so good is because Chase-Riboud did a masterfully job of making Sally's memories come alive and seem almost real.  Chase-Riboud wrote about what we know really happened during Sally Hemings's life and she creatively filled in the rest with situations that Sally might have faced and might have been put in. From Sally's first memory to her last, this book will keep you intrigued and you won't want to put it down. I recommend this book highly and for everyone.</span>
