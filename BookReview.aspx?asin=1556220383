                    <span>I'm a research junkie -- have been almost all my life. My entrance essay for law school was about my various research projects. It worked -- I graduated from Harvard Law School in 1986.<P>Mr. Busby's book provided a critical guide to Google, showing much more independence of thought than "Google for Dummies" and "How to Do Everything with Google." His approach to the subject included technical information that I found much more user friendly than "Google Hacks" and "A Pocket Guide to Google."<BR> <BR>I appreciated the tips on ancillary search issues including such topics as firewalls, Zone Alarm and Mcafee Visual Trace. I also appreciated the way he experimented with different search techniques to see what Google would let you do. It encouraged me to be brave when googling. <BR> <BR>I definitely enjoyed the humor, including the last page of the Internet. The Search Challenge was great fun and I learned numerous search techniques from taking the challenge.<P>Learn Google is undoubtedly the best Google book on the market.</span>

                    <span>Michael Busby's new Book Learn Google helped me to catch on quickly to the fundamentals of Google that go beyond the simple "type in key words" searching. I found the writing very clear and concise, not filled with technical clutter, and the examples in latter parts of the book are easy to follow and enlightening in terms of the more advanced Google search features such as using the phone book, something not found easily in other references.</span>

                    <span>Thank you to Michael Busby for writing this book! I've had many reference books in the past and found them more frustrating than helpful. Not with this book! It is the only book right by my computer so I may refer to it as much as I need. I recommend it highly to anyone who needs help with searches.</span>

                    <span>I found Learn Google to be very helpful in search techniques.<BR>The use of examples makes this a terrific tool for the beginner as well as those who feel that they are beyond intoductory help books. Using the techniques described eliminates the frustration that results in many of us "giving up" on a search. The author makes it an enjoyable learning experience with search games.</span>

                    <span>This very well written book is a must for anybody wanting to learn more about Google. It goes beyond Google's Help section to provide all the pertinent information you need in a very organized way. Eliminate your search frustration and save time. The search challenge and search examples are great.</span>
