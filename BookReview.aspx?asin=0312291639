                <span id="Label1"><div>Wanted: <br>One young woman to take care of four-year-old boy. Must be cheerful, enthusiastic and selfless&#8212;bordering on masochistic. Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived preschooler. Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family. Must enjoy the delicious anticipation of ridiculously erratic pay. Mostly, must love being treated like fungus found growing out of employers Herm&egrave;s bag. Those who take it personally need not apply.<br><br>Who wouldn&#8217;t want this job? Struggling to graduate from NYU and afford her microscopic studio apartment, Nanny takes a position caring for the only son of the wealthy X family. She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn&#8217;t work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. <br><br>When the Xs marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor. Over nine tense months, Mrs. X and Nanny perform the age-old dance of decorum and power as they test the limits of modern-day servitude. <br></div></span>

                    <span>My sister-in-law was a nanny for several years, so when I saw this book, I had to get it for both of us. Every story she ever told me has unfolded in this 306 page book.<P> The authors, former nannies themselves, have a disclaimer at the front of the book stating that the characters written are completely ficticious and not based on any particular past employer. This must be why the main character's name is simply "Nanny", and her employers are "Mr. and Mrs. X". Nanny has just been hired by the wealthy Xes to look after their son Grayer. She is to replace the old nanny, who had the audacity to request a week off to visit her sick sister in Australia. Nanny is just looking to keep her rent money coming in while completing her senior year at NYC, but soon finds that she is drawn to poor little Grayer, who at times can be a pill, but for the most part is just a poor little rich kid who wants his parents to notice him. Mrs. X spends most of her time shopping, planning dinner parties (in the hopes that her absentee/workaholic husband just might spend time with them), and volunteering on several committees. Nanny is used to the explicit demands Mrs. X requests for Grayer, and is not surprised when Mrs. X constantly asks her to do extra chores she wasn't hired for (like picking up Mrs. X's dry cleaning, picking up about 12 different items for a 30 people dinner party, or even escorting Grayer and the Xes to a fancy executive Halloween bash dressed as a giant Teletubby- one of the funniest passages in the book). Or, she'll show up 2 hours past the time she told Nanny she'd be home, leaving Nanny little more than 15 minutes to get to a school to give a speech that will determine whether she passes or fails. Nanny feels it's worth it, though, when the envelope of cash comes at the end of the week ("most nannies are paid under the table", she tells us).<P> Even so, Nanny gets more than she bargained for when, at the Halloween bash, she and Grayer walk in on Mr. X and his Chicago executive (whom the book simply calls "Ms. Chicago")making out. Mr. X acts as if mothing is amiss, and Nanny is left to question whether or not she should report this infidelity to his wife. Slowly, Mrs. X begins to get her own suspicions, and Grayer begins to fall apart under the obvious cloud of neglect and dread that his father has stirred up. Nanny wants to run, but feels obligated to navigate these treacherous adult waters for Grayer, hoping things will calm down on their own. Meanwhile, she's also fallen for a Harvard student that lives in the Xes building, leaving Mrs. X to treat her badly and hurl rude comments at her because she is jealous of the happiness Nanny is finding with a guy. Hhhmph! How can Nanny tread through these tumultuous waters and still graduate from NYC? You'll have to find out for yourself. I read this book in less than 48 hours because I couldn't wait to find out what outrageous thing Mrs. X would come up with next. After listening to my sis-in-law's horror stories, I found that I wasn't surprised about the Xes shannanigans. All in all, a very interesting look into the frustrating world of raising someone elses children under extreme conditions.</span>

                    <span>The book is a breezy, entertaining page-turner that chronicles the employment of a nanny ("Nan") with a self-absorbed, materialistic couple in Manhattan's world of the rich.<P>The shopaholic "Mrs. X" seems a parody of modern-day Upper East Side divas, with her obsession with things as frivolous as the right brand of "lavender water," gift bags for a party, and the latest Prada coat du season. And yet one wonders if she is a real person...certainly one imagines this pair of young authors is at least partially drawing on their real-life experiences as nannies to the Rich and Heinous.<P>Her detailed rants provide much of the comic relief of the story.<P>Yet there is a poignant side as well, as the Xes' sweet little boy, "Grayer," is caught in the fallout between his parents' immaturity and self-absorption, not to mention neglect.<P>Nan's character is likeable and very loving to the boy, but the biggest frustration in the book is Nan's inability to stand up to Mrs. X throughout the book. I felt the ending was unsatisfying and left things unresolved. <P>My only other nit to pick with the book is that it might leave all its readers with the impression that every wealthy parent who has a nanny is necessarily a bad parent and guilty of neglect. I don't think it would be fair to make this generalization.<P>But overall, the book was an enjoyable read and will provide a measure of schadenfreude to people who ever found themselves envying the lifestyles of highly moneyed Manhattanites.<P>- Julia, author, "My Life at AOL"</span>

                    <span>....<P>I read THE NANNY DIARIES quickly in a couple of evenings. The story of a nanny's year of employment in caring for Grayer X, the four year-old child of the rich yet dysfunctional Mr. and Mrs. X proceeds at a brisk and somewhat entertaining pace. During this year, Nanny and her proletariat companions are subjected to countless humiliations at the hands of the X's and their nouveau riche friends. <P>Throughout this year, Mrs. X underappreciates and underpays Nanny on countless occasions, taking advantage of Nanny's attachment to the charming Grayer to task Nanny with countless poorly defined chores aimed at keeping Mrs. X in good social<BR>graces. As Mrs. X engages in a cold war with her husband's mistress to keep the rich and callous Mr. X, she grows more distant from Grayer and more erratic and tyrannical over the entire household staff. <P>When Nanny finds herself caught in the middle of Mrs. X and the mistress's tug of war and her increasingly demeaning work environment, Nanny must decide whether to continue to nurture Grayer or to abandon the toxic situation and find another job.<P>When reading this book, I got the feeling that the authors Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus truly enjoyed dishing on New York's upper class mothers and their objectifying treatment of their children in the mothers' neverending pursuit of status. And to tell the truth, I enjoyed feeling morally superior to the upper crust as much as it seemed the authors did.<P>However, the book ultimately left me feeling deflated and discouraged. No character in this book grows or changes during the year. Not once did any of the employees confront these situations or try and change it. All of the nannies and <BR>housekeepers in this book were so enslaved to their positions that they silently sacrificed their dignity and the needs of their charges to the egos of their employers. Even Nanny, our protagonist, only dresses down both Mr. and Mrs. X via their nanny-cam. And at the end of this year, the lesson she takes away is that people like Mrs. and Mr. X can't change, so why bother trying.<P>Like it's cousin, BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, the book will capitalize on its success by providing another Hollywood star vehicle for some Rene Zellweiger clone. I'll probably see it. My only hope is that some smart screenwriter will modify the plot<BR>so that the X's get theirs, Grayer won't be doomed to the terrible childhood that the book leaves him with, and I'll walk out of the theatre feeling a little uplifted as opposed to demoralized.<P>Dav's Rating System:<BR>5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.<BR>4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.<BR>3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.<BR>2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.<BR>1 star - I want my hour back! Didn't finish the book.</span>

I've While this novel is not my favorite of all time, I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who has a love for a witty, lighthearted, and amusing reads. been reading the Nanny Diaries in concurrence with my assigned reading for my literature class. Perhaps the novel is not as amazing as I proport, but it is certainly a fast and amusing read in contrast with Billy Budd, Demian, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest....The writers' voices are amusing, intriguing, and genuine, and the plot is full of life's ups and downs, complete with a hunt for panties, sea-sickness, and late night computer crashes that jepordize a term paper. I would strongly recommend this lovely read to any and all in search of inciteful and amusing entertainment. I would also recommend to anyone who has read this novel and enjoyed it, any of the novels by Sarah Dessen =)</span>

                    <span>I love to read just about everything but was disapointed by this novel. Unfortunately I couldn't even get half way through the book because it was so boring. I am surprised by the popularity of this book but maybe I missed something. I regret that I paid full price for it! I wish I would have bought the book used or just borrowed it from someone.</span>
