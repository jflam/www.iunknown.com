                    <span>This book was a great biography on the man, Dexter Gordon. Gordon is one of the most underated musicians in jazz history, and it is good that the truth about this man's greatness is finally being told. I recomend this  book to anyone who loves Dexter as much as I do.</span>

                    <span>This book explains how Dexter Gordon was born in Los Angeles.  His father was one of the few black dentists in the 1920's.  Dexter said he wanted to learn how to play the clarinet like his father.  His father agreed as long  as he took music theory lessons as well.  As a teenager he switched to  tenor saxophone and the rest as they say is history.  He got his big break  with the Lionel Hampton big band on tour.  During that tour he learned a  lot from Illinois Jaquette who was playing 1st tenor.  Eventually he made  as many recordings as Stan Getz.  He moved to Europe and settled in  Copehagen, Denmark.  He finally came back to the "States" and  acted in some movies.  For example: "'Round Midnight" and  "Awakenings." Dexter is in a video called "Jazz in  Exile" which you can buy through The Saxophone Journal.
