<br />new publication date: 2004-11-25
<br />
<br />In case you happen to be viewing the
<br />page which details the 014028852X (first Penguin),
<br />you can upgrade to the 014027782X ('new' Penguin)
<br />edition by typing or pasting 014027782X into the
<br />amazon.com Search box (then hit the Enter key).
<br />
<br />In case you drive along parkways (no stop-and-go)
<br />OR daily spend considerable time stuck in jams, I
<br />recommend that you opt for the AudioCassette TAPE
<br />(assuming that the obsolete audiotape format can
<br />still be had when you read this). Should tape not
<br />be available already pre-recorded ISBN: 0553525689
<br />then order the audio Compact Disc ISBN: 0553456121
<br />and transfer the audio CD's sound to a cassette. I
<br />tell you this NOT to waste your precious time but
<br />to enable you to better access specific portions
<br />of the audio book ON TAPE, rather than trying to
<br />pinpoint a part (paragraph or sentence) on CD. On
<br />audiotape cassette (either copied from the CD or
<br />somehow obtained as an original Random House tape)
<br />you can fast-forward or replay tidbits (which tape
<br />allows but CD does not). This is applicable to all
<br />books (and music) on tape versus CD, not just this
<br />title. I believe that the ability to instantly
<br />REPLAY a given sentence (or phrase/word) by going
<br />BACK on audiotape is more effective/efficient than
<br />when one must be limited to the cues or tracks of
<br />a CD.
<br />Hope I helped somebody out there.</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute treat! It is well written, well structured, and very complete. It does expain what happens in the difficult conversations that each of us will experience once in a while.
<br />What I like best is that the book seems to be based upon the principes of Argyris, his ladder of inference and his Model I/Model II behaviour, and that they succeed to do it in a way that you can easily understand.
<br />What I don't understand, and this is the only issue I have with this book, is that I have not found any reference to the underlying theories. This makes the book very readable, but a short index of authors of the theories used by the authors should have been included.
<br />This book makes a great pair with 'The TAO of conversation' from Michael Kahn.

                    <span>I read "Getting to Yes" by the same authors and found this just as well written. The only reason for loosing a star was that I found it somewhat thin on substance and somewhat repetitive from "getting to yes". But it is well structured and their analysis is on the ball. </span>

                    <span>This is an absolutely incredible book.  I bought it as a required textbook for a graduate course. I was somewhat skeptical when the professor said that previous students ended up buying several copies of the book to give as Christmas presents.  But she was right!  The book is truly transformational, not only in how you can resolve current issues but in helping analyze what happened in the past.</span>

                    <span>Being a new corporate coach, I am always looking for resources to use and share with clients. This book has proven to be a very valuable reference personally and professionally. In fact it is becoming somewhat dog-eared from use. The insights and models have been useful for my (sometimes difficult)conversations with clients. Additionally, I share the techniques with clients and ask questions based on the book to help guide the client's development with having better conversations. Conversations are at the heart of all relationships, and are often overlooked in leadership development. For those who are ready to make some significant shifts in their leadership and relationship skills, or help others do so, this book is a great tool. </span>
