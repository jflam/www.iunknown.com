                    <span>I found Uresh's book very useful and easy to read. I am a processor hardware designer and am reading this book mostly to gain some OS perspectives. I was able to pick up a lot of information that I can apply immediately at work, such as the virtual memory architecture and the interprocess communication sections, etc. This book also contains a very interesting history of UNIX.<P>I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>As someone whose occupation is providing support for developers on the UNIX OS, this book is worth it's weight in gold. It explains in sufficient detail all of the major features of a modern UNIX kernel, including kernel threads, user-space threads, signal generation and handling, scheduling, IPC, filesystems, etc. I've read just about every popular book printed on UNIX internals and this is my favorite. It reads easily and the description is great. Importantly, is organized so you can skip around and get the information you need.<P>Congratulations to Dr Vahalia! I think you've written the seminal work for UNIX students for the next few years.</span>

                    <span>This is the best OS book i have evern seen, really deserve 5+ starts. It gives many design issues/ideas of real exist OSes which helped me greatly. If you are really interested in OS or do some creative design job, this book is a must see. It seems next edition of this book will be unleashed next February. But what i concern is next editon may be delayed, because there are really too much new things these years, Linux 2.6 ... And I hope next edition will have some introduction to Windows Kernel. I am a UNIX fan, but you see, Windows conquer the PC's desktop, it surely has some shining points. GREAT JOB, URESH VAHALIA. :)</span>

                    <span>A certain small and select set of books can be found in any serious programmer's library. "UNIX Internals" is one of those books.<P>I originally encountered "UNIX Internals" in my undergraduate operating systems class. At the time, I liked it, but I didn't really appreciate its full beauty until I re-read it with a few years of operating systems experience under my belt. I work as an operating systems programmer for a living, and whenever my knowledge needs brushing up, I go back to this book.<P>Uresh Vahalia does an excellent job of comparing and analyzing the approaches taken by different operating systems, rather than merely describing them. His deep understanding of the topic is what really sets this book apart. In addition, it is well written, conveniently organized, and thoroughly indexed. If you really want to understand operating systems, this is the perfect book for you.<P>As others have noted, this book is not for the beginner. You should probably have a minimum of three years of computer science experience before picking this book up.</span>
