                    <span>For me, No More Drama was a great book!! I don't see how anyone could not like the first book, Drama Queen, because it was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read in my life. No More Drama was an awesome read too. The story line was easy to follow and the characters were the same as in Drama Queen if you read the book from cover to cover. I loved it!!!
<br />For the reviewer "Miss T", if you didn't like the first book, why did you bother to read the second. As far as La Jill Hunt's writing skills, they must not be too bad because she's still making dough selling books and according to the other reviews, has fans for life - myself included. From reading your review, I think you have some type of personal beef with the writer (which is what a lot of immature people do these days on the review sites)and you're just giving her more drama to write about. I look forward to your next book, La Jill. As an Essence Best-Seller myself, I know you got skills!!! </span>

                    <span>I can not believe that I have been had not once, but twice!!!! When I purchased and read drama queen, I was needless to say very disappointed.  So, when no more drama came out, I figured everybody deserves a second chance.  Therefore, I went out and purchased the book. VERY BAD MISTAKE and a waste of my money.  The first book was avaerage.  This one, a total disaster.  The story had nothing to do with the first one.  I mean, you would think with titles like drama queen and no more drama, there would be some similarity to the first book.  There were so many characters, I could not keep them all straight.  I think that miss hunt has a lack of writing skills, or this was a poor attempt to put real life stories into a fictional setting.(A lot of authors do this).  Get it together miss hunt, or you won't be around very long. Of course, this is strictly my opinion only.  Afterall, this is what these book reviews are for ,right?</span>

                    <span>This was also a good story, of course after I finished Drama Queen I had to see what in the world would happen next. I found this one to be just as entertaining as the first one. Where this one is more about the men in Kayla's life I think Ms.Hunt kept them all in the circle quite nicely.

                    <span>But like the title says, there was No More Drama. This book was good, but it lost a lot of the distinction that the first "drama" series had. Kayla wasn't the main focus anymore and Terrell kept falling for the wrong women. That was making me mad! LaJill still does her thing, just not as well as the first time. </span>

                    <span>Just when you think the drama has ended Ms. Hunt has brought us even more drama.  This was a great sequel to Drama Queen!!! This time it's the men who are bringing in the drama as DJ Terror and his brother keep it coming.  Great Sequel Ms Hunt~~!!</span>
