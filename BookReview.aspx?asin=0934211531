                <span id="Label1">Volume II of our series containing the major stories from the Shahnameh opens and closes with tales of tragic conflict between a king and his son: Prince Seyavash and Prince Esfandiyar are both driven from the court by their foolish fathers to confront destiny and death in distant lands. Interwoven with Seyavash's story is the tale of his stepmother Sudabeh's lust for her young stepson, and of his escape from her tricks by the famous trial by fire; Esfandiyar's story involves the last combat of the great Rostam, a fight to the death which leads to Rostam's own demise at the hands of his evil brother Shaghad. Between these two stories the reader travels through a wondrous landscape of romance (Bizhan and Manizheh), demons (the Akvan Div), heroic despair (the tale of Forud) and mystical renunciation of the world (Kay Khosrow's mysterious last journey).</span>

                    <span>In this second of three planned volumes, Dick Davis continues in his effort to provide a fairly broad translation of the Shahnameh. He effectively utilizes the prosimetrum form, a mixture of verse and prose (naqqali in Farsi), where verse is used to accentuate periods of heightened tension.<P>In addition to being a fine literary accomplishement, this series of volumes is quite beautiful and heavily illustrated throughout with reprints from 16th and 17th century manuscripts. The books are very sturdy and make for excellent display.</span>

                    <span>I recently saw this book as well as the first volume in the planned three-volume set in the Bay Area in connection with an exhibit of art work from various Shahnameh manuscripts currently on display. In all fairness to the publisher and the author , it should be stated that this is a magnificently illustrated art book, not simply a text. The full-color enlargement pictures of miniature fragments from medieval Persian manuscipts are breathtakingly beautiful, and the high price no doubt reflects the fact that this book was a masterpiece and very expensive to produce. It is exquisitely produced and for those who can afford it well worth the cost. The rest of us should urge our public libraries to acquire it as it gives an in depth knowledge of this ancient history which very few of us are even aware of. This book would surely be a collectors prized possession.</span>
