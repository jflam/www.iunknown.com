                    </div>
                    <span>Ben Hogan may or may not be the greatest golfer ever, but he certainly wrote the most influential golf books of all time. He more than anyone else established and propounded the fundamentals of the modern swing. Though some of the material is inevitably dated--younger folks may not even know what the heck a spoon is--most of what he says is just as helpful today as it was over fifty years ago.<P>This book is especially appropriate for beginners and there are three essential bits of advice that are all someone really needs to know when they pick up a club for the first time :<P> (1) The basis of the golf swing is a good grip. A good grip "enables the two hands to act as a single unit."<P> (2) "The first movement in the downswing is the turning of the left hip to the left. Forget about your arms, hands, shoulders and club at that moment and start the hips turning, led by the left hip."<P> (3) "My advice to the beginning golfer is to go ahead and hit the ball as hard as he can right from the start. He will be wild for a time. That's only natural. Later on he can straighten out his hooks and slices with minor alterations to his swing. But if he doesn't learn to hit the ball hard right at the start, he will never be able to get distance without a major overhauling, because his speed and timing setup will be something less than his full power."<P>That's it; that's really all you need to get started. It's a terrific little book, complete with quaint illustrations of a little golfer in pleated slacks and a sweater demonstrating the lessons. Of course, there is one more more thing that Hogan emphasized and no book will help you with; if you want to improve you have to practice, a lot.<P>GRADE : B+</span>

                    <span>This book is best geared to beginning golfers who want a broad view of what different clubs are for and to get a general idea of how the game is to be played. Illustraitons accompany everything described, and is a good match for Hogan's Five Lessons.<P>One thing that should be kept in mind, however, is that the info in the book is somewhat dated in regards to equipment and some parts of the swing. For example, Hogan calls the forward bend in the downswing for a driver a natural part of the swing, which for his day it was. Now, we look at it as the right time to use a stiffer shaft as the premature whipping of the shaft leads to inconsistant shots.<P>Putting is also another area the book is not great on explainations, but this has more to do with Hogan's own view of putting more than anything else.<P>If you don't want to pay more to get the PGA Manual or another, more complete and modern volume on golf, or simply want to see what has and has not changed in golf over the past 60+ years, this would be a good book to pick up. For the beginner as well this may help add some light to a few aspects of the game that are not clear from other, more extensive books.</span>

                    <span>Always interested in getting better in the field of my golf game, I read this book with the hopes of gleaning some useful information on the swing, and how to hit the ball farther. Hogan offers a breakdown of the swing, and it is easy to follow. Not only is the book illustrated, Hogan did a nice job articulating how to get better and hit it longer. One thing I found that was very helpful was in the last two pages, Hogan talks about course management, and tricks to saving shots when you are playing in all types of conditions. This was a very informative and useful section of the book. <P>There are many golf-instruction books out there, and this book stands the test of time, as did Hogan's golf game. I recommend it to any golfer.</span>

                    <span>This was written in 1948 and is utterly useless as a "how to" guide for a beginning or intermediate golfer in 2001. I'm sure that even Hogan, if he were alive, would tell you not to buy it as an instructional guide. It is, however, FANTASTIC for the scores of photographs of Hogan at all stages of his swing. You'll clearly see why this man hit the ball in a way that we amateurs never will and 99% of professionals never will. As someone else pointed out, this is Hogan's swing before his near-fatal accident and before he developed a controlled fade. Some of the positions he achieves are mind-boggling and completely beyond anyone without his supreme talent. For the best quality in the photographs, I'd look for a used hard-cover copy (they are still plentiful). Buy this, but only as a piece of golf history. For instruction from Hogan, buy Five Fundamentals or one of the recent videos analyzing his swing.</span>
