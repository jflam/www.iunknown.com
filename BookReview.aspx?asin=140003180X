                    <span>"I must remember, thought Mma. Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life; at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the verandah of my house in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white. Here she was then, Precious Ramotswe, owner of Botswana's only detective agency, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency-an agency which by and large had lived up to its initial promise to provide satisfaction for its clients, although some of them, it must be said, could never be satisfied. And here she was too, somewhere in her late thirties, which as far as she was concerned was the very finest age to be; here she was with the house in Zebra Drive and two orphan children, a boy and a girl, bringing life and chatter into the home. These were blessings with which anybody should be content. With these things in one's life, one might well say that nothing more was needed." (Page 1)<P>So begins Alexander McCall Smith's latest book, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN. He has a wonderful African storytelling voice. Parts of the book are funny, sad, educational, and touching. <P>Mma. Ramotswe deals with real and moral problems. Although the troubles take place in Africa, they are universal and range from searching for people from the past, cheating spouses, looking for love, raising children, trying to improve one's financial status, trying to right a wrong, to dealing with competition, and more.<P>I enjoy the way Mma. Ramotswe solves her clients' problems as well as her own. There are no guns or high-speed chases. There is no fighting, cursing, or the likes. An element of danger and adventure exists in Mma. Ramotswe's work but the detective uses her wits and manners when dealing with others. The plot is always refreshing.<P>I love the way THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN transports me to Mma. Ramotswe's world. I feel like I'm a part of the detective agency. I feel like I'm riding with Mma. Ramotswe in her little white van along the Botswana plains. I feel like I'm sharing a cup of red bush tea with her and Mma. Makutsi. I feel like I've tasted a slice of the cake that Mma. Potokwani always serves Mma. Ramotswe at the orphanage. I feel like I know the kind and gentle Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. I feel like I'm in the same room with his funny mechanic apprentices.<P>Another good read.<P>Fafa Demasio</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Reading Alexander McCall Smith's stories of Precious Ramotswe and her associates in detection and in life is like having a visit with old friends: comfortable and reassuring. The graciously gentle and peaceful manner of resolving difficult situations in typical Botswanan style is in direct contrast with the lifestyle of modern America. <P>There is a slow and easy nature to Precious Ramotswe, her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and her assistant Mma Makutsi. But that nature does not preclude initiative and innovation. For even up against the competition of a chauvinistic new detective agency, Mma Ramotswe maintains her calm and patient demeanor and continues to serve her clients with discretion and wisdom. For an African woman in her late thirties, she demonstrates inner peace and strength beyond her years. Her ambitious assistant's new business, a typing school for men held after hours, provides a counter plot which enriches the story line. In addition, the interwoven staffing of Matekoni's car repair shop with the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, further links Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi with the young mechanics who work for Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. This is a true family of characters, including the children of the orphanage on the outskirts of town, from which come Mma Ramotswe's extended family of adopted children.<P>Once again, there is logical conclusion to the predicaments of Precious Ramotswe and her associates. These gentle twists to the unraveling of the unjust bring a smile to the reader and an appreciation for the beloved culture of these Botswanan natives. They honor, revere and love their nation home. And the reader comes to know that reverence in an almost personal way, although vicariously.<P>The love of a natural Africa with a citizenry that prides itself on respect for life, nature and one another, reminds one of the sweeping beauty in the opening shots and lines of the movie, "Out of Africa". Smith obviously has the same love of the Dark Continent and its people as did Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, whose voice over in the movie says, "I once had a farm in Africa." The past that Dinesen revered is the present of Precious Ramotswe. Do not miss the opportunity to quiet your soul with a visit to these good people.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've read all four of the Alexander McCall Smith books centering on Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and I plan on reading the fifth, so clearly (to me, anyway) there is something attractive, charming, and addictive about these little literary gems. <P>The gentle wisdom of the main characters, the insights into human nature that are revealed in the succession of episodes, the often lyrical references to life, nature, and culture in Botwana, all of these things render Smith's books fun to read and at times spiritually uplifting. This latest episode, featuring the professional and romantic adventures of Mma Rowatswe's trusted assistant, the typing prodigy Mma Makutsi, is every bit as charming and readable as the first three books in the series, so one cannot say that Smith is losing his touch as he cranks out book after book.<P>There are, however, some troubling aspects to this series that I confess have come to bother me. Example: in his laudable effort to portray life in Botswana in a positive light, Smith's narrative at times takes on a kind of paternalistic tone, the subtext of which seems to be, "these people are simple, yes, but they are gentle, good, and in a kind of salt-of-the-earth way, wise." A style that apparently seeks to keep the prose simple and accessible ends up making the characters themselves often appear childlike and one-dimensional, lacking in real human depth. Because of this, I can see how these books have come to be so whole-heartedly embraced by rat-race-weary urban Western professionals daydreaming of a "simpler life and a slower pace." <P>This tendency toward flattening out the stresses and complexities of life in rural Botswana would be more forgivable were it not for the fact that this is the nation with the highest rate of HIV infection on the planet. This is a startling, sad, alarming reality that probably will surprise many readers of these books, and yet this overwhelmingly serious problem is never mentioned even once in Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics. I certainly don't expect the author to dwell in his stories upon this health catastrophe, but his failure even to allude to the problem seems to me an almost calculated part of his overall strategy of presenting a romanticized, sanitized, they're-poor-but-they're-happy image of life in Botswana. <P>People who have read and appreciated all of the novels will surely interject at this point at least one, "Yeah, but..." Noteworthy among these could be the fact that in a previous book the principal male character, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (always, cutely, referred to by this full title), is diagnosed with clinical depression. Yes, this is strikingly "real to life," certainly, but even here the simplistic, dumbed-down approach to human problems advanced by Smith emerges, as Matekoni's apparently severe depression is completely obliterated almost instantly through a simple presciption for antidepressant drugs. Anyone familiar with the issue of depression knows that overcoming this malady is seldom so simple as is portrayed in Smith's novel. But problems in Smith's Botswana tend generally toward rapid and total resolution, much in the manner of prime time television episodes.<P>Still, I confess that I find these novels to be soothing and easy bedtime reading, and I'm sure I'll end up buying and reading the next one, despite my growing reservations about Smith's overall project.</span>

                    <span>I had been meaning to finish this book for a while. It was good. I liked it but didn't love it. This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. What made the first few so enjoyable (the simplicity of the story/characters/mysteries) suddenly felt dull to me in this installment. So I tossed to book aside with only about 50 pages left to finish, not really caring whether or not Mma Ramotswe got married or whether or not any of the cases got resolved. I did go back to it over the weekend simply because I was in dire need for something to read and couldn't figure out which book I wanted to crack into. In the end: Happy Botswana Ending. Was I expecting anything different? The next one in the series, Full Cupboard of Life, sounds just as exiting as the rest: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni installs a new seatbelt into Mma Ramotswe's van, Mma Makutsi's new house will have running water, everyone drinks a lot of bush tea. Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful storyteller but his books should be reserved for when you're coming out of a depression and want something simple and happy to read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In Alexander McCall Smith's latest installment, the reader is once again treated to the unfolding life of Mma Ramotswe and the cast of characters that make up the world of the No. 1 Ladies Dectective Agency. In this story Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has recovered from his debiltating depression and lends a wonderful richness to the storyline. His character as always is understated and charming and we wonder when the the engaged couple will actually get married. Mma Makutsi figures prominently in the plot and not only does the reader get to know her character more deeply but McCall Smith is able through her musings make several profound comments on the state of women in society today. A new dectective who is both arrogant and inept is introduced and it plays nicely in a humorous way against the womens thoughts about their place in soceity. Mma Ramotswe's primary case involves a successful man who wishes to atone for his past errors and in doing so is able to move on with his life. This is easy enjoyable reading, with beautiful prose and descriptions of life in Botswana and thoughts on life that apply to us all. A pleasure!</span>
