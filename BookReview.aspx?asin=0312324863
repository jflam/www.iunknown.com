                    <span>Enjoyed ONE THING AT A TIME by Cindy Glovinsky . . . its subtitle says it all: 100 SIMPLE WAYS TO LIVE CLUTTER-FREE EVERY DAY.
<br />
<br />There's nothing here that you may have not already thought and/or read about . . . yet to actually do as Glovinsky suggests is a whole separate matter if you're anything like me; i.e., prone to have papers accumulate . . . it seems that whenever I get rid of piles of them,
<br />their friends return in even greater force!
<br />
<br />Glovinsky presents each tip in the form of a short chapter that contains such sensible bit of advice as the following:
<br />
<br />One thing at a time;
<br />Stop perfecting, start bettering;
<br />Make a list of minitasks;
<br />Throw away coupons; 
<br />Put up pictures now;
<br />Move from quality to quantity; and one I need to think some more about:
<br />Break the clipping habit.
<br />
<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:    
<br />Invest a little time and money that may save you trouble in the long run. Buy 100 stamped postcards. For the next month, each time you receive a piece of junk mail from an outfit that has frequently contacted you, send its employees a postcard pointing out that they're wasting money and asking to be removed from their mailing list. If the junkmail 
<br />contains a 1-800 number or an e-mail address, use these means to contact them as well. Some businesses will ignore your request and continue to send you unwanted mail, but others will get the message. Dump all junk mail into the recycle bin as soon as it comes in the door. 
<br />
<br />If they're on the floor, put them in the hamper. If they're in the hamper, put them in the laundry baskets. If they're in the laundry baskets, put them in the washer. If they're in the washer, put them in the dryer. If they're in the dryer, hang them on the line or fold them and put them back in the laundry baskets. If they're on the line or in the laundry baskets, 
<br />put them in the closets and the drawers. Clothes that get stuck somewhere 
<br />in the laundry cycle create big mounds of clothes clutter, all of which can be easily removed. Just keep the clothes moving until they're all back in the closets and drawers and watch the piles disappear.  
<br />   
<br />When you're ready to sort, stand next to a recycle bin and toss everything useless into it. Don't bother to open envelopes if you're really sure they're junk mail. Then divide what's left into three piles: items to send or give to somebody else, action items and file items. Get rid of the Send/Give pile ASAP by mailing or handling papers over to their proper recipients. Meanwhile, put the File items--papers you want to put away--in a to-file box. Its size depends on how often you're able to file and how many papers you typically have. Schedule filing time in your planner within the next week to empty the box.

                    <span>If you have clutter, this book is a must-have.  The tips are practical and how-to without being just Band-Aids.  They get at the root of the problem and show you how you'll feel afterward.  Covers such things as preventing junk mail, shrinking a book collection, parting with coupons etc. that never get used, getting errands done in less time, and actually fixing the broken stuff that's been waiting for months or years.  I can't say enough good things about this book--GET IT.  And read it all.</span>
