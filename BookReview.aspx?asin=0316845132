                    <span>I bought this book before I had children because I was trying to understand my own personality a little better. Now I am trying to type my 2-year-old son-at least I am having a great time trying, even though I suspect I won't have any final answers until he is able to express himself a little more. Even at this age though, it helps me to identify different traits and not worry about the differences between him and other children in his environment. I think my son is an ESTJ and I am an INTP-so this book has helped to remind me that my son's way of relating to the world is different from mine, and that I need to consider his actions and needs in his context. Also, I like the fact that different learning styles, activity levels, and verbal abilities are discussed as well as the standard introversion vs. extroversion Myers-Briggs typing.</span>

                    <span>It is hard to underestimate the value of understanding personality type for developing effective business, spouse, peer, and parent-child relationships.  I would speculate that many family conflicts are due to different personality types not being able to communicate with one another, or a child not fitting the behavior model established by the parents or siblings.  Still, this is only one tool in the parental toolbox.  Personality type should not be the only tool used, it doesn't mean that the tools of common sense and tradition are totally thrown out the window, yet it is a very useful tool and one that many parents are not aware of. <p>If you are not familiar with personality type, this book serves as a great introduction to understanding both your own and your child's, and may well be the first of a number of books you explore in this area of psychology.  If you already have some knowledge about personality type (such as having read 'Please Understand Me II' by David Keirsey), it is still worth picking up a copy of this book.  You will find the specific examples and descriptions of how personality type manifests itself in children at different ages to be helpful and insightful.</span>

                    <span>Like all parenting/advice books, you have to pick/use the parts that make the most sense to you...and this is one that I've gotten the most out of, by far. The helpful hints for how to work with kids, at various age levels, based on personality types, are VERY useful. With one child like myself, and another very much the opposite, this book has been especially helpful in not only appreciating how/why they are different, but how to work with them accordingly, instead of just based on my own type...VERY INSIGHTFUL, WITH CONCRETE, USEABLE SUGGESTIONS.</span>

                    <span>Okay, I admit I am an INFP, so you can ignore the rest of my review since I'm so irrational.  But I can't help but see the big picture of their suggestions for parenting these different "types" of kids.  With Thinkers, parents should sit back and hope that their children learn manners on their own (lest parents be thought of as irrational).  With Feelers, the kid was already born diplomatic, so parents don't need to teach the child manners.  I don't think it's a good idea to encourage parents to forego teaching children diplomacy because this is supposedly a skill children are "born with".<br>  I also have to view the descending "functions" with skepticism.  For instance, I am an INFP, so my primary function is Feeling and Secondary function is iNtuition.  My least available function is logic, even though this would be my primary function if I was an INTP.  Pardon my ignorance, but this is illogical.  If I was more Extraverted OR more of a Judger (ENFP or INFJ), I would suddenly, either way, be less of a Feeler and more iNtuitive.  But, strangely, if I was more Extraverted AND more of a Judger (ENFJ), I would be no less of a Feeler and no more iNtuitive than I am now.  How is this neurologically possible?  Apparently, neither extraversion nor orderliness alone makes the kid more creative.  They have to be extraverted AND unorderly, or introverted AND orderly.  Furthermore, if I was low on the Feeling orientiation, Feeling would be both my primary and least available function, and Thinking would be both my primary and least available function.  If anybody has ever met such an irrational but super-logical character, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will have to assume that such a temperament is impossible.</span>

                    <span>I was introduced to this book by a good friend of mine - Thank you Shirleen!  She knew that I was having trouble understanding my son who is 7 years old.  When he was a baby I could feel his needs and wants instictively as a Mother.  During this past year, I felt that he was developing into a boy, which I could not always understand and I felt myself becoming more and more frustrated with myself.  I could understand my daughter 99% of the time, where she is coming from... But when it came to my son, I really felt helpless.  I could not understand his logic and his moods and also his retorts to certain situations.  This book helped me understand WHY my son does and says certain things and also helped me find solutions on how to deal with his feelings and weekensses and strengths.  I highly recommend this book to any parent in need, cause there is hope.</span>
