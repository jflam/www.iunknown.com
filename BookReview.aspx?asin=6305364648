                    <span>This flick is a true pleaser and I believe it is Cameron's best. It has amazing action and special FX and an engaging James Bond type story line that spoofs the genre with humorous dialog and amusing characters, as well as over the top espionage credibility. I wanted so much to hate Tom Arnold as I have always found him annoying. His witty charm makes his character the surprise hit of the movie and now I actually can admit that I like him (at least in those types of roles). Arnold S. is very suave (a la Bond) and has some characteristic humorous dialog also. Bill Paxton is classic as the smarmy cheeseball salesman guy (his best role since Aliens) who seduces Jamie Lee Curtis. Jamie Lee Curtis is sexy (if you can believe it) even though her character is painfully gullable and naive. True Lies belongs in any action aficionado's top ten DVD or Laser Disc collection.</span>

                    <span>True Lies is one of Cameron's less successful attempts to mix characters and romance with strong action - but even then it's not half bad. Arnold has to save the world from nuclear terrorists while trying to save his marriage at the same time. Not bad, but the film doesn't quite pull it all together.<P>Cameron's action scenes are his usual fine work, but with a lighter tone that pervades the movie. There's also plenty of humor to go around, which is also a nice touch. But Cameron can't quite fit Arnold's personal and professional lives together for the big showdown without feeling like there's some scenes missing. (How *do* the terrorists track him down at the most inopportune moment? For example)<P>A bit more editing and a few more explanatory scenes could've improved True Lies, but all-in-all it's still an enjoyable popcorn muncher.<P>The DVD itself comes with a nifty menu, but only the standard trailer+chapter select features.</span>

                    <span>True Lies is an action romp with several story lines that flow into each other for the big climax. Harry (Arnold) and Helen (Jamie Lee) are in a stereotypical middle-class marriage where the husband is totally career focused and because he is "successful" he thinks all is well at home. Helen is bored and miserable because she feels invisible to her husband. Their daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku - Faith from Buffy) is alienated from them both and headed down a very bad path.<P>Harry has a secret life as a spy for a super secret government organization. His partner is Albert (Tom Arnold in his best role / performance anywhere) and they are closer to each other than to anyone else in their lives as they travel the world saving us all from the bad guys.<P>The terrorism they are battling could have been ripped from today's headlines. However, I doubt such a film could be made today because of political sensitivities. I was surprised how much of it held up. <P>But this film is about fun more than drama. The action is exciting, but preposterous and the scale of the action crescendos toward the final ridiculous aspect of Harry flying a Harrier jet while saving his daughter, fighting the big bad guy and fending off an attacking helicopter all at the same time. Another problem, a small one for this kind of action film, is the endless weapons fire focused at the heroes to no effect, while Helen can simply drop a machine pistol down the stairs and wipe out a platoon. It is a delightful seen, however. If you can suspend disbelief for this, the movie can be a lot of fun.<P>Many have called the film misogynistic, and I suppose you can see some of that in the film. But Bill Paxton's wonderful performance as the sleazebag Simon is easily the most despised person in the film and he is a male. <P>There are other find performances in the film. Faisal, played wonderfully by Grant Heslov (we should see more of him), is a terrific character who holds a lot of the story line together even though his role isn't that large. And Tia Carrere as the mercenary art dealer Juno is simply one of the best things in the movie. Art Malik is great as the villain Salim Abu Aziz. Mr. Malik provides the right kind of energy for such an over the top film. He provides the kind of passionate megalomania that makes all the fighting seem appropriate.<P>With all the sub-plots weaving in and out, the humor, and the fine performances, I think this is one of Arnold Schwartzenegger's best films. And I thought his pairing with Tom Arnold was great. Too bad we never saw them together again.</span>

                    <span>Even Tom Arnold is good in this movie, and that's saying alot. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show, but Arnold is great as the butt kicking spy. Amazingly they even have Middle Eastern terrorists as the bad guys...who would have ever thought of that? Most movies these days stay so far away from that subject they can get downright comical in their efforts to find a bad guy. <P>This is just a plain fun movie. Bad guys, stuff blowing up, hero dad saves the day. Great for a Saturday evening to get a few laughs and relax.</span>

                    <span>For sheer appeal and entertainment, "TRUE LIES" surpasses any of the Terminator Series, Twins or really any other Schwarzenegger film. It is about as perfect a movie as one could hope for - with all the action, humor, drama and sex appeal there is to offer. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely incredible as the plain Jane wife who becomes entrapped in a world of espionage and shadows. (The strip tease was one of the best scenes in filmdom ever.) <P>Tom Arnold was also perfect for his role as the patient buddy spy who is the perfect cover. Tia Carrere was also perfect as the evil villaness with a flair for the upscale. Whoever did the casting deserves a medal. Dialogue, action, plot - I loved it all!</span>
