                    <span>I have not seen a text book worst than this. It appears like some one collected material from here and there and put together. Poor grammer and lack of Language flow will misguide your ability to understand the subject. And it will be too late by the time you realize. It should not be called as text book, it is simply collection of notes by students sitting in a class.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I know the writer/teacher and currently attending her lecture, I must apologize for being unfair to her. I have decided to use other texts like bible references. I would strongly recommend to land on different planet if you want to master in C++</span>

                    <span>This book is too incomplete, even for just focusing on OOP with C++. I have another book which I also find inadequate, however while that book only diverts about 3 chapters to OOP, it does a better job of covering it then this entire book.
<br /> 
<br /> OOP Using C++ focuses too much on tutorials and spends little time explaining the concepts that the book introduces. Many examples at the end of each chapter take up several pages because the author steps you through every step of creating the example (once should have been enough... after the first chapter the user should not need to be reminded to "Open a new file in your C++ editor and type the statements that include the header files you need..."). The examples used in the book are all very similar and you quickly get tired of typing in the customer's last name...
<br /> 
<br /> The book has too much useless text and it is often hard to find a piece of useful information. It is basicly a programming novel. It covers the absolute basics of OOP without going into enough detail about how things really work. This is not a good thing, even for beginners, because if you do not learn how to use OOP well, you'll never write good code....
<br /> 
<br /> This is a truly boring and useless programming book that I regret ever purchasing. If you are a beginner, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, it will break your C++ style and you might find it hard to adapt to what is considered "good programming style" at a later stage.
<br /> 
<br /> I recommend C++ Primer, it is much more detailed, costs less and covers much more C++ for beginners, including OOP.</span>

                    <span>We used this book in our advance C++ class, which was taught by the writer, Prof. Joyce Farrell herself. The writer is an A++ teacher in UWSP. She is not only a teacher who has a terrific skill in C++ but also she has a wonderful way of teaching. The way how she approached the course was just PERFECT!. This book is written exactly 100% similar to how she gave a lecture in class. In this book, there are a lot of exmples that are very good for a person who hate to read theory to much instead of jumping to the codes. I want to say thank you to Joyce Farrell for all her teaching to me. She is a MOST-WANTED teacher & writer.</span>
