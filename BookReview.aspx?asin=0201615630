                    <span>While I don't have anything against using a *little* humor to get a point across, the entire point of this book is apparently to be humorous while trying to be an introduction to the Java language. It fails in both respects. It is so heavily laced with attempts at over-the-top humor that it becomes unreadable. The reader is left sifting the text for actual information about Java, and often coming up empty-handed. I finally concluded that this book is actually intended for *experienced* Java programmers who have the background to appreciate the humor, but who obviously would have had to have learned their Java elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>I don't get the negative reviews. Well, whatever. This is pure, hilarious, brilliant, hurts-when-you-laugh from a guy who knows his Java. Don't expect to learn anything about Java. It's just a stream of great injokes. Includes enormous curly braces, examples of white space, meeting "the primitives", explaining interfaces with a guy who's the mayor and a sheriff and a painter and a whole bunch of other things. And the illustrations are hilarious for anyone who's suffered through too many life cycle illustrations, those silly marketing layer diagrams, and "simple" illustrations of how Java works.<p>Anyone who knows the difference between an interface and a class will love this.</span>

                    <span>A complete waste. No learning or humor. There's barely enough material for a magazine article let alone a book. Now, after trashing the book, I'll see if I can find a sucker who doesn't read reviews to re-sell this book to.</span>

                    <span>I was given this book by a friend who didn't want his copy anymore.  I have since been unsuccessful in passing it off to someone else.<br><br>Mr. Egremont's humor is hit-or-miss, and mostly, it misses.  It seems clear that he has some knowledge of the Java language, but for the book to qualify as a humorous parody, I expect the jokes to be more relevant and less nonsensical.</span>
