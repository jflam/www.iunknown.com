                <span id="Label1">"There's no such thing as a mature business," only a growth business, write leading business consultants Ram Charan and Noel M. Tichy. <I>Every Business Is a Growth Business</I> is a step-by-step manual for turning any company into an expanding company. The book is packed with real-world examples and key concepts for executives to get their businesses on an upward trajectory. <P>  Charan and Tichy assert that growth requires sticking to two principles: "strategy from the outside in" and "changing the genetic code." The first means putting yourself in your customers' shoes and asking what are their needs and how are they changing. From this perspective, a company can redefine its market and come up with creative ways to expand demand. The second principle, changing the genetic code, means revamping the corporate culture so that a new mindset for growth can thrive. As anyone who has ever worked in a company knows, corporate culture is a hard thing to overhaul. The book gives concrete steps to make that happen; sometimes it requires whole new leadership. <P>  Charan, who has been on the faculty of the Harvard Business School and Northwestern University, and Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School, speak from experience. They've advised companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and Mercedes-Benz. One of their heroes is the late Roberto Goizueta of Coca-Cola. When Goizueta took over, the company was on cruise control. It dominated the U.S. soft- drink industry--a market that many experts believed was mature with nowhere to grow. Under conventional thinking, Coca-Cola was maxed out: it would do well just to defend each tenth of a percent of market share against archrival PepsiCo. But in the 1980s, Goizueta framed the question of market share in a different way. Goizueta got his top executives to see that globally, Coca-Cola accounted for less than 2 ounces of the 64 ounces of fluid that each of the world's 4.4 billion people drank on average every day. In one simple stroke, he redefined the market and opened vast new areas of opportunity for his company. Coca-Cola became an immensely successful growth company under his leadership. Similar stories about Compaq, Citibank, and other companies abound. <I>Every Business Is a Growth Business</I> is an inspiring and practical book for business leaders looking to grow their company. <I>--Dan Ring</I> </span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite leadership books by two authors with whom I have a great deal of respect for their advice.  The premise of the book it that by looking at the entire business landscape affecting your clients, there are larger opportunities in which to solve the client's CEO issues beyond the immediate customer orders.  Written with real world examples, some of which were first hand consulting jobs by the authors, the examples are detailed and written so you can relate them to your own work.<p>I have applied these principles in my own professional work and find the concepts very useful in business growth development efforts. In almost every growth opportunity development session with employees, collegues and clients, the going in premise is that there is not enough budget or too limited a market, thus preventing us from pursuing a given opportunity.  Applying the author's concepts to creating the expanded view of the opportunity almost always proves to incite a bigger picture for everyone. <p>The book may require better book bindings because I refer back to it so often that I will one day wear out the bindings!<p>Read and Expand the Pond!  Highly Recommended.</span>

                    <span>Ram Charan and Noel M. Tichy make the case that no company, even a very large corporation, should think of itself as a mature company or as part of a mature industry. If you look at the market broadly and take your customer's perspective, you will always find room for growth. First, look at your customers' changing needs and think of how your company can expand beyond its current market. Then, expand that approach throughout the company. The basic message may sound familiar, but Charan and Tichy bring a strong how-to approach to their directions for implementing it in your company. We at getAbstract.com appreciate the utility of their mix of examples, graphs, charts, and workbook, which should prove helpful to executives and company owners.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be one of the best I have read on the topics of growth and change in some time. This book is devoid of the psychological "fluff" that permeates many other books in this genre. It reads  like a practical recipe to be followed by those commited to growth and  change. Not at all unlike Welch's annual letters to the shareholders of GE.  Whereas the annual letters of others companies drone on and on about what  was, surrounded by the fluff of what can be, Welch's letters read like a  master plan for action, which can be understood and driven to all levels of  the company.<p>The authors define "desirable" growth from the  perspective of shareholders as capital efficient, profitable growth. They  then describe a framework for "growing the pond you fish in".  Next, they point out the necessity of changing the "genetic code"  of the organization so that growth is pursued by leaders at all levels in  the organization. They describe a framework for producing this change in  the genetic code of the organization. This framework is primarily based on  a "teachable point-of-view" developed by the leadership, and  constantly reinforced and reiterated through various carefully designed  "operating mechanisms". The teachable point-of-view consists of  key business ideas, values, emotional energy, and "edge" (on  tough calls). <p>I've read this book twice already, and may read it again.  I've started to implement the methodology in my company...so far, so good.</span>
