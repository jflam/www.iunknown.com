                    <span>This book lives up to its title: It is a Comparative Compendium.
<br /> 
<br /> Definition of Compendium: 
<br /> 
<br /> 1. A short, complete summary; an abstract.
<br /> 2. A list or collection of various items.
<br /> 
<br /> No, this book will not teach you the basics of Flying Star Feng Shui. It was never the premise to begin with, and is clearly stated in the preface: 
<br /> 
<br /> "This book is not meant to be anything from which one could learn classical flying star feng shui, but it is an attempt to compare different methods used and taught by different classical schools and to investigate their common background."
<br /> 
<br /> For intro. material, I highly recommend The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui, 2nd Edition by Elizabeth Moran and Master Joseph Yu, Flying Star Feng Shui by Stephen Skinner, and A Master Course in Feng Shui by Eva Wong. Supplement your knowledge of Trigrams by learning about the I Ching through such books as The Complete Idiot's Guide to I Ching by Elizabeth Moran and Master Joseph Yu and Chinese Astrology by Derek Walters.
<br /> 
<br /> If you've already bought this book, and you're serious about Feng Shui, keep it! If you haven't bought it yet, put it on your Amazon Wishlist. IMHO you'll be wanting it soon enough!</span>

                    <span>Of all the hundreds of mass-market books available on Feng Shui, only a select few deal with Classical Feng Shui, specifically Xuan Kong Flying Stars. Authors that come to mind are Eva Wong, Joseph Yu, Larry Sang, and David Twicken. Now I must add Ulrich Wilhelm Lippelt to the list who has authored a classical work with a most needed advantage. This book is not about learning a particular style of CFS, because a background in Flying Stars is neccessary. Mr. Lippelt compares the varying styles and systems of CFS and brings the reader to a point of understanding not just the hows but the whys of the processes at  work needed to bring about specific results from certain Feng Shui Formulas, no mean feat, to say the least. <br>    For example, there are varying methods concerning the timeliness of the stars, their meaning and interpretations. One school advocates the involvement of the Earth Base star along with the Mountain and Facing Star in determining the energy values of a home while another school primarily concerns itself with just the Mountain and Facing stars. Readers familiar with both approaches might have found the differences between the two approaches disconcerting. Fortunately, the author's experience and knowledge become evident in his comparisons of the methods. I no longer felt the confusion I had held for so long, but felt I gained a better insight as to just how these differing approaches worked. Now knowledgable choices could be made. Contradiction was replaced with understanding. <br>     The author openly explains many concepts that heretofore were held secret for lack of a better word. Among the topics so well explained are Castle Gate, Replacement Stars, and Water Formula of the Two Heavens. Most importantly, not just what these concepts are but how to apply them. The list goes on.<br>      In summary, even if you do not have a firm grasp of Classical Feng Shui, get the book anyway. When you do understand the basics, certain question are bound to arise. This book should save you time in clearing up confusions that could linger unneccessarily.</span>
