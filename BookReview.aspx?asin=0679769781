                    <span>To mr_tack_driver<p>I just had to respond to your question "did you see that happening when Clinton was president?"  Just what planet were you living on during those 8 years?  So the republicans are just trying to do what is right and not give anyone hell?  Does the name Ken Starr ring any bells in that empty head of yours?</span>

                    <span>I think Carville's greatest strength comes from being an unapologetic, entertaining, not-overtly intellectual liberal. Although I feel a little bit of trepidation about the fiery, "Conservatives Are Evil" rhetoric (I'm inclined to believe that liberals should stay above the partisan fray that the rabid neo-cons so adore), I'm realizing that possibly the only way we can win back the White House and Congress is by stooping to the lowest common denominator and striving to entertain the electorate. <br>    <br>     Anyway, Carville is a hilarious writer, and an inspiring general for young liberals like myself, and this book is excellent at outlining the inherent hypocrisy, immorality, and illogicality of many of the platforms of modern neo-conservatives. I recommend it wholeheartedly.</span>

                    <span>This book would be a very funny book if it were not so true. <p>We have been mislead for years now and many gullible Americans have walked willingly into an imaginary world which has been presented as kind, supportive, and evenhanded. Mr. Carville in We're Right, They're Wrong has turned on the lights and the there is much scarring for the baseboards, as any self-respecting cockroach would.<p>Read this book... it is time for progressive democrats to stand up and start stomping our feet...</span>

                    <span>Carville writes like he speaks -- full of passion about everything. One can almost hear his Cajun drawl and rapid-fire style in this book.<br>Of course it's partisan. It makes no pretense about being otherwise. <br>It's also packed with examples of Democratic successes, suggestions on improving the country and tips on battling the sound bites, accusations and fabrications of the neo-conservatives.<br>Sources are footnoted and verifiable and he quotes acknowledged experts and sources to back up the points he makes. This truly could be a handbook for the spirited progressive, if only it were longer.<br>Even despite its slim size, It's packed with useful information written in an entertaining style.</span>

                    <span>When will these liberals ever learn?  Instead of actually getting out there and doing something, they just sit back and take shots at Republicans all day.  While the Republicans are just trying to do what they feel is right, the Democrats give them as much hell as possible.  Did you see that happening when Clinton was the president?  Of course not.</span>
