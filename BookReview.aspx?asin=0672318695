                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Sams Teach Yourself Qt Programming in 24 Hours will teach the reader how to quickly and easily write graphical programs for both X Windows-based systems (Linux, etc.) and Microsoft Windows systems. Consisting of 24 one-hour lessons, Sams Teach Yourself Qt in 24 Hours is divided into six sections that guide the reader through the language from the basics to the advanced functions. The first section of the book teaches the fundamentals of Qt. Building upon what has been taught in the first section, sections two through six show the reader how to apply that knowledge and make Qt a programming language they can use to fulfill their programming needs. Topics Include the Qt Class Library, basic and advanced graphics, creating custom GUI widgets, OpenGL, Netscape and Explorer plug-ins, and Qt GUI builders.</HTML></span>

                    <span>Before I went out to buy this book, I visited the publisher's and Amazon web sites because I was feeling apprehensive about how trivial a 24 hour Teach Yourself series get. After I had gone through the review, I feel that there is hope in learning C++ GUI development after all. Qt and Daniel, the author give beginners as a programmer a chance to shine. I attempted Visual C++ with a couple of books, and nothing came close to a good concept as portrayed as Qt and Daniel as a wonderful writer. I agree with one of the reviewers before me, there should be a CD consists of Qt GUI tools software bundled with it.<P>I gave it 5 stars because it's easy to follow, which I presume people with some basic C++ programming background would be interested in purchasing this book and this book covers alot. I'm going to look into a more detailed book by the same author which is also on sale and listed on Amazon if I'm not mistaken.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for the last version of Qt but not great for the current one (as of 8/27/2002). It also has significant proofreading errors in it, implying that it was written in more or less the same amount of time that you're supposed to read it in. However, it is an easy-to-read introduction to Qt programming and is nice for beginners (I recall a quote saying "of course, if you're a professional programmer you wouldn't have gotten this book" -- and I *am* a professional programmer). The O'Reilly book is a better choice if you already know programming; and if you don't know programming you probably shouldn't be starting with Qt. :)</span>

                    <span>This book as mentioned before has many of grammar errors. If you're from a country other than the USA and cannot speak proper English, this is your Qt book. It is a wonderful book for beginners to get started with. The intermediate and beyond will find this book to be boring, or they will learn one thing from it. It is the only 24-hour book I own.</span>

                    <span>Don't waste your money. This book would be helpful in getting you started using Qt, but the examples and coverage are no better or more complete than the tutorial included with the qt package. This book introduces basic Qt tools, but doesn't give any suggestions for how to use them in actual applications. Even the simple example applications at the trolltech website are more practical than the examples in this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I would've given it five stars, but I didn't like how it tried to fill up the 24 hours with how to use the widgets. Qt is pretty consistent (like any good library should be), and most of the methods work similarly enough that it's easy to figure out (like how to set the size). I would have like to have seen either more advanced topics or more indepth coverage of the advanced topics.</span>
