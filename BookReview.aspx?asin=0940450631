                    <span>This volume provides Lincoln's speeches, writings and selected letters from 1859 through 1865.  This period is the year leading up to his election in 1860 through his assassination in 1865.  You will get to read amazing letters from the commander-in-chief trying to get his generals to fight and win the war, letters to all kinds of people covering topics public and personal, proclamations suspending habeas corpus and emancipation, his addresses to congress (our State-of-the Union Addresses used to be delivered by letter to Congress), and some of the greatest treasures in American history: the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address.  It is stunning that in all this writing, so much of it powerful and worthwhile, that these two brief speeches so obviously deserve to be engraved in stone for all ages to read and take into their souls.
<br />
<br />It is awfully moving to read the material related to the conduct of the Civil War.  He was very strong in his determination to destroy the Rebellion, yet he has very touching notes about his sick child and is very human in his communications with intimates.  
<br />
<br />This volume also has a chronology of Lincoln's life and great notes on the texts.  Note particularly the Associated Press copy of the Gettysburg Address that was contemporary with its delivery.  The version most of us know is a finished copy prepared for publication.  The differences are subtle and not all that important, just interesting to note for style and rhetorical power.
<br />
<br />I strongly urge you to have these two volumes on your American History bookshelf.  Simply, they are important and you will learn a great deal reading through them.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this collection of speeches and letters knowing little about America's most beloved president other than what I had learned in my high school history classes.  My first impression was "Boy, where have all the good presidents gone?"  Aside from the famous speeches we're all familiar with, Lincoln was a prolific man of letters and an amazing presenter of ideas ahead of their time.  Our sixteenth president wasn't perfect, but neither was our nation.  During perhaps the most crucial period in U.S. history, thank God there was Abraham Lincoln.  I grew up as a Democrat, but if Lincoln were running for the presidency today, he would be the first Republican to get my vote.  This Library of America edition of Lincoln's speeches and writings is a beautifully bound volume that I will cherish for years to come.</span>

                    <span>This is the second volume of the Library of America Project devoted to the  works of Abraham Lincoln.  It covers the period after the Lincoln-Douglas  Debates and includes many of the records of the Lincoln Presidency and the  Civil War.  The standard Lincoln materials are included, of course, such as  the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Inauguaral  Addresses.  But there is immeasurably more.  We see Lincoln writing to his  Generals, Cabinet members, and other national leaders in his attempt to  hold the Union together.  We see a lincolns agonizing over military  discipline and frequently pardoning deserting soldiers.  We see Lincoln  dealing with Indian issues in his day; and we see him supporting the use of  black troops in the War effort.  This volume is highly useful in  uderstanding the Civil War.  Equally important it teaches the nature of  leadership and fortitude.  Finally, Lincoln is one of our Nation's great  prose writers and the book deserves reading for that reason alone.  The  Library of America is to be commended for this volume and for its ongoing  series.</span>
