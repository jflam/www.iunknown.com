                    <span>I love PowerPoint.  There is so much you can do with it and it really is professional quality right at home.  This book teaches you the innermost workings of PowerPoint... I have been using PowerPoint for years and never knew there were so many incredible features until reading this book.  For example, you can learn how to animate graphics and text, how to add music and sound effects playing in the background of slides, and how to post your PowerPoint presentation to the Web.<p>The instructions are really easy to follow.  There are step-by-step instructions for doing everything hands-on on your own computer.  Plus, there are tons of helpful illustrations if you get a little bit lost along the way.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that if you are taking this as a class, the instructions for some of the do-it-by-yourself assignments are a little vague and I had a little bit of trouble figuring out exactly what the authors meant for me to do.<p>If you have to give presentations of any kind at school or work, PowerPoint is an invaluable tool and this textbook can help you make the most out of your presentation and really impress your colleagues, professors, classmates, peers, whatever.  I recommend this book to everyone!</span>

                    <span>This text is a nightmare... The authors' PowerPoint 2000 text would have to be given 4 or 5 stars. Beginning with chapter 2 the steps in the various instruction sets provided do not map well to the PowerPoint screen. The reader is left to make extensive use of the software's help system.<p>I am MOUS certified in PowerPoint 2000 and am attempting the newly-named Microsoft certification in PowerPoint 2002... I was disappointed in this text--- I would recommend highly these authors' texts in Word 2000, Word 2002, and PowerPoint 2000.<p>The New Perspectives Series,in general, are superior to the Shelly-Cashman Texts.... but not in this case. Thomson Learning publishes both and has added a third series of texts.<p>It is obvious that the exercises were not worked through thoroughly by the authors--- otherwise these errors would have been caught</span>
