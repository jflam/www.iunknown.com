                <span id="Label1">"A life without direction is a life without passion," says motivational specialist, therapist, and career counselor Barbara Sher. In <I>I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was</I>, a sort of broader, less dense, and less intimidating version of <I>What Color Is Your Parachute?</I>, she reveals how to "recapture long lost goals, overcome the blocks that inhibit your success, decide what you want to be, and live your dreams." <p> This is a perfect book for new college graduates or anyone sick and tired of languishing in a dead-end job or relationship--yet reluctant to make drastic life changes due to uncertainty about what would actually inspire them. <I>I Could Do Anything</I> combines the I'm-not-buying your-excuses inspiration of Dr. Laura Schlessinger with the soothing, analytic encouragement of Dr. Martin Seligman in his classic <I>Learned Optimism</I>. In other words, Sher will pick you up off your butt and get you moving. She's included enough self-analytical exercises in here to save you hundreds of dollars in therapy. <p> Whether you're looking to make improvements in your job or personal life, Sher will teach you how to determine what your goals are, and how to successfully reach them--even if right now the only thing you know is that you're vaguely to very unhappy and haven't the foggiest idea what to do with yourself.</span>

                    <span>I was fortunate enough to receive this as a gift during my freshman year of college. Didn't know what I wanted to major in at the time let alone what to do with my life. Nine years later, I'm definitely closer to defining the goals in my life and becoming more accepting of myself. This book was invaluable in helping me become the person I am today. Finding yourself and what you want out of life doesn't happen overnight, thank heavens for that.
<br />
<br />I'm not into books that berate the reader and scream "just do it you loser" like some of the more popular books in this genre. If I wanted to be pissed on I could just spend more time with my parents. So if you're into THAT school of self-help then this book is not for you. But if you've got a sense of humor, are patient, realistic, and need some helpful words of encouragement, then it wouldn't hurt to check this out.</span>

                    <span>I LOVED this book.  The only book on finding a career direction that has been helpful to me.  It was so different, in the way that it explained to me what has been blocking me from going after my true desires.  The other books I have read just did a bunch of career assessments and personality assessments.  Who needs that?  I know my personality already, I don't need someone to test me on it.  Barbara Sher went so deep into a person and why their desires remain repressed.  She had different chapters for different types of situations.  It was like a personalized book.  I highly recommend this book.  It gets to the root of the problem, and motivates you to get out there and go after what you want.  She tells you to start NOW, which is scary, but that is what is stopping you...the scare.  Buy this one...I promise, you will be glad you did!!</span>

                    <span>Not bad for identifying some basic grievances you may have about identifying your career(s). Encouraging in a general way. Writer has sincere, conversational style. At times the "inner child" analyses were a bit much; I don't read a lot of these kinds of books I guess. Personally I don't work well with exercises that get thrown in at the end of chapters. When I'm engaged in reading I find it a bit disruptive to have to stop and write every few pages.</span>

                    <span>I haven't finished the book yet, but... <p>I am a 22 year old 5th year junior in college, and for the longest time I haven't had the slightest clue what's wrong with me. I find this book very emotionally challenging, and use it for just that: a challenge. I agree that it is rather vague, but there are some of us who have to start from scratch on this sort of thing. I DID NOT find Parachute to be at all helpful (after spending several weeks on it) for the simple fact that *I don't know what I want*! That was a very frustrating feeling, and this book speaks my particular situation. <p>I got a little turned off by the positive-attitude thing; after a while I just didn't want to listen to it any more. I'm VERY glad I'm not listening to this on tape.<p>Not for the very experienced, I imagine, but definitely for me, as a rock-bottom-ground-floor beginner.</span>

                    <span>This is a book that has received mixed reviews by readers.  Some perhaps are insulted about it's hand-holding approach, others perhaps are offended by its "overly ying" encouragement for expressing emotions.  <br>I can only say that I related fully with this book.  It confronted me with my resistance, and encouraged me gently to face up to it.  My immediate reaction was wishing the people around me had also read this book, because it was still very difficult speaking with them about dispelling the rat-race mentality.  Being from Latin America, the tendency to pigeonhole people around their first career is much stronger than in industrialized countries, which makes the pressures against changing careers that much greater.  <br>My only regret with this one is having lent it out too soon, after reading through it only once, but I was in that much of a hurry to share the inspiration!<br>The lessons from the book, in any case, have stayed with me, more than 5 years after reading it.  I still suggest some of the exercises from it on ocassion, to to loved ones who can't quite face up to their displeasure with their "established" careers.   <br>I am tempted to buy another copy soon, to hand over once again. I kind of like the feeling of seeing my friends getting started on their own gentle awakenings.</span>
