                <span id="Label1"><div>Addressing the storming controversy of EJB head-on, this guide discusses framework problems and common traps that can snare unwary developers. Advice is provided for choosing persistence strategies beyond EJB entity beans and a list of several entity bean antipatterns. Also offered are session bean and messaging antipatterns and a compelling discussion about how and when to use problematic stateful session beans. Solutions to difficult problems such as effective builds and performance tuning are furnished. Designed for EJB developers, architects, programmers, and project managers, this authoritative reference attacks basic Java programming problems to establish antipatterns as a serious field for Java developers in a well-known context.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I was disappointed by Tate's "Bitter Java". But "Bitter EJB" is totally different story.<BR>I would strongly suggest everyone read it also get "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and <BR>Development". These too books compensate each other very well. Both of them obviously <BR>favor JDO over Entity Bean. Is JDO the future? still unsure:-)</span>

                    <span>This is definitely a book for the advanced Java programmer looking to refine his understanding of the pitfalls of EJB, and more generally J2EE, development. I was tough on Bitter Java because of it's technical editing. This book is decidedly better in that department but I can't give it all five stars because the difference in tone between the chapters and between the authors is noticeable and somewhat distracting. In addition the anecdotes about white water remain and I think they are unnecessary. That being said, if you are a J2EE programmer, this is a required book.</span>

                    <span>If you are a Java/J2EE developer, reading this book will save you hundreds of wasted hours. <BR>There are plenty of books on J2EE design patterns and best practices. <BR>Bruce Tate goes well beyond these discussions and outlines the effectiveness of these strategies, antipatterns, and above all: alternatives. <P>Simply put, this is the only book that puts J2EE into perspective. <BR>Sales/Marketing have convinced developers that EJB is the "golden hammer" for enterprise solutions. <BR>This book will enlighten you to creating effective J2EE applications without falling victim to market hype. <P>It is my personal opinion that Bruce Tate is the most effective technical writer since Richard Stevens. <BR>The writing is clear and to the concise, every page directly addressing common roadblocks in EJB development. <P>For readers with a solid understanding of J2EE principles, this book will help you navigate around common pitfalls and outline effective solutions. <BR>For less experienced readers, it will help you plan effectively. <P>After reading a dozen J2EE books, Bitter EJB stands tall as "required reading".</span>

                    <span>Good book. Lots of useful information.<P>However, if you are not a native English speaker you will often be having hard time in trying to get through the forest of American idioms. This book is stuffed with them. Surely, informal language livens up the material, but only if you get to know this language well enough.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must-have for the serious J2EE developers. For example, many teams realize in EJB development that entity beans are overkill and complex enough to really drag a project down, yet very few books tell you this. Bitter EJB is the exception - it gives tried and true advice from those that have really been there and worked through the issues. In my extensive J2EE development experience I have learned the hard way many of these antipatterns. Do yourself a favor and don't learn these pitfalls the hard way - let Bruce, Mike, Bob, and Patrick join your team and steer you away from common mistakes, and towards best practices.</span>
