                    <span>I probably found this book too complete; sure Prof. Stroebel gives all concepts for large format photography, but in my opinion all these concepts are put in the book one near the other without a logical education steps for the reader. So in my opinion if you already have got those concepts you will sure understand them, but if you don't know those concepts, you will have a lot of difficulties to learn them by this book.</span>

                    <span>This is THE reference standard for view camera photography.  Prof. Strobel fully explains the different types of view cameras and how to best take advantage of the bellows and various camera movements.  This book first appeared in 1967 and has only gotten better with each printing.  Prof. Strobel was one of my professors at RIT 30 years ago and I still find myself using his excellent book as a reference.</span>

                    <span>View Camera Technique is a fantastic, all encompassing book  covering not only view cameras, but all aspects of photography. Everything you've ever wanted to know is in this book. It will be a reference book that I will pull off the shelf for years and years. Well done and well worth the price!</span>

                    <span>This is THE work on view cameras.  Probably the most comprehensive single-volume work, it should be required reading for everybody.<p>It does not cover all the latest models (use the internet for that) but view  cameras have not changed fundamentally in decades.  The work covers all  basic and intermediate topics, as well as many advanced techniques.<p>A  book to read and re-read several times.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>There are not many books on the subject and this one is probably one of the best, along with "Using the view camera" by S. Simmons. The camera brands presentation part summs up into a hard to read table, not really helpful; but otherwise, this is a very good book for learning and perfecting large format techniques, even if the inside layout is slightly in retreat from what the cover would let us expect.</span>
