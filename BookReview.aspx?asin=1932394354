                <span id="Label1"><div>Written for enterprise Java developers who have become disillusioned with the complexity and bulk involved with EJB development, this programming tool demonstrates how the Spring framework can make coupled code easy to manage, understand, reuse, and unit-test. Spring's employment of inversion control and aspect-oriented programming techniques to encourage loosely coupled code is explained, providing programmers with the ability to use JavaBeans with the power and enterprise services only previously available in the heavier Enterprise JavaBeans.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Information on the web about Spring can be found if you searched enough.  The problem is that there was never any kind of clear guide and process by which you could either learn or make good use of the features in Spring.
<br />
<br />I spent the better part of 2 hours last weekend at the bookstore reading through some chapters of Spring in Action and Spring PRO.  I had already looked at Spring Live and was just too fond of it.  Spring PRO turned out to be as dry a reading as the paper it's printed on.  Sure it's got a lot of information, but geez, who needs that much, and who can read all of it when it's so hard to stay awake during the reading?
<br />
<br />Spring Live offered something the other books didn't:
<br />1- It's easy to read.  The Authors, Craig Walls and Ryan Breidenbach, have a pretty good sense of humor, and has obviously put great effort in using good examples which everyone can understand.  If you don't know how a student class registration works, you probably didn't go to school.  I could have done without the Knight and singing what ever examples, but hey, they didn't hurt anything and got the message through.
<br />
<br />2- The book flows in the natural way one would expect to work with Spring.  I like the sequence of chapters, as Craig and Ryan layed them out.  They start with a quick yet fairly thorough Spring startup, and run from there into wiring, AOP, dao and on down to complete the project.  it just works and makes sense, and I don't feel like I'm left wondering about something.  They always seem to get to what you need to know as you think about it.
<br />
<br />While SiA didn't have the depth of Spring Pro, it still covered everything and then some, with accuracy with what you need to know.  It's written from the standpoint, at least in my opinion, that you're a smart engineer, this is not your first time looking at Java or a framework, so they tell you what's going on, and let you figure out things further if you want to and when you need to.  You're not plastered with a bazillion pages of details, leaving you skimming page after page for what you want to know.  Spring Live just lacks in details, and seems more driven towards those who want to integrate Spring with other frameworks like Struts, and just seems a little too happy on self promoting the author's own tools.
<br />
<br />I don't know what these stupid low rated reviews are talking about, it seems they were posted before the book was even published.  Sad.
<br />
<br />If you want to get going with Spring the right way, get this book and don't waste your money and time on anything else.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

                    <span>The Java development world continues to grow. Spring (often used in conjunction with Hibernate) is among the newest and is gathering quite a bit of attention. Spring brings almost all of the capabilities of EJB to the world of Plain Old Java Beans. 
<br />
<br />In this book Walls and Breidenbach have done a superb job of introducing Spring. Often computer books seem to leave out the first forty pages that describe just what it is that they are trying to explain. 
<br />
<br />In this book Chapter 1 is just about forty pages and is a really excellent introduction. It is titled A Spring Jump Start, but before it jumps off it has sections like Why Spring? This section starts off with a description of the process of writing and testing a bit of code using EJB. It then goes into What is Spring? This section talks about Spring both as a concept and with some very brief code samples. Then there's Understanding Inversion of Control, perhaps the biggest thing that Spring brings with it. And after that is Applying aspect-oriented programming, the secong big Spring thing. After reading this chapter the reader should have a pretty good idea just what Spring can do for him. 
<br />
<br />If you are still reading after Chapter 1, the remaining chapters give you all the rest of Spring's capabilities using an approach that's kind of tutorial related, kind of reference book oriented. 
<br />
<br />Compared to most computer books, this one is easy to read (intermediate level, you will certainly need to know Java before you start this book), and has just enough humor mixed in to help keep you awake (after all, it's still a computer book).</span>

                    <span>There's been a bit of a rush of books about the Spring Framework recently with a number of publishers releasing their own titles one after another. Without having read those other books, I feel confident in saying "Spring in Action" won't let you down. It's a wonderful introduction to the framework and a handy reference for those desperate moments with the Spring configuration files.
<br />
<br />What I especially like about "Spring in Action" is the style of writing. The book is largely about how to configure this and that and still I read most of the book in one sitting. The text flows well and the humor sprinkled throughout adds a nice touch. The other good things about this book include a good coverage of the Spring Framework itself. Only some parts of the Acegi security framework have been left out, as far as I can tell, and those features (ACL's and run-as) are not what I'd call essential so it didn't bother me much. In addition, the authors give a good comparison (brief, but a good overview) of Spring and other technologies and frameworks such as EJB, Struts, WebWork, Tapestry, PicoContainer, HiveMind, etc. Furthermore, the authors show you how to integrate with these other frameworks (except for the other IoC containers) and view technologies like JSP, JSF, Velocity and FreeMarker. Add to that, the index looks very comprehensive which is an important detail for a book that one might use as a reference afterwards.
<br />
<br />So, what separates this book from perfection? For one it had a lot of little typos, the text did exhibit a bit of repeat (didn't I just read this sentence on the previous page?) here and there, and I feel like mixing multiple ViewResolvers was covered too lightly. I don't consider these to be big issues, though, and I won't hesitate for a second in recommending "Spring in Action" for someone looking to get started with the framework.</span>

<br />Specially author use only spring-web module while talking about web application. This method make readers focus on spring framework so well understood.</span>

                    <span>This book  looks like from Spring insiders! Well structure with deep understanding of Spring framework. I specially like the authors put the Spring MVC to relative late chapter, after detailed discussing of the framework as a whole. English is easy to read and understand, good nonnative English reader like me. The only thing I feel little bit short is the Spring rich client part, I expected more. Overall, great book to learn Spring!</span>
