                    <span>This is my third book by Laurie Ulrich on Photoshop and Elements, and it's great. I got the Elements Bible, and had her Complete Reference on Photoshop, and they're both great. This author is GREAT at explaining things, and gives really realistic examples that make sense. I wrote to her with a restoration question after I got the Bible, and she not only answered the question, but she retouched the photo I sent her and told me how she did it. That made me want this book so Icould do what she did without help, and it's been a great investment. GET THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>I usually search the web and ask friends for help when I have to learn software, but the cover of this book made me want to check it out, and I'm glad I did. This is a great book!!! Laurie Ulrich really knows about retouching and restoring photos and you can tell she really cares about her readers and has a feel for the kind of stuff people want to do with their family photos, old pictures, and so on. The book is fun to read and is written in a very easy friendly and readable style. She doesn't talk down to you and she doesn't make a lot of jokes (like in a Dummies or Idiots book) to make her point. The author respects her readers and what they want to accomplish and I recommend this book to anyone who wants to really learn Photoshop Elements and start making use of all those photos you have lying around or the really damaged ones you thought would never be useable again. GET THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>I have been retouching photos for awhile now and recently bought this book just to check it out. I found myself not being able to put it down. From beginning to end Laurie has done an oustanding job presenting each step in simple easy to understand steps. I dont think anybody will be dissappointed buying this book.</span>

                    <span>I've been given the job of restoring my family's huge collection of photos. We have some going back to the 1800's, along with newer ones taken with Polariods where everyone has red-eye. I'm using the photos to make a big family tree book and a web site for both branches of my family. Restoration and Retouching with Photohop Elements 2 has taught me so many great tricks and I've been able to salvage a ton of the photos I thought were completely lost forever. We had burned photos, pictures that kids had drawn on, and one that a dog had chewed up. I've been able to put most of them back together and its all thanks to this book. I recommend this well written and fun book to anyone who has pictures they love and want to keep, because it even tells you how to care for your printed photos so you'll have both the scanned version you fix up and the original picture. Another thing I've also learned how to turn photos into presents by adding cool frames and making photos look like paintings and drawings.</span>
