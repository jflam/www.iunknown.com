                    <span>Excellent, excellent book! Don't listen to reviews that say this book doesn't help if you are taking a sociology class. The author is a very good writer- he doesn't talk in circles, he's specific in examples and the topics are very well-organized. The author doesn't hesitate to mention proven facts, and at the same time, he's able to maintain a genuine tone of concern, no haughtiness. One thing, though- John Macionis churns out a new edition almost every year, it seems. There is already a 7th edition out. You could probably get away with buying an older edition and still do well in your sociology class. Check with your instructor to make sure. My Soc class actually requires this 6th edition, but I am using the 5th edition, in Spring 2003, and I have an "A" in the class. There is an additional chapter in the 6th that the 5th does not have- on sexuality, I think (I apologize if there are children reading this review), but my class was not assigned to read that chapter, so I was fine. I am not sure what additions the 7th might have. Hope this helps.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very interesting and learned quite a bit from it. I bought it last semester for a sociology course I took. Because my professor was also the dean of that department - it amplified the learning experience I got out of the book. Each chapter also starts out with a little snippet of a story that relates to the theme of the chapter. I very much enjoyed the course and the learning experience gained out of the book.</span>
