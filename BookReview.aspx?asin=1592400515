                    <span>The 1 star reviews were written by a pitiful little man who has a personal vendetta against the author. If you read the review you understand it is an attack and not a reflection of the book material. The stories in the book are personal experience stories telling of the human side of Hogan. These stories have never appeared in print before. The reviewer is simply jealous of the experience as everyone in Ft. Worth, Texas well knows....sad that jealousy plays here...To see real reviews...go to WWW.JODYVASQUEZ.COM </span>

                    <span>Do not believe the low ratings on this book. I am a Hogan "Nut" and this was a great little book to get a refreshing glimpse of "The Man". I cannot remember the last time I laghed out loud when reading a book, but I did in several places while reading "Afternoons with Mr. Hogan". This book is written by a person who saw Ben Hogan in a very different setting, ie. as a caddie and ball shagger. Mr. Vasquez treats his subject with respect but not with the blind hero worship that sometimes accompany stories or books about Hogan. 
<br /> Buy this book and enjoy a refreshing and unique look at the man, Ben Hogan!!!</span>

                    <span>Not much here that hasn't already been written about Hogan, including the ?Secret? which is nothing more than a rehash of some old swing tips from years ago. I thought it was interesting that the author (a scratch golfer) never thought the ?Secret? was important enough to incorporate in his own swing, but now after 37 years he thinks it is ?book material?. In my opinion there isn't much to this book at all and it wasn?t very interesting. I watched Hogan hit shag balls and that was a lot more interesting than reading this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a pleasant little book of not much consequence.  Golfer's probably won't learn anything about Hogan that they didn't already know, but they'll have a few more stories to share.  Let's face it, he wasn't a bucket of laughs.  The famous "secret" isn't all that secret.  The cupped left wrist was revealed in Hogan's own book, and the action of the right knee isn't much of an addition.  Frankly, the most interesting parts of the book are the descriptions of Hogan's clubs and practice routine.  We learn here for the first time that Hogan's clubs were 4 degrees open and, hence, produced his famous power fade.  Unfortunately, we're not told how he hit a hook, a shot at which he was equally adept.  That would have been interesting.  We also learn that he practiced from the bottom up, i.e., he hit short clubs before long clubs, and that he alternated fades and draws in succession.  His command of his shotmaking is emphasized over and over, but we already knew that.  So, if you're a Hogan aficionado, here's nice book to read.  If you're not, there are better choices.</span>
