                <span id="Label1">Three young lions walk out of the night and take over an older lion's territory and his harem of eight lionesses. This <i>National Geographic</i> video captures a year in the life of these lions of darkness and their pride. Filmed and narrated by renowned wildlife filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert, the 75-minute video provides an in-depth look at the lions' daily struggle to survive. The Jouberts add a personal touch by naming the lions and noting differences in their personalities and interactions with each other--especially their interactions with Tao, the youngest cub, who faces even greater obstacles than the others. A few scenes, such as the death of the older lion, may be too intense for younger children, but the realism of this video is what makes it such a fascinating and memorable portrait. <I>--Larisa Lomacky Moore</I></span>

                    <span>This is a good movie if you want to learn the basics about Lions. If you need specific behaviors about them, buy something else. I watched this for an Animal Behavior class and I needed to do alot of extra research to find specifics. Overall a good movie!</span>

                    <span>I think the reviewer that said this film was about bugs got his tapes mixed up, because there is nothing about insects in this film at all. The documentary follows a pride of lions, particularly a young male that was born late and became orphaned. His story is intriguing enough to base a film on, but we also witness an old lion desperately trying to cling to the life he once had, and the intricate process of raising a cub. The only reason I gave this documentary four stars is because it ends rather abruptly, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the male cub and his fellow pride-mates. Another twelve minutes would have done this film some good, although I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase...(from a rival company...sorry Amazon...I'll never do it again...you guys were cheaper anyway!!)</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This video leads you to believe that it is about lions, when, in fact there is a bunch filler about frogs and bugs etc. If you have been to africa, you know that this is a sorry representation the lives of lions. It is about a pride of lions in decline. There is so little lion footage, they have resorted to filler stuff that is not related to lions. Further, the reproduction quality of the tape is poor. Kiley is wonderful, as usual, but they give him very little to work with. This might appeal to a fifth grader but is clearly not up to N.Geographics standards. AVOID!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best National Geographic videos to date. The footage, content and filmmaker's narration is outstanding. The story of a motherless lion cub growing up in a pride is one of the best real-life dramas I've seen. It takes a viewer into the world otherwise unseen and inexperienced by a human. A viewer has glimpses of the every day life in the pride of lions. Joubert's film portrays the hunts, the roles of males and females in the pride, the struggle for survival, interaction between pride members and other inhabitants of Savuti. Another great film from Derek and Beverly!</span>
