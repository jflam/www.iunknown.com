                <span id="Label1">If you're looking for a book that just about covers it all and does it in an approachable way (even when tackling nerdy topics like "bilinear interpolation"), you've found it in <I>Inside Photoshop 7</I>. This edition varies from previous ones in that it offers standalone chapters that address the specific needs of photographers, artists, and Web designers, along with a core of "fun, learning-based tutorials" that cover the basics.<p>An exhaustive array of material is covered here: customizing preferences (including dealing with Scratch Disks and sufficient RAM), learning expert selection skills (including loading selections to the alpha channel), working with layers (including the powerful clipping groups), using channels and paths (with more on alpha channels), and learning the "healing tools" (like the clone stamp, healing brush, and the patch tool). <I>Inside Photoshop 7</I> does an exemplary job of explaining the realities behind sticky issues like color management and input/output resolution. The task-specific sections cover, among other topics, color correction and retouching ("...for Photographers"), drawing and painting tools ("...for the Artist"), using ImageReady for rollovers and animations ("...for the Web"), and a lot more. There's even a chapter with "recipes" for various effects and tricks like compositing a man with two heads. Despite the small color gallery, the illustrations are all black and white. Not to worry: all the project files are included on the companion CD-ROM, along with clip art, stock photography, demo and freeware/shareware applications and plug-ins, and more.<p>The authors presume "practically nothing" on the part of the readers. Among other pursuits, the Boutons write textbooks for children, which isn't surprising given the slow and enthusiastically cheerful (sometimes silly) style here. For many people, though, a friendly, painstakingly thorough, handholding approach is the only way they can learn new software. The book seems especially well suited to nonprofessionals who need or want to learn Photoshop. The fact that, unlike most Photoshop books, the screen shots are all from the Windows environment makes it even more accessible. Also, the images used as examples in the book have a homey, cartoon quality about them (alien creatures, the author dressed as a wizard) that may also appeal to newbies. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>This book was simply awful.  While I am very computer literate, I was completely new to photoshop 7 (and to photo-type software in general).  This book decided to start by throwing me into the deep end of the pool and hoping that I could swim.  I couldn't.
<br />Not only were the explanations completely unclear, they make you do exercises without telling you why your're doing them; you can't learn when to take a specific series of actions if you don't understand when/why they would be appropriate.
<br />Finally, the index was completely useless, at least to a beginner (perhaps if I had used prior versions it would have been more useful).
<br />Overall, I found this book to be completely worthless.  It's been sitting on my shelf gathering dust since about a week after I bought it (which was how long I tried to muddle my way through it).  There MUST be better books on the subject out there.  Try one.  Any of them!</span>

                    <span>The author of this book is the classic example of the fact that someone who is an expert in a particular field is sometimes a terrible tutor for it. Writing style is unbearable, explanations are totally unclear and this book ends up being unapproachable for newbies and useless for experts. I am sure wheter the newer CS edition is any better but I think I will stay away...</span>

                    <span>I was entirely new to Photoshop 7 and so I decided to go thru the book page by page. The first chapter led me thru steps, but I wasn't sure what I had done when I was thru. I was instructed to select tools that I had no reasonable way of knowing where they were located, many hidden behind tiny icons which I have come to realize is Adobe's M.O., but very frustrating to a new user. The cutsie humor is lost on a frustrated reader trying to locate a tool. Some of the time he describes in detail step by step how to do an exercise but you're not sure what you are trying to achieve. The next time he assumes you know how and you don't have a clue where to start. After the first few chapters he surprisingly starts to tell you more detailed step by step instructions. Once I figured out on my own where many of the tools, option bar selections and palettes were I got a lot of information out of the book and have gone on to enjoy it.</span>

                    <span> I bought the book and it taught me skills I lacked. As a result I created designs that were widely accepted and loved.
<br /> Gary Bouton managed to cover tremendous grounds in very friendly manner. The book is huge and I read it here and there not whole. Almost all sections are self-suffitient but NOT redundant even when some steps were repeated. I am giving it all 5 because I benefited from it greatly - how better can it be?

                    <span>I read all the reviews about this book and was sure I hit gold - but This is a very big book with very little to offer in tricks and knowledge. The best example would be the lack of any important info regarding Layer Sets - I searched the book and found that it does not tell you how to avoid the effect adjustments layers ,when applied to nested layers, have on the external layers below them (the answer is to avoid the pass through blending mode which is not even mentioned in the book). <p>All I know about PS is from FREE video tutorials you may find on the net and some written ones. Save the money and get some Pizza.</span>
