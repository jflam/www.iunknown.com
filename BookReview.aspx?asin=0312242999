                    <span>This book gives you an insight about what really did go down in Las Vegas on the night of Tupac's shooting. I really enjoyed reading it! The Life story of Tupac is a great adventure and Frank Alexander spoke of the kind hearted side of Tupac in this book and not his media preception. If your looking for a good book, buy this!

<br />Excellent Book ***** (5 Stars)</span>

                    <span>Although at times an interesting look into the decadence and fast living that is offered to those with fame and fortune, it amounts to nothing more than a poorly ghost-written book of recollections by a first-hand witness (bodyguard) of Tupacs last year of life. Like so many other projects that make an attempt to capitalize on the late Rap Stars life, it never gets below the surface of Tupac the celebrity, and leaves the reader without any insights as to how and why, Tupac had, and continues to have, such an enormous impact on Rap/Hip-Hop music and culture. Instead we get insights like the one on page 84 in the book "Do you know why woman loved Tupac? The obvious reasons are his talent, his looks, and his charisma..but also Tupac had a f**kin' horse c**k". From the way it was written and presented, it doesnt seem like Mr.Frank Alexander had any strong motive or desire to bring this book to the public, otherthan reasons that start with dollar signs $$$. But I have to say that in the final chapters the book finally comes alive with Mr.Alexanders powerful, poignant, honest memories of the events that took place when, and after Tupac was shot, and eventually died in Las Vegas. In these chapters he reflects on his confrontation with Suge Knight, and the confusion, guilt, sorrow and fear he was feeling as Tupac struggled for his life in the hospital, and the aftermath that followed Tupacs death, it ends with an intimate phone conversation between Alexander and Tupacs Mother. Its worth reading the book just for these last chapters alone, its very, very moving. Unfortunately, its too little, too late in the book to make its entirety a good read. I was 25 when Tupac died, and I was into Heavy Metal more than Rap/Hip-Hop, but always being a big Tupac fan, upon hearing of his death that day, besides feeling sorrow, I also remember feeling it was the end of an era, I knew Rap would never be the same and there would never be another one like him. It was the same feeling I had when Kurt Cobain died. And ten years later, looking at all the Rap/Hip-Hop that has come after Tupacs death, I realized my feeling that day was right, Pac was truly one of a kind, and something special died with him that night in Vegas, and Raps never been the same since. This books OK, but I expected more.  
<br />
<br />RIP Tupac.  We all miss you.. and we're still down for you. </span>

                    <span>This book is about a famous rapper who explaines his life and what he's been through. He talks about how he was poor and he lived in the "hood" and how he got into rapping, and lead to his fame and demise. The person who wrote this book is Frank Alexander he was Tupacs body guard and he was with Tupac every day,all day. He wrote this book because he and Tupac became very close frends. I like this book because I am a big fan of Tupacs and I recommend this book to all the Tupac fans out there.   </span>

                    <span>This book is one of my all time favorite. It gives a real clear inside on his life through the eyes of his bodyguard. If you are a fan of tupac and love him as much as we all do. This book is a must get. I recommend this book not only to tupac fans but also to the public and the people who just didn't understand him. Alghough the end was really sad and made me feel like i was there, I am very glad i took my time to read it! BUY IT NOW!!</span>

                    <span>You cannot get much closer to the real thing, as the "real thing's bodyguard." This book is interesting because it chronicles a portion of Pac's life from a different angle. Throughout Pac's life, people tried to destroy him; whether it was mentally, psyhically, or psychologically. Alexander, in "Got Your Back," shares his experience with Pac as the one who was to ultimately protect and maintain him, his bodyguard. Although Pac had a far more profound impact on hip-hop than this book's setting of one year, it chronicles a set of interesting and unique happenings, all of which transpire within an intersting web of unbelief at the end. Read it. It is a good book. RIP</span>
