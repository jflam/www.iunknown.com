                    <span>The Grapes of Wrath, portray a migrating family that is in search of a better future after they were brutally kicked off their own land by the "bank."  The Joads encountered several problems, not only with the conditions of the vehicles and food, but with the people of other regions.  In every region people viewed outsiders as a major threat, and treated them as criminals.  
<br />Steinbeck took one family and related their circumstances with many.  The journey of pursuing a better future with everything at stake adds a sense of suspense to the overall theme of the novel.He was able to capture the despair of not being able to feed their children or to provide a stable household. The novel keeps the reader intrigued with what is going to happen next, a true classic.</span>

                    <span>"Wow, This book is boring"--Thats what I was like after reading this book for 1 hour (I only got 17 pages read). The beginning of this book isn't that great, but trust me, it becomes more interesting and you start to get pulled  into the book. Steinbeck does a good job of holding the readers attention after like the first 50 pages of the book. You learn history, and you get a great novel ALL IN ONE! People, I urge you to read this book, do not be afraid of the first 50 pages (they will lead you to the good part). Oh yeah, if you liked this book after reading it, read Of Mice and Men (its even better in my opinion).</span>

                    <span>"The Grapes of Wrath" a true American Classic is one of the most outstanding books that I have ever read. It does not fail to leaves its mark on a reader. This serious master-piece has its setting during the "Great Depression" and gives a general view of the 1930's. John Steinbeck who may be the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm wrote this THE GRAPES OF WRATH which is about the struggles of the poor during this time. In the story, the Joad family endures many struggles on their way to find work in California and their lives are a microcosm of struggles of the poor during this time. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, betrayals, setbacks and despair. Yet the Joads maintained dignity, courage, and hope to recover. America was fortunate in that the poor did maintain these virtues which kept their hopes alive and made them not to rebel and throw the nation into anarchy. The nation was also lucky with the ascension to power of Roosevelt. THE GRAPES OF WRATH shows how a people with hope and a leadership committed to its people can overcome disaster to become strong again.Also recommended: DISCIPLES OF FORTUNE, OF MICE AND MEN, WAR AND PEACE

                    <span>This moving novel captures the heartbreak of people driven into poverty by events beyond their control.  Author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) examines the hardships faced by "Okies," displaced farmers of the 1930's who headed for California and tried to scrape by as migrant workers.     
<br />
<br />The story centers on the Joads, a family of destitute Oklahoma farmers that head for California in hopes of finding work as fruit pickers.  Death and misery accompany their journey, and things aren't much better once they arrive.  The people (and law) in California fear and mistreat newcomers, and what little work is available invariably involves long hours and poverty-level wages.  The only time the Joads get respect is when they lodge at a modest U.S. Government camp for transients - the author once toured such camps with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  The book's ending is powerfully inconclusive, reflecting the sturdy will of people to endure hardship as the Great Depression drags on.        
<br />
<br />This book captured the 1939 Pulitzer Prize.  It was also turned into the classic 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda - a movie that was often filmed in secret due to lingering resentment against "Okies."  I gave the book just four stars because in places it lags a bit, but it remains a powerful statement for caring government and help for the dispossessed.

                    <span>"The Grapes of Wrath" is truly a masterpiece of American fiction.  Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California.  Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.
<br />
<br />The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California.  Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road.  He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land.  He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.
<br />
<br />Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had.  The characters in "The Grapes of Wrath" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down.  Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them.  And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet.</span>
