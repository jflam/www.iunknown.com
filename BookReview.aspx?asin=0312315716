                <span id="Label1"><div>Tom Perrotta's thirty-ish parents of young children are a varied and surprising bunch. There's Todd, the handsome stay-at-home dad dubbed "The Prom King" by the moms of the playground; Sarah, a lapsed feminist with a bisexual past, who seems to have stumbled into a traditional marriage; Richard, Sarah's husband, who has found himself more and more involved with a fantasy life on the internet than with the flesh and blood in his own house; and Mary Ann, who thinks she has it all figured out, down to scheduling a weekly roll in the hay with her husband, every Tuesday at 9pm. They all raise their kids in the kind of sleepy American suburb where nothing ever seems to happen-at least until one eventful summer, when a convicted child molester moves back to town, and two restless parents begin an affair that goes further than either of them could have imagined. Unexpectedly suspenseful, but written with all the fluency and dark humor of Perrotta's previous novels,  <i>Little Children</i> exposes the adult dramas unfolding amidst the swingsets and slides of an ordinary American playground. <br></div></span>

                    <span>I've read all of Mr. Perrotta's novels and really enjoy his work, so I was excited to pick up his latest offering, Little Children. There are a lot of plot summary-heavy reviews already, so I'll get right to it.<P>The weakness of the book, in my opinion, was the sex scenes. Frankly, Mr. Perrotta is a strong enough writer that he doesn't need them, and it cheapened the book a for me. Some readers will argue those scenes are nessesary to really get a feel for how the characters interact, and perhaps they have a point. But I thought it could have been toned down a little.<P>The strength, which far, far outweighed that weakness, was the questions the novel produced. Why are some sexual fetishes accepted by society and others rejected? To what extent can we control our sexual urges, and if we can't, should we still be punished for acting on them? What is the 'right' way to raise children? How much are children a reflection of their parents, and how much are their personalities predetermined?<P>Overall, Little Children is, if nothing else, an interesting read. And really what more can you ask for from a novel?</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Anyone who's ever been bored to tears pushing their child on a swing for the umpteenth time will be amazed to discover how much drama Little Children can cull from the interaction between parents who meet regularly at their neighborhood playground. The novels gets inside the heads and explores the arrested development of more than a half dozen characters including Sarah, a formerly bisexual feminist trapped in a loveless marriage; Todd, a stay-at-home dad who is studying for the bar after two failed attempts and who is so handsome the moms at the playground call him "The Prom King"; May, the mother of a convicted child molester who's resettled into the neighborhood; Larry an ex-cop who mistakenly killed a local kid and who is now obsessed with tormenting the child molester; Richard, Sarah's husband, who's become obsessed with Internet sex; and Todd's wife Kathy, the beauty queen who needs to rescue her marriage after Sarah and Todd start an affair.<P>There are very funny scenes here -- Sarah walking in on her husband while he's pleasuring himself while sniffing panties he received through the mail from an Internet porn queen; Sarah getting her revenge against the neighborhood's Supermom Snob over a discussion of Madame Bovary at a ladies' book club meeting. Some of the most poignant moments come from the mundane details Perrotta can mine from the moments when people should feel transported -- Sarah smelling pool chlorine and thinking about all her pathetic previous rejections while she's ecstatic about making love to someone as handsome as the Prom King.<P>There's never a false note with any of the characters' interior monologues -- ranging from Sarah's angst over buying a bikini that will sufficently entice Todd to Todd's inability to understand why he's become obsessed with watching teenage skateboarders while he's avoiding studying for the bar. It's a great testimony to Perrotta's depth and range. He's often compared with Nick Hornby, but the humor here comes not so much from clever one liners, but rather the feelings of the characters. (That doesn't mean there aren't some very funny one-liners here, too. Several times I laughed out load reading the book). It all builds to an exciting climax at the very playground where the Little Children -- the kids, the parents who behave like children, and the man who's obsessed with them -- meet.</span>

                    <span>Terrific book. One of my favorite movies is ELECTION, however I was just a tad disappointed with the book (which I read after seeing the movie). It wasn't that the book was bad, it's just that the movie was so great. Anyway, Perotta's latest book kicks ELECTION's butt. So, here are my casting ideas: Vince Vaughn for Todd (I know Brad Pitt's an obvious choice, but Vince hasn't done anything relatively serious in a while), Lili Taylor for Sarah, Phillip Seymour Hoffman for Ronnie (once again, a bit too obvious, but that's because he'd be perfect), Kate Beckinsale for Kathy, Will Smith for Larry (it wouldn't hurt to get a little bit of color into this story).</span>

                    <span>Although this novel promises readers a surprise by including a convicted child molester/murderer, an obsessed ex-cop, and a Peyton Place of suburban angst, it all culminates in a puff of smoke rather than the l-o-n-g awaited fireworks. In short, a big dud. I regretted both the time and money spent on "Little Children".</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed Perrotta's latest. What a slap in the face, this reminder of who we are as suburban adults, or who we will be if we let ourselves forget who we were as idealistic children in the raw. I highly recommend this one, along with Jennifer Paddock's A SECRET WORD and Brad Land's GOAT.</span>
