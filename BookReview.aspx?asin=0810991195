                <span id="Label1">"This is an invaluable volume for baseball fans and American history buffs alike."--<I>Sports Illustrated</I>  <P>Ty Cobb slides into third in a flurry of dust and spikes. Home Run Baker, young and strong, takes batting practice while his teammates stand in awe. Wee Willie Keller and Cy Young, Babe Ruth and Dizzy Dean, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams--these and other American heroes take the field in Baseball's Golden Age: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon. From 1904 to 1942, Conlon photographed it all, creating some of baseball's most famous photographs, but the photographer himself has remained practically unknown. This volume is the first publication to reproduce Conlon's photographs as fine art and to give his remarkable legacy its due.  <P>Selected and newly printed from the Conlon negatives in the archives of <I>The Sporting Age</I>, 205 dazzling images fill the pages of <I>Baseball's Golden Age</I>. The glory of that time shines through in the text as well, as authors Neal McCabe and Constance McCabe have assembled wonderful, evocative stories that bring these legendary baseball heroes to life. Baseball's Golden Age is sure to please all fans of baseball--past, present, and future.</span>

                    <span>Were Charles Conlon still alive, I would track him down and kiss his feet for capturing in such vivid detail the historic giants of baseball. The book features remarkable photos of the greatest baseball players of most of the first half of this century. Suitable for framing, the photos typically depict individual players and small groups, often in game action. The well preserved photographs provide an important window on a truly beautiful game and its players in an era when outfield fences were optional, and a "baseball club" was just that. My favorite of Conlon's gems shows Hall of Fame shortstop Honus Wagner gripping his bat. Under his fingernails is Pennsylvania coal dust. His chipped, oversized piece of lumber looks unwieldy by today's standards. And his sinuous forearms are testament to the power that we remember him by. Other photos are paired to show the dramatic impact of age and the outfield sun on players of yesterday. Picture Wes Chandler spunky at 25 and then battle weary at about 50 and you'll understand why so many players strive so hard for a moment in the sun: they want to enjoy it before it's all gone.</span>

                    <span>A captivating, can't put down book. As previous reviewers have noted, this book is like a time machine that transports you into another world. You step through the looking glass and onto the Polo Grounds, Washington Park, or Yankee Stadium. <P>I have not enjoyed a baseball this much since the companion book to the PBS "Baseball" series! <P>The photographs here are truly amazing when you consider how poor the technology of the time was. Other books on old time baseball force one to suffer through really bad period photos. There isn't a bad one here. Conlon was truly an artist!<P>If you love history, baseball, or really good photography you will love this book.</span>

The descriptions with each amazing photo show how America viewed baseball as a microcosm of the country. A great discussion book. Highly recommended.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This marvellous collection of the greatest baseball photographs ever taken qualify as one of the very best contributions to both baseball literature and serious photography. The consummate images of rough-hewn blue-collar stock named Wagner or McGraw or Overall silhouetted against rickety hardwood bleachers, rusty wire screens, and smoke-baptised brick houses; unmown grass and pock-marked infields beneath them; the smell of pancake mitts and hickory bats and unwashen wool uniforms in their nostrils; coal-dust and farm soil and blistering summer sun etching character into their faces. These, I say, seem to me the very breath and blood of the grand ol' game of baseball, all gloriously frozen in time in its purest splendor by the sensitive eye of Charles M. Conlon. These indelible images from the tool of a genius ARE NOT JUST BASEBALL PHOTOGRAPHS! Who can shake the documentary immediacy, mental peace, or aesthetic excitement aroused by the breath-taking images of Bob Rhoads warming-up his soupbone, shadowed by the hand-operated scoreboard at the wood-and-spit Hilltop Park? Or a flailing Tommy Leach squinting a pop-up into the merciless Brooklyn sun? Or Ty Cobb, his jaw curled into a fist, ruthlessly showering dirt and hellfire into a helpless third-sacker? Or muscular Tim Jordan gracefully balancing a heavy-weight stroke of his massive war-club? As the authors state, Conlon deserves to be ranked with Ansel Adams and Walker Evans, and compared with Eugene Atget. His undying images provide a unique look at a time and way of life gone by. P.S.: What I want to know is, WHERE IS THE SEQUEL? Conlon left 8000 negatives; and many of his most extraordinary--such as Russ Ford warming up by the Hilltop's trumpet-clutching "p.a. announcer"; or Hank Gowdy burnishing in the sunlight, warming-up on a Polo Grounds sideline in 1917--have been reproduced in a baseball card set, the discontinued "Conlon Collection," issued by the Sporting News. But the reproduction of these wonderful photographs in the set are inferior to Constance McCabe's sensitive care; and are much smaller, besides. Neal, if you're reading this, PLEASE put together another volume of Conlon's brilliant images!</span>
