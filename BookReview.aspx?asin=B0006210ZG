                    <span>This film did an adequate job of entertainment. It is far from a great one though. 
<br />
<br />Although it purports to be a 'thriller', this version of 'The Manchurian Candidate' is too predictable and has too many holes in its logic. 
<br />
<br />The story is basically about an 'evil corporation' that plots to have its person planted in the vice presidency with the assistance of his twisted mother who is portrayed as incestuous in one scene. There is never any connection made with what the motive would be for the company in going to all of this trouble. It seems like they could just as easily buy their person with campaign contributions as seems to happen with some regularity. 
<br />
<br />In another spot, the hero, played by Denzel Washington, attempts to appeal to the conscience of the automaton to call off his nefarious scheme. The creators of the movie didn't ever connect the dots on how one could control a person as a robot on one hand and appeal to his 'noble side' on the other.
<br />
<br />This is probably ok as a rental, however, I wouldn't recommend buying it.

                    <span>This movie will trip you out, nothing is revealed until the right time.  Why does denzel washington eat ramen noodles like mad?  Why is his memory of a battle in desert storm..coming back to him in a much different way as it did everyone who gave his buddy the medal of honor?  Denzel Washington does a GREAT job in this movie!  I strongly recommend it!
<br />
<br />Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) and Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) are two soldiers who served in the same company during Operation Desert Storm, but their paths following their tours of duty have been very different. Shaw, the son of powerful congresswoman Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), has used his reputation as a war hero to quickly scale the ladder of American politics, and with the help of his mother earns the Vice Presidential nomination. Marco, on the other hand, has been troubled with a mental illness, and is convinced that something strange happened to him and his compatriots during the war. As Marco struggles to find the truth behind his nightmares and emotional torment, he unearths some disturbing facts about how his mind and body have been reworked by shadowy forces, as well as those of his fellow soldiers - including Raymond Shaw. Featuring a stellar supporting cast (including Jon Voight, Miguel Ferrer, and Dean Stockwell!</span>

                    <span>While the ending of this film was basically given away somewhere in the first half hour of it, there was indeed one big surprise for the viewer: that director J.Demme delivered such a sad mediocrity.
<br />
<br />   With the storyline offering great possibilities for a great and very dark atmospheric film, Demme and the other contributors managed to make a boring saga that will have you reach for the fast-forward button in desperation.
<br />
<br />    The story is indeed full of holes (as other reviewers mention as well) and on another surprising note D.Washington is actually pretty mediocre here too. Someone either forgot to tell the scriptwriter or Washington himself that being brainwashed does NOT mean walking around in total stupor and half asleep. 
<br />
<br />That is really one part of the film that borders bad comedy as Washington's interpretation of the brainwashed veteran trying to find out who's pulling the strings behind the New Order plot he's unwillingly involved in is simply horrible.
<br />
<br />   To make things unbearably worse, you know far too early what the actual score is (and if you failed to figure it out early enough i'm stupified myself). But that's not the main problem. That would be that the film is so unengaging that even if it did manage to keep its plot twist unrevealed till the end it would still be boring.
<br />
<br />   Aside of Merryl Streep who's probably the only bright spot of this flick, the casting is actually a disaster. The senator candidate looks like someone out of a toothpaste commercial and acts like someone out of a toothpaste commercial. Granted, some politicians do look and act that way, but this is not what this film needed. The rest of the cast are simply putting in a good day's work, grab the check and go home.
<br />
<br />    The biggest failure here is by far the script. Had the script been adequate the actors would've (perhaps) put in a better and more engaging performance. But that's as iffy as the plot itself if not more so. In a film like this, where the storyline has to be super tight in order to capture the audience it's exactly that element that falls loudly apart. Early on too.
<br />
<br />   All in all, keep this on your rental list for when you've run out of all the better and even lesser choices you've got. I'm sure that list is ever-expnading. </span>

                    <span>The other reviews here will summarize the plot for you. I'll only evaluate it: Terrible, terrible, terrible.
<br />
<br />Denzel's such a fine actor, so convincing, so gripping. I can't imagine why he'd agreed to take part in this wretched revision of a classic - unless he signed on before reading the actual script. 
<br />
<br />WARNING - SPOILERS!
<br />
<br />It seriously takes nothing away to mention the changes from the original, since they're both mentioned in reviews (here and elsewhere) and apparent early on in the movie. And NONE of them constitute an improvement.
<br />
<br />Rice-sized electronic implants are a foolish change from the original's concept of brainwashing. There's little evidence that anyone has ever really been brainwashed, and maybe microcircuits are more contemporary and sexy, but they get implanted in solidiers' *shoulders*, not heads - except for the one character who gets a recharge/reset via a needle into his brain, one of several crucial disconnects within the plot.
<br />
<br />The dialogue is weak, predictable, and even sloppy. The cinematography is boring, the direction haphazard, and the casting distracting. If the actors had been nobodies, it might have stayed afloat. But when you get Denzel, Close, Voigt, and others together, you sorta kinda expect something thrilling. Instead, if you bother watching it, you'll probably find something flacid, pale, and tiring.
<br />
<br />Verdict: skip it!</span>

                    <span>The movie had very good acting: Washington, Schreiber and Streep were all excellent. The plot was tight and suspenseful. The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own. The remake filled in some of the pot holes that were opened in the original and created some of its own. The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters. However, Denzel's character was a very sympathetic. 
<br />
<br />I am stuck because I don't want to reveal the changes in the plot. The original Manchurian candidate has the Cold War as its milieu. The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings. It is just not as scary as the communist scare. 
<br />
<br />It is a good movie and the acting is very good. </span>
