                    <span>As its title suggests, Andrew Kaye's book is not only about Tiger Flowers; it's about the history and politics of black celebrity.  Kaye has delivered a wide-ranging, sensitive & intelligently written piece of work that goes way, way beyond the usual cliches of sporting histories. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Professor Kaye's book is about the dilemmas experienced by black athletes, <br>not an exhaustive account of every punch landed by Tiger Flowers and his <br>contemporaries. As a study of race relations in the 1920s and black life in <br>Atlanta, it seems to me that it succeeds admirably. The book is clearly <br>written and the illustrations are revealing.</span>

                    <span>I found this book interesting not only for its overview of the life and career of Tiger Flowers but for the broader look at how athletes, especially black athletes, had to cope with the pressure of the public eye in the South in the early 20th century.</span>

                    <span>I have always been a fan of Tiger Flowers. I was intrigued by stories of him as a child. I must say as a social history and/or biography of Flowers this book is a complete flop. I was lucky enough to purchase a rare copy of Flowers biography published in 1928 by Edney and Flowers' widow. The book leaves much to be desired, a contention which Mr. Kaye agrees with. Interestingly, despite this fact Mr. Kaye seems to use the Edney book as his major source for Flowers life. It would have been nice to have had a hometown heros life done in a more concise fashion. Sadly, Flowers legacy seems as neglected today, after the publication of this book, as it was before hand. Poor Tiger.</span>
