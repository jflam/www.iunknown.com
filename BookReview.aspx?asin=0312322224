                    <span>Comprehensively researched book that's marred by surprisingly poor writing. Alan Schwartz has done a great job of bringing to light both the evolution of baseball's traditional statistics and the discoveries by "outsiders" who have changed the way we understand the game in the past 25 years. He gives credit where credit is due and isn't afraid to kick the shins of those who deserve it -- from baseball's official statisticians to noted author Thomas Boswell.  If he'd just lay off the amateurish similies and metaphors, he would earn a "5" in my book. </span>

                    <span>This book is simply, hands-down, amazing.  It gives a spectaular history of America's game and tells how all of today's STATS have changed over time.  I suggest reading this book if you are a fan of baseball and/or statistics. </span>

                    <span>Watching a professional baseball game on television is an exercise in just how much statistical information can be displayed on the screen without totally blocking out the game itself. What I didn't realize was just how much history there was behind these numbers. I presumed, with I suppose a majority of other people, that all these statistics were simply a product of all the new computers. 
<br />
<br />No, the author says, the numbers began just about as soon as the game was invented. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that the numbers didn't come first, but I guess that they couldn't -- could they? 
<br />
<br />Nah! They couldn't. The first big statistical report of a baseball series didn't appear until August 18, 1858. 
<br />
<br />Delightful book with the season now over and months until the new one starts.</span>

                    <span>This book does a tremendous job of wrapping interesting stories around the discrete steps forward and contributions made by some of the greatest baseball analysts of all time. The book covers the entire history of the game from Henry Chadwick's box scores and arguments right through to today's 3-D modeling software.
<br />
<br />If you are more of a day to day game watching fan and not truly enthralled with the statisitics of the game, you might want to look elsewhere but if you love analysis...I recommend this highly to those who love the numbers game within the game of baseball.

                    <span>This book is an absolute delight to read for the baseball fan regardless of how many histories of the game you've already read. Alan Schwarz has delivered a perfect blend of Baseball history and the evolution of statistics that we today take for granted as being integral to the game. In this book we learn that  wasn't necessarily always true and Schwarz takes us inside the development and the arguments surrounding the relevance of various stats. At the same time the characters involved both in the statistical sense and in the game itself are colorfully described. 
<br />This was a wonderful book that entertained and educated on a subject that legions of baseball fans are absorbed in every day. The stats and their development are weaved into the history of baseball creating a unique historical view of the game we love.</span>
