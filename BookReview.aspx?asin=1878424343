                    <span>Contained in this little book (page 13) is a Note From The Author that states "For best results, I suggest that you read the entire book once and subsequently read five pages on a daily basis." Well, he sure knows what he's talking about. If you are open-minded or ready for change, this just may be the book you need. Get it from the library first, (as I did) and I bet you'll wind up buying it, (as I did). The wonder of this book is that the pages (don't panic, they are short, to-the-point pages) are such easy, common sense reading, that you almost (ALMOST) feel silly having someone remind you of the obvious. What's that saying, "You will never see the big picture until you remove yourself from it." Well, step aside, get out of your own way and let the universe perform its wonders on you. You will not be disappointed. May you have health, wealth, and effortless abundance!</span>

                    <span>The A-Z Steps that Deepak has listed in his book are more than just "steps" to affluence. I think most, if not all of the steps listed, are great "principles" for everyone to live by. The author also indicates that these steps are not only going to provide an abundance of financial wealth but and abundance of anything we desire in life. This is most important for me in my growth as a person. I personally measure my success as something more than just financial wealth.<P>In order to fully appreciate the steps that he has listed, I think that it is a good idea to read a few pages each day or once a week in order to fully understand and make a habit of each step. The author suggests this as a method of becoming "aware" of each step. <P>Overall, a great book on personal growth. The principles he teaches are time tested and true. The only problem I found was that the author tends to get very deep into Quantum Theory and physics. I do not see the significance of discussing these topics in a book about personal growth and affluence in life.</span>

                    <span>This book is quite short and can be read in about an hour.<P>Frankly, I was expecting more. It's really like a long brochure or outline rather than a book. While it did offer a few helpful points, it did not go enough in depth in expanding upon them. After reading this book, I felt like I had read an outline or a proposal to a book rather than an actual book. Thus, I regret my purchase of this book.</span>
