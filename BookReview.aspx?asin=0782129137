                    <span>I don't get why other guys gave 5 stars to this it's not giving enough information.The chapter go like this:
<br />
<br />chapter 1 : Is only talking about the author and what he thinks of the book 
<br />
<br />chapter 2 :It talks about Very Very Very basic stuff of animation
<br />
<br />I don't want to bother myself by writing more about this book
<br />it's just a waste of time unless you don't know what is flash!
<br />It's 32.99$ l wouldn't buy it even for 5.00$ I recommend to everyone to buy "Animating Flash characters" it's cheaper and better.
<br />The guys who rated this item with 5 stars are surely the author or his frieds, or maybe they didn't even see what's on the book
<br />Anyway l made the mistake of buying it and l am writing this so you won't do the same mistake as l did.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>A few years ago I tried learning Flash animation by using tutorials on the Internet.  I learned a little bit, but most of the tutorials weren't concise and they were confusing and usually I found myself aggravated with Flash deeming it was "too complicate to learn."  I found this book for $5 and decided to give Flash another try.  Gray made this book easily accessible for novices and advanced users alike with clear instructions.  Each chapter begins with a few words on the techniques you will learn in that chapter and some tips. Then the rest of the chapter consists of hands-on exercises.  Artwork and sample files are included on the CD-Rom if you do not have any original artwork.  These exercises are very easy to follow.  I completed the first four chapters and I made a short movie with music.  That was only two days after reading the chapters. I read the help file about importing music. This topic isn't covered in the first four chapters but it is in later chapters.  It does not take hours upon hours to learn Flash animation using this book.  Knowing some basics of Flash beforehand will come in handy, though.  I highly recommend this book if you want to learn to make Flash animations.  You will not regret your purchase!!
<br />
<br />*The CD-Rom also includes software.  Macromedia Flash 5, Adobe Photoshop, Bias Peak VST, Bias Peak LE, Bias Deck, and Sonic Foundry's Sound Forge.  Most of the programs are PC & Mac compatible.*</span>

                    <span>Want to be a Flash Cartoonist?
<br />Walk, no run and grab a copy of "The Art of Cartooning with Flash" by Daniel Gray, "Flash 5 Cartooning" by Mark Clarkson, "The Big Book of Cartooning" by Bruce Blitz and a flatbed scanner.
<br />In my opinion you need all three books in order to be successful with cartooning in flash.
<br />"The Big Book of Cartooning" isn't a flash book but will teach you how to draw or improve your drawing skills.
<br />I also recommend getting all of these books from the Amazon.com used book marketplace in order to get more bang for your buck.  Once you have a grip on Flash Cartooning, you may want to start creating some flash games.
<br />
<br />You must also have a few simple items to create your cartoons: paper, pencil, papermate felt tip pen and scanner, graphics tablet or mouse.
<br />I draw my cartoon characters using paper and pencil so I prefer to use a scanner instead of a mouse or graphics tablet.
<br />
<br />These books have taught me a lot and are a lot less expensive than going to animation school, flash cartoon workshops, buying how to cartoon in flash tutorials online or buying how to use flash tutorials on cdrom. I also have the following books:
<br />"Dreamweaver MX / Fireworks MX Savvy" and "Flash MX Savvy".
<br />
<br />10/5/04 - Update
<br />"The Art of Cartooning With Flash" includes several transitions that "Flash 5 Cartooning" doesn't.
<br />Transitions are a must in your cartoons!
<br />
<br />10/7/04 - Update
<br />"The Art of Cartooning With Flash" is for advanced users and "Flash 5 Cartooning" is for beginners.
<br />
<br />10/13/04 - Update
<br />I have purchased several flash cartooning books. In my opinion "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" covers everything you need to know about creating cartoons with flash except lip syncing.
<br />The principals of animation, walk cycles, grouping symbols and how to create a flash cartoon from start to finish are covered in the "Art of Cartooning With Flash" also.
<br />
<br />2/7/05 - Update
<br />I just purchased "Macromedia Flash 5 ActionScript for Fun and Games" for $4.  I can't wait to start bring my cartoon characters to life with games.
<br />I'm using Flash MX but the Flash 5 actionsript code will still work with this version of flash.
<br />I didn't want to pay $30 for a how to create games using flash book since creating games won't be my primary goal when using flash.
<br />
<br />2/16/05 - Update
<br />I just purchased "Flash 5 Bible" for $2.46. It has a small section on cartoon animation.
<br />
<br />3/18/05 - Update
<br />I was deciding on whether to purchase one of two traditional animation books.
<br />"Cartoon Animation (The Collector's Series)" by Preston Blair or "The Animator's Workbook" by Tony Blair.
<br />Since I'm concerned with digital computer animation, I'm just going to use "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" and "Flash 5 Cartooning" only.
<br />Also, since "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" discusses the 12 principles of animation, I should be ok without a traditional animation book.
<br />Again, I believe that you need both "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" and "Flash 5 Cartooning" to be successful with flash cartooning.
<br />Note: I still haven't created my 2nd flash cartoon yet.  I made one in 1999, but it wasn't that great.  So, I don't count that one.</span>

                    <span>This is a pretty decent book. However, for the most part it had nothing new or original to offer that I hadn't already seen in other animation books. Nice artwork thought and it's definitely pretty to look at so I guess in a way it's useful in providing inspirational material. But you're not really going to gain anything new by reading it.</span>
