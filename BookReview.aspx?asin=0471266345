                <span id="Label1">A look behind the curtain of shilling and pitch to see how we are manipulated everyday    <P>Robert Levine offers readers an incisive new take on the mindsets of those who prod, praise, debase, and manipulate others to do things they never thought they&#146;d do&#151;and are sometimes later sorry they did. He takes a hands-on approach by attending training sessions for magicians honing their craft and by taking jobs as a door-to-door salesman and a used car salesman. Levine explores the remarkable effect and power of subtlety on effective persuasion, the great illusion of personal vulnerability, and the unlikely similarities across a wide range of persuasive strategies, from parents to con men to lovers to religious leaders.    <P>Robert Levine (Fresno, CA) is Professor and former chairperson of the Psychology Department at California State University, Fresno. He has published articles in <I>Psychology Today, Discover, American Demographics, The</I> <I>New York Times, Utne Reader,</I> and <I>American Scientist. </I>His book, <I>A Geography of Time,</I> was the subject of feature stories around the world, including<I> Newsweek, The New York Times Magazine, </I>CNN, the BBC, ABC&#146;s<I> Primetime, </I>and NPR&#146;s<I> All Things Considered </I>and<I> Marketplace.</I>    </span>

                    <span>I found this book via a reference from Slashdot, and decided to read it for myself. It's a useful primer on persuasion. Levine's insight and explanation of the mechanics of manipulation can serve as either inoculation against hucksters, or inspiration to try these tricks yourself. It's an engaging read. Levine lays out principles which are simple and practical (e.g., the triangle of trustworthiness: authority, honesty, likability), and he avoids the dry, academic tone that saddles many Ph.D.'s writing. You don't need a GED to enjoy this book.<P>I had two minor complaints, neither sufficient to reduce my rating from five to four stars. While the book is replete with fascinating anecdotes and synopses of various studies, Levine also peppers the text with tongue-in-cheek remarks. Most of them are funny, but he spends a few paragraphs too many chuckling at his own jokes (or his pal, Lenny). More significantly, Chapter Nine ("Jonestown") comes from left field. For 200 pages, Levine writes about sales and marketing -- and then suddenly he spends 20 pages pontificating about a religious cult. It's interesting, but misplaced. If I'd wanted to read a book about Jonestown, there are dozens. I wouldn't have picked Levine's.<P>That said, I recommend this book. There are no surprises (apart from Jonestown): If you're intrigued by the teaser, you'll like the book. Aside from a general education about impressionability, I took away several specific notes. Levine's comments about Matisse struck a chord with me, and I'm currently reading Paco Underhill's "Why We Buy" based on Levine's reference. This is a worthwhile book. I'm glad I bought it, and I expect to pick it up again in a few years.</span>

                    <span>A well-known social psychologist and experienced writer (A Geography of Time, 1997), Levine (California State Univ., Fresno) has produced an authoritative, entertaining, and perceptive analysis of persuasion in the marketplace. He examines the ways that people can be coaxed, prodded, seduced, or debased into taking actions they previously were not attracted to. The book is an engaging read, a real page-turner. Levine mixes an expert's knowledge of contemporary research in social psychology with real-world examples of situations where effective persuasion is in play. His analysis identifies a set of core psychological principles that are the basis for all forms of persuasion, from selling Tupperware to electing politicians. The book concludes with suggestions for resisting persuasion. The clear, entertaining writing style makes the books accessible to all mature readers, but it will have special relevance for those with backgrounds in the social sciences. ^BSumming Up: Essential.

                    <span>I absolutely loved Power of Persuasion!<BR>Levine writes and gives due credit to everyone from his students (by name) to the many researchers who make the field more fascinating and understood year by year.<BR>I can't say enough about this book. When I wrote The Psychology of Persuasion in 1996, I knew that persuasion was a field that would become more fascinating and important as each year would come and go. This book is like a bible of persuasion,influence and contains an enormous amount of research about how you and I might not know each ourselves as well as we think. Get this book! You will get new ideas and tips that I had not seen prior to this book and that is rare indeed. Buy this book. It is one of the best in the field. www.kevinhogan.com <BR>Kevin Hogan</span>

                    <span>The first chapter is this book made me sweat. I thought I would read this book to continue my study in persuasion just to make me a better marketer, that I was in fact immune against most persuasion. Not so, says the author. His opening chapter about the illusion of invulnerability, shook me. It made me realize I'm just as easily swayed by ads and marketing as the next person. And so are you. This book is a great warning, a powerful education, and a great research tool. I'll use it to improve the marketing I create, but I'll also remember it the next time someone trys to market anything to me. Great book. Get it. Read it. Use it. - Joe Vitale, author of way too many books to list here ... </span>
