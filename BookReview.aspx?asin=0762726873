                    <span>This was an indespensible part of a recent road trip I took with my kids through Wyoming. It was a convenient source for side excursions and ways to see things off the "tourist trail".  It also presents little known facts and anecdotes.  I also own its companion for Texas.  You cannot say you truly know a place unless you own one of these books for the State in which you live.  The books open a whole new world of weekend excursions to places and things odd, quirky, historic and wonderful.  I highly recommend any in this series.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book along with Moon Publication's book on Wyoming.  I was looking for books to tell me about the rest of Wyoming, where to go, what there is to see and where to stay.  I defintiely wanted info on stuff  "off the beaten path".  Don't get me wrong, the Tetons and  Yellowstone are breath taking, but there are plenty of books written about  them.  I was interested in seeing what else this big and relatively empty  state has to offer.  It's great to find a book that tells you about the  other parts of Wyoming.  This title covers the history and geology of the  state but, in addition gives information about locals events.  It tells  about some of the smaller, less traveled places and describes some great  places to stay and visit.  I especially enjoyed the vivid descriptions of  places and the people.  I like to be away from the crowds and this book can  get me there, but somehow feeling it will all be familiar when I get there.  If you are looking for lesser known, lesser traveled places, if you enjoy  the experience of meeting people in these places and getting a real feel  for what it is like to live there this book is for you.  I know I will be  taking it on my next trip to Wyoming.</span>
