                    <span>I quite enjoyed reading this book. Having an interest in philosophy as well as in Seinfeld, I decided to give this book a read and was very pleased with it. It provided good insite into the characters themselves and was even able to provide more understanding of the different philosophical theories (Kierkegaard and Kramer was especially interesting).  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in philosophy and Seinfeld or would like to know more about either of those.  While it's not an educational book meant to teach, it's still a very interesting and fascinating read.</span>

                    <span>Watching television is a waste of time. Reading about watching television is less of a waste of time, maybe. But what about writing about watching television? There is an entire genre of academic writing now that treats TV shows as if they are worthy of analysis and even of deconstruction. In the past year I have read books about Gilligan's Island, the Simpsons, the Avengers and other spy shows, and now Seinfeld. Although the authors, usually university professors, treat their subjects seriously, they also seem to be having fun. This is the case with Seinfeld and Philosophy.
<br />
<br />All the contributors to this volume are fans of Seinfeld and sprinkle in catch phrases from the shows here and there. They are also scholars of philosophy who can toss off references to Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein at will. As a reader with a tenuous grasp of philosophical teachings, I cannot evaluate the academic value of these essays. However, I did notice that several Seinfeld episodes were worthy of multiple comments by these professors. They seemed especially fascinated with the episode in which George decides to do the opposite of what he normally does. They also liked the Bizarro episode, in which Elaine befriends a group of friends who are the opposite of Jerry, George, and Kramer. Are philosophy professors just obsessed with contrary behavior or is there some deeper meaning here? I suppose we'll have to wait for a book on Seinfeld and Psychology for the answer to that.
<br />
<br />Sarah Worth's essay on whether Elaine is a feminist or not is curious. Worth acknowledges that Elaine is the most stable, career-wise, of the gang (aside from Newman). She dates on her own terms and is treated as an equal by the rest of the characters. While Elaine confesses at one point that she would like to get married, I don't think that can eliminate her from the feminist category. And yet, Worth decides that Elaine is not a feminist, because she is too immoral and unethical. Elaine has too many boyfriends, is self-centered, and doesn't want to have children. While the professor might not admire Elaine, or want to be her friend, she should acknowledge that Elaine is a feminist. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

                    <span>Here's the premise; take an immensely popular show and capitalize on it by writing a series of essays on philosophy and slapping a Seinfeld photo on the cover?  Nope, it's much more than that.  This book is very interesting, and very well done.  I had several moments when reading where the correlation between the show and the philosophical concept was so direct that it is either a remarkable coincidence, or was actually written that way.
<br />
<br />For example, philosopher Jean Paul Sartre's play "No Exit" offers an account of three characters in hell, who are imprisoned together in a room.  They are sentenced to stay awake and in that room with one another for eternity. (Page 105). His thesis is that we are defined by others. Compare this to the unique end of the show where Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine are found guilty of violating a "Good Samaritan" law.  Their punishment; sentenced to spend a year in a cell together.  
<br />
<br />How often do you get serious discussions about the philosophical foundations of the "Castanza Maneuver", or how Socrates and Kramer may share some of the same philosophical focus?  When you can combine Plato and Elaine Bennes in the same book that is saying something.  The book itself is a series of essays.  Some of these are fabulous, some a bit of a stretch, but the overall effect is that the reader is exposed to countless philosophical concepts that may be otherwise unknown to many Seinfeld viewers.  If the popularity of the show can help deepen the thinking of a few, then that is worthwhile.
<br />
<br />While the title suggests a light fare, the book is anything but that.  In all honesty, had the book not been divided into rather short chapters that could be read one at a time, I may not have made it through.  The concepts are actually often quite deep, a stark contrast to the easy to digest commonality of the show.  Where the book gets the biggest hit is in the discussion of the fact that the show is actually about everything, not nothing.
<br />
<br />A fun read for Seinfeld fans and anyone who would like a quick introduction to some of the most highly regarded philosophical minds in history.  Combine this with a discussion of whether a chicken salad on rye is really the opposite of tuna on toast, and you have a winner.  
<br />

                    <span>Any and every philosopher worth his or her salt recognizes the philosophical brilliance (be it intentional or not) that underlies the tremendously successful Seinfeld TV show.  William Irwin has done a wonderful service to both philosophy and popular culture by editing this work.  So many philosophical themes ran throughout the nine years Seinfeld was on the air, one can imagine writing an episode-by-episode treatise!  In the meantime, however, this book will do.
<br />
<br />Yet, being a collection of essays, the usual problems of continuity and coherence are a part of the package.  Not all philosophers are created equal, and the variety of philosophical and literary quality varies.  For example, Jennifer McMahon's essay ("Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre") is excellent.  Sarah E. Worth's essay ("Elaine Benes: Feminist Icon or Just One of the Boys?") is embarrassing.  Mark T. Conrad's essay ("Plato or Nietzsche?"), unfortunately, remindes me of a piece written by a freshman philosophy major.  Kelly Dean Jolley's essay ("Wittgenstein and Seinfeld on the Commonplace") is courageous but weak (and short).
<br />
<br />But the most disappointing feature of this book lay in its sheer lack of entertainment overall.  Despite the seemingly bread-and-butter synthesis of Seinfeld and philosophy, this book was tedious whenever the contributing author was less than talented (there is some really bad writing in here).  All in all, I thought it was a bit of a let-down given the quality of the subject-matter.</span>

                    <span>	This book is bad. It contains the same essay about the episode where George does the opposite over and over again. Then there are some meaningless essays like Is Elaine A Feminist? where the author spends several pages convincing readers that albeit being free spirited she is not a feminist, although I never claimed she was. Then there's George being a loser and his inability to succeed, as well as a comparison between Jerry and Socrates that proves once and for all that there are some similarities but mostly they are very different. That's actually the format that most of the essays use: did you ever think that, well I could see why you would think that, but you're wrong and here's why. 
<br />
<br />Unpleasant. Avoid like a punch to the mouth.
