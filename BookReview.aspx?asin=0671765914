                    <span>My life has been greatly enriched by the legacy of Dr. Peale! Encouragement comes about from reading how other people have successfully faced their challenges and with God's help overcome them. In his collection, Dr. Peale provides such examples. His material is always relevant as the principles he teaches are timeless.
<br />
<br />Take the story of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He says his mother was the most influential person in his life and one of the things she taught him that stayed with him was to take the had you're dealt in life and work with it. By doing that things will turn out right. I see people who have come completely unglued because things didn't go their way. They used their energy up fussing over matters that would not change. If Eisenhower had done that we may have never known his name.</span>

                    <span>Vincent Peale has written some 42 books...and his message is good.  But given this book was first written in the 1970's, it is sometimes difficult to digest.  What is said in 320 pages could have been said in 30 (quite  wordy), the examples are far outdated (see below) and far too much  attention is paid to supressing your emotions (therapists will tell you  this is not good, feelings have to be dealt with).   Example:  Peale  upholds Henry Ford as a shining beacon of a good person....Henry Ford was a  great business leader but he was also a strong anit-semantic and was  against employing people of color.  The reader should also beware that  Peale is a Christian minister.<p>The book could use a re-write.<p>The  overall message however is still valuable today..Peale was one of the first  to point out the Mind-Body connection and the Self-Prophesy theory..what  you expect is what you get.  You dont have to read the whole book to get  the point though.</span>

                    <span>In 1990, this was just one of three great books that turned my life from a tradgedy to success. Back in 1990, I had a huge business that came crashing down. I was jobless and pennyless. Dr Peale's excellent book and a book  that I had read many years before turned my life around.  Within weeks, I  had found a brand new opportunity and within months my income was at a all  time personal high. The other two books? They were "Think and Grow  Rich" by Napolean Hill and More Wealth without Risk" by Charles  Givens. I obviously highly endorse all three. The priciples work.  Please  don't make the same mistake I did--read it and pack it away! Read the  books, take good notes, apply and reread at once a year. It's very true  that what you don't use, you'll lose. I know it happened to me.</span>

                    <span>Here is a concise, clear, and precise book on the power of thought, devoid of the "new-agey" hocus-pocus that is so prevelant today.  Dr. Peale writes in a straightforward manner.  Another good reason to get this  book?  Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and the Christian "Right"  dislike Peale and his work, referring to it as "heretical." A  rule of thumb, if those guys hate it, the rest of us will love it...</span>
