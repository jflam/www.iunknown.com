                <span id="Label1">Bernhard Riemann was an underdog of sorts, a malnourished son of a  parson who grew up to be the author of one of mathematics' greatest  problems. In <I>Prime Obsession</I>, John Derbyshire deals brilliantly  with both Riemann's life and that problem:  proof of the conjecture,  "All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half."  Though the statement itself passes as nonsense to anyone but a  mathematician, Derbyshire walks readers through the decades of reasoning  that led to the Riemann Hypothesis in such a way as to clear it up  perfectly. Riemann himself never proved the statement, and it remains  unsolved to this day. <I>Prime Obsession</I> offers alternating chapters  of step-by-step math and a history of 19th-century European intellectual  life, letting readers take a breather between chunks of well-written  information. Derbyshire's style is accessible but not dumbed-down,  thorough but not heavy-handed. This is among the best popular treatments  of an obscure mathematical idea, inviting readers to explore the theory  without insisting on page after page of formulae. </p> In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute offered a one-million-dollar  prize to anyone who could prove the Riemann Hypothesis, but luminaries  like David Hilbert, G.H. Hardy, Alan Turing, Andr&#233; Weil, and Freeman  Dyson have all tried before. Will the Riemann Hypothesis ever be proved?  "One day we shall know," writes Derbyshire, and he makes the effort seem  very worthwhile. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>Prime Obsession is an excellent popularization of the Riemann Hypothesis. I found John Derbyshire's presentation of the math to be very approachable by non-mathematicians like myself. It's taken slow, one basic step at a time, and spread across a well written and fascinating history of Bernhard Riemann and other key players. Simply put, you do not need an advance degree in mathematics to enjoy this book. <P>My math bakground is limited to 2 semesters of calculus 20 years ago and I haven't used it since. For me, John Derbyshire's approach was both refreshing and entertaining. If you've got even the faintest interest in math, you will find this book rewarding.</span>

                    <span>Prime Obsession is a delight: a book about a hypothesis on the distribution of prime numbers that reads like a gripping mystery. Most fiction isn't this vivid, moving, and well written, and this is no fiction. It is history, biography, philosophy, and, yes, mathematics brought to life with wit and wonder. You have to read this extraordinary book.<P>This is the story of the Reimann Hypothesis, the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics today. Here it is in all its glory: "All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half."<P>What on earth does it mean? Mr. Derbyshire, a gifted storyteller, takes the reader on an exhilarating journey of discovery as he painstakingly illuminates the meaning, mystery, and power of those eleven short words. <P>I have never taken a course in calculus and am intimidated by even moderately complex math notation. There's lots of that in this book, and I had my doubts I could get through it. But Mr. Derbyshire knows that some of his readers will have fear of flying, or only be able to fly for short distances, so he patiently breaks scary-looking formulae into bite-size pieces and gives you the general rules you need to know to digest them. He knows how to explain things with crystal clarity and easy wit. And the man knows how to turn a phrase.<P>Still, he does not coddle his readers, so you need to be prepared to roll up your sleeves and fasten your seat belt. This is a challenging book, no bones about it. I needed to read it twice just to get a passing feel for chunks of it. Why, you may ask, would I twice read a book I had difficulty comprehending? Because with Mr. Derbyshire's gentle urging I could glimpse the beauty and feel the deep wonder of Bernhard Riemann's hypothesis, even if it remained just beyond grasp. And this was enough, more than enough, to rivet my attention for days and give me hours of entertaining, informative reading.<P>This is a gem of book. It left me gasping for air and wanting more. I cannot more strongly recommend it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Although this book deals with a subject that no-one would sensibly place in a category below "Very Advanced," John Derbyshire treats his subject as well as any math author I've ever read, and I've read a lot of math books over the past 40-some years.<P>My formal math education ended after a standard introductory calculus course as an undergrad. However, I have always been, and remain, extremely interested in math -- a math aficianado if you will. As such, I've self-taught myself a lot of math -- including a lot of very advanced math -- over the past 40 years; ergo, my reading of a great many math books. And without doubt, Derbyshire's book is the finest math book I've yet to read.<P>I suspect Derbyshire started with the hypothesis that his readers are not familiar (or only familiar in a passing sense) with high-level, advanced math, and perhaps might even suffer from math anxiety. Any such readers, however, should have absolutely no fears. Derbyshire's exposition is superb. He clearly defines everything the reader needs to know to grasp AND understand fully the more advanced parts of the book. The book is clearly well designed to convey the information he wants or needs of convey and masterfully explains what would otherwise be quite difficult to understand.<P>Without any doubt this is by far the best book on any advanced and complicated subject -- the best book on ANY math subject (including a book on something as simple as how to add one and one) -- I have ever read.<P>Without sacrificing the complexity of the subject, Derbyshire has written his book in a very readable and interesting manner. And he does all this while making the subject so interesting you can hardly wait for someone to finally prove Riemann's Hypothesis and Riemann's zeta function so we can read Derbyshire's account of that landmark event in the history of mathematics.</span>

                    <span>This book should be the first one to appear in Amazon's listings for the Riemann Hypothesis, yet doesn't even appear in the top ten. It gives fascinating historical background to a very real Riemann and his friends, traces developments to the present day in a conversational tone, and somehow manages to take the reader through the details of what the RH says so that you actually understand it. Recommended with one reservation; to understand the chapters (every other one) which bring one to understand the RH, you will need to make a considerable investment in reading and rereading to make it. That is not for the faint of heart. However, the other half of the book can be enjoyed by anyone who likes general science history books.</span>

                    <span>"Prime Obsession" is a fascinating book for several reasons: the author explains a difficult topic with such clarity that it's simply amazing. For those who are more skilled in math, this book would also be very enjoyable to read, except that they might find some of his explanations redundant because he really assumes that the we don't know anything (and I mean anything!).<BR>Mr. Derbyshire obviously understands the topic quite well himself. He has written an amazing book for everyone to enjoy. <BR>200 years since Riemann first presented the problem, we are still desperately trying to solve it, and one day, you never know... what a piece of work a man is!</span>
