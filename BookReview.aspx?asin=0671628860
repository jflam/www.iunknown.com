                    <span>I recently took on a project to read the 4 or 5 negotiating books that I had accumulated over the years. Of all of the books that I read--Negotiating to Close was the only one specifically written with the salesperson in mind. Over the years it has become increasingly clear to me that buyers are employing skills and technology to try to win the best values for their companies. Negotiate to Close helps level that playing field. Knowing the technology of selling isn't enough--you also need to know the technology of making a successful deal.<P>There was some excellent information here that didn't appear in any of the other negotiating books. For example--his explanation of how the Good Cop/Bad Cop technique can be used to get you to accept a bad deal from the good cop--was an eye opener.<P>Gary Karrass teaches negotiating from the perspective of someone who has clearly "carried a bag". I could go on and on--bottom line--if you sell--read and use this book.</span>

                    <span>I have been working on a sales job for almost 12 years but reading Mr. Karrass' book gave me a totally different perspective to the way I do business with my customers. The book covers all important topics for people working on sales that have to negotiate with large accounts. This book should be the background for everyone that decides to start working on a sales job, since it helps you to uncover your power and improve your performance when dealing with customers.</span>

                    <span>When you speak you want to get your point across. Karrass in an easy reading style sets out those rules of communication. If you know the rules you can have fun and respect when someone says "I saw it cheaper down the street" or "I will wash the dishes tomorrow".<P>This book is not just for the salesperson. The book is for everyone who wants to negotiate.</span>
