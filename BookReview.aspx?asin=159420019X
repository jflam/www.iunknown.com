                    </div>
                    <span>The main point I took from this book is that Ben Franklin's conversion from loyal British subject and lover of the King of England to American revolutionary occurred primarily as a result of ridicule heaped on him by the British Parliament in his presence.  So his Americanization, or radicalization, was a result of hurt feelings, was a grudge against those who turned on him.
<br />
<br />He would have been happy to be a loyalist if only the British had flattered him.  Isn't that childish?  His idealism, his devotion to the cause of American independence, was nothing but his childish revenge at being personally insulted.  It had nothing to do with British policy or any political issue.
<br />
<br />Not that the American Revolution was a question of black and white idealism.  We often hear that it wasn't, that it was a question of economics.  We hear these days that the Boston Massacre was the fault of the Americans, that the British were innocent, that they were only defending themselves from a mob.  The American Revolution wasn't a war of good vs evil as World War Two was.  So Franklin can be excused for not knowing which side to land on, until he was personally insulted and his feelings of pride and revenge got involved.
<br />
<br />That, in a nutshell, is the Americanization of Ben Franklin.  But the book covers other material as well.  One of the most interesting parts to me was Franklin's life in France, where he was loved and appreciated as much as Jerry Lewis.
<br />
<br />John Adams comes off as a big boob in this book.  An utter fool.  I doubt it.  I think the author chose to give us a cardboard John Adams to knock down, because he was a rival of Franklin.  Adams is certainly not three dimensional here.  He isn't even two dimensional.  He is just on the left side of the line, the negative side, of a one-dimensional line, where the right side is intelligence and the left is nothing but a boob.
<br />
<br />Franklin comes off as a bit of a boob too, in places.  He kind of more or less sort of supports or doesn't object to the Stamp Act, but then when he is stunned by the violent reaction of the Americans to it, he goes oops, and he changes his tune.  And he goes through the same thing about the Boston Tea Party, thinking the British actions were pretty much okay, maybe, who knows?, but then being surprised at the violent reaction of the revolutionaries, and offering to pay for the tea himself.
<br />
<br />To the author's credit, he does explain why the British felt it necessary to tax the colonists.  They were in a deep financial hole thanks to the French and Indian War in support of the colonists, and they needed to recoup their losses.  The English people were taxed more heavily than the Americans to begin with.  Franklin was correct to be ambivalent to these taxes.  Again, the American Revolution was not a black and white case of good vs evil, so sensible people could land on either side of the question.
<br />
<br />Franklin does not come off as an unqualified hero.  He had a lot of sense and ability as an ambassador, and he was extremely important to the war effort primarily because he managed to get the military and financial assistance of France, without which the result could not have been what it was.  For this reason alone, he is considered to be second only to Washington in importance.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, he treated his wife churlishly, abandoning her, not caring about her a bit, while she suffered physically and pined away at home for him.  Her sin was a lack of sophistication, and his weakness was vanity.
<br />
<br />He prided himself on being a chess player on a grand stage, a world mover and shaker, but he completely misunderstood what was going on half the time.  Later in life he realized that world events are not like a chess game, but more like a dice game, and his fallback position was that God controls, people don't.
<br />
<br />Was his main strength simply that he knew how to play the French, or to put it another way, that the French loved his act and appreciated his anti-aristocracy views?
<br />
<br />In the end of the book we are brought firmly onto his side by our sense of sympathy.  Here he was, having secured America's independence from England, surrounded by idiots like John Adams who did nothing but obstruct, and America failed to appreciate their real hero.  Only France got it right, and adored the man who fleeced them, who used them, who inspired them to their own revolution.
<br />
<br />Franklin comes off strongest at the end of the book.  We are told what his religious views were, and they make perfect sense.  He believed in a creator, he did not believe in the divinity of Jesus, and he considered organized religion to be more divisive than unifying, and therefore probably more trouble than it is worth.  I'd go along with him on those points.  
<br />
<br />He would have hated today's right wing loonies who think the Bible is the dictation of God Himself, and who don't even know what is in the Bible in the first place, thinking it is all about the evils of sex and abortion, when the fact is that abortion isn't mentioned once in that old collection of fictional myths and semi-history, and sex, whether hetero or homo, is far from central to the plot, is in fact barely touched upon, occasionally.
<br />
<br />Franklin opposes the two-part Congress, the separation of Senate from Representatives.  Why are there two houses of Congress anyway?  Apparently it is to mimic the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and the Senate is the American version of the House of Lords, designed to give the wealthy a much stronger presence in government than the commoners.  The Senate represents the power of the aristocracy, and Franklin saw no need for it.  
<br />
<br />Why do we have two houses anyway?  I see his point.  But to me, the rich have undue influence in every branch of government.  It's their country, not ours, and the one thing we are called on to do is shut up and do what we're told.
<br />
<br />I think the book is worth reading.  Go read it.  See what you make of it, and whether your impressions are similar to mine.</span>

                    <span>The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin is an excellent portrait of Benjamin Franklin as a public figure.  The book does not focus heavily on his personal relationships with Deborah Franklin, his children and grandchildren (except perhaps with William), nor on his inventions, ideas and creations, but instead focuses on two things:  the perception of  Franklin's public persona and Franklin's metamorphasis from loyal subject of the crown to American patriot.  Franklin is an interesting and complex historical figure and was not as fully appreciated in America during his life as he should have been and Wood explains the political forces that led to that.  Part of the problem, perhaps, was the fact that he had to be "Americanized" and made a radical.  Those who were already Americanized and radicalized, such as John Adams, had difficulty believing that he fully supported the cause.  The passage of time has of course corrected that misunderstanding.  Wood does an excellent job of telling Franklin's story.  The book is a very readable and engaging account of one of America's most compelling characters.</span>

<br />Having several books on Benjamin Franklin, I was anxious to read this one, too. Having read it I think it well worth the time.
<br />
<br />But I would caution any reader coming to this work expecting a full-blown biography, to read a straight biography or two, first. Mr. Wood is offering us glimpses or stages, such as restore points in a computer. We get to see Benjamin Franklin begin in poverty and accompany him as he moves through life. It is a quick, smooth read, but it really only touches the surface of the man called Benjamin Franklin. And this exists as a valid problem because as Mr. Woods states Mr. Franklin is still an enigma in many respects to most historians today. Just 'who' Benjamin Franklin was can give even the most diehard biographers great difficulty.
<br />
<br />I'm sure any reader interested in colonial or American history will enjoy this book, but I also believe it cannot offer the depth of study that a biography would.
<br />
<br />But, again, Mr. Woods DID NOT say he was writing a biography, that was never his intent, so I am NOT faulting him. His purpose is well served here. But a reader interested in a more complete life, may come away needing more 
<br />
<br />Truly, I think any book written by this scholar is deserving of our attention.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book reads like a novel and is difficult to put down.  The author tries to get into BF's mind, not an easy task.  While Wood doesn't leave out BF's failures, it is easy to be overwhelmed with how talented this man was.  Although his whole life is reviewed, I would like to cover in this review something only hinted at in the last chapter.  
<br />
<br />When BF was in his young to middle aged working life, he created, among other things, Poor Richard's Almanac.  This was first published in 1733; full of common sense, admonitions to industry and frugality, and homespun proverbs.  His last edition was in 1758, reprinted separately as "The Way To Wealth," and attributed to a "Father Abraham."
<br />
<br />Later, when in a rare depression following a political failure in England, a friend convinced him he owed it to the public to write an autobiography.  He began the first installment as advice to his son, William, and wrote additional entries over a number of years.
<br />
<br />BF loved Europe, and they loved him.  His work in electricity in his early 40's earned him in international reputation, complete with multiple honorary degrees.  Perhaps because he spent so much time abroad, perhaps because his political enemies set the tone, he was not as appreciated in his home country.  Interestingly, he made it back for the writing of the both the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution 11 yrs. later.  
<br />
<br />After BF died, he was virtually ignored in America, while France proclaimed 3 days of mourning and made him a national hero.  This contrast is more than striking.  There were lots of signers to the Declaration of Independence, but only a few of them stand out in America as household names.  The rest of them have varied lesser legacies, with perhaps only short encyclopedia entries.  
<br />
<br />BF's legacy would possibly have shared that fate, had it not been for his writings, particularly his Autobiography and Poor Richard's Almanac.  Vitally important to the popularity of BF's writings were the changes that were occuring in American society, lessening the mindless esteem of the seemingly non-working upper class, and celebrating the working man. Perhaps  his books helped to expedite these changes. 
<br />
<br />In the early 1800's these two books became standard issue for those working men who aspired to get ahead in America.  "The Way To Wealth" alone had over a hundred editions in over a dozen languages.  His "list of virtues" comprised 13 traits (virtues), each one to be concentrated on for a week at a time.  At the end of thirteen weeks, they would have all been practiced once, so one starts over.  At the end of a year, each one would have been worked on for four weeks.  BF admitted in writing the difficulties he personally experienced while trying to be virtuous, but maintained there was virtue in attempting perfection.  One of his famous statement concerns his difficulty conquering vanity.  He wrote that in trying to keep his vanity under control during  "humility" week, he found himself succumbing to proudness for having achieved so much humbleness (or something like that). 
<br />
<br />Indeed, in 1836, a copy of the Autobiography was amongst Davy Crockett's few possessions found at the Alamo. This excellent book about one of my heroes, though relatively short, captures BF's exemplary abilities and a few human weaknesses, and I recommend it highly.    </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an extended essay on Benjamin Franklin by the distinguished historian Gordon Wood.  Wood explores Franklin's career and his later significance in American life.  This concise book gives an outline of Franklin's life and then concentrates on Franklin's role in the American Revolution.  Wood uses Franklin to show the evolution of many colonials from thinking of themselves as English and enthusiastic supporters of the British Empire to revolutionaries.  Franklin is an extreme example of this general phenomenon.  Resident for many years in England, Franklin was enamoured of the cosmopolitanism of English life and an enthusiastic imperialist.  Many many colonials, he was disillusioned by the maladroit handling of colonial affairs after the Seven Years War.  Once he converted to the cause of the Revolution, he became a fervent supporter and his diplomacy at the French court was crucial to the success of the Revolution.  Woods deals also with Franklin's transition from craftsman to gentleman and his later adoption by the American public as the symbol of successful capitalism.  These discussions provide some insight into the changing nature of social and political life engendered by the Revolution.
<br />Like all of Wood's work, this is a well written and insightful book.  It is, especially in comparison with his prior monographs, relatively slight.  Well worth reading but not a major work of scholarship.  </span>
