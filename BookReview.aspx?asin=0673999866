                    <span>This book has a great approach to teaching C with emphasis on pointers. It is a great resource that will further your knowledge and usage of C language.
<br />
<br />However, the price tag of the book is a classic example of a college instructor writing a book so that they can make it required reading, and profit from their faithful students.
<br />
<br />Ken: The material is on the level, I know your publisher gave you a sweet enough deal to make this book affordable to the average reader.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">One of the best C books I've read.</div>

                    <span>I bought this book for a class on C taught by the author. The man really knows his stuff and this book shows it. Even the most seasoned C programmer can learn a new thing or two from Ken's elegant coding and concise explanations. It also makes a great reference, as it seems to have the answers to those random questions that come up while programming, easily found and explained in plain English.  
<br />If you are a C programmer, I would say this book is a must have.</span>

                    <span>The book carries through an interesting boarding in relation to the use of some more important resources of the C language,  multidimensional arrays and pointers.  
<br />
<br />The comparison that is made between them, as well as the use most appropriate of each one is enlightening.  
<br />
<br />The author also carries through a soon however interesting explanation on the design and implementation of ADTs.  At last, the book brings valuable tips and serves as reference for programmers of any level.</span>

                    <span>I just had to do something when I saw the 3-star review saying it's not worth the money. It absolutely is! Pointers is the most difficult thing about C, and this book REALLY made me understand what you can (and can't do). The last chapter that includes m68k assembly also gives you some leverage in the field of code/machine.
<br />Best C-book I have read (that includes "The C-Programming Language").</span>
