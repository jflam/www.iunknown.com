                    <span>True to the game is a book that most of these young girls need to be reading. Teri did a good job writing this book I respect Gina for loving Quadir like she did.I was really said when quadir died I even cried.

                    <span>Um..can someone tell me please what all the hype was about?  This book was just mediocre but the cover is pretty.  I bought DON'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE by Stacy Nelson and there's no comparison.  It's something about the TCP authors.  Maybe they all need to branch out.  I'll be getting Nikki's new one though, only because I love to read.  Now that she's with a major publisher let's see what she comes with.</span>

                    <span>This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time.  I am so tired of reading books with typos, incomplete sentences, storylines that don't go anywhere, and, completely unbelieveable situations.  
<br />The only reason I finished the book was because I started it.  But it  was a chore to do so.  
<br />It seems to me the only people who like these books and give them 4 and 5 stars, are people who seem to have problems writing and spelling themselves.  If you don't believe me, read their reviews, and you will understand what I mean.</span>
