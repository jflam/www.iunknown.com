                    <span>I bought the book on CD, listened to it, and immediately listened to it a second time.  It contains invaluable information for self-help, business and/or leadership development.  Practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions.  I assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation - it was not, it was about encouraging (and accepting) honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact.  </span>

                    <span>Susan Scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all "pretending not to know".  I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious.
<br />
<br />One of the topics discussed is called "Mineral Rights", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on.  The approach accomplishes four purposes:  Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships.  It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now.  The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them.  The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace.   The answers usually are "in the room" if we can really get honest and start looking for them.
<br />
<br />In addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves.  Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships.  Another great approach used is the "Decision Tree" to help build empowerment in others.  Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others.  (Page 252).  Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on.
<br />
<br />While this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our "emotional wake".  We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people.  The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave?  How do we want people to feel?  This served as a great wake up call for me while reading.  
<br />
<br />Overall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn't begin to do it justice here.   From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read.  It is both deep and practical, both academically sound and real world tested, and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself.  Highly recommended!

                    <span>Most breakdowns in life have some connection to conversations -- conversations not had, conversations that go poorly, or conversations not yet even imagined.  There are a number of good books on conversations and this is one of them.<p>I tend to refer my coaching clients to "Fierce Conversations" when they are having trouble getting motivated and avoid a lot of uncomfortable conversations (compared to recommending other books for those who botch difficult conversations).  <p>Susan's section on "stump speeches" is good for gaining clarity on personal vision (i.e., where are you going, why, who is going with you, and how will you get there?).  <p>Once clear on "where you are going," it's time to start noticing and speaking about what "you're pretending not to know" (otherwise known as breakdowns -- yours or others).  <p>Although "Fierce Conversations" doesn't cover the underlying emotions like "Difficult Conversations" or "Nonviolent Communications" do, or the styles under stress (silence or violence) as "Crucial Conversations" does, it does have some good discussion on "interrogating reality" (with an emphasis on questions and remaining curious) and identifying your own role in conversational breakdowns.  <p>Fierce, difficult, crucial, nonviolent -- whatever you call these conversations, they're at the core of all meaningful relationships.  I can definitely recommend "Fierce Conversations" to the mix of books on skillful conversations.</span>

                    <span>This book offers numerous useful principles that will help anyone become a better conversationalist and a more responsive listener. Read carefully because gems of very valuable content are scattered through the entire book, a sentence here, a quotation there, buried in long, interesting digressions about the author's life, people she's known and clients she's worked with over time. A judicious editor could have made a very sharp and effective pocket book out of this material, which is about managing intense, strong discussions with skill. As it is, you'll have to do some digging, but you'll have a perfectly good time doing it, particularly if you are a fan of New Age mantras and can handle a little touchy-feely vocabulary. We assure you that the lessons you'll learn about conversations - including fierce ones - will stand you in good stead.</span>

                    <span>I listened to both this and "Difficult Conversations."  I found that "Diffiicult Conversations" offered much more helpful, concrete advice, and the material was much better organized.  I was disappointed that the emphasis of "Firece Conversatons" was almost entirely on business related conversations.  Example after example focused on her executive clients.  After listening to this program, I felt no more prepared for conversations with friends and family than before.  There were a few helpful ideas, but they were presented much more clearly in "Difficult Conversations."  "Difficult Conversations" gave me real, practical strategies that have made a big difference in my ease in bringing up tricky conversations and working through them with positive results.</span>
