                    <span>  Office 2003 is quite simply the worst pile of bloated crapware I have ever had the misfortune of installing on my computer.  Its slow, costs too much, eats up way too much precious hard drive space, and is difficult and unintuitive to use.  Absolutely the worst experience I personally have ever had with "productivity" software.  Do yourself a favor, go to openoffice.org, download their suite and use it.  You won't be disappointed.  Sometimes, I truly wish there were a "zero star" option from Amazon in rating a product.  If anything deserves it, this garbage does.</span>

                    <span>I am primarily an Excel user; this review is intended for those who primarily use Excel...
<br />
<br />If you work with a development team that has the ability to produce XML files, and you want to get away from using gigantic flat databases for references, Office 2003 is your solution.  Copying and pasting will be no longer necessary; just query a URL.  It's proven to be an indispensible tool for us.
<br />
<br />So, if you're in the serious business of producing reports, and you have a development staff that can produce dynamic XML pages, this is the product for you.  With the previous version, you could Web Query; XML provides so many more possibilities --especially if you're coding.  The code is much simpler.
<br />
<br />Other than that, the program is not much different from 2002.  Many other features that people want were still not implemented, such as extending the columns beyond 256 and the rows beyond 65K+.  Word still has the same ole quirks (you know what they are if work with it often), and Access is just about the same.  For the latter two programs, the only noticeable difference is the 'feel,' or the look of them.</span>

                    <span>Perhaps I am jaded but again it seems that Microsoft has cranked out another product that looks and acts so much like its predecessor that you wonder at first if you loaded it onto your computer properly.
<br />
<br />Office 2003 gives you what you already have in Office XP (and a few earlier versions) so learning how to use it is never going to be a problem.  In virtually every way the program looks and feels like the previous Office versions.
<br />
<br />There are improvements although I am not sure how much a home user will need the XML functionality.  It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.  
<br />
<br />Microsoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.  If anything, they should be upgrades that former users should be able to download if they registered the original product - the cost is too prohibitive to justify upgrading.  And, as your Office 97 or XP works just as well, you should think seriously before spending the money.</span>

                    <span>This is the newest version of Microsoft Office. I think this is the best also because they have added programs that you couldn't get with 2000 or XP. They include:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Word 2003 
<br />Microsoft Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager 
<br />Microsoft Excel 2003 
<br />Microsoft Access 2003 
<br />Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 
<br />Microsoft Publisher 2003 
<br />
<br />Word 2003 has really improved and it has much more fonts than the older versions. I love PowerPoint now and I use it a lot with work and just sometimes to fool around with. Outlook has finally gotten a new look to it which looks awesome. Publisher has even more things you can do with it. Excel has become a little bit easier with more things built into though. I love Office 2003 and no other company can even compare to it.</span>
