                    <span>This is one of the best books I've ever read. I have read most of the current books in network security, and this is the first one, teaching you how to "think". While most other books on the market will show how to run exploits written by others, this is the first one addressing how to make yourself working exploit code. I am familiar with most papers on this issue (Murat's text, Aleph0' etc), but never before have I seen such clarity and pedagogical approach as in "hacking : the art of exploitation". Besides, I learned new techniques on exploiting an elf binary from this book. <BR>Ever since I started reading it, I could not leave the book apart. The writing style is very clear, precise, making diffcult topics (like shellcode writing, printable shellcodes, heap/stack overflows) accesible and easily understandable for everyone. <P>The author presents three major topics. The first one addresses in excellent detail how software exploits can be crafted. Here you can learn a methodology on how buffer/heap/format string vulnerabilities are done. A second part of the book discusses network level vulnerabilities, while the last part adddresses cryptography. Even on this last topic, which traditionally looks either to mathematical or to general in other books, "hacking : the art of exploitation" is great and keeps one breathless. <BR>To summarize : If you're interested in network security, or enjoying learning/reading neurons-stimulating stuff, this is the book to read.</span>

                    <span>This book is for the security pro or would be hacker who want's to begin to see how deep the rabbit hole really does go. There is no other book like it on the market, and I've read most of them. Jon Erickson's code included in the book all works well as designed on Linux. The author also suggests some good free Linux tools for use with the code examples including most notably a hex editor, basic dissassembler, and packet injector.<P>The techniques in the book are best described by a caption on its back cover, "The fundamental techniques of serious hacking." It includes major sections on programming, networking, and cryptography. All material is covered with an eye towards exploitation. Languages used in the book material consist of C, PERL, and Assembly for X86. <P>The techniques described in this book are fundamental to any hacker or security professional who takes their work seriously. The book is well worth the discounted amazon.com price. The material in this book is all original and cannot be found elsewhere. Each example in the programming section is truly an eye opener if you are new to code hacking. The examples in the networking and cryptography sections are relevant and fresh as well.</span>

                    <span>This book is 10 times greater than any other hacking book. It gives useful code and examples rather than 250 pages of theory. Stack and heap overflows are explained in detail as well as many other modern types of exploits. The best part of the book is that it teaches the reader how to write his/her own shellcode and teaches some basic Assembly language along the way. Everything you need to know to be a hacker or stop hackers.<P>Includes detailed explanations and code for:<BR>buffer / stack / heap based overflows<BR>format string vulnerabilities<BR>writing shellcode<BR>sniffing switched and unswitched networks<BR>tcp / ip hijacking<BR>denial of service<BR>port scanning and tricking port scans of your own computer<BR>password cracking<BR>Man in the middle attacks<BR>Wireless internet security / hacking<BR>and more</span>

                    <span>You have probably heard of such hacking techniques as buffer overflows. Typically, a book might give only cursory explanation, especially if it is not devoted to hacking. But suppose you write in C. Chances are you've inadvertantly created buffer overflows and then spent hours chasing this down, after your program crashed. So how on earth can a deliberate overflow lead to a breakin?<P>It is for such matters that Erickson expounds here. Written for you, whether you want to create such exploits or prevent them. In either case, the knowledge is the same.<P>What the book requires is some knowledge of C and assembly. For the latter, it is the language of the Intel x86 family. But even if you don't know it, so long as you are familiar with any assembly language and the theory of a Neumann machine, then you can follow the text.<P>This book is not for every programmer. It turns out that a fair number of programmers get into the field by learning a high level language like C, Fortran, Java or Pascal. But they never learn any assembly. To them, anything compiled from source is a black box. Instead, you need some background in assembly.<P>The book also gives neat coverage of how to sniff network traffic and manipulate it. There is a section on cryptography. But for this, it is so specialised and vital that you should consult texts dedicated to it.</span>
