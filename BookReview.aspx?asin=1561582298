                <span id="Label1">It takes only a drive through any typical American subdivision to confirm that in recent decades the average house has grown in size, narrowed in style, and shrunk in vision. Jim Tolpin's <I>The New Cottage Home</I> represents a return to a previous school of thought about living space: that it should be no larger than is needed, conservative of resources, rich in detail-- in short, that it should pay homage to honest architecture and fine craftsmanship, not to conspicuous consumption. The 30 cottage homes pictured, all recently built, have the slightly unfair advantage of almost magically beautiful locations, but each has a unique character and many cottage-style nooks and crannies: the converted island pump house with sod roof, the 600-square-foot woodland temple, the salvage-built house on the Kansas prairie, the off-the-grid shingled hilltop house built to take advantage of natural light. Tolpin does an excellent job of pulling together the elements of each that make it a cottage and make it appealing. In his own words, "These houses seem to call as much to the heart as to the head, enriching us more with the highs of nature than with the highs of technology. These are the new American cottages that embody the ancient storybook dream, and the kind of homes that many of us have always dreamed of living in."</span>

                    <span>This particular book has numerous ideas for the cottage affacionado. There are several different categories to choose from with many sub-styles within each category. Mr. Tolpin captures the true essence of the cottage experience in each spread with many colorful pictures a wonderfully vivid descriptions. Not only is this book appropriate for those looking to build a second/vacation home, but it also serves as a guid for those interested in imparting a cottage-esque style to any new home, wether it be in the country or the city. Designers will greatly appreciate the descriptive floor plans. Overall, this is a must for any person interested in cottages or residential architecture.</span>

                    <span>I'm so inspired by this beautiful book, which makes a nice companion to the Cottage Style decorating book that I got from amazon last year. I'm marking pages of ideas to use when we have our own cottage built, but in the meantime, I'm picking up ideas I can use now to cozy up our present home. The first thing on the list is an upholstered window seat to go under our bank of living room windows. A beautiful book.</span>

                    <span>Getting away has taken on a certain urgency in the past week. The second home we've been wanting now seems like a good idea for our primary residence, instead. Getting our family of the metro area is something we are seriously considering. This book is gorgeous. It looks like most of the homes are architect designed, so the architect's fees might eat you alive if you decided to go this route. Still, though, the houses are reasonably sized and include lots of charming details. I also recommend:<BR>SECOND HOME (shows great houses around the country but also includes real estate shopping information, tips on evaluating a region or a small town, and so forth. inspiring and helpful too. houses includes new homes as well as refurbished older ones. A handsome but realistic book.)<BR>CABIN FEVER (a style book that does show how delightful a small cabin can be)<BR>SMALL HOUSE BIG STYLE (a very helpful book that also shows how to live in smaller spaces)</span>
