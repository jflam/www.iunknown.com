                    <span>When it comes to building databases, this book organizes chapters into an easy-to-follow logical sequence. Nielsen offers something for everyone in this book by taking you from modeling a logical database design, to implemtation, to performance tuning. He provides easy-to-follow examples all throughout the book. Personally, I found his "Best Practice" opinions and suggestions priceless!</span>

                    <span>The content of SQL Server 2000 Bible is expertly written and presented.  Author Paul Nielsen is completely deserving of the kudos he's getting on these pages.  I find there are examples of everything I'm looking for buried somewhere in this book.  
<br />
<br />The operative word being 'buried.'  There's the rub.  My only complaint about the book is something the author had no control over: the quality of the index.  In these types of reference books, you're completely dependent on the index to lead you to the proper place in the book.  I find my hit rate is about 50% or so.  In general, the tack of the Bible series is to aggregate items in the index into topics like 'code,' 'data,' 'design,' language,' 'model' (you get the idea) while the reader (this reader, at least) is looking for an arrangement that is a bit more pratical.
<br />
<br />Despite this shortcoming, Nielsen's book is one you'll keep close by your side as your navigate the depths of SQL Server.</span>

                    <span>Thank you for your kind reviews. I hope you have as much fun working with SQL Server as I do. If you're a SQL Server DBA, developer, or architect, I have two suggestions; 
<br />
<br />First, join your local Profession Association for SQL Server (SQLPASS.org) chapter. The SQL Server community is a growing and positive group. 
<br />
<br />Second, after you've read my book, continue learning. I highly recommend these books: 
<br />
<br />* Inside SQL Server by Kalen Delany 
<br />* Advanced Transact-SQL by Itzik Ben-Gan & Tom Moreau
<br />* Hitchhiker's Guide to Reporting Services by Bill Vaughn 
<br />* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 New Features by Michael Otey 
<br />
<br />It's critical that the book is accurate and the errata page on the book's website (www.sqlserverbible.com) keeps everyone honest. There are a handfull known errors: 4 screen shots mis-captioned, 1 screen shot mis-cropped, 1 table with transposed cells, and 1 mis-wording. If you discover any other errors please write to me. 
<br />
<br />I hope to meet you at a SQL PASS Summit. 
<br />
<br />may all your queries run swift and true, 
<br />-Paul Nielsen, SQL Server MVP 
<br />
<br />p.s. I would have preferred to not rate my own book, but the Rating column has a NOT NULL constraint.</span>
