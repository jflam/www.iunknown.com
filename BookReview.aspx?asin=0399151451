                <span id="Label1">A cheating husband and a wayward wife provide Spenser with an unconventional and dangerous surveillance job. <br><br> When Marlene Cowley hires Spenser to see if her husband, Trent, is cheating on her, he encounters more than he bargained for: Not only does he find a two-timing husband, but a second investigator as well, hired by the husband to look after his wife. As a result of their joint efforts, Spenser soon finds himself investigating both individual depravity and corporate corruption. <br><br> It seems the folks in the Cowley's circle have become enamored of radio talk-show host Darrin O'Mara, whose views on Courtly Love are clouding some already fuzzy minds with the notion of cross-connubial relationships. O'Mara's brand of sex therapy is unconventional at best, unlawful-and deadly-at worst. Then a murder at Kinergy, where Trent Cowley is CFO, sends Spenser in yet another direction. Apparently, the unfettered pursuit of profit has a price. <br><br> With razor-sharp characterizations and finely honed prose, this is Parker writing at the height of his powers.</span>

                    <span>Parker is in top form as Spenser investigates financial and sexual escapades in an Enron-like company. The book is heavier on plot than some of his later works which is a welcome development. As usual the dialogue is amusing and literate. Susan, Hawk, Rita Fiore, and Vinnie Morris all return. Hawk has a new girlfriend and it appears to be a serious relationship. I hope we see more of her in the next book. <P>I was interested in another reviewer's comment that Spenser was the new Travis McGee. I remember that when John MacDonald died, I wondered if there was another author whose new books I could anticipate with the same eagerness, knowing that reading them would be sheer joy. Then I discovered Parker and Spenser!</span>

                    <span>When Spenser is hired by a woman to investigate her husband for potential divorce proceedings, he finds himself involved in a corporate snake pit. There is wife swapping, a corporate pimp, shell companies, creative accounting, greed, and a presidential wannabe who can't keep his pants zipped. Unlike the real life corporate scandals, in this case the Chief Financial Officer gets whacked. Suspicion points in various directions.<P>There is the usual cast of characters, with Hawk and Vinnie lending helping hands, friends with the police, Spenser's girlfriend Susan and the dog they share, and various other characters that show up, some new and some old. The killers are caught, but some guilty parties seem to walk away. There is a major loose end as the corporation seems to be left in limbo.<P>My oldest niece would call the novel brain candy. It is light reading for a rainy evening, a weekend at the beach, a long commute or an airline flight. It contains some details for setting up shell companies and creating ficticious assets. The novel contains language (mainly the F word in its various forms), implied sexual activity, and a couple murders, but nothing graphic. I would rate it at about the PG-13 level.</span>

                    <span>I didn't think it was possible for Parker to give us even MORE of the incredibly irritating Susan Silverman, but when you team that up with very little Hawk and even more banal "banter" between Susan and Spenser, this book is a loser. Give it up Mr. Parker...you've lost it!</span>

                    <span>I loved this book, almost entirely due to Joe Mantegna's reading and characterization. Parker does a good job of telling us yet another Spenser story -- most of us don't read Spenser novels for the plot but for just how Parker write Spenser -- funny, sarcastic, wonderful. Mantegna does a fabulous job of bringing all of these characters to life. Go listen to it. It's wonderful.</span>
