                    <span>As a huge fan of Sabuda's WIZARD OF OZ, I grabbed ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND as soon as I saw it in the store, and it didn't disappoint at all.<P>The book is similar in design to WIZARD OF OZ, has several eye-popping pages that literally jump out at you and contains a faithful abridgement of Lewis Carroll's classic text.<P>The first page, featuring the forest where Alice first encounters the White Rabbit, is glorious, and Sabuda has imagined a remarkable way to give readers a look "down the rabbit hole."<P>This one's as good as THE WIZARD OF OZ, and it's going to be a great gift for all my cousins this holiday season.</span>

                    <span>Children and adults alike will marvel at this beautifullly detailed book of Alice in Wonderland. I hope the publishers come out with a BILINGUAL version: Alicia en el Pais de las Maravillas so the growing population of Latino children in the US can read it in Spanish and so American children can learn a new language while viewing the pop-ups! Another fabulous book for those seeking adventure and beauty is Drum, Chavi, Drum!/Toca, Chavi, Toca! (Set in the colorful Calle Ocho, Little Havana festival where a little Cuban girl makes her dreams come true). Alice and Chavi will bring joy into children's hearts and so these are the two books I recommend as Christmas gifts this year.</span>

                    <span>I've never written a review of any book before, but am compelled to do so now. (I'm not a very good writer!)<P>I've been collecting pop-ups for a long time, and this is the Pop-Up to End All Pop-Ups! <BR> <BR>This book exceeds all my expectations of any Pop-Up. Innovative, top quality, surprise after surprise, includes full story, just superb! <P>I cannot give this book enough stars. If 5 is the highest, I give this book a 15! You will not be dissappointed!</span>

                    <span>There is a REASON that reviewers of Robert Sabuda's "Alice in Wonderland" are AMAZED. This is NOT just another "pop-up book." THIS is a WORK OF ART!! <P>Robert Sabuda's work is MAGICAL as you literally peer down the rabbit hole. Another page shows Alice in the house; Alice at the tea party; the Cheshire Cat; the deck of cards....<P>This book can be great to show young babies as it will spark their curiosity, but you have to just have them look at it and keep it out of reach as young toddlers would probably rip the art work. If you know a young boy or girl (ages 4 and up) or a young teenager or anyone who appreciates illustrative art - this is the book to buy. <P>My mother bought this book for me plus one for her good friend and we both loved it!<P>Robert Sabuda's "Wizard of OZ" was great....this might be even better!</span>

                    <span>Absolutely the best pop-up book I have ever seen. A collectible for sure. Not only do you have large pop-ups on each page, but you have smaller multiple ones on the pages, too!! Beautiful color and excitment for everyone, adults included!!</span>
