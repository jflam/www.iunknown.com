                    <span>This book is a great read for people who wish to learn about the constitutional convention and the trials that that Founders faced in creating our system of government. The book also uncovers the personality traits of many of the Founders who played significant roles at the convention and discusses the disputes that served as stumbling blocks. As a person who is facinated by the U.S. Constitution, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in the early stages of learning about it. The book is very accessable and not written in a scholarly fashion which makes it very enjoyable as well as educational.</span>

                    <span>This book tells the story of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia which resulted in the writing of the U.S. Constitution.  It starts by describing the dissatisfaction that some states had with the Articles of Confederation.  Then, it goes through the issues important to the framers one at a time, describing the conflicts involved and how they were resolved.<p>Two issues are discussed at some length.  First, the authors detail the battle over proportional representation versus equal representation for the states in the (new) Congress, which pitted the smaller states against an alliance between the biggest states and the Deep South states.  Next, they discuss all the issues regarding slavery.  The last several chapters of the book describe the ideas and compromises about how the government functions -- the role of the president, the method of choosing the president, the presence of a bill of rights, etc...<p>The book was well written and in most parts a joy to read.  It left me wanting to read biographies of several of the men involved in creating the Constitution.</span>

                    <span>Last summer, before attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, I read this work to get a perspective on the city's past and present.  Although I am a lawyer, I was unaware of all of the compromises and contentions that went into the forming of the US Constitution.  Fortunately, the book is not written chronologically.  Rather, the authors deal with their topics issue-by-issue:  the separation of powers, the role of the House and the Senate, etc.  This provides an even, uninterrupted flow to the narrative.  It also helped in December when I reread the sections on the electoral college.  Anyone interested in the framers' intent during last year's political circus should buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for anyone wanting to know about our Constitution.  There are so many fascinating charachters that come to life in this book. Though we were taught about this subject in school, this book reveals many details we never learned.  This is an easy to read yet in depth piece of literature.</span>

                    <span>The Collier brothers are an amazing act.  Authors of the classic children's novel, "My Brother Sam is Dead," they also carry on careers individually as a history professor and writer on jazz  respectively.  "Decision in Philadelphia" is the story of the  Constitutional Convention from start to finish.  Told with novel-like drama  and narrative flow, this is the first choice for any general reader who  wants to know more about the issues driving our country's second national  government (the first, the Articles of Confederation, had failed  miserably).  Very readable, and very interesting, "Decision in  Philadelphia" is a book I have my own AP US History students read for  its depth of knowledge and ease of reading (although I wouldn't recommend  it for anybody lower than high school, unless exceptionally precocious and  obsessed with history).  All in all, one of the great popular histories  available on any subject.</span>
