                <span id="Label1">"So how hard is it to let go of doubt when you see that you can do the impossible? If you had audience with a quantum physicist who told you about the many-worlds concept, and that you are the Observer, and you are only limited by what you know and what you are inspired to focus upon to have those experiences of time-shifting and timelines, and that you are creating reality, imagine it gets even more glorious. You speak to a geneticist who will say your DNA is prepared to keep you at thirty years old or twenty years old, or whatever age you wish, for two hundred years and beyond. It is already. So you can't deny this. It is science."  <P>"So if we only put that you are the Observer, quantum physics, and you are immortal, potentially, and we put those together, we are looking at a pretty divine being. Being an individual and why you are going to find this unforgettable for the rest of your life is because you can say this is one place that you met and saw individual acts of greatness. And I say, in short, that the best is yet to come." &#151; Ramtha</span>

                    <span>I was very curious after seeing the movie What the Bleep, who was that blonde woman in the movie called Ramtha? I did some research and found there was a workshop from his school near where I live. It was only $250 for the weekend, with the first night free, so I said, hey, what the heck, let's find out and see. A while ago I stopped asking my friends about new movies I wanted to see. Most of the time I find they were wrong. I make it a rule to find out for myself first. So I went, and I was really impressed.
<br />First of all, there was no cult thing, weird stuff going on, pyramids on your head or strange clothes, etc., as some critics keep saying. What I found was, right at the start of the session, they had us in the audience try out some remote-viewing with each other. Simple things we draw on a piece of paper and the person next to us has to know what we draw without seeing, and then take turns. Well, you are not going to believe me, but a huge amount of people were able to do it exactly right. This is way cool. I got it right, of course! I did not know I could do this. I thought this was only something out of the x-files, or something like that. If you ask me, finding this out about myself, and learning some really simple techniques to practice this on my own was well worth the money and the time going to this RSE workshop. I am having fun with this thing. I am trying to remote-view what my boyfriend is really thinking! Ha.
<br />
<br />The other thing I wanted to share here is this scientific paper we got at the workshop with information about some scientific testing they did on Ramtha that got published by the scientists in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, a trustworthy society founded in 1885, so it is the real deal as far as science goes.
<br />This is what the scientists were saying about Ramtha, check it out: 
<br />"JZ Knight, who had been channeling Ramtha the Enlightened One, a spiritual teacher for the previous twenty years, `is not a fraud,' According to Dr. Stanley Krippner, a psychologist and the leading parapsychology researcher in the U.S. who rigorously tested Knight at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) in Yelm over a period of 18 months."
<br />" `She's not faking it,' added Ian Wickramasekera of San Francisco's Saybrook Institute of Graduate Studies, `because when we hooked her up to test her physiological responses, we got results which could not have been manipulated.' According to Wickramasekera, when Knight left her body and Ramtha took over, the heart rate hit a low of 40 beats per minute and then raced to 180 beats per minute. In her normal resting state, Knight's heart rate was between 85 and 90."
<br />"According to conference organizer Gordon Melton, Wickramasekera was initially not interested in being involved in the study and did not expect to come up with such significant results.  `You might see this in someone who is jogging or having a serious panic attack, but at the time Ms. Knight was sitting completely still,' said Wickramasekera, who used state-of-the-art equipment to test Knight. He conducted the physiological tests three times and the results were consistent in all three runs. `Science demands repeatability and Ms. Knight allowed us to perform these tests three times.' " 
<br />"Wickramasekera explained how eight standardized, physiological, psychological, and behavioral tests were administered. `When you go fishing you use a big net,' Wickramasekera said. `What we didn't expect was to find fish in all eight nets.' The results of the physiological tests showed that when Knight is channeling Ramtha, her muscle tension, pulse, and galvanic skin response increase while skin temperature and blood volume both decrease. Wickramasekera affirmed that Knight could not have voluntarily changed or faked all eight of these results."
<br />
<br />I must say that seeing the Ramtha DVDs, Create Your Day, Cracking the Code to the Extraordinary, and A Message of Joy, now make a lot more sense to me after I went to the workshop and learned my natural talent as a remote-viewer (smile). Some of the things Ramtha says there may seem too simple and nothing new, but when you put them into practice with the simple techniques and instructions I got there over the weekend, now I understand the value and how far reaching and applicable they are to my life everyday. And I can do this in my own time, in the privacy of my own home, without having to go anywhere else. If you are interested in finding out some really cool, sci-fi stuff we can do with our brain and our mind, check this out. You may like it as I surprisingly did!</span>

                    <span>You have to look deeper into the message, and not the messenger, it's always been a part of tests in schools of wisdom for time immemorial. Now I went to Ram's school as a skeptic at first, but using the information I started changing and worked with the message. I had a serious knee injury requiring surgery, no doubt but I said wait, but applying what I learned with Ramtha, the knee was pain free in a day and healed perfectly in a couple weeks. I have learned to be blindfolded and walk through a maze and forest without running into a tree or rock or anything. That's more helpful in life than you may consider at this moment, learning by doing that you are greater than your body is the essence of metaphysics. I have learned to attract wealth to my life as if magically by thought alone. DNA cracking, well it is quite true that I and others have had our blood drawn and the doctors said the blood was like that of a young child. Yep, I often pickup the phone before someone calls now, and I often know what letters are in my mailbox before I go to the post office, and I am talking about obscure contacts difficult to predict. I have healed my eyes to perfect vision when the optometrist said it was time for glasses. He giggled. I couldn't do this before going to Ram's school and this is just a tease of what I have accomplished. Mysteries indeed on the record, just look for the message and not what you are looking at and you will understand how you can beneefit. Worth every penny...listen to the message. Now is this the best DVD of the Ramtha, no it isn't but I do recommend it in a collection and the Bleep and Creating as mentioned in other reviews.</span>

                    <span> After seeing "What the blip do we know" that I loved so much, I bought "Cracking the code" and "create your day" DVD's. I just returned them to Amazon. Here are the reasons why.
<br /> 
<br />Cracking the code ....was SOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTING. After 10 minutes I shut down the DVD player. After seeing 10 minutes of " Cracking the code" I couldn't not believe how much this woman is full of EGO!!!!! I thought this woman had some enlightment. My God! How fool I was. She is the opposite! She does not know what humility  means.  A true enlighted person is someone who conquers ONESELF.....someone who conquers the Ego into one of the highest quality of the soul which is HUMILITY. All the true enlightened  Masters, yogis, Gurus have all this quality. She has a great deal of work in this area for sure!

                    <span>THIS!!
<br />
<br />  This is a scam, and this woman is only interested in your sending her money.  She rambles on incoherently for about 20 mins about 'Orbs' and what they want, what they're doing, etc, without every really talking about anything at all.
<br />
<br />  I've been a serious student of the metaphysical for the past 20 years, and I would NOT recommend wasting money on this if you're interest in metaphysics and the paranormal is serious.</span>
