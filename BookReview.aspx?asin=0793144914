                    <span>I tried to read this book, tried, then I made myself read it. But soon enough I had to quit. It has nothing to offer as far as "Hey, this is a good technique." or "Hey, try this." Not even a story to examplify. It's more like: "Yeah, you need financing and a cheap house that you can fix, and there's a bunch of ways to do that. The End."
<br />
<br />I could never get halfway through it. It's still brand new. Maybe there's something good in it somewhere in there. But I have no time to look for a golden needle in a stack of hay.
<br />There's way too many other books out there that can be more profitable.</span>

                    <span>I actually bought this book at a local Realtor store.  Overall, a good book for those who know a little about real estate and want to learn more about how to flip properties.  The authors give a pretty good glossary of terms to help you understand what they're writing, and I can see they try to make things seem as straight forward as possible.  Drawback -- the book did leave out some key facts, like tax implications of flipping, but it's something you should be thinking about anyway, if you're serious about becoming a successful real estate investor. </span>

                    <span>This book reads very well and contains a lot of practical ideas. I have been investing in real estate for about 10 years and have read a lot of books, most of them hype and fluff. You won't find anything but solid, good advice here, despite the "instant riches" hype in the title.<p>The book starts out by covering the difference between legal and illegal flipping, an issue commonly misunderstood by real estate brokers and lenders. It then goes on to cover real estate law, finding motivated sellers, drafting contracts, negotiating, estimating rehabs, and funding deals. It wraps up with a nice chapter on the real estate business, going full-time vs. part-time, etc. Lot of bang for the buck. <p>I've done quite a bit of flipping of properties, and this book really hits the highlights of the process right on the mark.  Keep in mind that some lenders (particularly FHA) are not as cooperative in lending on properties that have been flipped recently.  This is backlash on the dark side of the business, the fraudulent activities of a few bad seeds.  This book, however, will keep on you on the straight and narrow - definitely a must read.</span>

                    <span>I am an experienced real estate broker, and I was looking for a good text to recommend to my beginning investor clients - this is it! The book reads very well, considering the vast amount of technical information about deeds, contracts, escrow, title, etc.  No hype in this book, just practical, ethical information about the "quick turn" real estate business. Some very good sample forms are included in the appendix as well. If you are getting started as an investor, this one should be on your list of MUST-READ books!</span>

                    <span>Just a gloss over.  Offers some weak advice.  Look for the worst house in the best neighborhood - ????? Everybody and their dog does that, and how many ratty houses are there in good neighborhoods?  For a book like this to be worth anything it needs to offer advice you cant get elsewhere.  Try "Fast Cash" by LeGrand for better.</span>
