                    <span>I had initially planned to give it just a skim, but then could not put it down. It is full of cliches and hoary coaching bromides, and is obsessed with commercial spectator sports; but its overall, can-do message negates any faults.</span>

                    <span>Easy read, informative, and enlightening. Not extensive but perfect for someone who wants the basics and to be entertained by the many athletes mentioned and how they deal with their circumstances. Easy to apply. Should you want something with a little more detail read Mental Edge by Kenneth Baum. All in all, an uplifting and enlightening book that can be read by middle schoolers to professionals.</span>

                    <span>Gary Mack is the author of the sports psychological book "Mind Gym." I rate this book with 5 stars becuase I feel that it is at the top of its catagory. For the athlete who desires to gain a mental edge over his/her opponent, there is no better book to shed light on that subject. I read this book while I was healing from a broken back and it turned me around about how I thought about my sport of gymnastics. Garys book opened many doors for me in the way I thought about competition, training, and everyday life. I recommend it to every athlete in every sport because the psychological side of sports is often overlooked. Gary does a great job creating motivation, and better yet--sport and life lessons.</span>

                    <span>As the mild winter weather promises an earlier than usual start to the golf and tennis seasons, I am thinking about equipment, exercises, instructional videotapes and maybe a short "spring training" trip to Florida. But at the top of my list this year will be a re-read of a little book by Gary Mack that will have more impact than all of the above preparations combined. I learned from "Mind Gym" that, for most of us, how we approach our games mentally is the greatest key to improvement. It made a dramatic difference for me -- in attitude, enjoyment and score!</span>
