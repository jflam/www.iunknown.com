                    <span>The practices that Jim Highsmith describes in this easy-to-read book are important for project managers in many fields, not just software development. This isn't just the "standard" agile development fare, and I think it should be a must-read for project managers who need to manage any project that must deal with change and variability. Jim Highsmith provides a more clearly described set of project management practices that help bridge the gap between the agile approaches that are too minamilist in this area and more traditional "heavyweight" methods.<P>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>With this latest book "Agile Project Management: Creating Innovative Products", Jim Highsmith completes what could be considered his trilogy on adaptive and agile software development and he does so masterfully with practical guidance around the maturation of his adaptive vision. <P>In his first book "Adaptive Software Development", Jim introduced his premise around the lessons that software development can learn from the scientific study of complex adaptive systems (CAS) as applied in biology, chemistry, and even physics: primarily, that software development cannot be straitjacketed into a prescriptive process but rather most benefits from adaptive and emergent-oriented approaches. To that end, much of his approach emphasizes the need for greater communication and collaboration in project teams in order to be effectively adaptive.<P>His second book "Agile Software Development Ecosystems" provides the survey and guidance to understand and apply some of the extant adaptive frameworks: DSDM, Scrum, XP, FDD, Lean Development, Crystal, and his own Adaptive Software Development. In this way, he reinforces his initial vision by moving the discussion from one approach to multiple approaches. He then closes the book with a simple vocabulary to apply at an organizational level for developing one's own agile approach.<P>Finally, with "Agile Project Management" Jim truly completes the journey by bringing us the innovative and emergent theme that underscores his two previous works; that is, that we cannot just adapt software development techniques per se, but must also be clear in our project management approaches around those practices. He compels us to do so by offering 5 fundamental phases agile project management that shift our emphasis from control and plan to innovation through exploration and experimentation: Envision, Speculate, Explore, Adapt, and Close. Coupled with this road to innovation, Jim provides very clear and practical guidance around the specific project management practices that make the steps come alive in the team context such as collaboration through participatory decision making. <P>For my part, I have dog-eared practically every other page in this Highsmith version of "Return of the King" for the rich, straightforward guidance therein. I highly recommend this book, whether you choose to read it alone, or consider enjoying the adaptive journey fully by reading Jim's other two books as well. Whichever path you choose, you won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>In his book, "Agile Project Management - Creating Innovative Products" Jim Highsmith ties together the two worlds of Agile Methodologies and Project Management and in the process provides evolutionary growth in both. The book describes Project Management's place in Agile Methodologies and at the same time provides the next stage of project management growth from Command and Control to what Jim refers to as Leadership - Collaboration. The six principles and 18 practices of Agile Project Management that Jim discusses in the book provide a much needed combination of underlying principles and practical practices that are missing in a great deal of current Project Management thinking.<P>Jim wrote this book in a very readable fashion with short conversations between two project managers at the beginning of each chapter and several examples spread throughout the book. These conversations and examples help to make the material more applicable to the reader.<P>The combination of the principles and practices and the readable style of the book are the characteristics that lead me to rate the book as highly as I do. I highly recommend this book to any project manager who is looking for that next step of growth in their career, or for anyone who is looking for a better understanding of the place in Project Management in agile methodologies.</span>

                    <span>Highsmith's third book, "Agile Project Management : Creating Innovative Products", is one of those rare books which give me that Elton John feeling of "you took the words right out of my mind". That stated, even though I felt this when reading the book (and with his former books) this is not to say that Highsmith doesn't provide a lot of new insights, it's just that the principles and practices outlined in the book are all in the spirit of those words floating around in my mind, so to speak. Words like 'adaptation', 'camaraderie', 'discipline', 'coaching', 'leadership', 'collaboration', 'communication', 'technical excellence', and more. What I find Highsmith do better than any other Agilist I've read so far, is convey the practical aspects of Agility with the human, social side of collaborative, competitive, exciting work. An inspiring quote on p. 256 says a lot:<BR>"Delivering valuable products is important, and it's critical to project management success. No project team can exist for long without delivering value to its customers. But in the long run, how we deliver, how we interact at work, and how we treat each other as human beings are even more important."<P>This is a book all project managers should read. If you're not a project manager you should still read it; I'm a software developer and I was quite inspired by it. I won't go into the details of Highsmith's proposed APM framework, the principles and practices that make up that framework, but I implore you to get this book and read about them yourselves.</span>

                    <span>The agile philosophy of software development and management is the approach made by all busy, efficient people who do not have to conform to rigid rules, "Do the least possible that will satisfy the product constraints." Without question, it is much more efficient than the tentative, bureaucratic and inflexible manner in which so much development is done. Many of the computer students that I teach work at a very large company. On occasion, we engage in discussions about their work environments and the stories about their productivity are amazing. One student told me that the average number of lines of code produced by each programmer was on the order of several hundred a year. In some cases, they have to get managerial approval to make simple changes to the comments. <BR> This is a fundamentally untenable situation in the fast-paced, dynamic world of software development. New hardware and customer demands for new ways to use it require that software developers react much faster than ever. The development of agile processes is a reaction to the sluggishness of constrained software development and it works quite well, although it removes much of the personal security that rigid rules provide. <BR> The best advice in the book is found in a brief segment about communication. A group that is struggling is in a meeting, trying to determine what some of their problems are. A survey is taken and most people agree that the problem is not communication, as a large number of e-mails are passed around each day. Finally, one courageous person raises their hand and notes that while they are passing messages, they are generally not communicating. What they are doing can better be described as chatting. Even though important points are being raised in the messages, they are buried in the filler. <BR> It is that point which I consider to be the most important in this book. Communication between humans is one thing that we all do both well and poorly, and this is true of every type of relationship. It is done well, because we are so good at sending messages, but at times so terribly poor, as we so often send conflicting or incorrect ones. This is also one area where we tend to fool ourselves into thinking we are much better than we really are. In general, the single most significant thing that any group can do to increase their efficiency is to improve communication and that is a point of continuous emphasis throughout the book. It is not always put in those terms, but that is what it really is.<BR> For example, starting on page 66, there is the sequence of statements: "The capability of self-organizing teams lies in collaboration - the interaction and cooperation of two or more people to jointly produce a result . . . The quality of results from any collaborative effort is driven by trust and respect, free flow of information, debate and active participation - bound together by a participatory decision-making process." These statements are just another way to say effective communication. <BR> Independent of whether you are willing to begin using agile methods in your development or not, you will find value in this book. Effective communication between all stakeholders in the project is the real key to increased efficiency, and this book is packed with sound advice on how to do that.</span>
