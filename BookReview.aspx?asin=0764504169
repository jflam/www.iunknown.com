                <span id="Label1"><I>Microsoft SQL Server 7 for Dummies</I> provides one of the quickest run-throughs of this high-capacity database product and its associated skills, such as database design. Author Anthony T. Mann presents the basic concepts of relational databases, the SQL Server interface and tools, programming techniques, and enterprise management issues.<p> The book begins with a general introduction to both Microsoft SQL Server and SQL databases. Understanding the conceptual model of relational databases and the associated terminology is critical, and Mann moves at a good clip through this material. Diagrams and screen shots illustrate key points and help solidify the terminology.<p> Next, Mann introduces basic and advanced objects such as tables, indexes, queries, and stored procedures. After this interactive instruction, the author dives into the SQL language, illustrating how to create database objects with the Data Definition Language (DDL) and work with it using the Data Manipulation Language (DML).<p> This book also covers enterprise issues such as data warehousing, backup and recovery techniques, and security issues. The book ties it all together with a list of online resources and third-party add-on products. If you've been curious about SQL Server, but thought it must involve dry academic learning, give this introduction a spin. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I></span>

                    <span>I used this book as a step-by-step guide. It walked me through the installation and showed me how to use the basic tools and wizards. In almost all cases, the author shows you how to perform a task using at least 2 different methods and sometimes 3.<P>There were very few technical errors (and I was able to figure out what was wrong by just playing around with the tools). In no way would I consider this a high-level, advanced book, but for someone new to SQL Server it fits the bill.</span>

                    <span>With a lot of experience in desktop databases (Access, Fox Pro) and SQL, and a desire to get up to speed with MS-SQL 7.0, I found this book was a great starting point.<P>By no means will it make you a DBA, but it will give you a general overview of MS-SQL 7.0. It will walk you thru some, but not all, of the Wizards, and other features available in the MS-SQL 7.0 Enterprise Manager. Which, for people considering this book probably don't know, is the place where you do all your stuff (create databases, tables, manage users, etc.).<P>This book does not show you how to ~program~ against an MS-SQL server. It doesn't even show you how to set up a client to access the server, which was a disappointment. But then again it's a server book, not a programming book.<P>In a nutshell, if you want to get up to speed on MS-SQL 7.0 and know little or nothing about it, get this book. If you already know generally how to use and manage MS-SQL 7.0, then skip this book, and move on to something more advanced. ><></span>

                    <span>I'm new to SQL/SQL Server, and was looking for a basic intro to the package. The book does an excellent job introducing all of the features and functions, but not much else. Real-world examples were there, but very limited. As I read, I often found myself asking, in a manner of speaking, "sure, that's what button I push, but WHY do I push it?"<P>I did walk away with an appreciation for the complexity of SQL Server 7. Save yourself the cash, and read the product documentation instead.</span>

If you know a little bit about SQL, then steer clear. Otherwise, use it as a stepping stone, but be prepared to spend more on other titles.</span>
