                    <span>Don't buy this book. After I read the first a couple of chapters, my impression is either the author doesn't know exactly about the subject or the kid is so genious that he thinks everybody can understand what he seems to understand.
<br />
<br />For example, while explaining detail map, there is no explanation for background theoy of detail map. Instead, the author just says some stupid words about detail map and shows a pictire saying "Wow! it looks better!". All right, if I do just a simple cut and paste of OpenGL code, I can do that. But does it what you want? We want to understand what's going on behind the scenes. In my experience, this kinf of writing happens either when you don't understand something exactly or when you don't know how to explain something logically.
<br />
<br />One good thing about this book is its content list. By reading the content list of the book, you get to know what you should do to implement a terrain engine. And for this respect, this book did a good job. But isn't it too expensive to pay the bucks for a couple of pages of content list? I'd rather go to Border's book store and read only the content list.</span>

                    <span>I think many of the reviews here are a bit harsh and miss the intention of this book. The chief complaint of the book is that it does not go into very much detail. It seems to me that this title is intended to be a basic introduction to what is a very complex topic. 
<br />
<br />Having developed terrain applications for many years, I have a very thorough understanding of how difficult it is to approach this topic. While there are many great books available on the topic that go into much greater and complex detail (see: Musgrave, Perlin, Foley, et al), there has long been a need for a simple, basic introductory text.
<br />
<br />This book fills that need.
<br />
<br />Rather than inundate the new reader with 1000+ pages of difficult material, Polack gently takes them through the basics of terrain rendering. Using humor (which really isn't as bad as some stuffed shirts would have you believe), he gives good, basic explanations. The accompanying CD contains a lot of good source code, ripe for exploration. An excellent way to learn. For those who haven't been scared off, the original white papers are included for further studying. Polack also includes chapter-by-chapter references for additional reading.
<br />
<br />The complaints over the fact that the book uses OpenGL are also a bit silly. The important thing here are the topics and the introduction to their basic principals. Also, OpenGL is more universal than DirectX, giving this book a broader audience. If the need to use DirectX is such a concern, you can always write your own rendering and buffering adapter. 
<br />
<br />All in all, I heartily recommend this book for anyone interested in getting a start in terrain modelling. Ah, if only it existed when I started out with Musgrave's Texturing and Modeling book!  ;)</span>

                    <span>This book is and basic introduction to terrain rendering. It gets quick to the point and doesn't care much about the math. If you look for a introduction to terrain rendering and want get your results quickly this is a book for you, especially for this price!!! If you are looking for a profound book about terrain rendering with focus on math, choose another book.</span>

                    <span>The text doesn't come close to describing any of the terrain rendering algorithms adequately. For this, the author refers the reader to whitepapers on the companion CD written by the original authors. After a short search on the Internet, I turned up a wealth of better written descriptions on 3d terrain rendering algorithms. I suggest others to do the same.
<br />
<br />The author makes a big deal out of the importance of morphing vertex points to minimize the effect of  popping but provides no implementation description. As he says in the text: "I didn't want to limit your imagination..."  What a cop out!
<br />
<br />The c++ code provided on the companion CD is cleanly written, compiled and ran without problems, but is also clean of any useful comments further mystifying the subject. Another search on the Internet turned up many source code examples with better documentation.

                    <span>The book begins with approximately 100 pages of the extreme basics of terrain rendering.  Given this speed of progression, such an introduction would be proper to a 500-600 page text.  However, the author then covers three LOD algorithms in approximately 80 pages (the final 20-30 pages are devoted to special effects).  <p>Unfortunately, all Polack's work serves to do is provide a lackluster (and often bastardized) summary of freely distributed whitepapers covering the discussed algorithms (included in the text's accompanying CD).  His youth and inexperience as an author are blindingly apparent, as his "hip" talk quickly becomes both an annoyance and a distraction.  The most advanced mathematics covered in the text is essentially no more than arithmetic.  When Polack does attempt to explain math (which is not very frequently), his descriptions are nonsensical and often incorrect.  For instance, in chapter 5 he covers the distance formula (this Jr. High math is among his most advanced formulae).  He then proceeds to give an equation called "L2-Norm" which he states "Isn't that much different than the distance equation from chapter 5.  The only real difference is we're not bothering to square the individual component calculations, and we're saving ourselves the trouble of a square root.  Other than that, not much has changed".  If Mr. Polack was at all familiar with the methods of mathematics, he would comprehend the huge implications of removing the squaring in the distance equation - unfortunately he is not, and he gives no further explanation as to the consequence and reasons behind using "L2-Norm".  <p>Computer graphics is a subject based upon (often complex) mathematical operations.  Polack has, however, decided that instead of "boring" the reader with a description of math, that he will instead make jokes in regard to an "imaginary cat" among other things.  The first 100 pages of the book are a simple introduction to terrain rendering, which is why I give this book 2 stars.  The remainder of the book is indeed the work of an inept author struggling to make sense of complicated topics.  I would most definitely NOT recommend this book.  <p>A note to the author:  once you have learned to appreciate the art of high-level mathematics, perhaps attempt to rewrite this book, yet forego your childish style and elaborate on the algorithms at use (do not attempt to write a text on terrain rendering in a month, as it seems you have done).  It is truly unfortunate that the shelves of bookstores are being taken by books such as these, whereas masterpieces such as those written by Watt, Moller, Haines, Abrash, and Foley are pushed aside.</span>
