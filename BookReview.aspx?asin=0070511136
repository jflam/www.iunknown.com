                    <span>My bachelor's degree is in Computer Science, and I'm preparing to start my MBA studies within a year. I hope to start my own business one day and I knew I needed to generate revenues. But there was only one problem...<P>...I had no idea how to sell professionally.<P>I had already read a few books by Tom Hopkins, but felt he was targeting used-car salesmen types. It seems as though Hopkins' techniques relied on "closing" gimmicks when it came down to it. (I must say I did learn some good principles from Hopkins, but his gimmicky style is not for me.)<P>I was instantly attracted to SPIN SELLING when I saw that (1) it was based on extensive research, and (2) it dealt primarily with the large sale. Since I want to start my own corporation after my MBA, and want to have Fortune-500 companies as my customers, I realized SPIN SELLING was for me.<P>SPIN SELLING is simply a great handbook on large-sale tactics. Rackham shows how the "closing techniques" used in smaller sales severely damage the success of large sales. He then introduces the SPIN model (Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff).<P>Although before reading the book I never considered myself a "salesman", I realized afterwards that I was already using Rackham's techniques in other areas of my life -- and having a great deal of success. For example, as a professional IT consultant, I was using (unbeknownst to me) these tactics to legitimately perpetuate my client billings.<P>Selling is essentially obtaining another person's commitment. Commitments that deal with the purchase of good or services is only one type of commitment. Thus, you can use these tactics/techniques any time you're wanting to obtain another person's commitment.<P>If your desire is to sell large-value goods or services to sophisticated and intelligent buyers then SPIN SELLING is the tactical handbook you need. This book isn't about gimmicks to trick or pressure the customer into buying. This is professional, high-class selling.<P>After I read SPIN SELLING I immediately bought Rackham's "MAJOR ACCOUNT SALES STRATEGY". Thus, I now have a tactical handbook and a strategy handbook that are based on the same principles and extensive research.<P>I've found the SPIN model to be highly effective in my life.</span>

                    <span>SPIN SELLING provides the steps to help us become more successful and effective in selling. It is a great self-reminder checklist for wherever you are in the selling process. I also use another process to help me generate new creative approaches. Both of these can be combined for even greater effectiveness. This process may be found in THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION and includes the following steps. 1) Understand the importance of measuring 2) Measure everything that can be measured about your key activities to make sure you identify root causes of winning or losing sales 3) Identify the future best practice for your industry 4) Go beyond today's best practices to implement the future best practices for selling now 5) Figure out the ideal best practices (without resource, money, time or people constraints) and 6) Begin to approach that 7) Match the people, incentives and tasks, and 8) Repeat the process for even better ideas. I highly recommend that you buy SPIN SELLING and THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION, look at what you do now and use these steps to climb to a more effective level more easily and effortlessly. You will be surprised at the time and money saved and while increasing the results 20 fold.</span>

                    <span>As a sales trainer, I found this book to present a wonderful methodology for both salespeople new to the business as well as seasoned salespeople. The SPIN principle (Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff) works in almost any sales environment whether you are selling big ticket items to large accounts or volumes of small ticket items. <P>Overall, I found "SPIN Selling" to be a great book for addressing the strategic and tactical aspects of selling. In addition to this book, I highly recommend the book "Cognitive Selling: Proven Fundamentals and Techniques of the World's Most Effective Salespeople" by Todd Bermont. "Cognitive Selling" is the perfect complement to "SPIN Selling" as it provides a methodology for maintaining a winning attitude and frame-of-mind which is essential to succeed in selling.</span>

                    <span>SPIN Selling was the first sales book I ever read, back in the days when I sold copiers. Ten years later, as the owner of a sales training company, I still utilize those very principals of questioning Rackham taught me way back when. The key to sales is to have a process, a process within a process. Rackham adheres to this very foundation. This book is guaranteed to make you money!<P>Todd Natenberg, Author of the book, "I just got a job in sales! Now what?"

                    <span>I love SPIN Selling, the book and workbook. Also Major Account Sales Strategy. When I bought the CD I was thinking I could add a tool to my audio library and have more constant exposure to the concepts. But no<P>This audio was worse than my grade school educational film series. The reader is dull, boring and almost put me to sleep in the car. This is GREAT material. Everyone that is considering any of the books I would heartily give them a 5 of 5 stars. <P>I fast forwarded through the entire first cd, hoping that I would start hearing the same "meat" I read about in SPIN. What Iheard was a lot of "pre-program" dialog. <P>If I could speak with Neil Rakham I would say, "Neil, this is an outstanding program. Please get a reader with more emotion".</span>
