                    <span>On medium-weight, semi-glossy paper, this beautiful and durable map folds out to approximately 2 feet by 3 feet. On one side is a three-color highway map of the coast of Maine, inlaid with paragraphs on many of the lighthouses and framed by watercolor pictures of about two dozen. The reverse side describes all 65 of Maine's lighthouses; the descriptions give a short history, the optimal viewing spot, directions, contact information, hours of operation, transportation options, etc.<P>If you are interested in lighthouses, Maine, nautical history or maps, you will probably love this great map. Travellers will find it indispensable. What a bargain!</span>

                    <span>My wife and I just returned from a trip to Maine. We found the info in this guide to be very helpful in finding 21 lighthouses, most of which were well hidden. Without this map/guide, we would not have found most of them since they are usually not well sign posted.</span>

                    <span>In June of 2000 I used this map to visit Lighthouses in Maine. This map was very useful. On one side is a map pointing out the locations. On the other side there are details for each individual light such as: directions, hours, and phone numbers. I am from Michigan so I was not familiar with New England at all. Some of these lights were hard to find even with the map because some roads are not clearly marked. But I did find everything I was looking for. The price of these maps is an incredible bargain. Some people buy two of them so they can hang one on the wall to display the watercolor images and get another to use.</span>
