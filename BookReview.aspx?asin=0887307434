                    <span>I am working as a software contractor and I find myself negotiating a lot more than I used to -- rates, terms, types of work, etc... The results of these frequent negotiations affects my livlihood. So I bought this book to help.<P>And help it has. The book contains tips, tactics, and strategies for negotiating. And importantly for me, it contains tips for countering tactics used by others. I've recognized a large number of these tactics in my own life in just the past few months.<P>To be critical, the book does have some issues. Most of the examples are in a salesperson-buyer context. Sof if you are not a salesperson or buyer in the strict sense you'll find yourself transposing the examples to something more relevant to you. <P>Also, the book is organized in an odd manner -- alphabetical order. While useful for an index and looking up information, it would seem that there would be a better organization for the material. For example, what if you were reading a book about American History and it was organizaed not in chronological order, but in alphabetical order. Odd, but not a huge problem.<P>This is a good book that has valuable information for many different people. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book - it is in bite size sections that you can read, even one a day, to learn some techniques to get a YES from people who have the option to say NO to you.<P>Many of the MNCs use this book for their senior managers to learn new skills - so it works.<P>At twice the price, this book is definitely worth buying.</span>

                    <span>I collect books on negotiation and used to teach it at college level in connection with real estate classes. Give and Take is the best book I know of on negotiating tactics as opposed to theory. It is an alphabetically arranged list of dozens of strategies and ploys used by real negotiators. It is similar in this regard to Gavin Kennedy's excellent Pocket Negotiator (Economist) and David Churchman's Negotiation Tactics. Give and Take is most suitable for those involved in business and sales negotiations. I own several copies and carry one around with me in my car. Unless you're in an academic setting or a professional negotiator, this book is the one to buy. It has made me a lot of money.</span>

                    <span>I have 2 major complaints regarding this book. First, the title is completely misleading. The book contains strategies for SALES people. I agree that there may be strategies that sales people use that may be employed by other business people, yet I hardly agree that this constitutes "The Complete Guide to Negotiating Strategies and Tactics."<P>Second, the organization of this book is horrendous. It's exactly like reading an Internet newsgroup. There are no chapters, but instead one or two pages on each "tactic or strategy." There is no attempt at categorizing the information. And like a newsgroup, the noise to signal ratio is ridiculously high. While you may find golden nuggets of wisdom, you will spend precious time digging for them. Best of luck if you ever want to refer to them again.<P>Look elsewhere for a good book on negotiation. My copy just went into the garbage, maybe you can look there.</span>
