                <span id="Label1"><h4 align="center">A veteran waitress dishes up a spicy and robust account of life as it really exists behind kitchen doors.</h4><p>Part memoir, part social commentary, part guide to how to behave when dining out, Debra Ginsberg's book takes readers on her twentyyear journey as a waitress at a soap-operatic Italian restaurant, an exclusive five-star dining club, the dingiest of diners, and more. While chronicling her evolution as a writer, Ginsberg takes a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant life-revealing that yes, when pushed, a server will spit in food, and, no, that's not really decaf you're getting-and how most people in this business are in a constant state of waiting to do something else.</p></span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author did a wonderful job of taking the reader on her life's journey. Although I thought this book would be only about waiters and waitresses, I found it to be much more. As a memoir and a coming of age story I found it first rate. Ginsberg's prose wss easy to read and she is at her best when she details the incredibly humourous experiences she had as a waitress. I especially enjoyed her accounts of the sexual exploits in one of the restaurants in which she worked. I laughed out loud many times throughtout this book. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress" is a highly entertaining, fast-paced book about Debra Ginsberg's real-life experiences as a food server. She tells wonderful heartfelt stories about waiting tables in places ranging from a dining room/country club environment, to a cocktail lounge setting, to a upscale Italian eatery while keeping me laughing out loud and cringing simultaneously. I never thought that working as a waitress was an easy job (I've never actually done it) but after reading this book I can say for sure that it's definitely not a field I'll be tackling any time soon.<P>Ginsberg delves even deeper than just your run-of-the-mill waitressing antics (E.G.: hair in soup, rude customers, bad tips, etc.) She actually takes a look at waitressing from a sociological perspective and she does so with both intelligence and charm. For Ginsberg, waiting tables was a career, one which she struggled with because she constantly felt like she should "do something with her life" and "get a real job." So she did. But the money from waitressing was just too good. Her tips were essential in the raising of her son as a single parent. And waitressing also allowed her to spend quality time with her son when her "real job" kept them apart more than both of them were comfortable. I was proud of her for coming to that realization and going back to waitressing after giving the real job a shot.<P>Unfortunately, there is such a negative stigma attached to waiting tables while it really shouldn't be anything to be ashamed of. The physical and psychological aspects of the job are grueling and make for a tough job even in the best of conditions. I applaud anyone who can work like that at night and then manage to wake up, raise a child and stay focused on writing the next day. That sounds like three full-time jobs to me and I personally couldn't wing it. Three cheers for Debra! I eagerly await her next book.</span>

                    <span>All I can say is that if ever I questioned the universality of the "waiting life", I don't anymore. I have waited tables now for years as an easy way to get myself through school and everything Ginsberg talks about has happened to me and the various coworkers I have had over the years.<BR>Not only is it a way to laugh at your own follies in the business but also a guide to unskilled diners who think "tipping is a city in china" and that their servers are merely uneducated peons there to accept their personal abuses.<BR>I highly recommend this book as it is the only memoir I have ever seen that deals strictly with the trials of being a waitress. In short, it is a quick read and all around good fun. If I could afford it, I would buy a copy for every single person I work with. If you've ever waited tables to make ends meet, this book is a must!!!</span>

                    <span>*This review is for the hardcover edition*<P>I bought this book for my wife a couple of years ago and forgot about it until I recently saw it on my bookshelf. I'm certainly glad I read it. I've been in the restaurant business for over 25 years, except during an 8 year stint in the Navy. I identified with the lifestyle that she lead and also was amused by her stories, many of which I lived myself, only the names and places changing.<P>I loved the chapters on "tipping," "the back of the house," and "food and sex." They really hit home with me and I found myself nodding and laughing through most of it. The only chapter I didn't care for was the chapter entitled, "hello, I'll be your postfeminist icon this evening." Personally, I thought it was out-of-place in the context of the rest of the book, but as I see in other reviews, many liked it. It could be because I'm a man, and only a woman might really understand what she is saying.<P>If you've ever been in the restaurant business, this book is a must read. I'm sure that you will be reminded of good times and bad, but will finish this fasting-reading book with a smile on your face - even if you're still in the business.<P>If you've never had the pleasure of waiting tables, read it to become informed. That person who is waiting on you is not some heartless android, but a real person who deserves respect. Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I was totally surprised by this book. I first had no intentions to buy any book about waitresses or waiter. I am not a big fan of tipping and I am from somewhere tipping is not customary, rather an unusual situation (tips are already included in checks). However, I could not drop the book since the moment I started reading it. <BR>Ginsberg does not try to make "big-wise" statements about world, yet she does not try to criticize her life or justify it in front of readers. She just loves to write and she is incredibly good at it. <BR>I loved the way she tells the little, ordinary stories behind her customers, descriptions and observations. Her peace with herself and her talent for writing are two things make this novel special.<BR>I definitely recommend this book to anyone.</span>
