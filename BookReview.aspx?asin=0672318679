                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Sams Teach Yourself ATL Programming in 21 Days quickly empowers you to create your own small, fast COM components quickly and easily using the Active Template Library. Written by a professional developer who applies ATL in his everyday development, the book provides guidance and direction, leading you through a progression of topics that begin with the basic building blocks of COM programming, and ending with in-depth discussions of the more commonly used features of the Active Template Library. Topics include creating your first ATL COM object, understanding the ATL architecture, using the ATL app wizard, working with ATL helper classes, handling ATL errors, using C++ templates, using multithreading, creating ATL applications, automation with ATL, combining ATL and OLE dB for database access, and using ATL with MTS (transactions).</HTML></span>

                    <span>Very good good book. It's really tech you the basic block of the ATL programming and the background that you need to move from Regular Visual c++ applications to ATL. The writer is going step by step How ever this book it not for Visual c++ beginners or if you are looking to become an expert in ATL. I was more interested in the DB and IIS aspects using ATL but it only give you the general idea.</span>

                    <span>I have recently started learning ATL (having read Inside COM by Dale Rogerson and some of Don Box). Teach Yourself ATL was my first ATL book. Bad Move...<P>His overall approach is, in my opinion, inappropriate. After having read 8 chapters I found myself thinking what do I know? I understand how to use the Wizards, but I still have no idea how the IUknown interface is implemented, or how objects are instantiated. In my opinion the only way to COM/ATL success is to understand what the Wizards are doing. Sure they're great in incredibly speeding up the COM development time but if you don't understand what their doing, your hardly any better off.<P>Kenn gives you the concepts well enough but concept after concept after concept eventually becomes meaningless unless you can see the dirty detail in action. The book is not a write-off but as a beginners text it didn't suit me.<P>Personally I found Tom Armstrongs "ATL Developers guide" much better. Instead of developing clients in MFC with all the extra messy details, he used bare-bones console apps which allow you to focus purely on COM/ATL. He talks about what ATL is doing and how the basics of COM is implemented. ATL at this level is dirty, messy stuff but its fundamental.</span>
