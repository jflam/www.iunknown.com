                    <span>I trust the authors of this book, and have great esteem for this addition to the teachings of the Buddha.  My only 'criticism' is that the book seems weighted towards the practice of the authors, rather than survey what all Buddhists believe.  But -- the truth is everywhere.</span>

                    <span>I'm one of the "dummies" referred to in the title. What I knew about Buddhism I'd learned while studying the transcendental writers, Emerson, Thoreau etc. while in college.<p>This book is written by Stephan Bodian, an American Buddhist monk, and Jonathan Landaw, who has led meditation courses at Buddhist centers for over twenty-five years.<p>Despite its cheesy title, this book answered most of the questions I had about Buddhism:<p>Why the heck does the Buddha have so many names? He was born Prince Siddhartha, but once he became enlightened, he was called Shakyamuni Buddha. Bodhi, the tree under which he meditated, means enlightenment. Shakyamuni means enlightened sage of the Shakyas, the clan to which he belonged.<p>Was Buddha God? No, he was a real human thought to have lived between 563 and 483 BCE. When you see Buddhist monks prostate before a statue of Buddha, they are praying to their inner Buddha. They believe each of us has the ability to achieve enlightenment (nirvana).<p>What is karma? Sort of credits you build up, both bad and good. Buddhists believe in reincarnation; karma credits transfer from life to life. So if you're dealt a bad hand; it's because you were naughty in a previous life.<p>What's the difference between Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism? The way I understand it, Theravada emphasizes individual enlightenment; whereas, the Mahayana's proponents are more worried about helping everyone achieve spiritual awakening. A Buddha becomes a Bodhisattva, sort of a savior like Shakyamuni. Theravadas also emphasize compassion and kindness which is pretty much the same thing. Zen Buddhism and Vajrayana (Tibetan) are offshoots of Mahayana Buddhism.<p>What about heaven and hell? This is where they lost me. Shakyamuni taught that suffering resulted from something called the "Wheel of Life." A diagram shows a pig (ignorance) giving birth to a rooster (desire or attachment) and a snake (aversion or hatred). There are also six realms of existence: God, anti-God, Human, Animal, hungry ghost, and hell being. Primarily through meditation and compassion, an entity can build up enough karma to work its way up to God. But the gods can be demoted if they run out of karma and they are always fighting the jealous anti-gods, so apparently they are not Buddhas. This wheel of life has existed in infinity; one of the authors says to remember that an enemy was probably at one time your mother, so it should be easy to forgive.<p>At times Landaw and Bodian take their transcendental philosophy a bit too far. The last section deals with "uninvited house guests." By this they mean insects. According to Buddha killing mosquitoes and other pests is bad karma. If a mosquito makes its way into your house, you're supposed to catch it and take it outside. Obviously these guys haven't experienced a humid, Minnesota evening in July down by the lake.</span>

                    <span>Like most of the books for "Dummies" this one is neither simplistic nor easy. It's a fairly comprehensive guide to Buddhism, including a lot of its various myths, schools and competing dogmas. The title of the series has always been a bit off-putting for me.<p>In fact, its attempt to be comprehensive is a bit of a drawback. It might be easier for the newcomer had the authors chosen to promote a specific line or school, rather than offer a meandering potpourri of all aspects of Buddhist thought, hisotry and practice.<p>This book requires the reader pay attention and sift through this material more carefully than many of the practical guides - Awakening the Buddha Within, the Art of Happiness, etc. It's quetionable whether the novice reader needs to work through various myths surrounding the Buddha's life or the details of monastic practices in order to understand the basic concepts of Buddhism.<p>This is a somewhat encyclopedic approach, and less of a hand-on roadmap for core belief and practice. It's a good book, but the depth may easily overwhelm the person seeking some basic information or answers to simple questions. It would work best when read in parallel with other works.</span>

                    <span>All the title really means is that this book is written for people who know very little -- or nothing at all -- of the subject matter.  When it comes to Buddhism, that's the majority of North Americans.  I perhaps knew a little bit more than most as I live in San Francisco where Buddhists may be found readily, but I appreciated this book for filling me in on the ins and outs.  (I knew enough to know I didn't know enough.)<p>This is a practical book designed to educate the Western reader on what Buddhism is and what it is not.  A lot of attention is paid to dispelling myths Westerners frequently believe about Buddhism.  What this book does not do is presume to get the reader started on some kind of practice of Buddhism, but it may well get a reader well enough informed to choose to pursue the Buddhist way further -- or not, for that matter.<p>As a liberal Christian, I appreciated this book a lot.  I'm interested in knowing more because I already look from a viewpoint that includes Buddhist ideas as experienced truth.  One of the interesting things about Buddhism is that it neither teaches nor denies a supreme being and has nothign negative to say about other religions.  Rather, in a nutshell, Buddhism is more of a system of spiritual self-discovery than it is a religion, per se.<p>It's interesting to note that there are many different systems of Buddhist discipline, much as there are different denominations in Christianity, for example.  The beliefs and teachings all have the same foundation, but are not necessarily identical from one form of Buddhism to another, nor are the practices the various adherents follow.  It's interesting to find out what the differences are and when, how and where each "denomination" came into being.<p>One thing annoyed me as I read this book, however, which is why I've given it four and a half stars and not five.  Throughout this book, the historical human being we most often think of as the Buddha is referred to as Shakyamani Buddha, a term I hadn't heard before.  Nearly everyone refers to Prince Siddartha who became enlightened while sitting under the Bodhi tree in northern India in his role as enlightened being as Gautama Buddha (or sometimes Gotama Buddha, a variant spelling).  Not once in this book is the name "Gautama" even mentioned that I could find.  At least a paragraph addressing the disparity between the appellations "Shakyamani Buddha" and "Gautama Buddha" would have been apprecited -- after all, the author is using the less familiar of the two terms.<p>(I could be wrong here, but I think "Gautama" was Prince Siddartha's clan name, more like a family name, and his family belonged to the much larger Shakyamani tribe, of which he became prince.)<p>Other than that, I very much liked this book and found it satisfyingly informative about a very interesting topic.  I wish all Westerners were clearer about what Buddhism is and what it isn't and this book is effective toward that end.</span>
