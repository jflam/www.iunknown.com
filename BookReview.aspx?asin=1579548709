                    <span>This book was way ahead of its' time!! Bottom line, if you have not read this book yet, you should do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. I really mean that. 
<br />
<br />In July of 2004, I read this book and it was my first exposure to the concept of the 'housing bubble'. I knew of no one talking about this. In fact, I was tuned into the media and fellow wage earners who pretty much all believed that "housing only goes up". 
<br />
<br />Now, just about 9 months later, Forbes magazine, Fortune magazine, CNNMONEY.COM, CNBC, my local paper, the Wall Street Journal and several credible economists and analysts (including Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley)have made the term "housing bubble" almost household. Jim Cramer, of Mad Money on CNBC, won't touch the mortgage stocks! 
<br />
<br />Rubino was in the early crowd and how appropriate, since Rubino was one of the people who predicted a tech stock bust when others were saying "tech stocks never go down". Yeah, right! How is Nasdaq doing these days???
<br />
<br />Just so you don't believe this book was written by some boob making an extra buck on a 'conspiracy theory', John Rubino has the credentials (as if the above paragraph wasn't enough proof). John was a Wall Street Financial Analyst and a regular contributor to thestreet.com as well as Individual Investor, Ziff Davis/Smart Business, Online Investor and Consumer Digest. He now writes for Fidelity, Kiplinger's Personal Finance and CFA Magazine. Not too shabby!
<br />
<br />So, this is a guy who has been in the trenches, not some dimestore critic on Amazon.com! 
<br />
<br />Since reading the book, I've done a little research myself. It's shocking. 1/4 of all homes purchased are investment properties and a large percentage of those were purchased through home equity loans on the first property. 
<br />
<br />Also, look at some of the creative lending practices going on, if that doesn't convince you that we are staring at a very real bubble with horrific ramifications, I don't know what will.
<br />
<br />We have a propensity to believe in what we want to, rather than looking at facts and common sense. Common sense should tell you that the price increases on the coasts are way out of line. 
<br />
<br />If you are thinking of buying a house today or in the future, or if you are thinking of selling your house, then you need to equip yourself with this knowledge. Believe me, you will be happy that you spent the small change to understand what is happening in the housing market. 
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book as well as Rubino's book with James Turk, The Coming Collapse of the Dollar, which sheds some light on where the markets and the US are headed. It's really almost a part two to this book! 
<br />
<br />I very rarely give my stamp of approval on Amazon.com's books (I am a writer myself) but these books are invaluable to your investment book collection!!!</span>

                    <span>While I generally agree with his eye balling method on the Debt/GDP ratio, his analysis only tells one side of the story.  As a licensed accountant myself, I will tell you that numbers alone only tell one side of the story, the other side is what makes up those numbers.  Yes the debt ratio was greatest around the 60's, then GDP started to pickup, but after 1985, the pattern reversed again but is still better than the 60's, thus making Mr. Wilson's argument very convincing.  Yet we must not be too complacent, the underlying reasons for the debt ratios still need to be investigated.
<br />
<br />There are two kinds of debts: good debt and bad debt.  Good debts are usually tax deductible, they are usually debt incurred for the purposes of generating future revenue for the debtors; bad debts are usually not tax deductible, such as consumer debts on credit cards etc.
<br />
<br />Any astute observer can tell you that a large percentage of debt in the 21 century can be attributable to two sources: mortgage debt and consumer debt.  I don't know about you but my parents and relatives don't have credit cards in the 60's and they bought their vehicles with cash, not financed.  This suggests to me that the debts in the 60's were of a highest quality debt meaning they were created for good causes, i.e., business/investment ventures for example.  In fact, a good argument can be made based on this observation, because the data shows the standard of living improved beginning in the early 70 to about 1985 then debt started to pickup again.  Only this time, the majority of debts were attributed to consumer debts and real estate speculation.  This alone should be the cause of concern.
<br />
<br />I am not saying Mr. Wilson's analysis was incorrect.  I am saying that based on the graph alone, there is not sufficient evidence to prove the null hypothesis that the standard of living in the 21-century is better than the 60's.</span>

                    <span>Like a smooth attorney summing up his case to the jury, John Rubino gives you every reason in the world to be very careful now that real estate has superseded stocks as the investment of choice. Written in June, 2003, Rubino is early.  But "early" means you won't get knocked down if you head for the door.
<br />Real estate is a much more serious bubble than stocks could ever be because not only does it involve the roof over your head, it also constitutes your biggest debt, a huge amount of employment and business activity, and enough political ramifications to cause major tremors under our political landscape in the event the author is correct.  Additionally, there is no liquid market for real estate as there is for stocks. That means there is no October '87 to clean out the system in one fell swoop. Real estate busts take years to work through the system, with all the resulting hardships and recriminations that go with the bursting of a bubble.
<br />Rubino wasn't as prescient as Robert Shiller who published "Irrational Exuberance" in the same month as NASDAQ topped out above 5000, but if real estate does crack, this time nobody can say they weren't forewarned.
<br />The first half of the book is an excellent detailing of how the real estate market works, its history, and how the current bubble came to be. This is interesting reading for those who need to get current on the dangerous game we're playing.
<br />The last half of the book gets more specific, giving you a good overview of the alternatives to keeping you money in real estate, including everything from lifestyle changes to tax consequences to his main concern - safety.
<br />All in all, an excellent (and concise - 250 pages) synopsis on what more and more experts are warning is our next major crisis.

                    <span>Don't know what it's like in other places, but here in New York City, all I can say is DAMN. A friend who paid $700,000 a few years back for an nice but unspectacular condo says it's now worth $1.5 million. Apartments the size of walk-in closets rent for $1,500 a month. Who knows where the money's coming from, but there's no doubt about how all this will end.  
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the author of this book has been busy. I Googled "Rubino housing crash" and found some interviews that readers considering buying this or a similar book might find useful. There's an hour-plus webcast on Jim Puplava's Financial Sense Online, in which Rubino makes some aggressive (to put it mildly) comments about the big banks, derivatives, and gold. Also interesting is a profile/interview in something called Bacon's Rebellion, a site dedicated to Virginia politics and economics. Both, I think, make a compelling case that housing-and maybe the whole economy-is headed for trouble, and that Rubino gets it.  (...)</span>

                    <span>I read Rubino's book and it scared me. I pray he wrong, but I had a hard time disputing his argument. Before becoming a writer I'd been a real estate developer in Utah during the 80s boom. When the market turned, it fell into a freefall. Everyone who is thinking about speculating in real estate should be forced to read his book. That is unless they enjoy the pain of loss. </span>
