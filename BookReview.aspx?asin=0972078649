                    <span>This is a very important book for ColdFusion developers, as we begin the inevitable shift from procedural to object-oriented programming. Discovering CFCs covers the whole topic: from an introduction to OO and CFCs, through simple examples, and on to complex heirarchies of CFCs. It also points out the problems and bugs with CFCs as they exist now, yet another reason to pester Macromedia to stick with CFCs and fix their problems. Overall, a must-read for any ColdFusion developer who is interested in staying current with their skill set now and into the future.</span>

                    <span>Discovering CFCs is an essential read for any developer that wants to keep up with the movement to Object-Oriented Programming. While ColdFusion isn't OOP, and CFCs don't make it so, they are a step in that direction. This book clearly lays out the principles of OOP and shows where CFCs comply and depart.<P>After reading this book, you'll have a much clearer understanding of CFCs and be ready to use them in your applications. Kudos to the authors for making a tough subject accessible and useful.</span>

                    <span>I reckon this book is fantastic. I have gotten up to speed with objects in no time. I am writing CF now that has objects doing inheritance and composition and it seems so straightforward. Before this book I was bamboozled. The power of the OO stuff is awesome. I can't imagine now not being able to do things this way.<P>It's only a small book but that is it's great strength. You don't have to wade through hundreds of pages so learning is quick. <P>I can't recommend this book highly enough.<P>The only issue I have had with this book is the super keyword. The book is written for verion 6.0 and shows a way to get around there being no super keyword available. As of version 6.1 there is a super keyowrd so that part of the text is obsolete. Anyway, it's only a few pages and it will still work anyway.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is completely worthless. You are better off reading the documentation in ColdFusion about components. The examples are very simplistic and do not help to address why and how to use components in real-world applications.<P>There are also dozens of mistakes, including spelling, grammar and in the code examples which often make the examples difficult to follow. The numbered paragraphs are useless and seem to serve primarily as a way to increase the number of pages in the book. (If you do not include the code examples, this book probably contains only about 20 pages of writing.)<P>If you do buy this book, I implore you to skip the "Closing Thoughts" section which is an imaginary conversation between 3 developers that rambles on for 10 pages yet says nothing of value.<P>I will say the book is aptly titled: it helps you "discover" CFCs, but it does little to make them useful. I am considering sending this book back and asking for a refund. It's that bad.</span>
