                    <span>Ten years ago, long before Istarted surfing the web, I purchased my first ever copy of what was then called VMG. As I was passionate about movies (and still am), I read every single review there was in the book, and in the end it looked as tattered as hell. I still have my first copy, it's yellow-brownish and torn, and for me symbolizes my great love for this book and for movies.<P>I've leafed through Maltin's guide quite a few times, and the "video and dvd movie guide" is hands down the best there is. Here's why:<BR>Five stars to turkey, a rating system flexible enough for nuiances, and there are also the 1/2 ratings, i.e ***1/2. This allows for great accuracy in reviews, as opposed to the broad strokes which a four star rating sometimes uses.<P>The book is very easy to read, the title is highlighted, the stars are bold and clear (unlike in Maltin's). Not to mention the Turkey!<P>The fabulous cast and director indexes. Today, at the Internet age, you can log on to imdb.com and find complete filmographies, but in the past those indexes taught me a great deal about cast and directors body of work. And it still does. Sometimes I don't feel like opening the computer to find something.<P>This is a no nonsense guide. It's totally unpretentious, it usually shows a movie true worth, without over analizing, without apologies. It is impossible to agree with everything in the book, yet I've seen hundreds of films which appear in this guide, and as far as I'm concerned, it stands at about 90 percent hit, 10 percent miss.<P>So, ten years later, I'm still buying the new editions of this book. It was and still is a great tool for me, and it taught me a great deal about movies.<P>People Magazine was right. This is THE BEST.</span>

                    <span>With over 18,000 film reviews and right at 1616 pages there is no way one will agree with everything that Mick Martin & Marsha Porter will have to say. However this is the ultimate movie dictionary. A vital tool for a film buff on any level. This guide is by far the guide with the least missing links, I've read many other film guides (Ebert, Maltin, Bones, ect.) they are not as complete as "DVD & VIDEO GUIDE 2004" By Mick Martin & Marsha Porter. Stars and Directors are flawlessly included. If you've directed one movie,.. your listed. If you've played a key role in one film,.. your listed. An actor or director doesn't have to be a famous celebrity to be included in this guide. That's why I call this guide a movie dictionary. Thruthfully I disagree with alot of their star ratings and reviews. But that's to be expected. My review is not based on how many movies I loved and they hated. It's based on the fact that over all, as a whole.. it's the BEST! This fulfilling guide isn't lazy, believe it. Now buy it!</span>

                    <span>I get this tome every year for Christmas from my hubby because I couldn't live without it! I used to get the Maltin one, but I switched because I like the more complete Porter and Martin way of reviewing--from a big old turkey to five stars and also because of the Oscar guide and complete actor guides in the back. I like to just read this book and mark movies I'd like to watch, which leads to my only two complaints:<BR>1) I wish the foreign films with subtitles were not mixed in with normal American movies--or if they must be, mark them in an obvious way before I get all excited about it--there are plenty of people, like me, who can barely sit through a subtitled film no matter how highly rated.<BR>2) There are TONS of movies not rated at all. Now I know that the point of this book is only movies you can RENT, but when I''m playing with the TV remote and come across a movie, I'd like to be able to look it up and see if it's worth watching. Many times I go through the bother of looking it up only to find that, apparently since it's not in video stores, it's not in the book. <P>Otherwise, the reviews are very good, (though some inexplicably longer than others) sometimes downright funny. Be forewarned, though, ladies...a great chick flick can nearly never get a great rating, but a great shoot 'em up invariably will.</span>

                    <span>I was all set to title this review "head and shoulders above Maltin's guide, 4,000 more reviews of movies that can actually be purchased" But now I see that statement is not entirely true. Who wouldn't prefer a guide devoted to films you can actually buy instead of wasting space on movies that have never been released on home video, and as such are virtually impossible to find? And all this for a dollar less than Maltin's. But what if Martin/Porter are wrong? So far I've found two movies that haven't been released in the Martin/Porter guide. They are also reviewed in Maltin's guide and correctly identified as unavailable. Plus, there are some films that Martin/Porter don't review, but Maltin does, then again the reverse is true. The main reason I switched is that I have used Maltin's guide since 2001, and all of them with the exception of the 2003 guide have fallen apart in one way or another. The 2001 guide actually split in half. I think that I'll stay with Martin/Porter for at least another year and give them a chance to correct their errors, but getting your hopes up that something is available only to find out that it is not is quite frustrating.</span>

                    <span>I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a "find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.</span>
