                    <span>David Mamet's Pulitzer-winning play has been transferred to the screen in a deliberately, "rainy night noir", 1950es style, ala "12 Angry Men": almost all the action takes place either in the office or in a bar across the street.
<br />The story is simple and almost secondary: a group of real estate salesmen in a seedy office get told in no uncertain terms to shape up, sales-wise, or ship out. Desperation, crime, and infighting ensue.
<br />What makes this film a masterpiece is: language and acting.
<br />Mamet's flood of talk, filled with blistering profanity, odd rhythms, and harsh humor, is a dream for an actor, and the cast in GGH is one of the best ever. 
<br />
<br />When Alec Baldwin, sent from the corporate office to "motivate" the weary troops, starts his 15-minute monologue to them, you are just blown off your seat. His hate-filled, arrogant, belittling verbal whipping is simply one of the most amazing scenes in film. (Baldwin to Ed Harris's Moss: 'You see this watch? This watch costs more than your car.') You get the idea.
<br />
<br />Spacey as the cold office manager, Pacino as slick top-seller Roma, Harris as the angry lout, and Arkin as the befuddled ner-do-well all turn in magnificent work that intermeshes beautifully. However, in a career of some amazing films, Jack Lemmon, as has-been top dog Shelley 'The Machine' Levine who is now broke, delivers what I think is the performance of his life.
<br />
<br />Lemmon's mannerisms fit Shelley to a tee: an older, desperate man at the mercy of something he can't sell, and with a daughter in the hospital, he is at the end of his rope. His scenes are at times almost unbearable to watch: his pleading with a cold, cynical Williamson (Spacey), his being put out in the rain by a prospect who doesn't want to buy. You are seeing a man going down, and Lemmon hits every nuance just right.
<br />
<br />So then, a fairly stage-bound story about human failure and what we do to each other. It should, by that description, be dull and depressing.It is in fact mesmerizing from the first scene, and it is a film you will never forget.
<br />
<br />Get the 10th Anniversary set, to get the widescreen version. Technical quality of the transfer is superb.</span>

                    <span>I've been in sales and have been present at many sales meetings. This movie opens with the sales meeting I sat through a hundred times if I sat through it once. my familiarity with the characters as well as the drive to be the best may jade my impression fo the film. But how can you go wrong with Pacino, Lemmon, Spacey, and the list goes on? Highly encourage this romp through the sales world for anyone looking for a great night in front of the movie screen. Also, try "Suckers" for an eqully great, funny flick about the car business.</span>

                    <span>"Glengarry Glen Ross" is writer David Mamet's masterpiece. In the 1992 classic, his rapid, incisive dialogue is quicker and more brutal than in every other movie he's done, and the characters, played by such people as Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon, all exhibit a kind of rowdy vileness and vitriolic disposition that is appalling, engaging and astounding.  Mamet's message is not just that real estate is a cutthroat business; the real focus of Mamet's screenplay, based on his 1984 Pulitzer Prize winning play, is the struggle between men--the need for a weak, hurting, woeful individual to lash out against those who prevent him from being better; and the need for those at the top of their game to slander those they know are starving.  
<br />
<br />The movie's portrayal of a bummed real estate office down on their luck could be the portrayal of practically any tableau of unhappy, unruly men prepared to do anything to make a dollar.  It's Mamet's characterizations--Al Pacino as Richard Roma, the slick, conniving, office leader; Jack Lemmon as Shelly "the machine" Levine, an old timer on a bad streak; Kevin Spacey as Williamson, the boss, a man who garners no respect from those below him; and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as frustrated salesmen at the end of their wits--that makes the movie so important, so timeless.  These are men of character who possess a twisted uniqueness, but also possess a common connection to all working people; they're fed up with work, with bosses, the unknowns, the pay, the long hours.  They go through their routine gripped by spite and depression, confusion and anger, aware of how terrible their lives are, but too entrenched in their career to do anything about it.  They're a part of the American dream but at the bottom rung of the ladder.  They're living as capitalist independents but are no more satisfied with their work in the 20th century as a man might have been one hundred years before.  They wear nice suits and ties and shoes, and some of them drive nice cars, but none of that can erase feelings of hopelessness and subjugation.  When an upper level real estate agent gives a pep talk to Jack Lemmon and his coworkers on a dreary rainy night, he doesn't try to lift their spirits; he motivates by poking fun, denouncing, condemning and harassing.  
<br />
<br />To Mamet, the real estate business doesn't try to make a man feel better about himself; it's there to make a man feel worse--to feel brutalized, hopeless and frustrated.  And even those who make it-like the rich real estate agent who verbally tears down all he thinks are less than him--even they don't have any real end in life; for at the top, men still care about possessions and power.  
<br />
<br />It's as though business traps a man, telling him what is good and right in life while shutting him out of every potential alternative. And as we see Jack Lemmon and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin battle against the relentless tide of job fulfillment, we see they have no other desires; all they care about is finding leads, twisting people's arms, making a few dollars.  They come to believe that selling real estate is the most important thing in life, paramount to everything else, and their blinded pursuit ruins them, making them slouch in their chairs, making their eyes big and puffy, making them attack other men--good men--who were probably different people before they started.  The film is visceral, bewildering, and depressing, showing what life could be for those who can't break out of a rigid system, who can't break free from a lowly, unhappy, position in life.  The delivery of Mamet's dialogue by the actors is superb, ranking among the best ensemble casts of the 1990s.  There is hardly a movie that more accurately shows people struggling to stay afloat in their job, besieged by inequities, dislike, and disrespect.  </span>

                    <span>This movie is a man's movie, full of angry men cursing at each other. Alec Baldwin steals the movie with a speech full of lines like "What's my name? $#@* you - that's my name!" All of the other performances are great as well, with Pacino getting to do his usual yelling thing, and Jack Lemon transforming into a slimy old saleman. More importantly, Glen Garry features Ken Spacey back in the good ol days when he used to play unlikeable characters in interesting movies, instead of the leading man in cheesy, preachy garbage like Pay it Forward. Wait til the end of the movie for the part where Pacino calls him the C word - it's always enjoyable to watch.</span>

                    <span>Al Pacino (People I Know, Looking For Richard), Jack Lemmon (The Odd Couple, Out To Sea), Ed Harris (The Human Stain, Just Cause), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator, The Cooler), Alan Arkin (Grosse Pointe Blank, The Jerky Boys Movie), Kevin Spacey (Se7en, Beyond The Sea) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin) act their asses off in tense and powerful performances. Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, Arkin and Spacey all work as salesmen and they have to sell leads to get big mucho money by the next day or their fired...that's what the dynamic Baldwin says to them...he has everything and they dont...he doesnt like losers. So, the gang embark on selling the leads that they have and if the others dont, most of them get canned in the end. Harris and Arkin devise a plan or stealing the good leads for themselves...share them. The next day, they all come to work and find out that the place has been robbed...the contracts and leads and even the phones are all gone. A detective questions them all as the tension builds up as the actors bicker and banter on one another. Who stole the leads? A superb array of characters with the actors channeling their brilliant talents to them....Pacino is pulsating as the offfice hotshot...Lemmon hits the mark as the office loser....Arkin and Harris deliver as well and Spacey is riveting as the boss. Jonathan Pryce has a nice role as one of Pacino's clients. The dialouge rolls off the screen like firecrackers in true David Mamet style. A masterpiece. I recommend it highly. Directed by James Foley (The Corrupter, Fear)</span>
