                <span id="Label1">In distinctive ways, Iran is one of the most photogenic countries in the world -- a place where dazzling architecture is set amid desolate expanses of desert or steppe; where snow-capped mountains plunge dramatically to a seacoast of steamy lushness; where nomads guide their flocks to seasonal pasturelands; where tombs, temples, castles, and mosques bespeak the richness of the Persian past. High and dry for the most part, the land is sectioned by great mountain ranges, dotted with venerable villages of mud and stone as well as modern cities, and has a cultural fabric woven of many different threads -- Persian, Turkic, Kurdish, Baluchi and even Mongol. For a photographer to capture such a mix of spectacular terrain and cultural complexity is a formidable challenge, one that Daniel Nadler, an American born in Egypt, has met brilliantly in Iran the Beautiful. This book, comprising more than 170 photographs, takes as its symbolic center the magnificent landmark of Mount Damavand, the highest peak in the Middle East, and ranges outward from there north to the Caspian Sea, east as far as Gonbad-e Kavus, west toward Zanjan, and south to Isfahan. All lie no more than a day's drive from the great volcano, yet within those bounds can be found a spectrum of landscapes, lifestyles, and architectural treasures that show why Iran, once seen, can never be forgotten.</span>

                    <span>If you want to buy this book to learn anything about the country, either in writing or in pictures, don't buy this book. What you will get in this beautifully prepared book with an inviting title appears to be the product of the author taking a short trip to a few mountains and a coupe of villages in Northern Iran, taking a dozen or so nature pictures, and on the return back to the US, deciding to put them together to make money. You get different shots of the same snowy mountain peaks and a few pictures of villagers wondering around, a road or two of somewhere in Iran, and nothing else. I mean, nothing else. I opened mine with great expectaions and anticiation, went through the whole book of pictures in 3 minutes, and was very very upset. I might just throw it away or keep it on the living room table because of its pretty cover.</span>

                    <span>This book paints a portrait of the timeless Iran, one away from the cities, where the people live much the same now as they have for hundreds of years, where the old ways are least susceptible to change. While the book focuses on northern Iran around the Caspain Sea and Alborz Mountains, and only as far south as Isfahan, the northern region is a photographers dream. This is also the Iran that has been glorified in drawings and etchings by travelers from the 15th century on. Not only do the photographs capture the look of the landscape, but also the passage of seasons, the way the light and color of the sky and earth give an instant feeling of spring, summer, autumn or winter. The brief sections of writing and excerpts of poetry complement the images, pointing readers on their way. Buy this book if you if you're planning to go there or just want to see how magnificent its beauty is.</span>

                    <span>When I first saw the cover of the book, I thought "This one ought to be different." Unfortunately, it wasn't. The book gives nothing more than a stereotype view of Irans's "beauty" according to a somewhat spiritual-minded westener, who tries to tell other westeners "You're right! Iran is just a bunch of mountains, deserts and village-people, but try to see the splendor of all this!!".<P>As a native Iranian, If I knew the intention of the author, to write and inform about the true beauty of the Iranian nature, I could have suggested him to take a long trip to the North, West and the central part of Iran, which in size are much more than the total region the author visited, and which in richness of vegetation and animal-life are just breath-taking.<P>Iran certainly doesn't deserve a long trail of unclear and boring pictures showing snowcapped mountains (very beautiful, but three whould have been more than sufficient), empty deserts, ramshackled villages and faces that only reflect the majority of the western world's narrow-minded prejudices about Iranians.</span>
