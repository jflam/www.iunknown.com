                    <span>Bought this book recently and enjoyed it. Although I am sold on low carbohydrates whereas this book preaches high carbs, I still found it very informative on everything from picking out the right shoes to stretching to the proper way to run/jog.<P>The book is authored by an expert, Amby Burfooot, in the field. He is editor of Runner's World Magazine and has ran several dozen marathons, so I took his advice seriously and all of it made perfect sense.<P>The book is very organized and easy to read for anyone and flows smoothly so putting it down was sometimes difficult. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start running or has already been an avid runner.</span>

                    <span>Runner's World has been such a rich source of good reading forrunners that I was somewhat surprised by how ordinary this book is.That the book is a collection of articles from past issues of the Runner's World monthly magazine shows: the book "feels" disjointed. To the editor's credit, it is evident that he has tried, with his comments, to thread all the chapters (read "articles") together, but there still seems to be something missing. If you are a newcomer to running and needs a good first book on running, "The Runner's Handbook" will be a better choice. If you are already a serious runner, you are better off subscribing (or re-subscribing) to the Runner's World monthly magazine.</span>

                    <span>I wanted a book that provides detailed information about things like running training programs, information about injuries, and information about nutrition. While the Runner's World Complete Book of Running mentions these topics, the information is so watered down that it is barely useful. If you want some serious information I suggest getting Tim Noakes "The Lore of Running" instead. If you simply want to read some warm fuzzy articles that don't really say anything, then buy this book.</span>
