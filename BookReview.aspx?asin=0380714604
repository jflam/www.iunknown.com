                    <span>Fire on the Mountain is an inspiring story about a rancher in New Mexico who is trying to prevent the US gov't from laying claim to his land. Thru the voice of a 12yo grandson who is visiting for the summer, the novel comes vividly alive with desert descriptions of cottonwoods, riverbeds, and sunsets. The beautiful and emerging give-and-take relationship betw grandfather and grandson lends force to an already strong tale.<BR>Abbey is known as the father of the environmental movement, a label he didn't much like. He preferred to call himself 'an agrarian anarchist.' If you like his other books and his exquisite writing style, don't miss this one.</span>

                    <span>Fire on the Mountain very vividly describes the actual landscapes and realities of New Mexico. The characters enviroment plays an effective role regulating how the family responds to their hardships and obstacles. The book is very well written and based off a true story that is heroic in its own way. I highly recommend this book to a person who likes a book based on reality yet offers adventure while describing such desolate areas and making them come to life.</span>

                    <span>This book is an early example of Abbey's writings about fierce individualism. This book, along with "Desert Solitaire" and "Fool's Progress" depict a desire to return to days when people were much more independent. This book, while being 30 years old, is still relevant. Where should we draw the line between governement and citizens? Abbey did an excellent job with this book.</span>

                    <span>For all those who have read Abbey's famous work Desert Solitaire and other non fiction Fire on the Mountain is a great introduction to his fiction. First published in 1962 it marks Abbey's early attempts to confront some of the environmental and social problems resulting from humanity's alienation from nature and the land. Abbey based his plot around actual events in which a New Mexico rancher named John Prather fought government attempts to confiscate his land to make it part of the White Sands Missle Range. Considering the time when this book was written, following the era of McCarthyism and the onset of the Cold War, Abbey was especially bold in putting forth the philosophical preposition that an individual has a moral and ethical responsibilty to protect the land against its despoilers, whether corporate entities or even the US government. <P>In detailing one person's struggle against the seemingly invincible forces of power that the government represents, Abbey was attempting to illustrate that, indeed, one person's strugglecan make a difference. Given Abbey's extention of this line of thought and further development in The Monkeywrech Gang the intimate relationship between the two novels seems apparent. The ideas presented in Fire on the Mountain, thus, are central to understanding Abbey's subsequent works, both his fiction and non fiction, which are all bound by his belief that the essential tenent for human society must be respect for the environment and a duty to protect the natural diversity of life. As Abbey often said the land is owned by all and no one.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is another of Abbey's great works which mixes fiction with reality. Although I don't know if the main character and his fight to save the land he lives on is based in fact I do know that it represents the same struggle that many have gone through when the government comes to tell you they need your land. It is a very endearing story about a man who has lived and worked on his land (which is in a relatively hostile geographic area which most people would not live in) only to find that towards the end of his life someone is going to try to take it from him. It is a great story and does not duplicate any of his other writings as far as I could tell.</span>
