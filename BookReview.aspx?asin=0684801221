                <span id="Label1">Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the  author. In fact <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as <I>Across the River and into the Trees</I>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame:  <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: "The old man was dreaming about the lions." Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. <I>--James Marcus</I></span>

                    <span>The Old Man and the Sea was a good book and it took place in a tropical island, which was Cuba. It had a good story line and interesting storyline but easy to follow if you paid close attention to what was going on with the old man. The book was about an old man and his problems in life. The sharks stood for the problem, the old man stood for the people, and the marlin stood for the goal in life but it was also about the old man catching a marlin on a little wooden boat with a hand line in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. I think it could have not had a better ending.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you read this book if you are interested in adventure and fishing. I give this book a 5 star rating</span>

                    <span> Well, I have never read a book by Hemingway before, although I have heard quite a lot about him, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I ended up with was a pretty obvious and boring story about, (big surprise) and old man and the sea.
<br />
<br /> A fisherman named Santiago (though his name is mentioned only about 3 times) has had 84 days of bad luck. He hasn't caught anything and the boy who helps him has had to leave because he needed a more profitable job. So Santiago decides to fish out deeper than he usually does. He hooks a really big fish, which begins pulling him out to sea.
<br />
<br /> It keeps pulling him for 2 days before they finally battle it out, and Santiago kills the fish. He manages to lash it to his little boat and begins rowing for shore. However, before he gets very far, sharks start coming to feed on the carcass of the fish. Santiago fights them off for a while, but eventually nothing is left of the fish but a skeleton. He makes it back to land in the middle of the night and crawls home to bed, bruised, battered and defeated. The next day the boy takes care of him and the rest of the town marvels at the gigantic skeleton. At the end, nothing really changed.
<br /> 
<br /> So the story (and this is a 117 page book) has very little to it. I didn't like the writing at all. It was too spare, it reminded me of the fish's skeleton AFTER the sharks ate it! Instead of describing stuff, he'd just state it blankly and without any emotion or eloquence. Instead of describing how or why the boy loved the man, he just says " The boy loved the old man." How interesting is that? This was a short and easy read, but it totally bored me. It was a struggle to finish it.
<br />
<br /> I think he was trying to prove a point about how desperate and determined the old man was, and how even though he succeeded, it all came to nothing. Three days later, after his big adventure, nothing had changed at all. However, this book didn't reach me at all. Too bad, I had hoped I would enjoy it.

                    <span>I'm not the biggest Hemingway fan in the world, but I like this book. I first read it in high school, just like millions of kids still do every year. The Old Man and the Sea is an American classic, and for some pretty good reasons. It signified the author's return to greatness, it shows an old man who is full of both resolve and wry humor, and lastly it is a moving story told in very simple, straightforward language.
<br />
<br />I can appreciate what this novella is about. You take a guy down on his luck and send him on a journey of unearthly demands. How does he react? Santiago could have given up and quit any time he wanted - before or after his catch - so it is interesting to see what drives a man onward. Hemingway thought that Santiago's qualities were what was important in a man; he makes a good case for them here. Compassion, perserverance and a sense of order to life all come into play. Santiago respects the fish, and that is what makes this story most memorable.
<br />
<br />I don't know whether this was symbolic of Hemingway's own struggle with the literary critics of his time, nor do I think that this is his best . But I think the Old Man and the Sea should be read...in all ages. Perhaps it is fitting that a book like this is told in such simple language. Like the ocean itself, great things lurk just below the surface for those who wish to look.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a simple story about an old man who will not admit defeat.  
<br />
<br />For 84 days Santiago sails out to sea and returns home with nothing.  On the 85th day, Santiago sets out determined that this is the day he will end his unlucky streak.  
<br />
<br />He has decided that in order to catch something, he must sail out farther than usual, go beyond the "safe zone" with all the other fishermen near the shore.
<br />
<br />When Santiago feels a tremendous tug at his line, he knows that this is it.  This is what he has been waiting for.  This is the big catch.  
<br />
<br />The fish, a marlin, proves to be bigger than anything the old fisherman has ever handled.  It challenges Santiago's strength, courage and endurance.  For days he hangs on, his fishing line cutting deep into his hands and back.  But he will not give up the fight.  The marlin pulls him farther and farther from his home, from all mankind.  It is just him, the marlin, and the open sea.  Finally, the fish gives up and the old man wins the battle. 
<br />
<br />But the war is not over yet.  On the journey home the old man's boat sails into shark-infested waters.  Ironically, Santiago now has to protect the marlin he just killed.  
<br />
<br />This story is about a man's place not against, but within nature.  Out at sea, all alone, he develops a relationship with the marlin and the sharks, and we come to understand that perhaps man is not always the superior species.  His part in nature is the same as all creatures: he has a place in life and in death.</span>

                    <span>When Santiago, the old fisherman, finally decides to try his luck far away from the shore, he probably did'nt realise he would meet his destiny both as a fisherman and a human being.
<br />
<br /> As a human being because after all his troubles he comes home empty handed, a fate most of us humans will find at the end of our live; we will ask if this is all we have done.
<br />
<br /> But it seems to me that the story has a second meaning. When a huge sword-fish takes the bait an epic battle starts between the two. The fish swims away, forcing the old man to taut the cord for almost two days. During this moments one could ask who's the hunter and who's the hunted. I believe that this duality makes the story a masterpiece.</span>
