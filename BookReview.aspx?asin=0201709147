                <span id="Label1">XML is often treated as the next pop standard in markup, but seldom in  depth as a set of software development specifications. <I>Essential XML</I> digs  deep into XML, examining its capabilities as an underlying data-exchange format.  This book is for serious software developers who are comfortable with technical  terminology.<p>  Right from the start, the book addresses XML as a data format and not a  presentation mechanism. It is the belief of the authors that XML handcoding by  humans will fade away as XML becomes increasingly a low-level standard for  providing communication between applications. The entire book revolves around  the XML Information Set (InfoSet), an XML specification that the authors feel is  underexamined by most XML aficionados. The InfoSet defines XML documents in  terms that are independent of syntax.<p>  The opening section provides an overview to the InfoSet, albeit a very technical  examination. There's little ramping up in this book--readers must be prepared to  dig into the nitty-gritty right from the start. The text moves on to discuss  programming XML via the DOM and SAX, as well as such key topics as  transformations and navigation. <p>  One of the book's strongest points is its examination of XML as a messaging  technology for the software development market of the future. In a discussion of  XML as an improvement over standard component models, the authors proclaim that,  "as the software industry looks to XML as a solution to all problems short of  world hunger, there is a tendency to reinvent the entire automobile and highway  system in the process of reinventing the wheel." <p>  Developers who are fluent in component programming and distributed object models  will glean the most from this book. Casual XML implementers should look for a  more introductory guide, but tool developers will find this title quite  insightful in charting their XML course. <I>--Stephen W.

                    <span>Like all the stuff Don Box wrote and published, this book is yet <br>another product he put out in a hurry. there are many many many<br>blunt errors which makes you doubt if Mr. Box understand <br>the topic at all. we have our copy of this book (bought by mistake) in the lunch room so that we can use its pages to clean<br>spilled food. the cover of the book is anoying too! Don, is that you getting out the shower? <br>in summary, what a piece of junk!</span>

                    <span>My impression is that Don Box is missing the mathematical bases to write this kind of ambitious books. There are big mistakes that show how he is missing a solid background on "graph theory" and mathematics. In my personal opinion he is a lot better writing about programming and should avoid this kind of topics.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book without even thumbing through it - that's how much faith I had in Don Box after reading his other books in this series.  What a disappointment!  This book is poorly organized, rife with errors and doesn't seem to have any discernable target audience.<p>There are no good books on this subject (although there's no shortage of them) and someone really needs to step-up and write the definitive work in this area.  I was expecting that someone to be Don Box.<p>If you're considering buying this book, I urge you to go to the bookstore (or borrow it from a friend) and read the chapter on "Schemas".  If that strikes you as remotely clear..., then go ahead and purchase with my blessing.</span>

                    <span>Essential XML commits the worst sin of any technical work: it assumes its readers are already familiar with the subject matter. Reading this book is is like joining a competitive high-level college course in mid-semester--one feels behind from the start.<p>Perhaps the authors feel that readers who would admit to a need for a more gradual approach to the material are beneath their consideration as being weak technically. It's unfortunate that omniscience is one of the assumed attributes of the hacker.<p>I for one am not omniscient, but prefer texts where the authors and editors have made a reasonable effort to present the material in a way accessible to readers with varying levels of prior expertise.</span>

                    <span>This book is a little confusing if you are starting with XML. But if you keep working on it, you will find it really rewarding. It focuses on giving you a conceptual review of the technologies related to XML and XML itself, instead of providing a bunch of "if you have this problem, do this" kind of receipts.<p>It is outdated by now in terms of the sintax, specially with the XML schema spec getting the recommendation status. Nevertheless the concepts behind didn't change fundamentally. If you have read the Primer from the W3C but didn't get enough from it, but  don't want to go to the spec (who reads that?) then this book may be of great help.</span>
