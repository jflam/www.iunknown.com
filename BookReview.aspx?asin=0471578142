                    <span>What can I say, this book starts at just beyond turning the computer on. It does it with a humurous style that makes learning this sometimes frustrating art a joy. I consider myself a seasoned assembler and I still come back to this book because of the writer's style. If you want to learn assembler from square one, well buy it now.</span>

                    <span>I wore this book out.  I'll probably buy another just to have a good copy.  No doubt the best assembly language book for absolute beginners.  Tom Swan's book is the next logical step.  I wish Jeff Duntemann, Tom Swan, and Michael Abrash would get together and write a nice great big fat book for  Turbo Assembler 5.0 that includes extensive coverage of object oriented  assembly, the debugger and Windows Assembly Language programming.  That  would be the ultimate book for those of us that just LOVE pain!</span>

                    <span>I was very impressed with the way that the author started his book by introducing those who didn't know them to the bare basics of computer hardware and how they work. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it helped me a  great deal in getting through the beginner level of programming this  language</span>

                    <span>This book is really good value for people who, like me, know how to use a computer and feel like learning more about the way it works. It's quite easy to understand it, even if you don't know how to program at all. I  guess it may be boring for expert users, but it's a great start for  newbies. If you would like to understand a bit more about the computer  itself, this is the place to begin.</span>

                    <span>This book is great.  It is a book that will take you step by step to get you started.  Not like those other begginers books that assume that you know how the computer works, this one will take you from the basic inner workings of a computer to a level where you can start creating very basic  programs.  From this book, you can go out and get a normal beginners book  and be able to understand what you are trying to learn.</span>
