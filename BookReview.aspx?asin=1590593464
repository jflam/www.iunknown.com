                <span id="Label1"><b>Foreword by Yoel Arnon, MSMQ Software Development Engineer, Microsoft Corporation</b><p> </p>  <p><b>No application is an island&#133;</b>In today&#146;s connected world, each and every professional developer must assume that his or her applications will need to communicate with other applications.</p> <p> Distributed applications, however, present a large set of unique challenges, like, What do I do when the network is disconnected? How do I coordinate the actions of two separate applications? How do I handle peak times? How do I guarantee delivery? How do I upgrade my application without breaking the communication? </p> <p> We at the Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) team have worked hard to provide an elegant solution to these questions and many others. This book will help you leverage this work by using MSMQ in your distributed applications so that you will be able to concentrate on the business logic rather than network problems.</p> <p> What is MSMQ? MSMQ is message-oriented middleware (MOM) that comes as a standard component of Windows and allows applications to exchange messages among them using queues&#151;outgoing queues for messages waiting to be sent, and incoming queues for messages waiting to be received. Queues&#151;like dams&#151;guarantee nice and controlled flow of information, even when the network is congested or suffers frequent disconnects.</p> <p> Moreover, queues are a very natural programming metaphor. Most people would agree that working from a queue of to-do tasks is more effective than responding to requests on the spot. The same is true for computer programs. Programs that process queues of incoming messages tend to be simpler and more efficient than programs acting on interrupts.</p> <p>  The availability of powerful, yet simple, MOMs like MSMQ on millions of desktops and servers have changed the way programmers design and write distributed applications. The simple concepts of queue and message&#151;along with powerful features like quality of service, transactions, and security&#151;have enabled a new breed of distributed applications in a wide range of industries. In addition, MSMQ provides an excellent solution for integrating existing applications&#151;for the Internet or for enterprise-wide systems like ERP. </p> <p>   Even after nine years on the MSMQ team, I am amazed to see the number of ways customers use this technology: in airlines and communication, financial services, e-retailers, traditional department stores, and even online games.</p> <p> In addition to covering the essentials of MSMQ, this book is the first book covering the cool new features introduced in MSMQ 3.0 (which was released as part of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003) &#151; features such as multicast, triggers, HTTP messages, and more. In addition, it is the first book covering the novel .NET MSMQ APIs: System.Messaging. </p> <p>   Today, MSMQ knowledge became a standard requirement for a professional Windows developer, alongside such skills as Visual Basic, Visual C/C#, SQL/IIS/ADO/COM+, and others. Reading this book is a great way to get started.</p> <p> If you consider yourself a professional Windows developer, and you know that no application is an island any longer, then this book is for you.</p> <p>  I am proud to be a part of the revolution MSMQ brought to the Windows application development world. I hope that you will enjoy using MSMQ as much as I&#151;together with the other MSMQ team members&#151;enjoyed developing it. </p> <p>  Yoel Arnon Software Development Engineer Microsoft Corporation <p> <b>About the Book</b> <p>  This book explores MSMQ so that you can initiate robust, asynchronous communication between applications. MSMQ provides three APIs to incorporate message queuing into different applications. These APIs include "C" from unmanaged C/C++ code; a COM component from VB or C++ code; and the System.Messaging namespace, which integrates MSMQ with managed C# or VB .NET applications. </p>  <p>This is the only book on the market to cover all three APIs. Plus, this book discusses the newest features of MSMQ 3.0 (released with Windows Server 2003), and explains sending and receiving MSMQ messages on a PocketPC device.</p></span>

                    <span>This books does have some working examples.
<br />I felt that the book lacked in the clarity in how to setup 
<br />the msmq for routing which is extremly important for enterprise applications. Like alot of books, the start of the book was a very good introduction, then the author slacks off and misses out a few explanations here and there and the examples in the later chapters then don't work. Would have been nice if the author provided some examples to demonstrate msmq problem architectures. Very messy in the end.</span>

                    <span>This is a very competent and well written walkthrough of MSMQ functionality. The book is fairly simple in form. The first chapter is an introductory level discussion of message queueing with effective illustrations. The second chapter covers the .NET API for messaging with C#. The third chapter covers administration of the message queue. These three chapters are really the heart of the book. The final chapters cover advanced topics like transactions and triggers. MSMQ 3.0 is also covered.
<br />
<br />The book is well written and makes good use of graphics to explain concepts like message flow and state management. A very good, very tight book.</span>

                    <span>If you are familiar with MSMQ and looking for a good reference or new to MSMQ and want to learn how to use it this is the book for you. It has all the information in one place. You will find versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 covered.  Code either in VB6, C#, VB .NET, or C++ is used with the .NET System Messaging Namespace, MSMQ API, and the MSMQ COM Component. .  It starts with an introduction to message queuing, gives some scenarios where it might be used and describes the MSMQ architecture. Installing various versions of MSMQ is covered along with dependent or independent clients and servers. Separate chapters are devoted to System Messaging, Administration, Transactional Messaging, Triggers, and MSMQ 3.0 including the HTTP protocol. Finally MSMQ on the Pocket PC is covered. I found the discussion of difficult topics, difficult to me anyway, such as MSMQ in a global MSDTC transaction in the Transaction chapter to be excellent.  I don't think you will be disappointed in the book.</span>

                    <span>"Pro MSMQ" is one of the only books currently out that gives an in depth overview of MSMQ.  This book is basically split into two sections. One section gives some of the best information and reference material regarding the System. Messaging class for the .NET framework.  The code snippets are very useful and give the reader a solid direction and foundation for extending the code to accomplish their objective using MSMQ.  The other section is just as informative with regards to the Win API.  I read this section, but most of my effort went into reading and using the example code from the System.Messaging section.  
<br />
<br />   I found the book easy to read, concise, and very helpful in ramping up on the MSMQ technology.  The chapter on creating and administering MSMQ was very useful and the diagrams made it easy to follow.  The book also had a chapter on deploying and administration tools for MSMQ.  The code snippets are all C# but a VB.NET developer should be able to convert the code examples with little effort.  This book was very helpful for me in ramping up on MSMQ in a short timeframe for a project I was working on.  I would definitely recommend this book as necessary reading for anyone who will be using MSMQ and .NET framework.

                    <span>MSMQ is now in its third version and is shown here to be very stable and useful for distributed, asynchronous programming on Microsoft platforms. Those of you also familiar with the Java world will recognise MSMQ as the analog of Java Message Service. (Though this book's index contains no entries for Java or JMS.)<p>The description of MSMQ 3 is comprehensive. The authors show how it has significant improvements over version 2. They point out that the main difference is now you have Internet Messaging. You can send and get messages via http, and refer to q queue by its URL. Very nice. An indication of how the rise of the Internet shapes our programming expectations.<p>The book is replete with example code. In C#, naturally. But even if you don't know this language, it has good semantic keywords, so that following the logic is easy. The book is also a testament to how Microsoft is promoting C# as their core language for development. Quite reasonable, as the language has been well designed. In fact, you might regard this entire book as an important use case for C#!</span>
