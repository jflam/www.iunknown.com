                    <span>One of the better golf books on the market. Actually it is very similiar to Rick Smith's book "How to find your perfect golf swing" (which is another great book). However "Golf is a Woman's Game" was published before Smith's which leads me to believe the author Horn is well ahead of her time.<P>I did not agree with all of Horn's theories and found the illustrations to be ok. But despite these setbacks it really was a very excellent book.<P>I gave it a five star rating and believe a lot of men (who are not intimidated by the title) would benefit by reading this book. It shows how a man's forearm strength can actually hurt his golf game. Any way, I strongly recommend this book, it has some great information, one of my favorites was the chapter "Observations on Women and Golf"....a lot of cute stories.</span>

                    <span>In another review I read that this is William Jefferson Clinton's favorite golf book. You know since he has left the presidency he has a pretty good swing. Though I feel sorry for the guy because no one believes his scores, as a result he will probably never be accepted as a credible golfer.<P>Now to this book. No I do not believe golf is a woman's game. It is no ones game. The game is equally brutal to us all. However, I do applaud the author for writing an excellent instructional manual that is also a very pleasant read.<BR>The author believes golf is a woman's game because women (compared to men) lack physical strength so their bodies naturally accomodate for difference through the use of technique. She has a sub-chapter called the effiency ratio where she discusses the amount of physical strength vs distance and she explains that the swings efficacy not the distance the ball travels represents a good golf swing. <BR>A very good book that reveals a lot of myths and one that is definitely worth reading.<P>And as for William Jefferson, I believe you and keep swinging... it's looking good.</span>

                    <span>I've read this book twice and will read again. The instruction flows just like an enjoyable novel. Definitely a great book worth reading twice.</span>

                    <span>I got this book thinking it would be good for a beginning golfer. I was very disappointed. The concepts were much too difficult for a beginning golfer or just not well written or communicated to the reader. The illustrations weren't helpful either. A much better book for beginners would be the Golf Handbook for Women by Vivien Saunders.</span>
