                <span id="Label1"><I>The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions</I> is a theological remix of the old Cole Porter song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." In alternating chapters, the (mostly) liberal Marcus J. Borg and the (mostly) conservative N.T.  Wright consider the major questions of the historical-Jesus debate that has dominated biblical studies in the 1990s.  Borg and Wright agree that Jesus was the Christian messiah and preached the Kingdom of God, but they disagree about the Virgin birth, the purpose of Jesus' death, the issue of his bodily resurrection, and the question of his divinity. The Ping-Pong structure of this book and the fastidious politeness with which the authors treat one another sometimes give <I>The Meaning of Jesus</I> a tomato/tomahto, potato/potahto bounciness, but the project is nevertheless worthy: this is a simple, clear orientation to some of the most important biblical questions of our time, and a record of a lively and loving friendship between two of the best Christian scholars alive. <I>--Michael Joseph Gross</I></span>

                    <span>I'll be honest; I came to this book with my opinions firmly planted and walked away from it much the same. While N.T. Wright is the contributor that I knew I would side with more in this particular debate, I did not think that Borg would be what he is. By that I mean that he is no J.D. Crossan laying down ideas and giving me no way or reason to join him. My overall impression is that Borg stops just short of being quite a bit like Wright. Both men share a Jesus who subverts authority and liberates but Borg's is really nothing more than that. I gave this book five stars becuase it is, as other reviewers have said, a very good introduction to the debate. Futhermore, both men can write well, which is refreshing. I simply feel that Borg had the burden of proof (since I've already read some of Wirght's work) and he did not sway me. But he did inform me, which is honestly well worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>Although I came late to this book, I nevertheless pass along these thoughts.  This is an absolutely compelling work, particularly since both sides of the question of where Christianity should go in the future are well represented.  The focus is on methodology rather than details and the interaction is mutually respectful.  Anyone desiring to look beyond polemics and see why and how a new vision of Christianity in the third millennium is emerging could do no better than this.</span>

                    <span>The Meaning of Jesus is co-written by N T Wright and Marcus Borg and is presented as a dialogue of sorts between a liberal and traditionalist reading of Jesus and his portrayal in the biblical material. From both perspectives and in dialogue with each other many of the key issues of Jesus debate are covered such as the idea of the Virgin birth, the incarnation, resurrection and parousia. Both viewpoints are clearly argued in serious but still easily digestible essays. In spite of the differences (which are in no way minimised) the communion and respect each author gives to the other's work shines through which is really encouraging.
<br />
<br />I found this book engaging and it reminded me all over again how revolutionary and worthy of attention is the person who is the focus of the book. Most illuminating was Borg's distinction between the pre-Christian and Post-Easter Jesus (which is not strictly synonymous with the more common Christ of Faith and Jesus of history approach) as it shows how liberals can have a vital faith that is rooted in tradition rather than the mere appropriation of enlightenment rationality. Perhaps the most abiding influence of this book is that it has inspired me to read again the narratives and consequently is the first time in a while that I can honestly say I was excited to read the bible. Definitely recommended!

                    <span>Most people I know who consider themselves Christians follow the narrow path outlined to them in the churches of their youth.  They reject the ambiguous nature of much of the Bible and believe those interpretations different from their own belong to the foolish, the wicked and the damned.  If this arrogant and naive form of worship appeals to you, then you probably have no interest in a book like "The Meaning of Jesus".     However, if you are interested in exposing yourself to how different people view the meaning of Jesus' life and in turn developing a deeper understanding of him for yourself, then there is no better book to begin your search.  <p>In alternating chapters, Borg and Wright discuss the important debated issues of Christianity.  They discuss such subjects as the virgin birth, the resurrection and the important question of whether Jesus actually believed he was the messiah.   They must have seen early drafts of the other's sections, because they also make comments on points made by the other side.  Wright is a traditionalist, or what I like to call a "John 3:16 Christian."  He believes the meaning of Jesus' life is as the savior who died for the sins of the world.   Borg, on the other hand, is a follower of Jesus, the man.  He believes less in the elements of traditional Christianity that seem supernatural to non-believers, focusing instead on the lessons of Christ in the first three gospels (which is largely without references to Christ as the son of God).    <p>A lesson is found in this book, a lesson that if learned by the rest of the world would make it a much better place.  The two men disagree on many fundamental questions.  Even though each of them debates an individual whose beliefs work to disprove the elements of their faiths they cling to, the two men are able to discuss the issues without judgment thrown in the other direction.    They don't attempt to "show the other one the light" or convince them their beliefs will only lead them to Hell.    Instead, they give us all intelligent discourse, shape and support their own arguments and then leave it up to us to decide.  Both men know it is better to work toward having people follow one interpretation of the life of Christ than to argue over minutia and turn people away from him.</span>

                    <span>...on the historical Jesus debate, this should be it.<p>I've used this book in two of my seminary classes so far.  It's rich in good scholarship, and both of these gentlemen are well respected in the academic world, but it doesn't get bogged down in technical language, so the lay person can still understand it easily.<p>The idea of alternating chapters with the two scholars works perfectly, and they alternate who gets the first word and the last word on each topic, as well.  I often found myself agreeing with one of the authors as I read his chapter, only to find myself agreeing even more with the other author in the very next chapter!  Ultimately, I believe that neither side has the Truth completely figured out, and it will be much of this "give-and-take" that gets us closer to the heart of Christianity.<p>I know that many people (myself included) believe that much of the truth of Christianity hinges on the resurrection, and both Borg and Wright do superb jobs in stating their opinions and arguments on that topic.  The final topic, "Jesus and the Christian Life," serves remarkably well in tying everything together, as each author presents what meaning they find in their beliefs about Jesus. No matter what we believe about Jesus, if our beliefs don't inspire us to a changed, transformed life, then they are, in the end, worthless.  Both Borg and Wright exhibit changed lives as a result of their experience with Christ.<p>It is so beautiful how two friends with two (almost) opposite viewpoints can have such an honest, open discussion about a topic that is all too often very aggressive from both sides.  Clearly, this is an issue that has important ramifications for those within and without the church, and, as such, it is crucial for both sides to begin being honest with each other.<p>Peace.</span>
