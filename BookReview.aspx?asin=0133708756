                <span id="Label1">This book provides an excellent introduction to Common Lisp. In addition to chapters covering  the basic language concepts, there are sections discussing the Common Lisp object system (CLOS) and  speed considerations in Lisp. Three fair-sized examples of nontrivial Lisp projects are also included. The  book's clear and engaging format explains complicated constructs simply. This format makes <I>ANSI  Common Lisp</I> accessible to a general audience--even those who have never programmed before. The  book also provides an excellent perspective on the value of using Lisp. </span>

                    <span>This book is good introduction to Common Lisp. There is quite qood reference section at the end of the book. The reference section is just perfect for language learning. Graham's writing syle is not neutral. He has many opinions what is good and bad in Lisp. Those opinions make the book more enjoyable for experienced lispers too (even if you don't agree fully).  If after reading this book reader can proceed to On Lisp from same author.
<br />
<br />As other reviewer has noted the book has bad binding. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Don't get me wrong, I still think the book deserves 5 stars for doing a grade-A presentation of material --- topics are presented clearly and without fuss, and even examples are logically (but thoroughly) discussed, without the bludgeoning that typically accompanies code examples in introductory language texts.  
<br />
<br />One minor failing is that occasionally (I came across 3-4 instances) the author makes use of constructs in examples where they have not yet been presented --- it might have been intentional, as it forces the reader to get acquainted with the reference section, but it's a little disconcerting.  
<br />
<br />The macro section left me hungry for more (but that's what "On Lisp" --- available online for free from Paul Graham's website --- is for), and the package discussion was a little sparse (keywords were sort of confusing --- Practical Common Lisp, at http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/, does a better job), but overall, a great read.
<br />
<br />I have to agree with the other reviewer that I wish more substantial programming exercises were given.  This won't be a problem for students who are using the book as a text in a Lisp-based course, obviously, but for self-study practitioners it would be icing on the cake.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very good introduction to Lisp, as others have  adequately explained.  However, since it was first published the quantity of good free Lisp reading material on the web has increased.  See <u>Practical Common Lisp</u> (http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) as an example.  The $47 expenditure might not be necessary if you just want to learn lisp.
<br />
<br />My main complaint is the binding on the book. I have not put this book under any unusual stress and the spine is already starting to fall apart after a few weeks of use.  This unacceptable for reference book that I would like to use well into the future.</span>

                    <span>I read the first few chapters of this book before losing interest.  My general feeling is that it is a good source to get some insights into where python features like lambda functions come from.  As to fully learning LISP, my own personal opinion is don't bother unless you are an ivory tower academic or computer person with an abundance of spare time who likes to collect programming languages like people collect stamps or coins or whatever.<p>Those of us in the real world solving real programming problems need a rich set of built-ins (python socket, OS, modules etc.)<br>and want to steer clear of LISP's arcane syntax.<p>So in conclusion:  good book for learning about some programming language design principals in general (and python more specifically), but don't plan on using LISP for real-world applications.</span>

                    <span>Graham has a penetrating understanding of Lisp, so the text is lucid and easy to follow. Also, like Starr's report on Clinton, some of the best stuff is in the footnotes!<p>The book is small and the topic large, so some coverage of things is a bit thin. So what -- the Hyperspec is free. <p>The book is extremely practical, dealing with how to write programs and use the language. It is *extremely* handy to refer to while programming; this is not true of the Hyperspec. Hence this book is a must-have. <p>Also strongly recommended (especially if you don't know why Lisp is so wonderful) is "On Lisp", by Paul Graham. He shows the completely unmatched power of Lisp. Out of print, you can get for free on Graham's website -- go to yahoo to find it.</span>
