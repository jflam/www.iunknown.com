                    <span>I'm a home winemaker in the heart of the best viticulture region in North America being groomed to become a commercial winemaker in the next year or so. I have read MANY how-to books on the subject, taken courses and toured many operating wineries. I rate Jeff Cox's "From Vines to Wines" as the best entry level book around, and I rate Yair Margalit's Handbook as positively the best I've seen for winemakers with some experience behind them. Yair is a PhD, so stand by for some heavy chemistry, but it does not get in the way of understanding this marvelous little book. This is truly HANDS ON stuff with nothing left out! I found Yair's straight-forward style just the ticket for untangling complex winemaking concepts and clearing up my understanding of some pretty difficult wine technology. He definitely added to my expertise and affected the way I will approach winemaking in the future. If you're interested in fine tuning your winemaking technique, get this book!</span>

                    <span>A very entertaining scientific book which simplifies the art of winemaking and the chemistry which is involved in it. Very straight forward and readable. Since I am not a winemaker, but a wine enthusiastic I am not aware of how much does it help experienced and professional winemakers, but as a book to novices and ordinary people who want to get some knowledge of the interesting practical aspects which are the concern of every wine maker it sure does a great job. One Aspect that The book does not touch is the terroir. Overall, it is a very interesting and enlightening book.</span>
