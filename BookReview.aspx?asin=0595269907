                <span id="Label1">"I was on a lonely stretch of road. There were no lights other than the moon and stars, and I had not encountered any traffic in at least 10 minutes. Far ahead of me a figure stepped out of the brush and stood on the shoulder of the road. The figure was still far out of my headlight range, but was visible as a stunning and marvelous silhouette in the bright moonlight." Capturing the essence of the riding experience through a series of adventures and a candid look into the author s mind, this book explodes the myths and shows the reader something few books have before-the complex motivations of an avid motorcycle rider.</span>

                    <span>The author may be a great guy but this book is just plain awful. I've read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down. If you need to read a "motorcycle" book to know it's hot in Texas, Motel 6 has noisy air conditioners, chicken fried steak can be nauseating - and be told this in EVERY FREAKING CHAPTER!, than you may be able to get through his book. I gave up halfway through when the "poetry" showed up, it's hard to believe a grown man could write such drivel. I don't think I've ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one. </span>

                    <span>  I purchased this book last summer.  I had the pleasure of meeting the author, and getting him to autograph my copy.
<br />  This winter, I finally got around to reading the book while on a trip (family death).  Daniel's writing style, insight, ability to find something good to write about in his riding adventures... all contributed to making a nice couple of evenings (during an unhappy time) for me.  The book's stories brought smiles, laughs, and longings to return home (to ride) to my soul.  
<br />  I've had the pleasure of quietly observing Daniel's kind hearted contributions to the lives of fellow motorcyclists and their families (internet forums).  A kind word, or a signed copy of his book sent to them (to help them along a difficult path).  
<br /> Daniel Meyer's writings will not only provide you with spirited entertainment, but will show you the better side of motorcycling, and the people who enjoy riding them.  It may even tug at your heart strings and cause you to long for some "time behind bars" (handlebars, that is).  </span>

                    <span>I read this book almost non-stop. If you ride a motorcycle, it's a must read. If you don't, read it and find out why the rest of us ride! Humor, adventure, a little sureal, something for all. The story about finding the cat is worth the price of admission alone!
<br />I'm looking forward to reading his next tome, as soon as riding season's over :).</span>

                    <span>"Daniel Meyer is a Dallas area author who has written two books of short stories that are at once charming and very American. He travels the roads on a Honda Valkyrie and has... adventures. He writes these episodes up in a succint style, which makes for quick and thoughtful reading. More than 'adventure stories', these books are little nuggets of Americanna that give just a little different perspective on contemprary life. Well worth the reading!"

                    <span>This guy wrote a great book for all motorcyclists who travel the USA Roads. He has several miles under his belt and I have personally met him. The Book life is a rode was informative for some of us younger riders, had lots of rode information and was very pleasing to read! 
<br />Funny at times, and held my attention throughout. This is the kind of riding I like to read about, I've never been on such a ride, but it does place a spark in my 50 year old heart!
<br />The Girl in the book is a dream to a lot of riders, and it brings out some of our own imaginations too.
<br />
<br />I believe that you'll enjoy the book. I give it 5 Stars for entertainment, 5 Stars for story telling, and at times... 5 Stars for all the excitement.
<br />I have read it twice and picked up more the second time than the first. 
<br />
<br />Thanks Daniel Meyer for a most enjoyable book!</span>
