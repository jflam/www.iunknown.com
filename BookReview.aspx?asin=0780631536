                    <span>At first, I was a little apprehensive about "Boiler Room" thinking it was just gonna be "Wall Street: Part 2". I finally rented it on tape and loved it. One of this year's most underrated films, Boiler Room is a smart and energetic film with excellent performances from it's right cast. The film tells the story of Seth Davis, a decent college dropout earning a living by running a casino inside his house, much to the strong dismay of his frustrated judge father. In order to impress his dad, Seth takes on a job at a stock brokerage firm where he becomes a fast tracking stock broker and making good money. Only later does he find out that his job isn't what it's cracked up to be. The performances are strong, particularly from lead Ribisi and supporting characters Nicky Katt as a two faced co-worker, Ron Rifkin as his dad, and Scott Caan as a hotheaded co-worker. Vin Diesel does quite well as the good guy to Ribisi's Davis. The film definitely has the testosterone feel of a Generation X movie with The Angel's rap/classical score. There's even an homage to "Wall Street" that I don't want to spoil. If you're in the mood for a really good film, rent "Boiler Room". Look for the director Ben Younger in a cameo as a stock broker.</span>

                    <span>A fly-by-night stock brokerage selling bogus stocks to unsuspecting customers is the scene for this tale of greed as a young man, Seth, played by Giovanni Ribisi of "Wonder Years" fame, gets into the business. The tale of his rise, fall and eventual redemption kept me on the edge of my seat. There was so much action and excitement to the film that I didn't look at my watch once.<P>Seth also has a troubled relationship with his father, Ron Rifkin which was well crafted and moving. And a relationship with the Afro American receptionist, played by Nia Long which lacked the electricity to make it real. There's a cameo appearance of Ben Affleck as one of the brokers, but he is obviously just in this movie to give it a little star appeal.<P>The script is fast paced, and well developed, although I didn't quite understand all the stock broker terms. I didn't need to though; knew it was all a scam. There's also some Jewish-Italian ethnic jokes that seemed superfluous to the plot, especially since characters to whom they were directed seemed to be just as WASP as everyone else.<P>For pure entertainment, though, and a caustic look at this rather obscene interpretation of the American dream, check out this lively and interesting video.</span>

                    <span>If you think this movie was intelligent and the best stock market film I feel sorry for you. I can name ten better than this and even though this movie tries to become Wall Street for the 90's it incredibly falls short. Why? More than one reason. First of all the actors don't compare to those in Wall Street. Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas stole the show in Wall Street with fine, veteran acting. I didn't care for Charlie Sheen but even he was better than Giovanni Ribisi. Boiler Room was just another film thrown up to target a young audience. It has no point, no plot and the best actors were the ones shown the least. Jamie Kennedy, Nicky Katt, Ron Ripkin, Nia Long ( and the guy that played Harry ) were the sparks of the film. Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel's presence wasn't needed. Neither of them did anything of importance. All the actors in the world and the casting director picked Ribisi to be the lead? Especially when he's standing beside actors who would have played Seth ten times better? I can't see that. He may be a likeable supporting character but he wasn't strong enough to carry the role of Seth. I love interracial relationships but there is no way in the world a woman as beautiful as Nia Long would look at a room full of young men and fall for Giovanni Ribisi, who played Seth like a mindless dork.. Sorry, but I couldn't believe that. Seth was supposed to be this hustler yet he is so stupid he can't see that J.T. is a chop shop? Please! Anyway this is nothing to get hot for unless you like lackluster films that will only amount to " wannabe " status. Yes this is a wannabe Wall Street that never is or never will be. <P>Don't be fooled by the great soundtrack. They used hip hop to lure you into thinking this film was hip and trendy. Once you start to watch it you see it's nothing to get excited about.</span>

                    <span>What Wall Street did for the '80s, Boiler Room did for the 90's. With its wonderful cast and side plots, Boiler Room showed the shady world of the flourishing chop shops during the 90's boom. The father/son relationship Seth has is heart-wrenching as is the Abby's home situation. Many lessons are to be learned through this film. For one, regardless of how shady a company is, there do exist some people in these firms who either don't know what is going on or who really have no other choice. Secondly, stop worrying about trying to impress others (even family) it just may get you into trouble.</span>

                    <span>This movie surprise me.I liked how they use "Gecko"and it shows them watching Wall Street that was cool.The next best movie to Wall Street (Michael Douglas) in the stock market.<BR>Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) drops out of college and stumbles upon a job to be a stock broker to make all kinds of money, everything is going well, and he is doing great,but things seen to good to be true , as he finds out what he's got himself into.With actors such as Ribisi ,Vin Diesel,Nia Long , Scott Katt and Ben Affeck as (Jim Young) some what like Alex Badwin's part in Glengarry Glen Ross similar in arrogant roles.So set the sale and Enjoy!!!!</span>
