                    <span>I was lucky enough to see this 40 minute documentary in a huge IMAX theater last summer and it was unbelievable. Of course, you don't get the same effect with the dvd compared with the big IMAX screen, but this is still very entertaining to watch at home. While it is limited by the film's short length in telling the full story of Lewis and Clark's journey, what it perfectly captures is the majestic beauty of the American West that captivated the Corps of Discovery as it slowly moved towards the Pacific coast. And you at least get a great summary of their journey, including the major events that took place. After watching this short documentary, you should then see Ken Burn's epic, in-depth documentary "Lewis & Clark: the Journey of the Corps of Discovery". Bonus features for the standard edition dvd of "Lewis & Clark: Great Journey West" are a behind-the-scenes program on the making of the documentary, as well as an interactive map. This dvd is highly recommended for all history buffs!</span>

                    <span>This is in response to the_digital_dude's comments from July 1. The license will renew after it expires as long as the disc is in the drive. You can copy the WMV file to your computer and play it without the disc being in the drive as long as the license is active. After it expires, you will have to place the disc back in the drive and the license will be renewed. As far as I know, this is the way all of the Imax and National Geographic WMV-HD movies are. Unfortunately, one of the earlier WMV-HD movies, Terminator 2, required an active internet connection to acquire the license. I agree that the digital rights management is confusing to the consumer and really should be documented somewhere on the disc or packaging.</span>

                    <span>Please note that this film is terrific and rates five stars all the way!  I first saw it in an IMAX theater and then had to have it on DVD.  Read the favorable reviews of the movie itself to gain an appreciation of what makes it so great, even though it is regrettably very short considering the huge amount of effort that went into making it.  It's a timeless masterpiece for better understanding a cornerstone of the history of the United States.  Don't be surprised if you watch it a few times!<p>This review, however, is of the Special Edition DVD.  Disc 1 is the standard movie playable in a regular set top DVD player hooked up to your TV.  Disc 2, however, contains a high definition 720p version of the film for playback on a fast computer.  At first glance of the DVD cover and the generic instructions included inside, one realizes that a fairly recent and rather powerful PC is required.  Okay, for a fair number of us, that's not a problem, and it was not a problem in my case.  For those of you with a PC slower than 2.4Ghz, your computer doesn't even meet the minimum requirements.<p>So, I was fairly excited to see what such high definition playback looked like on my 2.8Ghz PC.  I noticed that there was no 1080p version of the film on the disc, as the generic instruction card inside the DVD case indicated, but I later realized that the instructions were indeed that, generic, and simply didn't apply to this particular title.  Okay, at this point, the documentation goes from bad to absolute crap extremely quickly.<p>Putting the disc into my DVD-ROM player began Autoplay.  Well, immediately an ActiveX control error appeared and suggested I look at www.wmvhd.com for a solution.  Actually, that website couldn't have any less technical support for this problem than if it had been written in Latin with a black pen on a black wall and viewed in pitch darkness.  Trudging through the Microsoft website links off the main WMVHD page gives precious little useful information, so after Googling on the problem for a while, I found out that this whole scenario is a Microsoft marketing ploy to sell its five-year-old Digital Rights Management scheme to content providers to eliminate media piracy.  Wow, talk about shooting the baby when dumping out the bath water.  This DRM anti-piracy product is downright draconian in its implementation.<p>Setting all ActiveX controls, cookies, and security/privacy settings to the lowest possible did not resolve the ActiveX error, nor did disabling my Anti-Virus, Firewall, or anti-Spyware software.  Hunting through the Microsoft Support Knowledgebase came up totally empty.  Good grief, is this technology ever poorly documented and supported even in house!<p>Well, after some more Googling, I finally found a piece of advice in an AV forum to just run the main movie file directly from Windows Media Player, but AFTER running the License Registration executable in the root of the DVD directory.  Running licgen.exe doesn't appear to do much at first, but apparently it will authorize the playback of the main movie file by unlocking the key encrypted within it.<p>Okay, at this point, surely one is thinking "Hey, I finally get to see this movie on DVD in high def on my PC".  Well, yes, you do, but here's the kicker:  THE PLAYBACK LICENSE EXPIRES IN 9 DAYS!!!  While the movie is playing in Windows Media Player and looking and sounding nice and pretty, right-click on the filename in the playlist column on the right of the screen and look at the License information.  Sure enough, you'll see that there is a limited duration playback period!  What in the world??????  Where was this stated on the DVD packaging anywhere?<p>Truly pondering if this scheme meant that disc 2 of this special edition amounted to some sort of a self-destructing DVD, I ran the license request executable the next day to see if the playback duration would get reset, but no, it didn't.<p>Keep in mind that none of these limitations are clearly documented anywhere in the online product description, on or in the DVD box, or even anywhere prominently on the WMVHD website.  However, if you dig far enough off of that website into the Microsoft sales information for why content providers should use DRM software, it becomes quickly apparent how very anti-consumer this anti-piracy scheme really is, especially as it concerns limiting the playback options for a movie DVD that is not at all advertised in good faith as having such restrictions.<p>So, whether or not this High Definition DVD ends up being a frisbie in a week remains to be seen, but the poor support and documentation in getting the movie to run in the first place only to learn that it may be self-destructing is absolutely inexcusable.  I wonder for this particular release if National Geographic even fully understands what they are selling here.<p>Again, the movie content itself is terrific.  This MS WMV HD DRM DVD, however, is beyond bizarre.</span>

                    <span>There is very little historical information in this DVD.  They omitted the number of persons that began the trip, the number of boats and they did they tell anything about what equipment and goods they took along.  It may be interesting for someone who never heard of Lewis and Clark nor heard anything about their journey but for the average person it is boring.  There are some good scenes along the way but they are generally out takes that do not fit in with the trip.  It appears to have been produced by someone that had little knowledge and little interest about the significance of the expedition.   National Geographic can do much better!</span>

                    <span>The photography is superb, and the action and sound are enough to keep viewers of all ages engaged.  As an Imax movie, this is designed for the eyes and ears, and towards those goal, it provides a great experience.  Don't purchase this with an expectation of learning much about history, however.  While the general course of the expedition is followed, the short length of the film severely limit the needed details to describe the journey.</span>
