                    <span>It's a relief that a book like this has been released. Newfield paints the truth about Guliani and is quite fair. Everything discussed in the book is based on fact and shows that Guliani, in reality, was nothing but a sub-par mayor who screwed New York City in numerous ways. Newfield admits that there is no denying that Guliani did a great job after the attacks on Sept. 11 - but that does not necessarily mean that all should be forgotten for his poor work as a mayor from the years before. Want to know the real Guliani? Read this book. You'll be amazed by the truth, whether Guliani wants you to hear it or not.</span>

                    <span>Jack Newfield, who wrote for the Village Voice for many many years, is one of the last of the great muckraking journaLists. They have been replaces by tabloid tv journalism,which is another story.This book takes on one of the recent myths of the new century,that of "americas mayor" Rudolph Guliani. Newfield straight away calls him a"c+ mayor",which is actually rather objective.Chapter by chapter,he brings up the screwy foibles of the Guliani years{his refusal to meet with any minority politicains,to gather votes for a compromise, outside of herman Badillo cost him control of the Board of Ed and led to cuts in education and no contract for the teachers for over 2 years}His bullying of anyone who didnt agree with him is well documented.Newfield acknowledges the great job that Guliani did for theose terribel two weeks in september of 2001,but states, convincingly that the work of his adminstartion must be judged from "september 10 and before" also. Mr Guliani has presedential aspirations, but his hubris and temper will be his undoing. this book shows how.And why. First rate!</span>

                    <span>For everyone who thinks Rudolph Giuliani is a hero and the savior of New York City, they should read Newfield's book.  It objectively tells the ugly truth about this deeply flawed man.</span>
