                <span id="Label1">In the 1940s, FDR was the first airborne president, flying several times in a C-54 nicknamed the "Sacred Cow." In the 1950s, it was aircraft known as "Independence," "Columbine II" and "Columbine III" that transported Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower on occasion. But it was not until after the Korean War, with the United States becoming the leader of the free world, that presidential air travel entered the modern age. The jet-age mobility of the American presidency beginning in the 1960s corresponds directly to the nation's emergence as a super power.   <P><b><i>Air Force One: The Aircraft that Shaped the Modern Presidency</I></b> is the story of the planes, the Presidents, their staff and, their many trips across the nation and around the globe. But it's also more than that-it is a vehicle for better understanding the activities and dealings of each presidential administration in the second half of the twentieth century. <b>Through vibrant photography, this book communicates the story of a unique set of planes and the presidents who made them a vital national asset.</b>  <P>Now all of these planes and their famous passengers have been captured. Written by Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum curator Von Hardesty and featuring over 200 illustrations, including new photos of the airplane' interiors, this book takes you on a memorable flight through history. Through insider accounts and from a unique vantage point on well-known political events, Hardesty shows how the presidency was transformed by the remarkable advances in aviation technology.  <P>The book's foreword is written by veteran CBS News broadcaster and best-selling author Bob Schieffer, who flew many times on Air Force One during the Ford and Carter administrations.</span>

                    <span>No symbol of American strength and progress says super power more vividly than Air Force One, the flying center of democratic government when our president travels. This informative and interesting book traces the history of chief executive flying from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush. Each president brought his own personality to the plane: John Kennedy was often hoisted in a steel cage to the entrance to avoid climbing the stairs with his ailing back; Richard Nixon preferred to remain isolated once aboard and seldom moved about the plane; Jimmy Carter used flights on Air Force One as a reward or inducement for congressional members' votes; Bill Clinton liked to pack the plane with political luminaries; in November Bush flew Air Force One into the heart of a hostile Baghdad to have Thanksgiving with our military in Iraq. There are numerous photographs and anecdotes about the plane and its place in history. There's also a foreword by broadcast journalist Bob Schiefer who was on board many flights in the Gerald Ford and Carter administrations.</span>

                    <span>This book would be of great interest to "presidential" buffs! There are wonderful, never before seen photos (at least to me)! I especially love the photo of President & Mrs. Reagan greeting their dog! However, I beleive the Reagans' dog was named "Rex" not Millie..as the caption states!</span>

                    <span>Van Hardesty brings a special expertise to this specialized aviation history by being the curator of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped The Modern Presidency is a reader engaging, informed and informative presentation on those advances in air travel which have affected the American Presidency and enabled America's leaders to make more and farther-ranging visits around the world. More than 260 color and archival photographs illustrate this absorbing story of the air vehicles that have served the American President in the twentieth century. Air Force One is a strongly recommended contribution to both Aviation History reference collections and American Political Science supplemental reading lists.</span>

                    <span>This is an interesting book both textually and visually. It shows how aviation made the Presidency a world office. Aviation buffs will enjoy the lineage of Presidential Aircraft and the inside and outside views. Much history occured on Air Force One and newsman Bob Schieffer presents some of the more historic moments for us. There is a table inside which shows how many assets and resources are necessary just to move the President of the United States which is an eye-opener. A fascinating book and a great gift idea for the holidays. It's one of those books that you'll look at again and again over the years.</span>

                    <span>AIR FORCE ONE by Von Hardesty is a terrific book about the presidential plane. Chocked full of interesting details about the planes, the presidents, the politics, the décor and even the dish behind each president from Roosevelt to George W. Bush, it is a book that gives the full picture of the most famous plane in the world. I recently saw Bob Schieffer (who wrote the foreword) of CBS's Face the Nation Fame talking about it on a television show and couldn't resist buying it when hearing the behind-the-scenes stories. I now have a better understanding about AIR FORCE ONE and its significance to our presidents. The book has many photos which capture the behind-the-scenes world of each president, first ladies, and their families and the key players who rode on the planes during historical visits such as Nixon's visit to China, Lyndon Johnson's swearing in as president following the tragic assassination of JFK . This book would make a great holiday gift, and I highly recommend it.</span>
