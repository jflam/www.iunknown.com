Why would I be asleep at this hour when I could be up repotting the azaleas?<br><br>&#191;Where are you?&#191; I ask, fumbling for the Brite-Lite clock on the night table to confirm that, yes, it&#191;s still two hours until my alarm goes off. &#191;Traveling?&#191;<br><br>&#191;L.A., darling,&#191; Lucy says. &#191;Working.&#191;<br><br>I knew that. When she&#191;s in New York, Lucy lives around the corner in a big Tudor house, but she regularly packs off to Burbank to produce glamorous TV shows. Being on the opposite coast causes her to sink into saying &#191;darling&#191; too much.<br><br>&#191;Everything okay?&#191; I ask, awake enough now for my worry genes to have kicked in.<br><br>&#191;Absolutely, yes,&#191; Lucy says as I hear what I swear is another champagne cork popping in the background. She bursts into giggles, covers the phone, and calls out, &#191;Watch it, darling!&#191;<br><br>&#191;What&#191;s going on there?&#191; I ask.<br><br>&#191;It&#191;s not what you think. We&#191;re rehearsing for a show and there&#191;s a scene with Dom Perignon. We&#191;re using real French champagne, even for the sound check.&#191;<br><br>French champagne. I sit up abruptly realizing that when the phone rang, I had been dreaming about Jacques, my very own Frenchman. We were lying naked, with our arms wrapped around each other at the edge of a warm, sunny beach. He was kissing me passionately as the waves lapped over us. Wait a minute. Didn&#191;t I see that same scene in some old movie? I put the phone down and notice the TV across the room is still flickering. I must have fallen asleep watching From Here to Eternity. Again.<br><br>&#191;Yoo-hoo, &#191; Lucy calls impatiently. &#191;Earth to Jess. You still with me?&#191;<br><br>I clear my throat. &#191;Jacques,&#191; I say. &#191;We were making love.&#191;<br><br>&#191;Jacques? Jacques is there?</span>

                    <span>Just finished The Botox Diaries! It was one of those books that I couldn't put down. Thank you for delivering a light, humorous read for the start of my summer!<P>The Botox Diaries was perfect for a mom on the move like me (and Jess and Lucy!). I could read a chapter, change the baby, read some more while he played in the sandbox,...pick up the mess, grab the girls from school,...read a little as I prepared dinner...bathe the kids, and then relax while reading in bed. I loved the characters and the humor. I found myself chuckling out loud and getting looks from my husband!<P>As I approach forty, and I look at the wrinkles forming around my eyes and my hands aging, I can't help wondering if I'd ever do botox! I think not. Like Jess, I'm a bit more "au naturelle".<P>Bravo to the authors! I'm passing the book along to my girlfriend, and telling all about it. I might even get my (60+)Mom to read it! This is a great beach or vacation book. I was very entertained!!!</span>

                    <span>The Botox Diaries is a fabulous book about two women in their forties, Jess and Lucy, which is breezy, fun and more. Lucy goes through a mid-life crisis and ends up in an affair with a famous TV star -whose name I just loved!- Hunter Green. Jess' French ex-husband, Jacques, has come back to New York and is chasing her again. The plot is fast paced and funny and you really end up caring about Jess and Lucy and their friendship. This is a fabulous book which is perfect for all of us who loved "The Devil Wears Prada" and "Sex and the City". LOVED IT.</span>

                    <span>Not that I was expecting "the next biggest thing" but I had hoped for a fun, light summer read. What I got what a dull book that I had to force myself to finish. Every now and then I like reading a "beach read".. something that's fun and flirty like The Devil Wears Prada or anything by Sophie Kinsella. This book is terrible. It drags on and I really didn't find there to be too much of an story to it. Pass on this one.</span>

                    <span>The Botox Diaries is a romp through midlife. Jessica Taylor is a single mother on the fringe of the "beautiful people". Jess's best friend Lucy Baldor, is a TV producer and Jess's work with the Art Council for Kids has her rubbing shoulders with the city's elite. Of course she also has her 11 year old daughter,Lily to keep up with. Lilly has decided her mom needs to marry again,and has taken steps to bring that man right to her doorstep. Jess might have been more aware of Lily's plotting except Lucy has announced she has taken a lover,Hunter Green, the game show host. Jess cannot believe that her best<BR>friend is willing to risk her marriage to Dan, the too good to be true husband and father. Lucy seems oblivious to the risk, diving headfirst into tantricsex, botox and unbelievable lingerie. Jess can only watch and hope the resulting disaster doesn't destroy their friendship. Oh, her former husband, Jacques is pleading with her to join him in Dubai. Will Jess<BR>find true love, or even, just a nonscarring date? Will she be able to talk Lucy into recognizing the treasure of a husband she has at home? What about the impending visit from Cosmo's hunk of the month? And the Arts Council is about to present My Fair Lady on Broadway with a grade school age cast. This is a delightful romp through the perils of the over 40's crowd. You'll either laugh or wince, but you'll never be bored. A great summer read.</span>
