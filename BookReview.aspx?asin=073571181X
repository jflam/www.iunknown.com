                    <span>Since the book was published in 2002 and I was working with Dreamweaver MX 2004 there were some differences in the directions and what I actually was able to do.  This could be the reason for so many differing oppinions on this book.  However once I was able to adjust from 2002 to 2004 we were off and running great.  <p>This book was able to fill in the blanks of what I already knew in web site design and taught me new advanced features; while teaching me Dreamweaver.  I am now sold on using Dreamweaver instead of just scripting all my code as I have been doing.  <p>This book has good structure and the ability to build each chapter in such a way that each level up seems easy and quick to master.  I would read the chapters and then follow the tutorial directions.  Each chapter felt as easy as the first even when I was learning completely new material.</span>

                    <span>I am an experienced JSP and PHP programmer. I recently need to do some web design by myself. I have dreamweaver installed on my computer for a long time, but have never go a chance to explore the rich capabilities of this software. So I bought this book as a used one from Amazon market place for $11.<p>To my surprise, this turns out to be a very good book. Not only does it explains practical uses of the software, it teaches design principles as well. I spent 1 whole day and I finished 500 pages already. Most of examples are easy to follow. I think within 3 days, I should be able to work smoothly with Dreamweaver. <p>To whoever still doing handcoding HTML, I recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm not new to HTML, CSS or webwriting, but new to Dreamweaver. This book is literally littered with errors, mistakes and other incorrectnesses. It doesn't look like the proof reader had a bad day; he simply wasn't there! The single chapter about CSS alone is worth looking at other books. It [is not good] is a major understatement. Better look at an online free tutorial for that chapter. <br>Ms. Gutman knows here stuff, so much is clear. But being a teacher is a different profession, and not all can do that. Ms. Gutman clearly can't. A less experienced writer with better teaching skills could do a much better job. I'm currently trying to negotiate a refund from the publisher. I rate this book that bad. <br>I bougth it because it has ASP, ASP.NET and PHP tutorials.Had these been absent, I would have gone for the Dreamweaver MX bible. A MUCH better choice. <p>I rate it one star, because lower is not possible.</span>

                    <span>Don't be fooled by people who may have read "Inside Dreamweaver MX" but didn't actually follow any of the step-by-step instructions. The three authors must have written the book using a beta version of Dreamweaver MX. Numerous commands that you are instructed to choose simply aren't there. Also, files you are instructed to copy from the CD aren't there or you have to be creative because the reference in the book doesn't match the name of the file on the CD.<p>It is painfully apparent that the collaborative efforts of the three authors failed (in my opinion). As a technical writer/web designer who is an expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but new to Dreamweaver, I read very carefully and follow instructions. When they repeatedly don't work as written, I place the book along with the others in my archives (I don't have the audacity to sell the used, poorly written copy to some unsuspecting fool on Amazon[.com] or eBay).<p>Bottom line? If you buy this book, open the package and immediately put it into the strongest vice you have. When you're through compressing the ten-pound volume, you might end up with one pound of accurate information. The last book of this magnitude that I bought online had 26 pages of errata on their website. <p>In summary, for those of you who are appalled because you gave "Inside Dreamweaver MX" 5 stars, my advice to you is, "follow some of the step-by-step instructions" and maybe you will feel my pain.</span>

                    <span>Although mainly written for the beginning Web design student, I found this book to be a fun review of my own roots in basic HTML and the Web, in general.  Also, being new to Dreamweaver's way of doing things, I found the book to be a complete and thorough walk-through of Dreamweaver's every feature.<p>I enjoy books that take you step-by-step through the process of a thing.  Inside Dreamweaver is a great example of that.  Each chapter lays the groundwork for chapters to come.  At the same time, each chapter (after introductory chapters are out of the way) gives repeated opportunity to learn and solidify skills by doing a fun example.  <p>A fun example?  Yeah!  I had fun.  At least one of the authors (maybe more) has a true flair for simple, yet attractive designs.  I've been designing Websites and Web applications (in other programs) for 5 years and I enjoyed the "silent" review of simple design concepts presented-not in words-but in the "good" designs themselves.<p>I'm glad to see a book, like this instruct it's readers in correct practices.  I meet allot of Webmasters who have "known" HTML for years, yet struggle with the "new" standards, such as XHTML 1.0.  I scratch my head at this.  Not much has changed!  Only now the standards are enforced and deprecated code will fail.  I've been a big believer in standards compliance since first reading "HTML 4.0 - No Experience Required (Sybex)".  And now it's nice to see another book, "Inside Dreamweaver", perform the same service to it's readers by letting them know what is and is not recommended.<p>"Inside Dreamweaver" will instill confidence in the beginning student and provide reliable and accurate review of sound Web design principles for both the new and veteran Webmaster.</span>
