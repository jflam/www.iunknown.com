                <span id="Label1">Due to the success of his first campaign involving the  <I>Amulet of Samarkand</I>,  Nathaniel, now fourteen, has been appointed the youngest representative ever to the Office of Internal Affairs, and has been devising traps to capture members of the Resistance--a secretive group of commoners who are determined to undermine the ruling class of magicians. When a magic-sapping Golem&#146;s surprise first attack is labeled an act of Resistance terrorism, Nathaniel reluctantly summons Bartimaeus for help. Meanwhile, a zealous young member of the Resistance, Kitty Jones, is planning to rob the sacred tomb of the great magician Gladstone, and turn the power of his buried magical instruments against the spell makers. The towering clay Golem and its shadowy master unites the destinies of Nathaniel, Bartimaeus, and Kitty together in one fateful night--unfortunately, that night is much too slow in coming. Stroud&#146;s second book is far too long and gloomy, focusing more on the priggish Nathaniel and wronged Kitty than the dijinni readers have come to adore. Fans of Jonathan Stroud&#146;s breakout hit, <I>The Amulet of Samarkand</I>, may be a little disappointed to discover that Bartimaeus features so little his second book. While Stroud cleverly uses the class war between the ruling magicians and the disgruntled commoners as a metaphor for current political and social clashes, the text suffers overall from a lack of the dijinni&#146;s famous facetious footnotes. Avid fans are left skimming the slow parts and hoping that when Bartimaeus escapes his servile bonds he will be given more space to make them laugh. <I>--Jennifer Hubert</I></span>

                    <span>In the second book of the Bartimaeus trilogy, the sequel to The Amulet of Samarkand, Nathaniel, a young magician, summons the powerful, wise-cracking djinni, Bartimaeus to help him track down an evil golem making random attacks on London. This incredible adventure takes them on a chase after a skeleton, an encounter with the Night Police, and eventually leads them to the dreaded golem and the shocking truth behind his power. A magical adventure that will keep you gasping and laughing to the last page! </span>

                    <span>After the reading the first book I could not wait for the second one to come out and boy was I dissapointed. The story drags on and on the story gose no were. I like the character Kitty's story it was intersting and fast paced full of tiwst and turns but Nathanal and Bartimaeus story was so boring. It wasent great but it was o.k I still cant wait to read the last book.</span>

                    <span>This book, like the first in the trilogy (the amulet of Samarkand) is a very deep and well-developed book. There are so many fantasy books out there that I thought the genre was worn dry...that was until I discovered "The Barimaeus Trilogy". It is highly original. Magicians, demons, and fantasy, set in modern-day London.
<br />
<br />This book also has a very strong and unique plot; involving depth that really shocks the reader. At first I thought it was typical mythology, (by the cover art-which is great, by the way), but once I was absorbed in reading this, I lost all thoughts of that.
<br />
<br />This book also has some great character development. Perhaps not as much as the first book, but it's definitely there. I love the author, Jonathan Stroud's, amazing sense of seriousness in the story, yet also his humor. 
<br />
<br />I was a bit disappointed in the lack of Bartemaus (it is the Bartemaus trilogy). He was there, but not as much as some characters and not as in-depth as the previous novel.
<br />
<br />This book was great and I highly recommend it. I'd buy it, if I were you...I did. I would also suggest reading the first book first. Not a necessity, but helpful. 
<br />

                    <span>I enjoyed the first book of the Bartimaeus Trilogy, but I have to admit to being disappointed in the second installment.  Mr. Stroud receives high marks for a well-conceived world with a believable history (except for the bit about the Americas...not sure I buy the 'uninhabited wasteland').  Where his story fails is in his lack of likable characters.  I found little to admire in any of the characters in this book, even Kitty, who was far and away my favorite.  As many others have said, there is little sense of urgency about any of the events in the book, and I found myself looking forward to the bits narrated by Bartimaeus (even if it meant I had to put up with Nathaniel as well) simply to relieve the humdrum of the plot.  Having said all that, there are hints that things will turn around in the final installment, and I will most likely read it--once the library gets a copy, that is.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book and would have given it 5 stars.  However, I think the author could have used Bartimaeus more in the dialogue.  He wasn't developed enough in this book.  There wasn't enough interaction between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel, and too much time on Nathaniel's job in the government.  All in all it was a good read.  I stayed up late for several nights reading it.</span>
