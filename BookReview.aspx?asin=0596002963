                    <span>I am generally a fan of Pocket References.  But this one seems poorly debugged.  One example is claiming &#34;align&#34; is deprecated for &#60;td&#62;.  Turns out, this bug has made it onto the Errata page for the book
<br />
<br />  http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/htmlpr2/errata/  ,
<br />
<br />but only under &#34;Unconfirmed error reports and comments from readers.&#34;  If you write a buggy book, at least do the work to confirm bugs and fix them in new printings!</span>

                    <span>If you are designing web pages, you must have this book.  That is all there is to it.  <p>This is a small compact reference book (hence the title) which lists the HTML tags in alphabetical order, shows if they are supported by the three major browsers (IE,NN,Opera) and if they are part of the w3c spec HTML 4.01.  Information is given for the applicable attributes for each tag.<p>Once you know it (especially if you follow w3c standards) HTML is a simple and easy language to use.. however, having a easy to use reference comes in handy quite frequently, especially when starting up a new site.  <p>This will not be the only reference you need.. no book can claim that.  Though everybody who designs websites should have this book, those new to HTML may find it the most helpful most frequently.  However, this book will NOT teach you HTML.  It is a reference.. nothing more.<p>as mentioned in other reviews.. the IMG tag is missing, which is a major flaw, but not major enough to take away from the greatness of this book.<p>In short.. get it.</span>

                    <span>This is the best compact reference for HTML there is. There is only one minor error in it. As another reviewer mentioned, it does not include documentation for the IMG tag. However, for the audience this book appeals to (people who know the language well, but can't remember every tag and all their exact handlers and attributes, etc.), it does not need support for it as any person who knows much about HTML knows most everything about <IMG>.<br>   Overall, it gets 5 stars!<p>Michael Pipolo<p>13-year-old Programmer<br>Visual Basic, Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, Perl, CGI</span>

                    <span>There may be a few errors, like the missing <IMG> tag, but the errata list on the O'Reilly site has the information posted.  The rest of the book is so good that I'm fine with plugging in the missing information myself.  I love how it's set up as one big alphabetical list of tags.  It makes it so easy to find what you want.  I have been using it lately to check tags for browser compatibility.  Saves so much time to quick turn to a page in this small book, rather than search big books or websites for compatibility info!</span>
