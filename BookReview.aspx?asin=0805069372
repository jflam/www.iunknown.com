                    <span>It hasn't been hard to notice that John Adams's reputation has been undergoing a serious rehabilitation in recent years.  Joseph Ellis in particular has been dedicated to revising our understandings of both Adams and his nemesis/friend Thomas Jefferson.  In his PASSIONATE SAGE:  THE CHARACTER AND LEGACY OF JOHN ADAMS, FOUNDING BROTHERS: THE REVOLUTIONARY GENERATION, and AMERICAN SPHINX: THE CHARACTER OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, Ellis has been challenging a long established scenario in which the arch conservative John Adams was pitted against the populist liberal Thomas Jefferson for the political destiny of America, and the hero Jefferson triumphed over the mildly villainous Adams.  Ellis has been questioning whether any part of this scenario makes any sense, whether Adams is at all a villain, and whether Jefferson is nearly as heroic.  He has done this not by asserting the virtues of conservativism, but whether Adams has been correctly understood at all, both by his contemporaries and by subsequent generations.  This reevaluation of Adams was continued by the spectacular and unanticipated mega-bestseller by David McCullough of 2001.  This process of reassessment is clearly carried forward by John Patrick Diggins.  For the record, I find the rehabilitation of Adams by these and other writers to be both welcome and highly convincing.
<br />
<br />For two hundred years, our view of Adams came very much through the lenses of his critics and opponents.  The truism that history is written from the standpoint of the victors is perhaps truer of Adams than any other major political figure in United States history.  Adams was said to be a closet monarchist, a favorer of aristocracy.  In the face of this criticism, Adams explicitly challenged Jefferson to point to a single passage in any of his writings that endorses monarchy or aristocracy.  In fact, if one reads extensively in Adams works, as argued by Ellis, Diggins, and McCullough, one finds instead a powerful and subtle critique of the dangers of the development and influence of an economic elite, placing him at the opposite extreme of Alexander Hamilton, whose ideal of government came very close to the espousal of plutocracy.  Adams did hope for the emergence of natural elites, but this was based on ability and character, not on wealth.  Contained in the reassessment of Adams is implied a questioning of whether Adams is the arch conservative he is often portrayed as being.  The case for Adams's conservativism is based largely on his belief in monarchism, his favoring aristocracy, his support for a bicameral Congress, his looking to the past for guidance, and his opposition to the French Revolution.  As these authors have shown, Adams transparently did not favor monarchy or the growth of an aristocratic class and a bicameral legislature in the United States has not resulted in the Senate being a sort of House of Lords.  Today many leftist historians have found grounds for critiquing the French Revolution, and a host of leftist political figures have found inspiration for their beliefs in the past (not least Karl Marx, who was a student of the Greeks and Romans).  Furthermore, Adams was hardly a passionate capitalist, and was suspicious of a life devoted to the acquisition of wealth.  In fact, if you compare Adams and Jefferson to that modern conservative icon Ronald Reagan, it is hard to find many issues that Adams would not differ sharply on from Reagan, while one can see a number of points of contact between Adams and Reagan.  Diggins, in fact, finds numerous points of contact between Adams's political writings and many French radical writers of the late 20th century.  I will say that as a leftist myself, I find much to love in Adams's thought.  I share his fear of the negative effects that economic elites have on the democratic process, his belief in the need for a strong central government to protect citizens from  the pernicious influence of greed (Adams would understand my fear of deregulation), and his instincts that government rather than less or no government is a better safeguard of individual liberty.  Diggins rightly states that the American president who would most closely incarnate Adams's principles would be Teddy Roosevelt, who envisioned government as the means of breaking trusts and promoting economic justice.
<br />
<br />Of all the books in the Schlesinger series on the American presidents, this is probably the one that I found most provocative intellectually.  It is a dense, rich book, in large part because Diggins focuses more on the thought of Adams than his life.   Diggins is more intent on explaining Adams ideas than the various events in his life.  In one sense this is a weakness as a biography, but because his discussion of Adams's ideas is so clear and interesting, it more than makes up for the lack of biographical detail.  I do regret some of the sketchiness of the biographical narrative.  For instance, he doesn't' deal in any detail on how Adams became either vice president or president.  This contrasts sharply with the rather deep discussion of Adams's ideas.  This is in line with Diggins's role as apologist for Adams.  On the purely historical side, most of Diggins's effort is put into dispelling the myth that the election of 1800 represented the defeat of Federalism by Republicanism (that's Jeffersonian Republicanism, not what we associate today with the GOP).  I personally found this section less interesting that the sections dealing with Adams's thought.
<br />
<br />I would strongly encourage anyone reading this volume to consider picking up the new volume THE PORTABLE JOHN ADAMS, edited by Diggins.  I completely agree with Diggins that Adams's writings are more interesting than his presidency, and that he may be the most unjustly neglected political writer in American history.  This new volume contains a wide ranging collection of his writings, not merely from his theoretical writings, but his diaries and letters as well.</span>

                    <span>To start with and to avoid disappointment for those looking for something other than what this is, some of the trade reviews are just plain wrong: this is not a biography focusing on Adams childhood and youth.  In fact, it isn't really a biography at all.  What it is is a short, to the point but nevertheless fairly deep analysis of Adams' political thought with a particular emphasis on the politics of his presidential administration.  It is written from a very positive view point (one shared by David McCullough) and from a view point that is quite hostile to Thomas Jefferson.  As such it is an invaluable read for anyone interested in the development of presidential politics in America as well as anyone seeking the "rest of the story" regarding Adams, Jefferson, and their relationship.</span>
