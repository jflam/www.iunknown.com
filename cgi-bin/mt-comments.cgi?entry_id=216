<p>Thank you John for your well thought out and clear response.</p>

<p>Just a thought but how about making the project opensource John?</p>

<p>I'm thinking about it. Unfortunately, I just don't have the cycles to clean up the code and write the docs so that someone can actually start building stuff on top of it. Sam can vouch for this - installing it and getting it running is really nasty. But it is on the list of things that I'd like to do.</p>

<p>Thats what I was thinking, if you can't find the code a new home, release it to the wild.<br />
If you do decide on opensourcing the code, and don't plan on being the maintainer, you could "audition" some hopefuls by getting them to help clean the code and write the docs.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, Dave. I'll think about doing this once I get some cycles. March is shaping up to be a real busy month ...</p>

<p>With test driven design and usage of MockObjects (perhaps provided by the API designers)  you can flush out incorrect API usage at unit test time.</p>

<p>I am interested in applying AOP to security. John, would you provide more information for me to find those companies in this area? I just want to find more references. By now,I just know of "New Aspects of Security":<br />
http://www.newaspects.com/</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've completed an pull-aspect engine using Proxy, but have not been able to use it due to the fact that I can only access MarshalByRef objects with it. I need to update my engine to handle any object type I require, and thus I think I need to hook into Profiler like you did. However, I've had a look and found it daunting. Have you got any docs/examples which I can use to get going?</p>
