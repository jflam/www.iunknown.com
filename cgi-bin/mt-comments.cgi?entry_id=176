<p>Very sexy. But are you going to be able to get used to a single-button mouse ? </p>

<p>Actually, you can use a Microsoft Intellimouse with OS X. Most of the Apple apps don't use the right mouse button, but all MS apps do (like IE and Office X).<br />
The downside is that there isn't a right mouse button on the Powerbook itself. I'll have to get use to the OPTION(?) click pattern for activating a context menu.</p>

<p>No. I thought the 1 year warranty would do. Should I have?</p>

<p>No, you will now get to SEE my Mac, which should hasten the assimilation process </p>

<p>John, first of all congratulations, It is a very sexy machine! I am very looking forward to hear your future experiences with the powerbook. Especially how you productive you will be on the mac compared to your windows boxes<br />
About a year and a half ago I bought the 450 MHz version. I had the excuse that I needed a Unix machine that was non-Intel. There will be moments when I pick it up and will just love it again, but frequently it will not last longer than an evening before I get frustrated again. Whether it is the networking, the server access, the apps, I never seem to get the same productivity level as on XP, even though I used to be a Unix guru. And in the end my Thinkpad wins once more. <br />
I am curious to see whether it is something personal or if others have the same experiences.<br />
BTW For all the praise Apple is getting for their hardware, wouldn't you have expected some more video ram and a higher resolution display?</p>

<p>Let me correct myself, your machine has much better video processor than mine and a heck of a lot more video ram (32 MB ddr). I didn't look at the specs.<br />
Cheers,</p>

AppleCare:  I don't know if you should have, I was just curious.  I am planning on buying an ibook, but I don't think I will go with the AppleCare either.</p>

<p>Thanks, Werner. I'm going to hang out over the holiday's with my friend who's the product manager for ATI's All-In-Wonder RADEON card. I'm going to see whether he can point me to the right guy at ATI who would know just how much more effective the Mobility RADEON 9000 card is at accelerating 2D graphics. It's almost impossible to find benchmarks for 2D graphics these days, especially in the PC world where everyone's obsessed with gaming performance.</p>
