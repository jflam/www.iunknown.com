<p>The .pdf doesn't render correctly in OS X 10.3's preview tool.  All the fonts are messed up and look like boxes.  I'm sure you'll fix the problem if you update your powerbook but I'd thought I'd let you know.</p>

<p>You simply _have_ to write something to take a csproj file and create a task.  There is _no way_ I want to go and edit a build task when someone adds a source file to their project.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads-up, Gerry. Another friend of mine who has a Mac seems to have the same problem. But my TiBook renders it fine. I'll have to look around and see if I can figure out what's causing it. It might be something funny that Ghostscript is doing, which might force me to go back to using Acrobat ...</p>

<p>Rick, can you wait a week? I promise that I'll demonstrate a solution then!</p>

<p>Just so you know, it doesn't display correctly in Acrobat for Pocket PC.</p>

<p>Nice article !</p>

<p>Also liked your idea of presenting info in landscape 4:3 layout. Been wondering myself lately ... all such pages/articles/newsletters should have a print layout option seprately ... i like informIT.com in this respect ... MSDN articles that run into sections should have a similar option on the main page giving you an option to print the entire article with its subsections in print layout (along with code snippets if possible/relevant) ... the option that is there on MSDN right now lets you print ... but only the current page ... should be more like informIT ...</p>

<p>John: I tried getting the same layout for mypages using distiller but am still not able to ... which tool are you using for formatting and presenting it that way ... even the acrobat toolbar doesn't appear in IE when i open your newsletter (which is a good thing according to me) ... Request: You could probably present a primer on that too ... about hwo to optimise the size/layout of the presented information ...</p>

<p>Wow! It's great!!!</p>

<p>You've describe, how to build release and debug versions at the same time, but I believe, that in real build script it is almost impossible to do the things that way. The reason for this is that a person writing the build script usually wants to use dependencies rather than direct forced calls. And you surely can't force dependent target execution. Thus, in complicated build scripts it is almost impossible to build different configurations of a product without duplication.</p>

<p>Sigh...</p>

<p>Perhaps it's a font embedding issue.</p>

<p>Hi could someone please give me a link to an ASP.NET build example preferable using C#.<br />
