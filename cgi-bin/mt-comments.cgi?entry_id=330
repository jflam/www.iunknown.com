<p>The ability to use a loopback terminal server is really nice, but a major problem with running a server OS is the licencing issues with so much third-party software that refuses to install.</p>

<p>An even bigger problem (for me) are the apps that don't function correctly under a regular user account. </p>

<p>Well, I had to repave a week ago, and decided to give Win 2003 a chance and finally make the switch to running as a non-admin. Things have mostly been going smoothly, although I did have to hack the registry to make Terminal Services find my local Licensing Server and not the domain-wide 2000 Server. I also had to *telephone* the Microsoft Clearinghouse in order to get an activation code that would work with our Certified Partner volume license.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am now temporarily back to running as an admin because I haven't found a reasonable solution to debugging ASP.NET web applications from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I could let ASP.NET run under my user account, but I don't want to do that as that would reintroduce a mismatch between the development environment and the testing and production environments. That's a big deal, as the whole point of running as a non-admin (for me, anyway) is to eliminate such mismatches.</p>

<p>The other thing I am supposed to be able to do is to grant myself the SeDebugPrivilege, which supposedly is the same as turning on the "Debug programs" user right. This isn't ideal either, as I am slowly morphing into an administrator again, but it's not such a big deal, as the debugging privilege is not one that is likely to be a point of conflict when non-privileged users are running my applications. However, it doesn't work. I am logging out and back in, but I still get the "Access denied" message when trying to debug a web app.</p>

<p>The third way of solving this problem is to simply fire up Visual Studio from my admin Terminal Services client whenever I need to debug, but come on. That is far more of a productivity restriction than I am willing to accept.</p>

<p>So at the moment, I am back to running as an admin. I'd be very interested in hearing how others have tackled this problem. Are you all happy running ASP.NET under your personal accounts?</p>
