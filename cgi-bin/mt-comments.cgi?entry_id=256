<div class="comments-body">
<p>Oh, jesus. You are incredible. Almost the same environment (win2000 domain with 2 DCs and about 400 workstations) and I've spent the last two weeks trying to find the reason why my new 2003 server could not be upgraded to a DC. Your tip saved my ass. Be well my friend.</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Was starting to be convinced that it was impossible to add a 2003 server to our SBS 2000 environment.  Went through all the adprep/inetorgperson stuff for win2k / exchange2k but was severely hung up here with no help to be found from MS or anyone else -- except here.  Sure this situ will be common as more folks migrate to 2k3, thanks again for the assist.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem.  I have a W2003 AD setup and I want to add a W2000 server as a DC.  Whenever I try a dcpromo I get the error:</p>

<p><br />
Active Directory Installation Failed</p>

<p>An ldap read of operational attributes from the server SERVERNAME.DOMAIN.CO.UK failed.</p>

<p>"An error occcured while installing the directory service. For more information see the event log"</p>

<p>**The 'SERVERNAME' is the name of the server currently hosting the AD, running W2003.</p>

<p><br />
There is nothing in the event log.  I have tried the 'Trust computer for delegation' and yet when the dcpromo fails the check box is unchecked again on the 2003 AD server.  </p>

<p>I have been told on a discussion board that it is not possible to run a 2000 DC in a 2003 Domain, howwever I don't believe this.  Any advice or help would be appreciated</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>This fixed a major problem here.</p>

<p>No Server 2003 involved, but it's currently 2:30am, and we had a problem about two hours ago promoting a 2000 server into our 2000 domain.  </p>

<p>THANK YOU!</p>

<p>I still don't know if I can sefely run Adprep on my SBS2K and install a second DC runing win 2003. Is there some issue with Exchange 2000 running on the same box?<br />
Someone said you have to run some AD 'fix' on the SBS2K box after running Adprep.<br />
I have installed a number of DC's running Win2K3 in Win2K forest without any problems! (honest!!)</p>

<p>Thank you so very much, I had the same problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't delegate trust the to to-be DC (Even as Domain/Enterprise Admin).  Fortunately, I checked out kb 23070 and fixed the issue in default domain controller policy and it worked!  dcpromo just finished.  THANKS!</p>

<p>I have a single domain network in which I am going to be replacing our Windows 2000 server DC with a Windows 2003 Server DC, the problem is my boss configured the new 2003 Server as a DC on a completely new domain.  We are not going to be using the 2000 machine once this is completed but we want to retain the original domain name on the 2003 server.  What do I need to do to enable the 2003 Server to be the DC on the existing domain?</p>

<p>Dude!!! I can't put into words my thanks!! We literally searched for four hours using Microsoft's support site, Google et al to find out why we were getting errors when trying to make a 2003 server a DC in a 2000 domain. Needless to say we found nothingf at either place. We were seriously going to go deep into the bowels of the machine when I stumbled upona  link to this tip. First we verified we were having the same problems by trying to trust the 2003 machine for delegation. Once that failed I knew we were on the right track. After making the changes you posted, voila!! we now have a 2003 DC in a 2000 domain.<br />
Many, many thanks!<br />
You should demand Microsoft put a link to your tip here (their KB article 232070 title is a little misleading).<br />
Thanks aagin. I now have your site set as a favorite!!</p>
