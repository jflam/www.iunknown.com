<p>Cute picture reinforcing the fact that I think all the labradors we've had have been chewers to various degrees as puppies. They're so much hard work at this age and yet so rewardingly cuddly.<br />
Make the most of it because it doesn't take long before they're too big to sit on your lap, or if they're like my 7 year old border collie, too big to sit on your lap and you still be able to see to type and read the screen ;o).</p>

<p>Our black lab spent plenty of time chewing on our children, almost to the point of exile. It took about 6 months before she stopped "getting into trouble". She's now about 13 months old and what we consider the perfect dog! Just a little advice, hang in there. </p>

<p>Ahhh... the joys of new puppy ownership.  It took us about 5 months before our new terrier stoped waking me up between 2-4 am to go out...<br />
Glad she has out grown that... and thank *god* for the crate =)<br />
Enjoy</p>

<p>Why oh why isn't Ramses (our beloved Labrador) still not clean (he's nearly 20month already)... We had him when he was like 4 month old, might be the reason...<br />
However, lemme state that having a huge labrador on his lap with dual screen is not feasible. That's why i have my feets on him when coding <br />
I should post pictures of Ramses and lady (our second dog) on my blog too...<br />
Is that a coder thing about having labradors and dual screens??<br />

<p>congrats! I just got a black lab puppy in Oct 2003 she's now about 8mos. old and loves to bark chew and be a lil monster in general. Will she ever grow out of it? She's driving me crazy. She is definately full of energy and smart enough to blatently disobey me if she thinks she can get away w/ it. Any suggestions?</p>
