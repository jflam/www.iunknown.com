<p>>I learned an awful lot about how to do cool >things to impress my friends, like dynamically >injecting IL code into running assemblies.</p>

<p>That sounds really great. Could you share with us a bit of that code? It would be nice.<br />
Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>"one of being able to build technology-neutral abstractions. You create a domain language that models a particular problem domain, and you write code generators that target specific implementation technologies"</p>

<p>Have you seen OMG's Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) work?  http://www.omg.org/mda</p>

<p>MDA defines Platform Independent Models (PIMs) and Platform Specific Models (PSMs).  The idea is that the business analyst can model the business process as a PIM.  A technology wonk defines patterns that transform the PIM into a PSM.  An application architect customizes the PSM to handle specializations that aren't in the pattern.  The technology wonk also defines patterns that transform the PSM into working code.  A developer then customizes the code as necessary, such as making it conform to your company's standard look and feel. </p>

<p>In the case of our OptimalJ tool, we give you a bunch of patterns.  You can add your own as well if you wish.  Patterns are a good place to capture boiler plate code.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the heads-up on the MDA stuff, Ken! It was on my list of things to do, but I had initially dismissed it as "yet another UML modelling tool". I'm going to look into it on a lot more detail this weekend as I plan on curling up with at least one MDA book :)</p>

<p>Ahh, an issue close to my heart:</p>

<p>Craig: >><br />
a whole app in zero lines of code being the ultimate experience. Obviously I’m exaggerating, but I think the phenomenon of seeking to do things with fewer and fewer lines of code is a real one&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Although I didn't get on the AOP bandwagon, I do have strong feelings about code generation.  I hate it!  Our motto at Couloir is: If you know enough to generate code, you know enough NOT to.  In fact, at Couloir, we have managed to create significant applications without ANY source code.</p>

<p>But then how do you debug that code, Gunnar?</p>

I'm very interested in your case study.  Have you already finished (a part of) the generated version?</p>
