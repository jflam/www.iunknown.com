<div class="comments-body">
<p>I felt like I was reading something I did when I read your woes with VMWare. I have VMWare installed on a Windows XP host, but I think I worked because I imaged the entire drive onto a large hard drive on my thinkpad think I swapped them.  Installing Server wasn't easy though.  Even though it is a bootable CD, the system would not recognize it.  I did something weird.  I "viewed" the CD in explorer in the host, copied the setup files into a folder(that I created) in the VMWare directory and then tried it again and it worked! (At least that's what I remember doing...doh!)  Anyway, a friend of mine is not having the same exact problem.  I am going to print your woes and solution and have it handy for when she comes over with her think pad.<br />
Please write some more and your solutions.</p>
