<p>That is an *awesome* picture!! They were here in Chicago for the air & water show earlier in August. Buzzing the skyline & all. They did make a bit of a scare at a cubs game when a pilot came in and made a big boom over the ballpark.</p>

<p>The Thunderbirds were last here in Toronto a few years back. I was at the Skydome watching a Jays game and they did the same buzzing the ballpark trick. The dome was open, and forms a half-shell on the North side of the ballpark. The F16 flew *into* the dome and pulled up into a vertical climb right over the center of the field in front of the open dome. I would swear that he was below the top of the dome when he flew into the stadium. Unbelieveable!</p>

<p>Not bad...  I would have preferred a shot of the Snowbirds, mind you.  You know, as a Canadian and all ;)</p>

<p>Sheesh ... everyone's a critic :) I have some Snowbirds shots, but they aren't anywhere near as interesting as this one. Mostly because they flew in formation past the west of my building which means that you can only get sky in the background. I'll see if I can bring myself to post one of those shots.</p>
