<p>I got it to compile under VS7 (aka VS.NET), but I did have to copy some files around to make the libero makefile happy. I'm certain it could be fixed by modifying a path, but frankly, I'm too lazy to climb through someone else's makefile. For those of you who'd like to join me in my decadence, here's the list of files that need to be copied to the Microsoft Visual Studio .NETVc7lib folder:<br />
uuid.lib<br />
mpr.lib<br />
winmm.lib<br />
wsock32.lib<br />
odbc32.lib<br />
shell32.lib<br />
netapi32.lib<br />
advapi32.lib<br />
comdlg32.lib<br />
gdi32.lib<br />
user32.lib<br />
If I find myself with some free time, I'll noodle out where the path needs to be modified.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip, Andy! I see that you have more patience than me </p>

<p>it seems to me that you can use GSLgen commecrially as long as you aren't modifying its code, or directly linking its code into your software.  if you are modifying the GSLgen source (or linking), and distributing these modifications, then you would need to either provide the modified source (thus conforming to the GPL) or purchase a commercial license.<br />
under the GPL, you can freely redistribute unmodified source or binaries.  this means the GSLgen command line tool can be used (and distributed) commercially, as long as it remains unmodified.</p>

<p>Thanks, Dave! I still haven't heard back from the imatix folks about their take on the license, but I agree with your interpretation of the license.</p>

<p>FWIW, I spent a few more minutes spelunking into this, and the modifications needed will be more than just modifying a path in a file--the dependence on the appropriate libraries being in a "lib" subdirectory off the VC7 directory is fairly widely scattered, along with a couple of other, smaller issues.  Andy Hopper's got the right idea .  Extra cool points for using hard links though....</p>

<p>I don't know why your emails did not reach me, but probably the amount of spam we get has something to do with it.  </p>

<p>David Lee is correct, GSL's license has no impact on the work you produce with it, only on derived tools that incorporate GSL in some way - e.g. DLLs, modified versions, etc.  This is pretty standard and we chose this route because we want our software to be freely used but without giving our commercial competitors a free ride.</p>

<p>Anyone making commercial code generators that reuse GSL code has to pay for a license.  Everyone else (those making GPL'd derivations and those using GSL to generate code) have nothing to do except enjoy the technology.<br />

<p>I have read (several times) the documentation on GSLgen, however I would like some examples. I am trying to generate SQL stored procedures with GSLgen and I need to use the index and count built in functions. My problem is understanding scope definitions.</p>

<p>Can you give me any examples or direct me to some?<br />
Thanks<br />
