                <span id="Label1"><p>From airport terminals decorated like Starbucks to the popularity of hair dye among teenage boys, one thing is clear: we have entered the Age of Aesthetics. Sensory appeals are everywhere, and they are intensifying, radically changing how Americans live and work. </p><p>We expect every strip mall and city block to offer designer coffee, a copy shop with do-it-yourself graphics workstations, and a nail salon for manicures on demand. Every startup, product, or public space calls for an aesthetic touch, which gives us more choices, and more responsibility. By now, we all rely on style to express identity. And aesthetics has become too important to be left to the aesthetes.</p><p>In this penetrating, keenly observed book, Virginia Postrel shows that the "look and feel" of people, places, and things are more important than we think. Aesthetic pleasure taps deep human instincts and is essential for creativity and growth. Drawing from fields as diverse as fashion, real estate, politics, design, and economics, Postrel deftly chronicles our culture&#146;s aesthetic imperative and argues persuasively that it is a vital component of a healthy, forward-looking society. </p><p>Intelligent, incisive, and thought provoking, <i>The Substance of Style</i> is a groundbreaking portrait of the democratization of taste and a brilliant examination of the way we live now.</p></span>

                    <span>With her latest book Virginia Postrel once again wades into an area of intellectual study in which conventional wisdom has sorted the debate into convenient, pat, and yet ultimately unsatisfying dualities - superficial versus substantive, authentic versus phony, the "purely artistic" versus the "crudely commercial" - and proceeds to use her keen eye and open mind to assemble facts and theories that have the power to stand the debate on its head.<P>In "The Substance of Style" Postrel chronicles, explains, and ponders what she perceives as "the rise of aesthetic value". She first recounts, through an array of statistics, media reports, and other evidence, what she perceives as a rapidly increasing role in society for elements of the aesthetic - style, design, look and feel. Not only is the size of style-related industries rapidly increasing, but style-related issues are reaching into ever more of our life, and taking a role of more and more importance in our choices. Though she acknowledges that relative fascination with styles comes and goes, this time, she argues, something different is happening. She attributes this sea change to greater power over our surroundings and selves due to technology, greater consumer affluence and freedom, resulting in increased demand for choice and customization, and greater cultural exposure.<P>Postrel then trains her guns on the tired prevailing conventional views on design, style, and the aesthetic. In particular she attacks the twin theories that our pursuit of fashion, style and accessory stems from either being victims of corporate manipulation, or from a gnawing internal dissatisfaction that of course can never be realized no matter how many material goods we acquire. Interest in style and appearance, she argues, is tied deeply with our sensual natures, our biological drives, our neurochemistry and the nature of our perception. Postrel argues that even fashion, an industry whose constant cycles cast it as pure superficiality to so many, is a natural, healthy, and pleasurable outgrowth of our nature as both social and biological beings. This high-minded ideological defense of fashion is the type of argument only Postrel could give us and stands as a high point in the book. Ultimately, she asserts, our coming "age of aesthetic" is a novel, emerging synthesis to the age-old dialectics of substance versus appearance and artistic versus commercial.<P>Just as fun as Virginia's ideas is the palpable sense of delight she takes in the facts and observations that fuel her theories. She gleefully juxtaposes neo-Gothic architecture and dreadlocks to show the unexpected parallels between the development of these two trends, speculates how Calvinists or the Frankfurt School might feel about the rise of PowerPoint, and surveys the many visceral reactions the public has had to the societal Rorschach test of Hillary Clinton's hair. Such incandescent details cram every page not as frivolity but as argument after argument for the larger ideas that drive the book. In the aggregate, such data give Postrel a unique and powerful tool to argue her positions, one that the great minds of social theory she takes on would be hard pressed to match: those theories of Daniel Bell and Abraham Maslow may look good on paper, but how do they stand up to a slew of evidence on Afghani nail salons or megachurch architecture? Postrel knows, and her ability to ground her positions so thoroughly in even the most mundane aspects of our existence adds to their persuasiveness.<P>The scope of her arguments creates ample opportunity for the ideas in this book to be used as jumping-off points into other fields. For Postrel, the critique of style and design is a gendered one: such disciplines used to be considered "frivolous and feminine", and with the rise of women in society, and the loosening of traditional gender roles, these disciplines are finally winning a place of respect and legitimacy. It is also one of class order and struggle: a people's aspiration for material things, she notes, can be viewed by authorities as a dangerous sign that they are not happy with things as they are. And in exploring the way our accessories and surroundings impact our very sense of ourselves, even into our neurological makeup, she points towards pioneers in the field of ecological psychology such as Gregory Bateson and Edward S. Reed, or the cognitive neuroscience of Esther Thelen.<P>As with her last book, to be persuaded by Virginia's ideas means to find oneself repositioned at a right angle to many of the conventional concepts and viewpoints that we encounter in our everyday exposure to media, ideas and discussions. This will doubtless prove too unsettling for many who sit complacently on one side or the other of our current wisdom: many devotees of Hume will have little initial interest in a discussion of garbage cans at Target, and few professional hair designers will immediately gravitate to the theories of Adorno. However, for those willing to follow Virginia with an open mind through her extraordinary account of contemporary life, the rewards and opportunities are well worth the trouble. And just as her previous book developed a cult following among the radical innovators that drove Silicon Valley, so too is this book likely to resonate with the minds on the forefront of tomorrow's cultural transformations.</span>

                    <span>Never before have humans mastered production and distribution so well that function and value become givens, making aesthetics the ground of marginal competition. Design, therefore, has real and substantive, if hard to measure, economic value. These are the two points that Virginia Postrel makes in The Substance of Style. It takes her 191 pages to do so, however, and this distresses some who feel that these obvious points could have been made in two sentences.<P>I came to this book with the same trepidation because I didn't particularly care for Postrel's last book, The Future and its Enemies. But, I ended up a convert. Sure, Postrel's thesis here is a simple one, but this only underscores its elegance. That we all demand ambiance with our coffee and a flourish with our door knobs is something many folks take for granted. But the thing is, it's an unprecedented change in the history of human consumption and I don't know of anyone who has catalogued it like Postrel has. That profitability and business survival increasingly depend on the intangible "feel" of a product or service--and not on its traditional utility--will still come as a surprise to many old-school thinkers.<P>What Postrel does in this book is engagingly prove her two points beyond a doubt. Sure, they're simple points, but the book is short and packed with interesting anecdotes. I recommend this book to anyone interested in design, but especially to folks who think there's no value in looks or those who might be tempted to fault our modern "consumerist" culture as wasteful.</span>

                    <span>Virginia Postrel was editor of Reason magazine during its best decade. You could always tell when she wrote a piece - if it was charming, forceful, and subtle enough to effortlessly and painlessly slip big ideas directly into your brain. Her new book is no different - I read it in two nights, and came away both educated and entertained.<P>The premise of Virginia's book is, "How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture, and Consciousness." What interested me most, being the capitalist pig that I am, was the commerce angle. Postrel tells the story, from back when pagers were still the big thing, about how Motorola was for a time able to charge a $15 premium for their units. Why? Because instead of being the same dull black as everyone else's pagers, Motorola's were a cool toothpaste green color.<P>No extra features. No extended range. Just different plastic - green plastic which didn't cost them one dime more to manufacture than the plain black stuff.<P>Cool matters. Aesthetics matter. Look & feel matter. Motorola discovered those facts a decade ago. In her book, Virginia explains how those things are reshaping everything in the postmodern economy, from what we buy, how we buy it, and how it's all increasingly tailored to our individual tastes.<P>That's the substance of Virginia's latest book. So how about the style? Same as she ever was - charming, forceful, subtle, and a joy to read.</span>

                    <span>I saw Virginia Postrel speak recently at Rhode Island School of Design, and it was clear that she knew nothing about aesthetics. Starbucks, Walmart, all of the "case studies" she cited have everything to do with consumerism, mass production and savvy marketing and nothing to do with aesthetics or the inherent value of design. <P>At the beginning of her speech, Postrel apologed for the awful design of her powerpoint presentation and admitted that she was not a designer and had no background in design criticism. What she fills her book with are endless ridiculous and unfounded observations like the assertion that America has a higher design consciousness than Europe, and that Houston, TX is a metropolitan city that can be compared to Paris on the basis of style. <P>It is clear that Postrel has not a clue what the definition of aesthetics even is, but knows that if she fills the subtitle of her books with enough buzzwords she will sell millions. If you want to read about design aesthetics from someone who knows what he is talking about, you'd be much better off reading "How to Design" by George Nelson. Or get some actual design criticism in I.D. magazine every month. Don't buy into Postrel's BS. Even the cover of her book is badly designed! So much for promoting "aesthetics" and "style."</span>
