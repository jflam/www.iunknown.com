                <span id="Label1">Christopher Matthews, the Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner and a former aide to Tip O'Neill, offers a fascinating look at the connections between the two most well-known politicians in the last 40 years. He traces the symmetries of their beginnings--both were elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and assigned to the same committee--as well as their similar thirst for power. While both men's rise and fall, events that had profound effects on America, have been well chronicled, Matthews' book is one of the few, if not only, that places the two in parallel historical context.</span>

                    <span>Matthews provides a balanced and fair, if superficial, examination of Nixon and Kennedy.  As an avid studier of this era of politics, and Nixon in particular, I didn't learn a whole lot that I did not already know.  But this book, I don't think, is meant to provide the function of in-depth scholarly research.  It's pleasant fluff, for people who might be interested in learning a little bit about Nixon and Kennedy, but don't want to invest too much energy and brain power.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I think we all have subjects we'd like to know a little bit more about, but don't necessarily want to make a major scholarly investment in.  
<br />
<br />Matthews' writing style is easily digestible and entertaining, even if it does make you think that Matthews might just be as stupid in real life as he appears on TV.  He also provides a solid and fair account free of egregious errors.  If anything, I might be inclined to believe he has a slight bias towards Nixon and against Kennedy in terms of their respective treatments.  Despite Watergate, and my own liberal leanings, I tend to have a similar bias so it didn't bother me.  Nevertheless, Kennedy and especially Nixon are both fascinating figures, and Matthews does a credible job of capturing what makes the both of them so interesting.  In short, I'd give this book a fairly mild recommendation, with the understanding that there are better books about each figure out there, and Matthews does not provide any crucial, original, or insightful analysis.  It is good for the person with a mild interest, who'd like to know a bit more about Kennedy and Nixon, but who does not have the time or energy for something heftier.

                    <span>Chris Matthews, the host of Hardball, clearly composed a masterwork in "Nixon & Kennedy".  The book is well written and manages to take a non-partisan look at the rivalry.  While the book is clearly not a complete biography of either man's life, the unique angle of the politcal rivalry between these men should be pleasing to readers of history.
<br />
<br />Nixon and Kennedy could not be more different in their backgrounds.  Kennedy came from a wealthy background, while Nixon was not nearly as fortunate.  Despite their differences, they developed a mutual admiration for one another after they entered congress in 1947.  Both Nixon and Kennedy were viewed as up and comers for their respective parties, curious as to who would go farther in his career first.  
<br />
<br />Their rivalry came to a tragic end when JFK was assassinated in 1963.  Yet the rivalry lived on through other member of the Kennedy family.  First, the spector of Bobby Kennedy running off of his brother's legacy frightened Nixon.  RFK's assassination would extinguish any Nixon versus RFK poltical battles before they came to fruition.  Without a Kennedy in the way, Nixon was able to win the White House.  
<br />
<br />Even after the first term in office, Nixon's biggest threat was another Kennedy.  While Ted Kennedy's Presidential aspirations were evaporated by a car accident, Nixon continued to feel threatened.  These feelings of inferiority led Nixon's administration to the dirty deeds involved in Watergate.  Ironically, Ted Kennedy led the charge that ended Nixon's Presidency through his resignation.
<br />
<br />Matthews goes into surprising detail on a number of topics in the book.  I found the chapters on Watergate to be more thorough than many sources.  The overall picture is a revealling look into American politics in the 1960's and 1970's.  Truly, I took great pleasure in reading this book.</span>

                    <span>This book on mid-twentieth century politics reads like a page-turning novel.  It follows Kennedy (and Kennedy's brothers, after JFK's assassination) and Nixon from World War II to Watergate, providing many little-known details and stories about the two men, meaning that both political junkies and people only moderately interested in politics will find the book both informative and entertaining.  It is a great introduction to American political history of the 1950s and 1960s.</span>

                    <span>MSNBC host and news columnist Christopher Matthews charts the rivalry of "Kennedy v. Nixon" as backstory and inspiration behind most of America's post-World War II history. His meticulous research and breezy storytelling style creates a psychological/historical drama mixed with Shakespearean tragedy and some hilarious, touching anecdotes. <p>In it, Richard Nixon, the 37th president who resigned under pressure from the Watergate scandal, battles the ambitions, then the "Camelot" mythology of President John F. Kennedy, who defeated Nixon in 1960's close, contested election. Nixon is then shadowed throughout his political life by memories of the slain president: first by brother Robert, (a likely 1968 candidate before his assassination), and finally youngest brother Edward Kennedy.<p>"Kennedy vs. Nixon" tells a story of personal friendship souring under political differences and career paths. It shows how these cordial political colleagues who shared a hallway both opposed what they saw as Yalta's squandered victory after World War II, and fought Communist insurgency and infiltration domestically and internationally. Matthews traces their roles in the era's major events, all playing against a Cold War backdrop: tacit support for Joe McCarthy's investigations, distrust of Alger Hiss as Nixon prosecuted him, 1952's infamous "Checkers" speech preserving Nixon's vice-presidential candidacy even as President Dwight Eisenhower coldly minimizes Nixon's accomplishments and even attempts to remove him. <p>During these chapters Matthews reveals the start of Nixon's legendary personal distrust, hinted when vanquished Congressional opponent Helen Douglas branded him "Tricky Dicky." Here Matthews also introduces characters (Archibold Cox, Charles Colson, Larry O'Brien) who became household names less than 15 years later as henchmen for or targets of Nixon's need to retain power . You also see the slow roots of America's painful Vietnam involvement, and how it helped fuel Nixon's 1968 comeback victory.<p>The core of the book is dedicated to 1960's presidential election and TV's major role in its presentation and outcome. Matthews meticulously retells 1960's "Great Debate" and how Nixon's TV image which, compared to Kennedy's carefully crafted public persona (and what Nixon saw as creative counting) painfully cost him that election. But recounting private taped and untaped unconversations, you sense both men's anger and frustration against enemies foreign (Kennedy's Bay of Pigs, and 1963's assassination of South Vietnam president Ngo Dihn Diem) and domestic (Nixon's "Saturday Night Massacre," his palpable need to discredit Ted Kennedy even after 1969's Chappaquiddick tragedy ended any hopes for his presidential run.) <p>Matthews effectively argues Ted Kennedy's threat as fueling Nixon's self-destruction, but adds Nixon's suspicions were justified. From being used by Kennedy's wealthy father as pawn for President-elect Kennedy before the inauguration, to  investigated for loans given Nixon's brother Donald (for "Nixonburgers"), to Ted Kennedy's role in prosecuting Watergate, Nixon felt constantly chased by Kennedy legacy and perceptions he only held space until another Kennedy "restoration" and couldn't compete with Kennedy' carefully written legacy. This leads to several bitter but even  hilarious anecdotes (the ones about the phony train conductor, the pregnant woman and the beach photo opportunity being three favorites).<p>Even in Nixon's declining, post-retirement years, his foreign policy expertise respected and presidency re-examined, he couldn't hide antipathy for his 1960 rival and events leading America to the Vietnam war always associated with Nixon's presidency. Even his 1994 death was shadowed a few weeks later by that of President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline (with whom Nixon shared sweet and sincere correspondence after Ms. Kennedy's family visited Nixon's White House in 1971.) It is a somber, fitting ending to Matthews' remarkably told story, whose details provided deeper, long-missing reasons behind some of history's tragic, yet seismic events. "Kennedy vs. Nixon" is a recommended story addressing personal and political clashes between two of American history's most significant, forever fascinating figures.</span>

                    <span>A compelling account of the friendship and rivalry between two men who changed the face of American political campaigning in the Cold War era.  Matthews charts their long friendship, which was seriously challenged in the 1960 Presidential election that pitted them against each other.  Along the way, they had used many of the same techniques (one might say dirty tricks) to elevate themselves onto the national stage.  In the limelight of national television, Kennedy clearly got the better of his opponent, and their relationship took on a more adversarial tone after that.  Matthews covers the campaign with great relish.<p>One senses a certain sympathy with Nixon, speaking of his earlier campaigns against Voorhis and Douglas in a defensive tone.  Conversely, Matthews challenges the myths that surrounded the Kennedy persona, noting his "fighting conservatism," which often found him at odds with liberal establishment, especially in regard to Joseph McCarthy, whom Kennedy thought "might have something."  <p>Nixon comes across as the underdog, able to eventually overcome his handicaps and attain the office he so long desired, even if it came at a heavy price with Watergate.  One senses the tragic figure in Nixon. On the one hand, wanting to be a part of the intellectual elite, and on the other hand, dispising its condescending attitudes.  He seemed to view Kennedy in the same way Nick viewed Gatsby in "The Great Gatsby" (which Matthews alludes to).  But, Kennedy seemed to think little of Nixon in turn. In the end, Nixon was a terribly bitter man, but much of this was his own undoing.<p>The book covers a lot of ground, skimming over some parts of their lives, providing valuable insights into others. It is a timely comparison of these two men, as many of the same themes have resurfaced in recent years.  Clinton clearly modeled himself after Kennedy, and Bush seems to have gleaned much from Nixon.</span>
