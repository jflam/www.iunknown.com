                    <span>The Island, is mainly about 15 yr. old Wil's observations on the island. Wil's family, consisting of him and his parents move from Wisconsin to Minnesota because of his father's job. Wil goes out biking 1 morning which is when he first discovers the island, and 1 of his only friends in Munnesota, Susan. The book follows with Wil continuly going to the island and seeing Susan. This book is kind of like a story in a story because even thoug it was written by Gary Paulsen, there are little paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter that are supposedly written by Wil, also as he starts spending more time on the island, he writes storys about things that he sees, and that can get kind of boring. All in all this book has many insights on nature, but lacks the excitment that books like Hatchet, and The River have.</span>

                    <span>IMAGINE HAVING A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN RELAX AND GET OUT OF TROUBLE. THIS HAPPENED TO A FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY, WIL. HIS FATHER WORKS FOR THE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT AND THE COMPANY OFFERED A NEW JOB OUTSIDE OF THE CITY. HE ACCEPTS IT. ONE DAY WIL WAS RIDING ON HIS BICYCLE WHEN HE SAW A ISLAND THAT WAS LIKE A MAGNET TRYING TO ATTRACT HIM TO IT. HE FINALLY GOES TO THE ISLAND HE RELAXES, PAINTS, AND WRITE ABOUT NATURE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ANIMALS AND FILLINGS.<P>IM A GARY PAULSEN FAN BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST WRITTEN BOOKS. I SPECIALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE NATURE AND THE POWERFUL AND COLORFUL, PAULSEN WRITING.</span>

                    <span>The main characters in this book are Wil Neuton, Mr. and Mrs. Neuton, and Susan. Wil Neuton is a boy who just moved from the city to out in the country. Mr. and Mrs. Neuton are Wil's parents. Susan becomes Wil's best friend. She lives on a dairy farm and helps Wil through a lot of things. The book starts off before Wil moves. He had every thing going for him when he finds out he has to move because of his father's job. When he arrives to his new home he goes bike riding and finds an island. He goes out to the island with an old minnow boat he found laying around. When he gets out there he learns something about himself. When he leaves and is coming home and meets a girl named Susan. Susan shows Wil around the town and while they're out Wil gets writing and drawing supplies. He tells his parents he is camping out on the island, they don't really care. He goes out there and writes about many things and learns about many things. wil only meant to stay for one day but it turned into days and days. Finally his parents come out to the island and ask him what he is doing.</span>

                    <span>I usually like books by Gary Paulsen, for example the Hatchet, but I thought The Island was very boring. Wil Neuton moves to a new town and explores an island. The reason I thought it was so boring is because all he did was sit there and stare at different animals and then write about them. There was never anything interesting in it at all. <P> I think this book should be read by adults. This was definitely not meant for children!</span>

                    <span>I read this book in two days in about four hours' time and didn't put it down until I was finished. It was a great book, not only one I could relate to, but it has hit home as I know people trying to find themselves.<P>The book is vividly artistic and Emil Aucht adds a bit of humor to the picture, but I found a few abrupt transitions. The most pronounced is at the point where Susan decides to leave Wil alone for the time being and she all but disappears except for her one appearence to deliver food to Wil. The counselor bears a strange resemblence to Doc Daneeka in Catch-22, which is no doubt humorous.</span>
