                    <span>Details a number of case studies from the files of a professional cat behaviorist. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to counsel cats and their owners, here you are.<P>I didn't get the impression that the book was trying to be a serious treatise on cat-box behavior or spraying or whatever, though each vignette includes treatment plans and information about what was going on in that case. For in-depth treatment of issues like cat-box behavior and spraying, I'd recommend one of the author's other books, "Think Like a Cat". The treatment plans here are interesting to read, giving much insight on how one goes about changing an animal's behavior. And what cat owner doesn't love reading about odd cats? We got lots of them here, and sometimes the owners are just as odd. Honestly, I love reading these frequently amusing, sometimes very touching stories.<P>"Psycho Kitty" contains vignettes of what a day of a cat-behaviorist's life is like. I found the book absolutely fascinating, sometimes humorous, sometimes very touching.</span>

                    <span>I just got my first pet, a kitten, two months ago. Before I got her I read tons of books on cats and what to do or not to do. But many of the books were very dry and did not address behavior problems. Then a friend showed me Psycho Kitty and I read it in one afternoon. The book is easy to read and understand. And while the stories Johnson-Bennett tells are anecdotal, they do point out things we stupid humans do TO and FOR cats. I found out that some of the things I was doing were ENCOURAGING psycho kitty behavior.<P>The author does not talk down to the pet owner and provides practical advice. By writing this book, she is also telling us that we are not alone with our cat's weird and fascinating behaviors.</span>

                    <span>I was so glad I read this book. I had a cat that I brought home from the Humane Society. Ater he passed away I waited 5 years and decided I wanted a Kitty. I immediately feel in love with Allie and while shopping one day I spotted Psyco Kitty at the store. I bought it, and I am so glad I did. I found I couldn't put the book down. It was full of wonderful stories, but more important than that I actually learned so much that I never knew about cats. I learned so much about how my cat thinks,what they like, and don't like, and why. I highly Pam Johnson-Bennet's books!</span>

                    <span>After physical and mental trauma from the most recent flood, moving, rebuilding, moving again, one of our indoor cats just wasn't the same. My vet surprisingly couldn't give me any info on behavior problems and what he did offer, I now know, was actually wrong information. He recommended we drive 90 minutes (one way) to TX A&M with my traumatized cat/s to see their behavior "experts". What an experience that would have been - like addding fuel to the fire. Found this book here on Amazon and it really saved us. It gave thorough information in story-style that explained more about cats, their views, their behavior - where, why, etc. - than the other books I purchased written by different authors. Read an interesting, funny or touching story, learn from their experiences and be entertained all at once! I'm looking forward to reading her other books. I couldn't be more grateful and I'm sure my cats would thank her too if they could!</span>
