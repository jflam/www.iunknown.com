                    <span>This is an excellent book, and provides an easy to read format with questions listed in bold throughout the book.  There is no "quick reference" sheet of questions, though there is an appendix which lists questions in the back of the book (on p. 169).
<br />
<br />The author seems to be from a sales background, and lists many questions more suitable for sales.  In particular, some of the questions seem to be quite bold and forward; you may want to skip some of these.  To his credit, these questions are clearly marked.
<br />
<br />The book breaks questions down into three general areas: questions to ask yourself (before the interview), questions to ask a prescreener (an HR person), and questions to ask the hiring manager.  Most of the book is spent on the latter two.
<br />
<br />This book also describes how to do research on a company - so you know what questions to ask.  Resources are described in detail, and how to get them.</span>

                    <span>Career development expert Ron Fry focuses on how to prepare for a job interview and how to conduct yourself during the interview. While he covers some of the same ground he's covered in some of his other books and as well as the territory in other career books, such as What Color Is Your Parachute, Fry focuses helpfully on a critical job-finding skill - asking the right questions during your job interview. He tells you how to respond when the interviewer asks you, "Do you have any questions?", because your response indicates your level of interest in the job. Besides listing questions to ask or to modify to meet your own circumstances, Fry provides helpful preparatory questions you should ask yourself to clarify what kind of job you really want. We recommend this book to job seekers at the middle or lower management level. By the time you get to the executive suite, you'll know what else to ask.</span>

                    <span>This book does a great job of helping you ask the questions that will get you a job. As a training manager, who trains managers and executives on how to interview, I feel I am qualified to say this book works.  <p>I know we look for people who can ask the right question. This book is a wonderful resource once you get the interview.  This leaves us with the question, "How do you get an interview?" Simple, know the type of job you want and pursue it, if  you do not know what type of job you want you may want to read the classic, "How to find your dream job and make it a reality."  By Jason McClure.  <p>Read this book, and learn how to ask questions for your job interview.</span>
