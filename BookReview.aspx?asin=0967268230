                    <span>This is the second edition of the original guidebook and while I didn't read the original one, I can say that this book was very handy to have when my wife and I toured Vermont. T The Schellers are very entertaining people who obviously have a sense of humor and they also have a good sense of what is interesting to visit and what isnt'. They also must have done a lot of driving. We tried out two of the drives they suggested and were amazed at all the things there were to discover along the way, not to mention the physical beauty of Vermont. Even looking at a map I doubt we would have discovered these drives on our own. We tried out some of their "finds" which I'd say were places we never would have found on our own and they made our trip truly special. The book is an amazing collection of information that covers history, hours of operation, interesting little tidbits and so on. Definitely worth the money.</span>

                    <span>My wife and I recently toured vermont by car and we were very glad to have this book. It made the trip a unique and memorable experience. We were able to find lots of little places that we never would have discovered without it, and met people "off the path" that were genuinely glad to see us. I strongly recommend this book to anyone planning to drive through vermont, even if it's only a short trip. Great book and very funny in places, too!</span>
