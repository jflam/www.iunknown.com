                    <span>Based on the title, I had been hoping for something different, but found this little more than a glorified Tour Guide. Much of the information is the type shown in your standard Tourist Brochure or website, and I thought the overall tone a bit condescending.<P>A much better book for these purposes is "Inside Belize" by Tom Barry. It offers a well researched, in-depth view of the Belize economy, politics and culture.</span>

                    <span>I've been to Belize many times and read most of the guide books available. <BR> Although not technically a tour guidebook, it's suitable for that purpose, in addition to its stated goal.<BR> And as for that, it's absoultely the best thing out there for anyone considering investing, working or living in Belize. <BR> Lan loves Belize and its people but he gives you straight talk and advice, nothing is glossed over or ignored. <BR> The book covers everything one might need, such as the scoop on getting medical care, dealing with real estate transactions, finding attorneys, what businesses are best to invest in, and all the everyday needs that one will encounter. <BR> And, of course, there is plenty of information on fun things to do and places to see while visiting or living in this friendly country. <BR> A must have book!</span>

                    <span>The Belize Adapter Kit will not disappoint you.

Mr. Sluder has managed to create a guide that is as useful to the novice as it is to those with significant knowledge about the country. <P>You will learn the pros and cons of life in Belize and gain a respect for the practical aspects of living and traveling in the country. This is not a romanticized look at a tropical paradise, but an unbiased and truthful guide to daily life in a place that may inspire you - or frustrate you. <P>If you wish to know whether you should consider relocation to this remarkable country, the Belize Adapter Kit will be an invaluable resource. It is also extremely useful to those considering a vacation here.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Sluder is very knowledgeable about his subject, but does not try to sugarcoat the country to be an island paradise where you can live like a king on a peasant's budget. Unlike some of the other Belize-related expatriate or retirement articles I've seen, Lan tells you more of the difficulties and intricacies of this country!</span>

                    <span>As the author of several travel guides to Belize (the latest of which is Explore Belize) and the author of Explore Costa Rica, I've been familiar with Lan's writing for many years. <P>Lan has consistently been one of the most prolfic writers about Belize and one of its biggest boosters. This book offers a compact summary of what life in Belize might be like. He interviews a crew of resident expats (many of whom I know), and there are plenty of maps, charts, and other info.<P>Personally, I've learned a lot from Lan about Belize, and I encourage you to buy this book. And do keep Lan and myself informed of changes and your own experiences. Because this is the way to improve travel guides.</span>
