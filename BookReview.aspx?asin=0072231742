                    <span>I purchased this book at the recommendation of my grandson, our family's resident hacker and wiz. I have to say I learned quite a bit about google by reading this book. Although I would not call myself a google expert, I will say that I am now a "power user". This books is not only thorough but written well enough that a non technical person such as myself can read it. Excellent job. Well done!

                    <span>First, this book was published in 2004, so it is current.<p>Second, the authors are Google insiders, so it is accurate.<p>Third, "Each of Google's features is explained at a basic level so as to accomodate novices,..."<p>If you don't search every day, this book will make you better!</span>

                    <span>I thought I knew Google moderately well.  It turns out, I didn't.  I now know it better, and have a book to help me find more information more quickly when I need to.  The book covers basic web search, and goes through a number of the more esoteric features (did you know you can do arithmetic in the search bar?) and  goes on to discuss the news, Usenet news groups, directory, image search and Froogle, amongst other features.  There's a little technical information about how Google does its stuff, but appropriately located in an appendix.<p>The book is easily understood by anyone who can type 'google' in the search bar of their browser, and it will make you realize what an astounding resource Google is.</span>

                    <span>Did you know Google can find you best prices, do translations, or even fill out online forms for you?<p>"How to Do Everything with Google" by Fritz Schneider goes over everything from how to enter a query all the way to configuring your Google toolbar.  Whether you are a complete beginner or an advanced web browser, Google will help you use Google to it's fullest capability.  The book is very friendly.  Has plenty of pictures with notes and does not use technical terms.  The chapters were straight to the point and kept short.<p>To nitpick, the book could have shown examples on some advanced topic such as "advanced operators" to give a better understanding of how to use it.  This was probably not included to keep the book beginner friendly.<p>Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone that thinks Google is just another good search engine.</span>
