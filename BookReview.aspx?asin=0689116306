                <span id="Label1">The biggest paradox in golf is that the harder you try to "hit" the ball, the worse you do so.  In The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing, Michael McTeigue offers you a simple system of sequential body movements that produces a true swinging motion with every club in the bag. The result is increased distance and greater accuracy for all sizes, shapes, and ages of golfers for a minimum investment in learning time.  <P>The clarity and simplicity of McTeigue's frell-free approach to the golf swing leads the reader to a new experience of power and effortlessness. He truly shows how to "build a swing you can trust and keep for life."  <P>If you love golf but have never played to your potential, here is a book that you will quickly come to treasure.</span>

                    <span>Like others, I've purchased other instructional books, silly gadgets, and lessons from the local golf pro. I've also read the magazines, and searched the internet for that one magic tip that will make my golf shots longer, straighter, and more consistent.<P>Nothing really worked until I read Effortless Golf by Mike McTeigue. I now fully understand the golf swing, and why the fundamentals are some important. My golf shots are now looking and feeling much, much, better.<P>I found this book so effective because it simply explains what to do and what not to do during the golf swing. Furthermore, the book offers numerous drills that will help you learn the fundamentals neccessary for a solid, repeatable golf swing.<P>Overall, the book is an easy enjoyable read that will definitely improve your game.</span>

                    <span>A couple of years ago I wrote 'the only book you should read is Jimmy Ballard's 'How to Perfect Your Golf Swing', well here is another. It is true that this book is based on Jimmy Ballard's teachings and for this reason you must own this book too. <P>Mr McTeigue has reduced the swing to a simple minimum. This a great thing for the golfing world. His lighthouse drill is excellent, it will help anyone feel the correct swinging sensations a good player has. <P>As a golf instructor I can tell you what works and what doesn't, and this works. The book is based on sound fundamentals, is easy to understand and is simple to practice. What more does a golfer want? Most books are far too complicated and you cannot put into work what the author has written because it is too difficult. We need a plan and Mr McTeigue has given the world one. Do yourself a favour, buy this book and practice what is in it.</span>

                    <span>Michael McTeigue's "The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons" is a marvelous book. I found that Mcteigue did a terrific job in taking the myriad complexities which seem to make the golf swing so difficult to understand, and distilled them to down a small handful of points and concepts which are easy to grasp. The exposition and organization of the ideas is clear and easy to follow. There's an elegant simplicity to having the keys presented be so straightforward -"balance", "momentum", "rythm", etc. In particular, the notion of the "lighthouse turn" has helped my game enormously, and gives me a concept I can turn to (no pun intended . . .) when on the course and starting to encounter difficulties. Everyone who plays golf is striving for a powerful, efficient, repeatable swing. It's an elusive goal (as even Tiger has seen lately). This book will help golfers of all levels in their quest to attain such a swing.</span>

                    <span>This book provides solid instruction on the golf swing. It describes how weight shift and body rotation with passive arms and hands leads to a less complicated and more repeatable golf swing. This is a good book and deserves any golfer's consideration, however, I more highly recommend "The Natural Golf Swing" by George Knudson. Knudson's book covers that same concepts as McTeigues book, but I think it provides a bit more background and detail. I think that either of these books would benefit golfers looking to improves their games.</span>
