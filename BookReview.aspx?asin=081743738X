                    <span>I really loved this book.  It provided clear descripions of basic photographic techniques.  I think that there is something in this for both beginners and advanced photographers.  Beginners need to have a framework of creative options to explore and advanced photographers often need to get out of their habitual shooting mode and try some different things.  The concepts are simple but the execution is challenging.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book 2 times already and is one of those photography books you just can't put down.  You could read it cover to cover in one sitting.  Awesome color images that are truly inspiring to the photographer at all levels of skill.  Tharp's skills and professionalism really shine in this book.  She really hits a chord with her creative approach and is supported by wonderful color images.  I can't wait for her next book.  Highly recommended!!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is sort of a "how to see creatively" kind of book.  It has decent photos and gives a nice theory behind seeing pictures.  My main two problems with the book are the following:
<br />
<br />1) Despite basically trying to teach composition, no compositional art terms are ever mentioned (ie, rule of thirds, etc).
<br />
<br />2) None of the photograph captions (besides a handful in one of the chapters about shutter speed) show any sort of shot information like shuter/aperture, and only some show focal length.
<br />
<br />This book is not designed to be a technical book, so if you need to learn how to use the camera or learn about lenses, depth of field, or what aperture/shutter settings to use for a given composition, you won't find it here.  On the other hand if you'd just like a book with decent nature photographs, and what is essentially a pep-talk throughout the text, this one will fit that bill.  It is essentially a beginner's introduction to nature photography composition, I believe.
<br />
<br />There is another book on amazon that I also owned called "Learning to See Creatively", and though it did not deal strictly with nature photography, it seemed to be a bit more experimental and pushed you to actually be more creative in your compositions.  It also has all the lens/aperture/shutter setting information in the caption for every photograph.  </span>

                    <span>I bought this book sight unseen, based on the strength of all the 5-star reviews below.  My mistake.  It's a decent enough book, with lots of nice photos, but in my opion it certainly doesn't deserve a 5-star rating.  There isn't anything in this book that isn't in dozens of other photography books, and there's nothing outstanding in it.  It's not a bad book at all, but it's not a great book either.</span>

                    <span>This is a delightful book in which concepts for creative photographs are cogently explained and illustrated with consistently strong images.   This book could well have carried a subtitle something like -- "A Composition Toolkit".   Very useful -- perhaps even inspirational -- for all skill levels.</span>
