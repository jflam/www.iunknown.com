                <span id="Label1"><p>A book of hope and healing, <I>Recovering From the Loss of a Sibling</I> is the first book for those who have experienced the death of a brother or sister. It addresses the many questions, fears and feelings of surviving siblings of all ages, such as:</p>  <ul> <li>Will this soon happen to me? <li>It should have been me. Why wasn't it? <li>God must have punished me for the time when I was so mean to my brother. <li>My sister was my parents' favorite and I don't seem to count to them. <li>At work, they have no idea what I'm going through. They think I'm <i>just</i> a sibling. All the focus is on my parents, not my grief. </ul>  <p>When a brother or sister dies, surviving siblings may receive little support or even recognition of their pain. Parents are so grief-stricken at the loss of a child that they often find themselves unable to cope with the needs of their surviving children. With family and friends concentrating on the parents?tragedy, the suffering of siblings often goes unnoticed.</p>  <p>These intimate, true stories provide valuable insight, demonstrating that the reader is not alone and that others have gone through this devastating experience and have survived. In these pages, sisters and brothers share their innermost feelings, wanting others to gain comfort from their experiences.</p>  <p>The book also serves as a compassionate aid to friends, co-workers, teachers, family members, and the helping professions.</p></span>

                    <span>I ordered a few of these self-help sibling books, and this book is by far the most helpful. The author not only has experienced the loss but lets others recount their experiences and feelings after their loved one passes. Every single page allowed me to understand that all of my feelings are normal, and that other siblings go through the same thoughts. If you have lost a sibling, this book will cover every single element in your life--I promise it will make all the difference in your grief.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book, not for myself, but for the brother of my brother-in-law. He was having a difficult time coming to grips with the death of my brother-in-law, as I was. Living closer to my sister's family, I grieved (and still do), but did not carry guilt of not having told him how much he meant to me. He was a wonderful friend and brother-in-law. His brother was not so fortunate. I am told that this book was a great help to him in picking up and going on. It put to rest his guilt that he should continue to live his life and helped him to validate his feelings of sorrow and loss. Losing a sibling is difficult enough, but when it is not a child or parent or spouse, people do not understand the time it takes to heal the wound. I know that the individual that I bought this book for is glad that I did.</span>

                    <span>To the Author, I say "Thank You" for writing this book!!! Surviving the Loss of a Sibling has been by far, the most "healing" book for me, in my personal experience. This based on having read (too) many (50-100) grief related books in recent years. I was 17 when my older brother died..., 28 when my little brother died..., and I very much appreciate the numerous testimonials that Katherine Fair Donnelly included in the book. I can't speak for anyone but myself, but when I read (or talk w/ others) about how "they" have dealt with their tragedy(s), I realize that I am not doing as bad of a job of adjusting (relatively speaking) as I often convince myself I have. I have found comfort in many books "on this page or that", yet in Surviving..., I find comfort on "each and every page". I have recommended it often. The problem is that the book is out of print, and the publishers @ this point have not "seen the need" for it to be re-published. They would not make that mistake if they had "lived" the loss, and then read this book. I was involved in a project for M.A.D.D.'s "Fall 96 MADDvocate. I was later told by Stephanie Frogge (Assistant to the Director of Victims Services - out of the National Office) that the "Siblings" issue was the largest publication in M.A.D.D.'s history, with over a 25% increase in distrubtion. There is most certainly a need for "Sibling" materials such as this excellent book. I've read my copy many times, and will continue to do so, with the hope that her book will again be in print very soon - for the need is great!!!</span>
