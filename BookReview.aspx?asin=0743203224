                    <span>This book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it's not the party, it's the man.  By serving Presidents from both parties, Gergen forces Republican and Democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent Presidential successes and failures.
<br />
<br />For example, I was a proud Reagan youth who didn't vote for Clinton in 1992 However, by 1996 I had to admit that Clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country.  Gergen explains how Clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country.
<br />
<br />Gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about Reagan, that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right, Reagan was truly a President to all Americans and governed from the middle.
<br />
<br />If are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party, this is a great case study.  If you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people, this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach.  If you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents, this is not the book for you.</span>

                    <span>If you want to stay away, or need a break from, the (sometimes) fun but predictable polemics about the state of our state, Gergen is your man.  I have often enjoyed his comments on television and his editorials.  He always speaks with authority, respect, and perspective; and thus, he stands out.  You'll see no "gotcha" moments in this book, and his prose is simple and engaging. 
<br />
<br />This is not really a history book, nor does it have much discussion of policy, but Gergen states this from the get-go.  Rather, he sets out to look at 4 presidents at various moments when they are at their best in their leadership role, and when they fall short in this role.  I found the chapters on Nixon and Clinton the most interesting.  I suppose this could be due to the fact that they had the more complicated times in office, and they are seemingly more complex individuals than Reagan or Ford.  Ironically, the chapter on President Reagan, from whom Gergen learned "the most about about about leadership",  was the least interesting.  His discussion about Reagan's communication ability wasn't as lively or fresh as other parts of the book.     
<br />
<br />I think the most interesting thing about thing about this book was the way in which various aspects of one administration affect other, seemingly unconnected, aspects.  How one's initial organization, one's staff, one's personal relationships and maturity, and even the simple need for sleep can effect political effectiveness and policy itself.  This is essetially the purpose and content of the book.  
<br />
<br />Further, he can cast a brief, but interesting light on the cast surrounding the Presisdent.  In discussing Al Haig and his misstep after Reagan, Gergen reminds readers of Haig's admirable role after watergate yet he refrains from letting Haig of the hook for his mistake, a wonderful example of Gergen's persective.
<br />
<br />Gergen also treats the Lewinsky scandal gracefully.  He refuses to dip into tabloid journalism or fake outrage, but he convincingly showes how the incident effected Clinton's Presidency, and how it was more than merely a silly sex act.
<br />
<br />I hope Gergen writes more, and recommend this book.  </span>

                    <span>Eyewitness to Power was an unexpected pleasure. I have watched Gergen as a pundit for years and thought that he, while articulate, was a little too milktoast for me. I picked up this book on a lark, and once I began to read it, never set it down. <p>I have read countless business books on leadership in business. Most, if not all, paint the picture of the perfect unerring leader. Gergen, on the other hand, writes about what he observed - the strengths and the warts of those he served while in the White House. As a result, he has written what has become my favorite book on leadership. <p>Leaders come in different shapes and sizes, with different skills and experiences. And Gergen shows how each of these Presidents used their unique skills and experience to lead. Some better than others. <p>This is a book that should be a must read in all MBA programs as it tells the story of real leadership and not some fictional, unattainable ideal.</span>

                    <span>After giving a first hand account of four U.S. Presidents (Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton), David Gergen provides qualities which make a good leader.  This, however, though it is the conclusion of the book, isn't the most beneficial part of the book.  By giving in depth accounts of four different presidencies you see how one President runs the country so much different form another.  Also it gives the analysis of events from a point of view that is very uncommon.  It really makes it so you can begin to know the real men who served in the oval office, not the man that the media portrayed.  Sure, Gergen has his biases, but if you can look through them, you can get an amazing picture of the some of the more recent Presidents.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very well written and thought out.   The author, who could have really cashed in on the book by spelling out even warmed over gossip and tall tails did not.  He took the high road and tried to dissect the leadership characteristics of the four Presidents he worked for.  He also added some interesting insights from his own work and I always wanted more of his experiences.   I found that I enjoyed the sections on Nixon and Clinton the most.  He was as complimentary as he was negative, depending on the topic.  I found his views were very balanced and based on definable facts, not just off the cuff comments.    To be fair in this review, the section on Ford was much like the Ford Presidency, everything interesting had to do with Nixon.<p>If I had one issue with the book it was that the author did seem to go easy on Reagan.  The author holds Reagan in very high esteem and that comes through on the writing.   It is a good thing Reagan never went swimming or this author would have had to detail a walking on the water episode.  The reason I was disappointed was that for the other three Presidents, the authors sharp eye cut through the fluff and got right to the mistakes, weaknesses and strengths.  I would like the author to come out with a memoir of his time but maybe he is waiting for the next President to call him up for duty before he pens it.   Overall the book was good, interesting and easy to read.</span>
