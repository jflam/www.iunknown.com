                    <span>Theodore Eicke was the original, pre-war commander of the concentration camp system. At the start of WW2, he formed the Totenkopfverbande as a unit for occupation duty in Poland (primarily "Final Solution" executions and the like), which became a combat unit in the invasion of France, and ultimately became one of the foremost tank divisions on the eastern front. Their rise came primarily from their resolute defense of a wooded area near Leningrad, which was instrumental in convincing Hitler to expand the Waffen SS at the expense of the army in 1942. SS Totenkopf became a fire brigade sent in to stabilize the front where it seemed on the verge of collapse. They were known more for their resolute determination to fight to the last man, rather than for any tactical brilliance. This served them well in many unwinnable situations in the latter part of the war.<P>The book provides a far more balanced picture of Theodore Eicke than is available elsewhere. Most other books portray him as a raving lunatic sprung from a straight jacket (literally) to command the concentration camps. This book shows Eicke's original commitment to a mental institution to have been entirely political. During his reign in the camps, he made a lot of connections, which enabled him to do remarkably well at requisitioning equipment (much of which was produced in the camps, or stored in warehouses adjacent to them). Eicke had a great rapport with his men, but was extremely brutal with those who got on his wrong side.<P>In another book, "Wenn Alle Bruder Schweigen", there is a reference to Felix Steiner being the commander of Totenkopf after Eicke's death. However, "Soldiers of Destruction" makes no reference to Steiner. I am not sure what to make of this.</span>

                    <span>Soldiers of Destruction is a scholarly examination of the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf, perhaps the most controversial of all the SS divisions. Charles Sydnor does an excellent job of tracing the origins of Totenkopf from its origins in the concentration camp system to crack fighting unit.<P>Perhaps the one personality who permeated the division was Theodor Eicke, the first commander of Totenkopf and its major personality whose influence was felt even after his death in combat in 1943. Eicke's struggles with Himmler and the Wehrmacht to gain respect and much needed supplies as well as the various machinations within Nazi Germany's hierarchy are well detailed. Eicke was to the Totenkopf what Sepp Dietrich was to the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler and Paul Hausser to the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich: a father figure revered and respected by his men, but also feared (Eicke often punished his men by sending them to the camps as inmates but made sure his men had enough rations and winter clothing in Russia). <P>The Totenkopf Division fought primarily on the Eastern Front and gained a reputation as steadfast in defense. While the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler and Das Reich divisions were the spearheads of the Waffen-SS and took the forefront in the attack, it was the Totenkopf that held the line in Russia and gained respect from notable army generals such as Erich von Manstein and Maximilian Von Weichs. <P>Even with its enviable reputation in battle, the Totenkopf was a unit of contradictions. Some of the officers and men who were worthy soldiers included Otto Baum( holder of the Knights' Cross with Swords and Oakleaves-no Diamonds, even though he deserved them and Sydnor says that he won them), the only man to command three different divisions of the SS and one of the youngest corps commanders when he took temporary command of Das Reich along with the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division "Gotz von Berlichingen", Georg Bochmann, also a holder of the Swords and a commander of two different divisions, Karl Ullrich, commander of the combat engineer batallion, holder of the Oakleaves, and the last commander of the 5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking", and Fritz Christen, the first enlisted man in the SS to win the Knights Cross and at the age of 20 the youngest soldier to be awarded the Ritterkreuz. Totenkopf was awarded 11 Knight's Crosses for actions in the Demyansk pocket, the most Knight's Crosses awarded to a single unit in one battle. Despite such brave officers and men, Totenkopf had an unsavory reputation for atrocities and a number of war criminals did serve in the unit. Totenkopf was responsible for the execution of English prisoners of war and French colonial troops in France in 1940 and was alleged to ahve committed numerous war crimes on the Russian Front. Sydnor notes that three Totenkopf officers who later beccame division commanders were alleged to have been responsible for major war crimes in the West: Heinz Lammerding for the massacre at Oradour while commanding Das Reich in 1944, Hermann Priess for actions during the Battle of the Bulge while serving as corps commander of the LAH, and Max Simon for killing Italian civilians in 1944 and executing German civilians in 1945. Sydnor traces this to the instituion of the camps and the mentality that resulted from them and the indoctrination of Eicke which makes for an intersting study and refutes the claim made by some SS members that they were soldiers like the rest of the German military. <P>The final fate of the Totenkopf was in many ways a Goetterdammerung: Totenkopf managed to surrender to the Americans in Austria, but its members were handed over to the Soviets supposedly because it did almost all of its fighting in the East, a fate not shared by the LAH and Das Reich because they fought extensively on the Western Front. Few Totenkopf members survived Soviet captivity.<P>An interesting read and a definite must for those interested in the German military. Perhaps Professor Sydnor could do a study on the LAH and Das Reich.</span>

                    <span>Charles W. Sydnor Jr's, "Soldiers of Destruction" is a wonderful piece of historical literature. This book represents Dr. Sydnor's Ph.D. dissertation and as such is based on significant research - this is historical prose by a historian! However, having said that, this does not imply that "Soldiers of Destruction" is merely an academic book with facts that is dry to read, quite the opposite. "Soldiers of Destruction" is a pleasure to read - well-crafted prose and flow - and contains lots of facts. This dissertation is not meant to represent a study of the whole Waffen SS, but rather an in depth look at one component - Third SS Panzer Division Totenkopf (Totenkopfdivision) - as an individual and somewhat isolated case. That said, it is fair to say that whether you are an airchair historian looking for a good read or a serious student of history interested in the Waffen SS and issues associated with the fighting arm of the SS, "Soldiers of Destruction" might be what you're looking for. <P>Dr. Syndor begins his story with a discussion of the development of the Totenkpfdivision as an outgrowth from the SS Totenkopfverbande (Deaths Head Division) and the concentration camp guard system. Central to this development was Theodor Eicke, who put his aggressive, fanatical NSADP stamp on the system. He organized the concentration camp guard system and from that the initial Totenkopfdivision, making this Waffen SS unit one with a particularly rabid Nazi makeup, at least at its inception. By bringing the formation of the Totenkopfdivision into focus provides important perspective for Syndor and the reader to assess the actions of the division in its military exploits, including charges of brutality. Simply put, are actions seemingly askew from other battle units, such as murder of POWs, ultimately unexpected given the personalities and ideological "training" of the division? Syndor does not use this analysis to excuse the actions but rather to provide clarity for greater understanding in a historical context.<P>The passages dealing with combat of the Totenkopfdivision (most of which occurred against the Soviets) are fascinating and highly enlightening. Syndor has does a great job brining to life these years of the division and balancing the highly effective and laudable (from a military perspective) battle actions of the Totenkpdivision with the criminal activities that followed the division. The reader can easily separate these issues and then place the latter in context given the introductory material. This is in fact what Syndor attempts to do (quite effectively I believe) in the last section of the book, entitled: Ideology, Personality, Criminality. <P>In the end this is a wonderful book, both from a mere historical and a reading enjoyment standpoint. Syndor conveys a clear history of a single element of the Waffen SS that is both significant and fair. Highly recommended reading - five stars!</span>

                    <span>The death's head SS division, created in october 1939, was one of the oldest Armoured formation of the III rd Reich. Thus, this unit achieved great military successes, mainly on the eastern front. Sydnor, in his talented study, details, the initial developments with the incorporation of concentration camp guards, the first fights in the western campaign where, the division occured some victories but also setbacks and finally, the military operations on the east... The "SS Totenkopf division", created by Theodor Eicke, former chief of the death's head batallions (camp unit guards), maintained close ties with the concentration camp system until the end of the war. Sydnor demonstrates that with documents. Sydnor also shows, the fundamental influence Eicke had over the formation's fighting spirit and thus, some of the consequences on the ground... But he doesn't contest the military value of this elite division, illustrating that by numerous examples. That's why many generals of the german army were pleased to have the SS Death's Head division under their command... This book is a must read !</span>

                    <span>Dr. Syndor presents us with what appears to be an academically honest, truthful account of the development of the SS Totenkopf division. He traces its indisputable origins from the concentration camp system into an elite Waffen SS combat Division. <P> Syndor captures the facts regarding the effect that Theodor Eicke had on creating the division from his hand picked staffs in the concentration system. Thus creating a combat division led and manned by individuals already hardened to cruelty to the "enemy behind the wire". Syndor presents a detailed account of Eicke's rise through the concentration camp system, his immense political connections, the origins of the Totenkopf division under Eicke's guidance. <P> The author is clearly impressed by the combat performance of the Waffen SS and the Totenkopf division in particular; however, he presents facts and adequate footnotes for anyone to investigate. The truth speaks for itself, the Waffen SS, with the esprit of the troops and the political indoctrination, were elite combat units. They fought at times to the last man and withstood hardships and casualty rates beyond what most other troops would endure. They also committed acts that carried the political will of the Fuhrer and the Reichsfuhrer SS to the occupied territories and the front. <P> This is NOT an apologist's book about the Waffen SS, nor does it state that every SS trooper was a criminal. The truth, as usual, is somewhere in between. It does paint the SS and the Waffen SS as the criminal organizations that they were. It also details the combat performance of this elite combat unit. The last half of the book is sketchier on details of the Totenkopf's combat records, but this was due to the loss of many of those detailed records to the war waged upon Germany.<P> This is an excellent book, my only criticism is that it does not have enough photo's and statistics (specifically, after action reports).</span>
