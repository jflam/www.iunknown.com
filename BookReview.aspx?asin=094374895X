                    <span>This book has done more for the size of my jazz improvisation vocabulary than I could have dreamed.  The fact that I can look through the pages to find a fitting run for a specific chord has been a source of endless help.  Brilliant for beginners and advanced players who are interested in expanding their horizons.  A great book from a great pianist.</span>

                    <span>If you are an aspiring student of jazz, you can not do without this book. Though not an especially voluminous publication, it is densely crammed with countless ideas. <p>Improvisation in the purest sense should come from the wellsprings of the artist's soul- but let's face it, some days are better than others! Rather than painstakingly reinventing the wheel, pick this one up- you will not regret doing so. It should keep you busy for years to come- especially once you begin to combine these wonderful musical quotes, extensions, etc, with your own. They can be applied to just about any standard and with enough perseverence you will elevate your playing and performing by quantum leaps. <p>Worth every penny- thank you Mr. Laverne! Again, Thank You!</span>

                    <span>I'm not a big fan of lick and pattern books, but this one has my seal of approval... and more than that, I HIGHLY reccomend it.  There are lot's of ideas in here, some powerful stuff.   Really hands on Jazz language material, some that if you're a more experienced improviser you might be using instinctively already, and some you wonder why you haven't touched on all along.   The idea is to take them and build upon them...    Within hours of getting the book, I immediately tuned out the outside world and was having fun experimenting with it...   Some other things I like about it :  The licks are in more than one key, suggested fingerings for more difficult ones, they're over a nice variety of patterns, typography is nice, and they're stuff that real people actually play, not just text book prototypes.      <p>I venture to say, that of the books I'm familiar with, this is the best one out !!!   Great stuff for professionals as well as folks just getting into improv... and not just for pianists !</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource in the art of jazz improvisation.  It provides the opportunity for the jazz musician to increase their vocabulary of runs over various chords and chord progressions.  Highly recommended!</span>
