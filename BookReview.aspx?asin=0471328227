                <span id="Label1">From uncanny movie dinosaurs to the loopy physics of the triple axel, Keith Devlin's vibrantly illustrated book illuminates the mathematics inherent in every human endeavor.    <p>"A beautiful book . . . the aim is not to teach but to entertain, and it succeeds. The view that mathematics is dull is replaced by an image of how math can be both interesting and useful, if not all-powerful."&mdash;New Scientist.    <p>"A colorful and exciting introduction to the ways in which mathematics can help [us] to under-stand phenomena. [Devlin] presents fascinating real-world problems posed by real people and shows how mathematics is used to solve them."&mdash;Choice.    <p>"Not in many, many years have I seen a book nearly as instructive and enlightening about the beauty of mathematics. Life by the Numbers is superb."&mdash;Amir Aczel, author of Fermat's Last Theorem.    <p>"This wondrous book reveals how, on the brink of the millennium, wizards are using math to bring movie dinosaurs to life, to improve tennis stars' serves, to win sailboat races, and to probe the eeriest corners of the cosmos. A pleasurable read for adult and young alike."&mdash;Keay Davidson, coauthor of Wrinkles in Time.    <p>"A fascinating account of many of the ways in which mathematical ideas find application in the world around us. Keith Devlin is to be congratulated for bringing these ideas so accessibly to the public."&mdash;Sir Roger Penrose, author of The Emperor's New Mind.    </span>

                    <span>Life by the Numbers has a simple thesis to prove: that math is anywhere and everywhere; but instead of asserting the pervading ubiquity of mathematics whether you like it or not, the book convinces you that you *will* like it, period.<p>The book is richly illustrated and jargon-free, true to its promise on clarity and easy-of-reading especially for the non-professional readers. It is not so much of a wild speculation however to suggest that even a professional (specialist) mathematician will get a worthy entertainment reading this book, considering the wide spectrum of human interests where mathematics is unexpectedly to lurk that Devlin adventurously explores.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased a videotape of the Star WarsÂ™ movie, `The Phantom  Menace.' It is difficult to believe that a more convincing point of  evidence for the power of applied mathematics will exist for some time. The  scenes where the generated creatures are in motion have a degree of reality  that is astounding. As Devlin spends a great deal of time explaining in  this book, what you see is a complex series of numbers translated by a  computer into pictures on a screen.<br>   Other topics concerning image  generation by computer involve the visualization of scientific data. People  working in this area are often a combination of graphics artist and  computer scientist. With such enormous amounts of data being collected,  interpreting it and filtering out the points of interest has become a  horrifically difficult task. The only way that it can be done is to find  ways to filter the data as much as possible and then display it in a visual  manner where the key points are easily discernible. No quote better  describes the situation than that uttered by R. W. Hamming, `The purpose of  computing is insight, not numbers.'<br>  The physics of sports is also  described in some detail. No matter how well trained their bodies are,  athletes are still bound by the laws of physics, so at some point their  training must incorporate these laws. A simple question such as whether to  jump higher or spin faster when figure skating can determine the difference  between a medal winning performance and simply watching it happen on  television.<br>   This book is a tour de force in how many applications  there are for mathematics, with many that appeal to young people. An  appreciation for the value of mathematics is the first step towards a  desire to study it, and this book will no doubt spark the appreciation.  <br><br> Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with  permission.</span>
