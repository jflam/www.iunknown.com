                    <span>I am a newbie of online database appication and want to learn this technology in a short period. This book gives me a clear understanding about how Dreamweaver is working with database. I think this is the MUST book for those want to learn this technology.<br>The reason I give this book 4 stars is that there are some mistakes that need correction. And some description might be a little vauge without supplemental graphics.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author is knowledgeable and presents ideas in a logical flow that is easily understood.  Within days I mastered fundamental concepts of web site creation, database integration, and more.  The only reasons that I did not give the book 5 stars is that the exercises were sometimes difficult to follow since the instructions are embedded within "theory" paragraphs. I would have found it much easier if the step-by-step instructions were listed more clearly (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, etc.).  Additionally, the sample database files (as of 3/29/03) were not password protected, although the book instructs the reader to enter a user name and password when connecting to them. I was at my wits end trying to get the files to work until I tried the exercises leaving the user name and password blank. Then, presto!</span>

                    <span>This book does what it says effectively and efficiently. Although it appears as a rather large book, it reads very easily and is well documented visually. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it provided me with the tools necessary to getting the most out of Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX. I highly recommend it for those just getting started with this product, you won't be disappointed and it's worth every penny.</span>
