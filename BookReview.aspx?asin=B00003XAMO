                <span id="Label1">Originally intended for IMAX theaters, this documentary follows a family of beavers as they lay claim to a dam and build a place to live.  The animals live as extended families, complete with uncles and aunts, and with their instinctive engineering skills build complex dams and apartments for themselves.  What could be a mundane nature documentary, though, is made lyrical by its score, lighting, and camera work.  It's a rare documentary that can be sweet but not cloying, with plenty to hold the interest of kids and adults alike. <I>Beavers</I>' accompanying making-of film answers some of the inevitable questions and reveals that the project was an incredibly arduous task.  The film was made in the mid-1980s and involved lugging around the cumbersome IMAX camera in the wilderness, as well as weeks of waiting for the beavers to actually <I>do</I> something. Set against the breathtaking beauty of the Canadian Rockies, this is an incredible example of nature photography and a rewarding little film about our bucktoothed rodent friends and their innate construction drive.  <I>--Jerry Renshaw</I></span>

                    <span>This is just great cinema! The visual imagery and superior 5.1 DDSS tell a great story about these fascinating creatures. The narration is kept to a minimum, though the compositions of Eldon Ratheburn add a dimension in music enriching this production. Andy Kitzanuk's photography with the vision of Stephen Low truly make the beavers 'spectacular'. Every minute of this film is dramatic in sight, sound, or story. The humor is just spontaneous. I can't fathom the effort, time and money that went to making this production. "The Making of..." sequence begins to touch on that. It is well worth the effort.<BR> As an IMAX junkie, a father of two, and someone who loves nature, BEAVERS is time well spent. The kids love it, though I must admit, I have watched it more!! Few films in my DVD library are as entertaining for a group of professional thirtysomething adults too. I can't find a bad review on this one, and there is a definite reason. Enjoy it!!</span>

                    <span>If you like nature videos, you'll love this one! I've got about 15 IMAX DVD's and this is my favourite one! I was amazed at how good the video quality is. Everything is very bright, crisp, and clear. <BR> <BR> The DVD comes with extras, such as the making of this movie. <P>The only down side to this IMAX movie is that it is very short. It's approximately 30 minutes long.</span>

                    <span>In looking for the top rated IMAX DVDs to get for Christmas this one repeatedly came up as a five star just about everywhere I looked, and was never less than four stars. If you're an IMAX fan, outdoor/animal lover, or just want very high quality entertainment for your home, then you must consider adding this film to your collection. Its not just a kids film either, all of the adults in our family enjoy it just as much as the kids do.</span>
