                    <span>I was already a huge fan of Rebecca Lobo before reading this book. 'The Home Team' gives you a look into the lives of Rebecca and Ruthann Lobo. It's such a real look at how their lives truly are and how much they love each other. After reading this book I was blown away by the courage both of these amazing women have shown in thier lives.</span>

                    <span>I really love this book! I did not want to put it down. A couple of  reasons I love the book is because now I know she was a normal child once  and she did'nt always play basketball. I also liked it because her mom  talked about her life. Now I know they had problems just like any other  family does.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for all WNBA fans.  Rebecca Lobo's life is revealed in many aspects, that of her point of view and her mother.  It talks about many issues such as Ruthanne's struggle with breast cancer and how the family dealt with it.  As a 15 year old girl, reading is not one of my favorite pastimes.  When I heard of a book about my idol Rebecca Lobo, I decided maybe I should give reading a try.  I finished the story in a total of two days and found myself waking up in the middle of the night wanting to know what was going to happen next.  It is an extremely moving book in which I fould that it was very easy to relate to.  As a basketball player, some of Rebecca Lobo's theories such as playing basketball to relive stress and cope with problems I use also.   It gave a new perspective to why I am two different people a hustler and leader on the court and a shy and proscinator off of it.  Athlete or not, this book will get you moving.  It will leave the message in  your heard that anything is possible and it will help you to get out and reach that goal that you have been striving for.</span>

                    <span>I had the opportunity to meet the Lobos at a seminar, and they are as congenial in person as they appear in this fantastic book. Each personal chapter of this narrative made me feel like I was almost a part of the Lobo family. I liked reading about how Rebecca and her brother and sister grew up, what it was like to be part of a team as tight as the Huskies, and how the family dealt with RuthAnn's cancer. I have read this book over and over, and my mother and grandmother both love it as well. It is definitely worth sharing!</span>
