                <span id="Label1"><I>Sesame Street</I> veteran and Emmy Award-winner Mo Willems returns with a fast, funny follow-up to <I>Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!</I>--only this time, the short-tempered pigeon faces his perfect foil in a "special guest star" duckling.  In the previous <I>Pigeon</I> book, author and illustrator Willems expertly distilled the escalating emotions of preschoolers all too anxious to get their way. <I>The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog</I>--also a simple and sparsely illustrated story--explores the flip side of that coin, exposing the poker-face persuasive powers of young negotiators. The pigeon just wants to greedily eat the hot dog that he's found: "Oooooh! A hot dog! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!" Then along comes the duckling, "scooty scoot scoot!" with his insistent questions about hot dogs: "What do they taste like?...Would you say that it tastes like chicken?...Hey, I'm a curious bird." At first, the pigeon entertains the duckling, "Each morsel is a joy! A celebration in a bun!", but then he soon suspects the little bird might have designs on his delicious dog. In the end, of course, the clever duckling gets his way--and half of the hot dog: "You know, you're pretty smart for a duckling." (Ages Baby to Preschool) <I>--Paul Hughes</I></span>

                    <span>Poor Pigeon. He has the good fortune of finding a hotdog. It's just sitting there. So what's the problem? (Special guest star) Little Duckling won't give Pigeon a moment's peace to eat the hotdog. "Does it taste like chicken?" Duckling asks. The discussion escalates until it is finally resolved with a happy ending and a fairly understated lesson. Mo Willems' lively pastel colored drawings are simple but still expressive. A thoroughly enjoyable, excellent book. Karen Woodworth-Roman</span>

                    <span>I was shopping today for my nephew's birthday. I already had picked out an armload of children's picture books when I spotted The Pigeon Finds A Hot Dog. Not only did I laugh hysterically out loud in the middle of the regularly quiet bookstore, but I was also very impressed with the story dialogue and the simple, but unique style of illustration. At any rate, I put all the other books back on the shelves, and rushed to the counter to purchase the book. Now, I'm debating going back and buying a few more copies, one for my collection and a couple more for some friends. I highly recommend adding this to your library.</span>

                    <span>Who couldn't like the pigeon and now we meet a new friend. We weren't as thrilled with this book as we were with "Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus" but the lesson at the end makes up for that. Mo Willems has made two very lovable characters with strong personalities!! It's amazing that a book with such little dialogue can catch your heart. I miss the interaction of the first book but the lesson of sharing is one that you can't beat.</span>

                    <span>From Abbott and Costello to SpongeBob and Patrick and everyone in between, all great comedy duos have worked with a simple but effective formula: The straight man who sets things in motion, and the source of comedy who is either easily furiated (such as Costello in the "Who's on First?" routine) or dumber than the straight man (such as the bumbling starfish Patrick). Now, animator Mo Willems adds another duo to this long list: Pigeon and Duckling.<BR>Pigeon was the star of Willems' first book for children, DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!, in which he interacted with the reader by constantly pleading to drive a bus. Now, he has someone else to play off of, the cute but annoying Duckling. Duckling plays the part of the straight man as he approaches Pigeon, who is ready to greedily eat a hot dog he has found. Duckling distracts Pigeon by asking him a number of silly questions ("Would you say that it tastes like chicken?") Will Pigeon give in? Is there a possible solution to this conundrum?<BR>There is a simple lesson to be learned from this book, but it is also unique in its comedic style. An easily angred character such as Pigeon isn't seen very often in books for young children, and is a refreshing change from the goody-two-shoes, Dick-and-Jane type characters who always do the right thing. Children (and their parents) will most likely enjoy this simple story featuring a new comedic team who are sure to go far. Abbott and Costello were able to make audiences laugh with a routine about a baseball team. A routine about something as simple as a hot dog doesn't seem that far off.</span>

                    <span>This clever story is sure to delight fans of Willems first book as well as newcomers to the pigeon character. The book has simple illustrations that children love to draw with each character having its own unique charm. In addition to this the story will make both the young and young at heart laugh out loud. Six time Emmy award winner and Caldecott honoree Mo Willems looks to have the right mix to gain further recognition with this new book The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog. This is a must have for your childrens library.</span>
