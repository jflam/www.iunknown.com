                <span id="Label1">A hands-on book design students and designers alike will welcome.  <P>Elements of Design is a tribute to an exceptional teacher and a study of the abstract visual relationships that were her lifelong pursuit. Rowena Reed Kiostellow taught industrial design at Pratt Institute for more than fifty years and the designers she trained-and the designers they're training today-have changed the face of American design.   <P>This succinct, instructive, invaluable book reconstructs the series of exercises that led Kostellow's students from the manipulation of simple forms to the creation of complex solutions to difficult design problems. It includes her exercises and commentary along with selected student solutions, and concludes with examples of work from former students who became leaders in the field, including such well-known figures as Tucker Viemeisater, Ralph Applebaum, Ted Muehling, and many others.</span>

                    <span>This is a technical book that is an attempt to teach what RRK developed over a lifetime obsession with visual compositions. She did one thing, over and over, refining it over a long and productive career at Pratt, in Brooklyn. As such, I believe that it would best be used in the classroom, rather than as a simple read for those who want to understand modern design. Being ignorent about issues in studio design - really doing it, rather than observing it like I do - I got a lot out of it. But I will need to refer to it and read through many more times to truly absorb the exercises. For what it is, the book is a masterpiece as an exercise in visual thinking and the method left its imprint on many of the greatest American designers from before WWII to the 1980s.<P>Recommended, but for designers rather than design critics.</span>

                    <span>I agree with one of the reviewers in that the rules presented in this text should not be applied loosely and expected to produce "a beautiful design". As far as industrial design goes it still is not even so great. HOWEVER what it does teach is basic 3-dimensional design. There are lessons in here that anyone who works in a 3-d medium (interior, industrial, fashion, sculpture, etc) should be fluent in. I did the exercises and it has allowed me to get such a tighter grasp on my work and understand all the subtle effects I can produce in it. It is also invaluable to me as a reference guide. Study this book in order to help develop your sense of 3 dimensional structure and compositions but not as a base for design education (only because design incorporates much more than "beauty").</span>

                    <span>The book is old and pretentious. It describes Design as it was some sort of a religion (with Roweena as its prophet), that a Designer needs to stick to some basic rules, in order to generate a beautiful product. <BR>It doesn't really take the engineering part into consideration. For example, that a functional product kept very simple is usually beautiful. <BR>Also it hardly has any examples and some of the few are about 30 to 40 years old and not really convincing either.<BR>Maybe this book explains why most cars from the 70ties are somewhat unsightly. <BR>And last but not least the letters are pretty small, a pain to read.</span>

                    <span>I was a student of Miss Reed's (1972-73), even have her hand written notes in my class notebook that I kept, and have always kept these notes close to me, they included everything that she wrote on the blackboard at Pratt Studio. This book will become the the most valuable guide and should be in the library of every designer. So glad to see this book happened, to share some of her teachings. The first thing that I have written in my class journal:" Structural principles parallel visual analysis can create an aesthetic disipline." the next line is "I don't like to go around saying that gray haired men were my students, but they were.."(former student, now GM executive dropping by her class to say hello) then back to her lecture, basic relationships: volume,plane,line,value,texture,color,space. This book covers these topics.</span>

                    <span>I was a student of Ms. Reed at New York's Pratt Institute. This work by Gail Hannah is an important, and accurate, description of Reed's visual design methodology that has had far reaching positive consequences for our nation. Anyone seeking to understand how the visual design of three-dimensional objects can be taught, and subsequently successfully implemented, will appreciate this book. The practice of designing three-dimenional objects for use by people is an oft misunderstood subject since it is not conventional engineering nor an art unto itself. Industrial design is a unique combination of skills that forms a bridge between the end user of objects and the manufacturer. Hannah's work on Ms. Reed, her origins, and her teaching technique, begins to fill the gap in our knowledge of American ingenuity and our ability to invent. Highly recommended.</span>
