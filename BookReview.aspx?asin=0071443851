                    <span>This book was just right for us. It had the right mix of exercises that made the DMAIC steps more fun to teach and ensured that the class got engaged with the material.
<br />
<br />I liked the fact that it also had exercises on Change Management and Team Dynamics
<br />
<br />What I found most useful was the website that gives all datasets and template which made preparation for the exercises a breeze.
<br />
<br />Here is the website it would be hard to use without the book but you can go take a look and see if has stuff that interests you.

                    <span>The title lured me to purchase this book -- what I have found are a lot of stale exercises with some slight changes.  I have really found nothing that I can add to how I train GB, BB, and MBBs from this book.  Here are my 2 biggest observations:
<br />
<br />Target audience -- appears that this was written for professional organizational teachers and not the MBBs that typically pitch the Six Sigma training.  Shared this with several of my peers (MBBs) and they quickly lost interest.  Too much effort appears to have been focused on the styling of the book rather than the substance of the exercises.  
<br />
<br />Timing -- quite a few of the exercises require way too much time to set up, conduct, and debrief. The return on this time really will not provide an illustration of the concept and application of the tools.  Looks like a couple of the data analysis exercises will require a large amount of time to enter the data provided, and then share this with the students.</span>
