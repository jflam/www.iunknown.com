                    <span>Thank you Kevin Boyle for writing about Dr. Ossian Sweet, an important, yet forgotten figure in the Civil Rights Movement.  The reader gets a great understanding of the racially tense times in which Sweet lived.  Back in the 1920s, a Klansman lost the Detroit mayor's race by a minor technicality.  There also was a strong Klan presence in the city's police department.  In addition, Sweet knew of other blacks who had been terrorized when they tried to integrate white neighborhoods in Detroit.  It only was natural that he would try to protect his home.  This book should be required reading for high school and college American history courses. The courtroom drama in the second half of the book is very intense and reads like a novel.

                    <span>This history of race in the twenties shows the way that racist prejudice almost became endemic in the North in the wake of the Great Migration. The gripping story of Ossian Sweet, determined to escape ghettoization, and the trial for murder that resulted from the encounter with a mob trying to drive him out of a white neighborhood, shows a side of America that we have forgotten, and yet whose underground strains still haunt us. Around this incident the author weaves the details of the era of the massive emigration from the south to the industrial belt of the North, and the resulting tide of prejudice fed by the (northern) Klu Klux Klan. The trial of Sweet, defended by Darrow, created a partial counterreaction to the tragic collision, in the first intimations of the Civil Rights movement a generation later. But as the author points out the malformation of American cities under the shadow of disguised segregation still endures with a legacy inherited from this period. This important vignette gives a dose of reality, and is a reminder of some of the hidden sides to the cancer of racism in American society. </span>

                    <span>Professor Boyle does an excellent job in bringing the charged racial atmosphere of Detroit and other northern U.S. cities in this well-researched history of an alleged murder conspiracy by a group of African Americans threatened by a white mob in Detroit.  As a product of suburban Detroit schools, this important incident was never mentioned in my schooling and Professor Boyle should be commended for bringing it to light.
<br />
<br />The book cannot be awarded five stars, however, despite winning a National Book Award, since the sprinkling of errors throughout the book (as well as those mentioned by others, the "Little Rock, Arkansas, an hour's train ride from...Tulsa" statement (p.245)--the two cities are 276 miles apart by road, making it at least a four hour train ride)tarnished an otherwise excellent read.
<br />
<br />With this caveat, this is a highly recommended history of a critical criminal case in the unfolding of 20th century U.S. history.

                    <span>This is a compelling and finely written history of the Ossian Sweet matter, culminating in the dramatic trial in which the defendants were represented by Clarence Darrow and Arthur Hays.  It is very hard to put down and Boyle brings the reader into the front row of the action.
<br />
<br />But this book is also a distressing and honest look at American society in the 1920s and the rampant racism infecting northern cities for the first time, as blacks began to migrate north.  None of the other reviewers even mention this aspect of the book and I think it the most powerful.  This is not merely a crime drama, although it is that too.  It is a vivid depiction of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the north, the mob rule that spread like wildfire through Detroit, Gary, Washington, Springfield, Tulsa, and many other cities, and the terror that was inflicted daily on people who had allegedly been set free 60 years earlier.  I do not know  much about the history of black America during the 1920s, and it was a series of horrifying revelations.  I am surprised that none of the reviewers has come away from reading this book with the same sense of dreary remorse as I felt. </span>

                    <span>This is a very good and well researched book but I'm surprised it won the National Book Award due to the flaws it does have.  This is from the new school of writing which makes the reader wish there was a limit on the time an author may spend researching his book.  The result is more a list of facts with words to join them together than a story. Ossian Sweet probably passed a man named Robert in the hall, who research shows was the janitor - who cares? (this is not an actual quote from the book).  Worse yet is the lack of objectivity.  America's record of race relations is horrible enough on its own that attempts to exaggerate it are unproductive.  When whites kill a black man in this book they slaughter viciously without provocation, but when blacks kill policemen in random acts they are frightened and make a mistake.  Again, the facts are shocking and tell the story, no 'spin' is necessary.  Beyond these substantive flaws are inexcusably basic editing problems.  Winning the National Book Award should take more than spell-check.  Pouring and poring are both words, but they're not the same word, nor are peak and peek interchangeable.  I don't mean to be overly negative, this is an important book about a period in general and events in particular which deserve to be written about well, and Mr. Boyle does so.  But if this is truly the best non-fiction book of last year let's call it a lean year and look forward to 2005.</span>
