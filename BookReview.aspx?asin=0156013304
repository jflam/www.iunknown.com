                <span id="Label1"><div>From nuclear superpower to impoverished nation, post-communist Russia has become one of the most corrupt regimes in the world.  Paul Klebnikov pieces together the previous decade in Russian history, showing that a major piece of "the decline of Russia' puzzle lies in the meteoric business career of Boris Berezovsky. <br>Transforming himself from a research scientist to Russia's most successful dealmaker, Berezovsky managed to seize control of Russia's largest auto manufacturer, largest TV network, national airline, and one of the world's biggest oil companies. When Moscow's gangster families battled one another in the Great Mob War of 1993-1994, Berezovsky was in the thick of it. He was badly burned by a car bomb and his driver was decapitated. A year later, Berezovsky emerged as the prime suspect in the assassination of the director of the TV network he acquired. Although plagued by scandal, he enjoyed President Yeltsin's support, serving as the personal financial "advisor" to both Yeltsin and his family.  In 1996, Berezovsky organized the financing of Yeltsin's re-election campaign-a campaign marred by fraud, embezzlement, and attempted murder. Berezovsky became the President's most trusted political advisor-playing a key role in forming governments and dismissing prime ministers. <br>	Based on hundreds of taped interviews with top businessmen and government officials, secret police reports, contractual documents, and surveillance tapes, Godfather of the Kremlin is both a gripping story and a unique historical document.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I lived in Russia long enough to know when a story had the ring of truth to it. Berezovsky as the driving force of evil in the new Russia didn't ring loudly enough. Whatever its flaws, Klebnikov's book would have been much better served simply telling the story of Russia instead of singling out Berezovsky as the hook for readers.<P>In the middle of his legal problems he called looking for help finding authentic information about Berezovsky. Paul's sources had all clammed up and he was desperate to document information his sources had apparently told him earlier for his Forbes article and subsequent research, specifically documentation showing that Berezovsky was a "gangster". During our conversation he complained that Berezovsky's reputation had grown far out of proportion. I gently reminded him that, on the international stage, he had played a significant role in forming that reputation. He agreed, seeming, at least in some measure, to regret it.<P>In the brief time we had together, he struck me as a very bright, personable fellow, well meaning, diligent, and determined -- a good person. His murder is a great loss. My condolences to his wife and family.</span>

                    <span>Paul Klebnikov died yesterday (7/10/04) in Moscow because he had the courage to print the truth as he uncovered it through relentless investigative journalism. Anyone--such as some of the reviewers at this site--who dismisses this book because of some trivial libel suit brought by Berezovsky in London is making a mistake. Klebnikov was no small-time journalist with an axe to grind. He had a PhD in Russian history from the London School of Economics and was a senior editor for Forbes magazine. He was an American of Russian heritage who spoke Russian fluently and who used his abilities to investigate the looting of Russia that took place in the early 1990's. He loved Russia and wrote what he learned about the looting that was going on.<P>Everything Klebnikov says in this book can also be found in The Oligarchs by Hoffman (Washington Post), Putin's Russia by Shevtsova (Carnegie Endowment) and The Tragedy of Russia's Reforms by Reddaway (George Washington University). They all cite and/or quote Klebnikov with approval.<P>I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants an introduction to the murky world of Russian privatization during the '90's.<P>Incidentally, Berezovsky actually took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to tell the world he is not a crook. However, like some of the other oligarchs, he is wanted in Russia for tax evasion, fraud, etc. Read the book and find out all about him.</span>

                    <span>Sadly, I did not pick up Paul Klebnikov's book until July 9, 2004, the day of his gruesome murder. I have always had a passing interest in Russian culture and was a reader, and admirer, of Mr. Klebnikov's pieces in Forbes. <P>-Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism- reads like a novel. However, these events did happen, despite the blind eye Mr. Yeltsin turned. Mr. Klebnikov puts together strong arguments and raises some disturbing questions as to what was going on in Russia during the 1990's. <P>Further, his murder has done nothing but confirm, in my eyes, what he had written and discovered.<P>I hope others continue his work, and I hope Forbes continues to employ those with Paul Klebnikov's thirst for knowledge and truth. <P>I send my deepest regrests to his family.</span>
