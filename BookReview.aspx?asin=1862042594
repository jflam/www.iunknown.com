                    <span>I got this book to help me choose a suitable color scheme for my office, to improve productivity and provide harmony and contentment.<p>I didn't find exactly what I was looking for, as the chapters on office colors are not detailed enough for my required purpose, but I found so many other interesting things that I kept it anyway.<p>Having more than a passing interest in Feng Shui, and aromatherapy, this book was quite entertaining reading, but quite honestly, I didn't dwell too long on the sections on the healing powers of color.<p>It is well presented, and well illustrated, and covers a wide range of topics related to color, and some you didn't realise were influenced by color.</span>
