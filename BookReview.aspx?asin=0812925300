                <span id="Label1">An insightful, witty, and well-written analysis of the effects of mass-media on women in late 20th-century American culture. Douglas cuts through the fluff that spews from the tube with a finely-honed sense of the absurd that can forever change (or minimally, inform) how you perceive the changing portrayals of women by the media. The only book I know of that has been given highest recommendations by Gloria Steinem, The McLaughlin Group, and Amazon.com. </span>

                    <span>this book is very readable, but I found if you do not know much about the tv shows she talks about, it really isn't that interesting or imforative. I do know a bit about I Dream of Jeanie and Bewitched, so I found the particular chapter on these two tv shows very informative. However, some of the other chapters seemed a bit dull if I had no other knowledge of the shows, movies, etc that were being talked about. Don't get me wrong, it is very readable, but for me it was harder to stay with it if I had no prior to fall back on. Also, maybe it was me, but I don't know if it went deep enough into the issue of mass media and how it reflects on women.</span>

                    <span>To begin with, feminism is about finding a suitable subject position for "female", "feminine", "woman."  Douglas explores the subject position of the feminine in pop culture -- and does it rather well. Some attacks listed here are uninformed about the purposes of feminism, or assume that feminism is designed to do something anti-male.  For instance, "Harpe" you claim that "Government-funded child care, taxpayer-supported abortions, national health insurance, Social Security for homemakers, and many other socialist policies" are socialistic rather than feministic.  But maybe that's because your idea of what feminism is remains limited to the outmoded belief that feminism is about equal rights with men (well, white men).  What Susan Douglas does here IS feminism and the only way your Civil War nostalgic mind can get past it is to disregard it as socialist (and since when did social responsibility become a BAD thing?).  The things Douglas addresses in this book support equality not special privileges -- for instance funding for homemakers provides security should the heteronormic imperative (also known as marriage) fail or be, gasp, undesirable.  Why do some readers fail to see that it is men who have special rights by having independence from domesticity in a way that women do not have (particularly in Alabama -- I know, I live here too).  For those of you who might have picked this book up to find out "Where the Girls are" for your own misogynistic reasons, put it down now; go read something like Susan Bordo's _The Male Body_; find out what feminism REALLY is and what it hopes to achieve; then come back and read Douglas's book.  Until then, vote for Bush and Riley, admire Thomas Jefferson, attend a Civil War re-enactment and stay out of the new millennium.</span>

                    <span>I have read some of this book, and I know what writer Susan Douglas means when she talks about how the media unrealistically portrays women. Take, for example, today's commercials.  Even though we are already in the 21st century, the commercials I see on TV look like they never left the 50s.  Just about every commercial for food, baby, cleaning, and other products portrays women as wives and mothers.  These commercials constantly say, "Moms know...", "Moms need...", or "Mama's got the magic...".  These commercials give the impression that every woman out there is a wife and a mom.  Needless to say, that's TV, not reality.  Not every woman in real life is a mom or wife.  Some, like me, are neither.  In addition, a lot of us (even the married ones with kids) work outside the home.  We women know what we're really like, and we don't buy those unrealistic images.</span>

                    <span>I borrowed this book from my sister who was reading it for school. I found it incredibly interesting. The book traces the history of women and how the media has portrayed them. Although it is used in feminism and media classes, it reads nothing like a textbook. Although it is nonfiction, it is a quick, informative, entertaining, and engaging read. I highly  reccomend it.</span>

                    <span>While I found this book to be breezily written and often entertaining, I also found it to be very one-sided in its knowledge of and presentation of primetime entertainment television history.<p>To read Ms. Douglas's book, one could easily come away with the belief that not a single "positive" image of American womanhood has ever been broadcast in the history of the small screen.  The world set forth in "Where the Girls Are" is one where women were constantly demeaned by the media; and the real-life women of the time (one assumes) willingly, ignorantly accepted these images and these programs which (one also gathers) were created and broadcast by a group of 100% male, women-hating producers, writers and network execs. <p>To make the above myopic point, Douglas ignores entire genres and entire series.  In her book, she makes no mention of Barbara Stanwyck on "The Big Valley" or Anne Francis on "Honey West" or of the series "The Nurses"; or of the popular anthology programs of the era often hosted by the likes of Stanwyck, Jane Wyman and Loretta Young; or of the variety shows of the time also often helmed by women; or of the constant presence of individuals like Kitty Carlisle, Faye Emerson or Arlene Francis and their witty, wise contributions to the primetime panel programs also of the time.  <p>She also makes no mention of Yvonne Craig or Julie Newmar on "Batman" or of Pat Crowley's avant-garde mom on "Please Don't Eat the Daisies" and she unfairly dismisses "Our Miss Brooks" as just a "husband-hunter," failing to recognize her as the competent professional she was.  Instead, Douglas prefers to take easy shots at the usual TV targets-"Charlie's Angels," "I Dream of Jeannie" and the poor, much-maligned Donna Reed, among others. <p>By focusing only on the popular targets, Douglas fails to put her subject (TV programs) in a proper context.  If Lucy or Donna Reed were unfair images to beam into the homes of the young women of the 1950s and `60s, was Gomer Pyle, Gilligan or Ralph Kramden an inspiring image for young males?  And if young men were able to watch shows like "Gilligan's Island," et.al. and suffer no ill-affects then why doesn't Douglas have faith in young women that they too could and did do the same thing?<p>Furthermore, in order to build her case of all-bad-female-images-all-the-time, she carefully prunes away episodes of many series which do not support her thesis.  For example, she chastises the "Bionic Woman" for often sending its lead, Lindsey Wagner, undercover in traditionally female occupations as a nun or a roller derby queen.  She ignores the times the series sent Jamie Sommers undercover as a scientist, a race car driver or a police woman.  (She further dislikes that the "Bionic Woman's" day job was as school teacher; a diss that seems to degrade the hundreds of women all over the country who, proudly teach America's next generation.)   <p>In regard to undercover roles, Douglas has the same criticism of "Angels," again not mentioning the times that the trio went undercover as female football players, truck drivers, stuntwomen or even joined the military for a particular case.  <p>Concerning "The Flying Nun," Douglas focuses only on the Sister's clumsy, slapstick landings in the few two or three episodes of the series, choosing to ignore the rest of season one and all of seasons two and three where's Sally Field's ability to fly often saved the convent, saved the day, and even saved lives.     <p>And sometimes she misreads programs entirely.  She upbraids "Wonder Woman" stating that Wonder Woman's alter ego, Diana Prince, always showed up at the office in  "low-cut dresses."  Actually, the first season of this series was set during WWII, when Ms. Prince wasn't Wonder Woman, she was in an official Army uniform.  Later, when the series was moved ups to present day, Prince's daytime wear was always appropriate to the workplace.  Did Douglas even watch an episode?<p>"Where the Girls Are" is a thought-provoking work but I believe it must be read with a critical eye.  To accept all its arguments without questioning does an enormous disservice to the women, in front of the camera and behind it (and, yes, there were many) who created these long-lasting, enduring programs and images.  I also can't help but think that it also does a disservice to the women, young and mature, then and now, who watch/watched these programs and felt not only entertained by them but also often empowered by them.</span>
