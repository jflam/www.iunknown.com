                    <span>This is a fine, short guide to managing conflict. Author Tim Ursiny particularly addresses those of you who are "conflict cowards," people who do not like conflict...and who does, outside of a few well-compensated litigaters? Ursiny himself is a confessed hater of conflict. He has hated it ever since he was a child and now, even though he's an executive coach and a fairly beefy guy, he still hates it. He is also a psychologist, and his style and approach have much in common with the work of other pop psychology writers, although this guide is more useful than most. Ursiny keeps the reading light by providing ample anecdotes and he invites readers to participate through several self-examination questionnaires. He provides some clearly written, easily accessible explanations of how conflicts occur and how to manage them. In fact, he defines conflict, its consequences and even its benefits so broadly that almost anyone fits the book's target audience. You got a problem with that? We doesn't and warmly recommend this entertaining, refreshing book, which - we agree - has something for almost everyone who'd rather duck than fight.</span>

                    <span>This book is phenomenal and the best I have read on the subject.  Very few people have the experience Tim does, as both a psychologist and successful businessman, so he has great credibility.  His system/process makes dealing with conflict a breeze.  And I love his humor.  I feel connected with him and trust his advice.  I highly recommend this book!<p>Michael Charest <br>Speaker, Coach<br>BUSINESS GROWTH SOLUTIONS<br>and<br>COACH & GROW R.I.C.H.<br>(...)<br>"Grow your business, grow your life!"<br>(...)</span>

                    <span>The Coward's Guide to Conflict is a great tool for every day life in the workplace and at home.  Utilizing everyday people and situations Dr. Ursiny explains why we behave in the manner that we do and then gives tools to help change those behaviors to lead to more positive results and a better understanding of ourselves and others. It takes the fear out of conflict. It should be in every household and office.</span>

                    <span>Ursiny uses examples to illustrate his points so well - one example looked like it came right out of my work environment - as if he was a fly on the wall!  No one likes to face conflict and we are all pretty good at avoidance.  This book helps one understand conflict and, most inmportantly, how to face and resolve it in an honest, respectful and EFFECTIVE way.  FIVE STARS!!!!!</span>

                    <span>There's nothing Dr. Ursiny has left out of this easy to read and follow book. Since more than 80% of all people are non-confrontational this guide helps everyone understand others and prepares them for any difficult conversation. As a business coach I have used and recommended the book to all of my clients who struggle with getting their point across and being heard in a contentious/confrontational situation.<br>The book is complete and is a guide deserving to be utilized by everyone.<br>Great Job!!</span>
