                <span id="Label1"><P> In <I>The Virtue of Prosperity,</I> Dinesh D'Souza examines the spiritual and social crisis spawned by the new economy and new technologies of the last ten years. D'Souza questions the basic premise of the American dream that prosperity and "progress" will better the human condition. Anchored in history, rich in anecdote, and supported by state-of-the-art data, <I>The Virtue of Prosperity</I> is a tough-minded critique of our high-tech culture, with a surprising prescription for doing well and doing good.</span>

                    <span>Business people rank among the biggest victims of unfair criticism. Blamed for greed, exploitation and selfishness, business people generally fail to defend themselves or assert their positive status. Instead, they continue holding the country together through productive activity that generates tax revenues and high standards of living. <P>Thanks to a book by Dinesh D'Souza, they have a well-articulated defense of their status that extends beyond moneymaking. As D'Souza points out in The Virtue of Prosperity-Finding Values in an Age of Techno-Affluence (The Free Press, 2000, $26), business is about more than earning dollars. It is about realizing dreams through sacrifice, work, vision and an ability to satisfy society's needs. The pursuit of business not only is an economic endeavor but a noble endeavor, D'Souza believes.<P>An enthusiastic free market advocate who immigrated from India and was graduated from Dartmouth College, D'Souza focuses his attention on the boom of the high tech industry, which turned many ordinary people into millionaires almost overnight. The growth of capitalism, he notes, has led to unprecedented general prosperity.<P>An annual survey of freshmen conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA and reported by Alex P. Kellogg in the Jan. 26 Chronicle of Higher Education reveals that nearly three quarters of first-year college students say they want to be very well off. Only 28.1 percent report an interest in keeping current with political affairs.<P>D'Souza acknowledges that capitalism unleashes vast social and economic changes that alienate people and create an intensive need for spiritual fulfillment. He realizes that for many people, capitalism will not solve a search for meaning.<P>Also, social hierarchies are an inevitable outcome of the scramble for success in capitalist societies. However, these inequalities are not arbitrary accidents of birth. "The rich are today the hardest working people in society, and they refuse to...work less or stop working, even if they can easily afford to."<P>The ability to turn an area of enthusiastic interest and energetic resolve into prosperity for oneself and others drives the successful business person and also explains the hostility to the capitalist by those who look behind a haze of envy for not receiving the same rewards.<P>Despite economic gaps between rich and poor, one does not find instability or conflict as in other cultures because "technological capitalism is a powerful catalyst of enduring equality among citizens," he says. Indeed, higher standards of living make life better for all, with those at the bottom in America society considered privileged by the poverty-stricken in non-capitalist Third World countries. This result, D'Souza believes, elevates capitalism to a moral good so long as it retains the goal not of "I win, you lose," but "I win and therefore you win, too."</span>

                    <span>Dinesh did it again with this piece of literary genius! Well maybe it isn't genius, but it is informative and entertaining.<P>In "The Virture of Prosperity" D'Souza makes an argument for capitalism based around the compassion that affluence had brought to this country. This book should counter every anti-globalization textbook in the classroom in order to provide a fair and balanced view of our supper-affluent society. <P>Relatively short, easy to read, and full of stats and figures to amaze your friends with, this book would make a great paper-back to pick up asap!<P>The only shortcoming would be that it was written before 9/11 so some of the flowery imagery of our future seem a tad bittersweet.</span>

                    <span>I like most of Dinesh D'Souza's books, but this book was a bit dry. I guess maybe the subject matter didn't really lend itself to a full book. It just couldn't hold my attention. While some parts were somewhat interesting--such as, the discussion of the super-rich, and who owns what in America. Overall I would pass on this book. I can recommend his other books, though.</span>

                    <span>I am absolutely amazed at the breadth of D'Souza's knowledge. This is my first Dinesh book and it certainly won't be the last. <P>After reading that he was a policy analyst for Ronald Reagan and was a member of both the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, I expected the book to make a much firmer stance on the issues. I am pleasantly surprised at the respect that D'Souza gives to all arguments. He really considers every viewpoint before moving on.<P>The topic at hand I would summarize down to "the ethics and morality of capitalism and technological progress." What I found was a very intellectual (for a grass-roots type of book) work that bounced between technophile and technophobe viewpoints, liberal and conservative viewpoints, and touched upon a huge diversity of subjects such as philosophy, sociology, psychology, politics, and biology, among others. By the way, I minored in Philosophy, and D'Souza seems to have a firmer grasp of philosophical concepts than I ever had! D'Souza has a deft touch that makes his book at once highly readable, intellectually stimulating, and thought provoking.</span>

                    <span>"Most of us are more successful than we ever dreamed we could be." <BR> This quote pretty accurately sums up the disillusion rampant throughout D'Souza's book. The truth behind the "unprecedented prosperity" he speaks of is that the majority of Americans' incomes have dropped in the last 10 years. Only the extremely wealthy have gained. For D'Souza and his millionaire fans, "all is right with the world," the same kind of blind optimism that Voltaire lambasted in Pangloss. Poverty is growing (already at 40 million people), unemployment is high, and things are getting worse. All the while, the greatest challenge for D'Souza is for the rich to learn how to "be happy with our success", rich-speak for drowning ourselves in our own wealth, thereby ignoring all the ills of the world. Avoid this book if you can, it's a supreme waste of time (although it can be redeemed in a warm fireplace). However, if you must read the book, under whatever sick compulsion, then do so quickly, and afterwards pick up some common sense by reading Candide. It's a quick read and still relevant against fools like D'Souza and our generation's hollow men.</span>
