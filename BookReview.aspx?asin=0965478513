                    <span>How can one possibly expect someone to tell a 4 year journey in one book? Well that's why Ted Simon wrote a "second" Jupiters Travel. If you enjoyed Jupiters Travel, dont hesitate to buy Riding High. It gives you  more insight into how Ted travelled, what went on in his mind and life.  Especially that he shares his "settling down" years made the book  a good read.</span>

                    <span>Point to ponder:  Ted Simon muses that "The interruptions ARE the journey".  This book causes one to think about priorities in life and what drives them.  Ted writes from a British perspective and humor and  provides an insightful description of the real world as he passes through  it.  He describes his travel brilliantly as penetrating life's mysteries.   He has been robbed, imprisoned, threatened and hospitalized.  He has gone  from ecstatic to despondent, but continued on, speaking to the therapeutic  effects the motorcycle had on him (and his digestion).  He showed keen  insight into his fellow travelers as well as the indigenous peoples he  observed in the many locales visited.  I enjoyed his command of language  and appreciated the level to which he writes.  I scrambled for my lexicon  and index of foreign phrases, for I enjoy the chase of literature.   I was  mindful of the BMW Anonymous tradition in which a rider can always find  help due to his association with the marque.  Ted created his own contact  list as he moved along.  It seems that we are really on a very small  planet.  I enjoyed the lessons in cultures such as the four Indian groups  and an understanding of the caste system from which escape is impossible.   Also, Ted provided valuable and interesting tidbits of history and cultural  mores which some might find distasteful but are fascinating to me.  This  book fills in the gaps left by the first book "Jupiter's Travels.  It  continues to be an account of contradictions and inner struggles of wants  and needs, both real and preceived as he marries and attempts to settle  down in California.  This is a real guy who suffers like the rest of us and  shows us grit.  I am envious of his experiences for I know that sharing  them vicariously is as close as I will get.  Read the book!</span>

                    <span>I read this book... oh! so, so many years ago as a fresh undergraduate in England and,twenty years hence,is among the handful of books I remember vividly. I was drawn to the book simply because I had planned a similar  trip in 1975(hitch-hiking) and never got to do it. Being from the East I  can vouch for a number of his Asian narratives and some of his Mid-Eastern  stories (I was later based in that region). His free-wheeeling (no pun   intended) style of story telling is punctuated with enough humor and  philosophy to make it a wonderful read. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Riding High is a wonderful companion to Jupiter?s Travels. In it Ted Simon elaborates upon his four-year trip around the world and he also tells us about how hard it was for him to come to terms with journey?s end!   Settling into married life in Mill Valley is a far cry from living a  constantly changing, exciting life in the glorious here and now for four  years! Ted makes us feel his struggle to adapt.  He does this very  tellingly by interspersing some domestic scenes with on-the road scenes.   For myself, I felt claustrophobic when I read about his domestic life and  longed for him to be on the road again.  However, I think these scenes help  us understand his dilemma: how can he reconcile a longing to be on the move  with a yearning for the simple life in one place?   It becomes apparent  that Ted, although a compassionate and friendly person, is at heart a bit  of a lone wolf!  All the travel scenes are great, particularly those in  India and South America and the book is full of fascinating information and  insights, all of which Ted shares with us in his usual honest, articulate  and engaging way.</span>
