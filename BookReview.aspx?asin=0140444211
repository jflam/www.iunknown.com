                    <span>As one of the early works of political inquiry, Aristotle's "The Politics" is one of those must-read books for anyone interested in political science.  Aristotle often makes reference in this work to one of the other great works of early political inquiry, Plato's "The Republic".  In fact, "The Politics" seems in many ways to be an answer to Plato's work and ideas.
<br />
<br />Of course, there are many obvious differences between the two works.  The most obvious of these differences is the manner in which the material is presented to the reader.  "The Politics" is presented in a way more familiar to modern readers.  The book reads as if it were written today.  The translator frequently remarks on how "The Politics" resembles notes assembled for a lecture.
<br />
<br />Aristotle is also more interested in the variety and strengths and weaknesses of the various constitutions that he comes across in ancient Greece.  Aristotle does not concern himself so much with the ideal state as with the idea of what a state and its purpose exactly are.  To Aristotle, the ideal constitution is the one that allows the state to fulfill its purpose.
<br />
<br />The present echoes far more with the ideas and language of Aristotle than it does with that of Plato.  However, this does not exactly make Aristotle a progressive or even centrist figure relative to modern times.  Aristotle was very restrictive in his concept of citizenship and believed that there were people born to be masters and those born to be slaves.  As with many Greeks of the day, Aristotle did not even discuss the role of women in society in any capacity outside of marriage and child bearing.  However, reading Aristotle with an understanding of his world allows one to not get too worked up about his more regressive attitudes.  After all, he died over 2300 years ago.
<br />
<br />While I do not have a high opinion of Aristotle's work on its own merits, it is vitally important to read him if you wish to progress through the history of Western political thought.  Aristotle defined the terms of political discourse in the West well up into the 19th century and "The Politics" is the primary work from which those terms were drawn.</span>

                    <span>Aristotle's constitutional theory is the most important aspect of this book.  Every high school world history should become familiar with the 6 forms of government that Aristotle identifies, and every college poli-sci student should commit Aristotle's analysis into their core knowledge.  
<br />
<br />Of course Aristotle lived in a time when social norms were different.  Much of what he writes applies to a different age, but the constitutional theory of government remains a timeless set of observations -- especially important in our times.</span>

                    <span>I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle.</span>

                    <span>Aristotle's Proportional Equality
<br />
<br />         Aristotle does not believe in equality, but proportional equality. He believes that people are naturally different in their intelligence and moral qualities, that these qualities naturally give them differing arete (this word has been translated into:goodness, excellence, merit and virtue), and that they should naturally be given different political rights based on these arete. However, Aristotle does not have any viable methods for detecting the nature of people. Instead, he artificially locks rulers, citizens and slaves into three unequal classes based on wealth and birth, and he tries to appease the lower classes with deceptive schemes. From its very core, Aristotle's proportional equality is unfair and does not allow freedom. 
<br />
<br />      In Book Three, Aristotle establishes the theory that political equality does not mean everyone getting the same as everyone else. He believes that different groups of people in the city have equally valid claims to political rights based on differing criteria. To him, the different interest groups are, "The people at large, the wealthy, the better sort, the one who is best of all, the tyrant" (1281a11)
<br />
<br />       In fact, Aristotle states that political equality for one of these groups will always be inequality for the other groups. He claims, 
<br />
<br />      "For example, justice is considered to mean equality. It does mean equality-but equality for those who are equal, and not for all. Again inequality is considered to be just; and indeed it is-but only for those who are unequal, and not for all." (1280a7) 
<br />
<br />      After rejecting the distribution of political rights according to the interests of various groups, Aristotle states that the right basis by which political rights should be conferred is the degree of arete one contributes to the city. Through this, proportional equality could be achieved. He writes, 
<br />
<br />      "Those who contribute most to this association have a greater share in the city than those who are equal to them (or even greater) in free birth and descent, but unequal in civic excellence (arete), or than those who surpass them in wealth but are surpassed by them in excellence (arete)." (1281a2)
<br />
<br />        The rationale for this proportional equality based on arete is simple: the city "exists for the sake of a good life*" (1252b27), and the good life is only achieved with arete. Therefore, naturally those who have more arete should be given more political rights because they can best utilize the resources of the city to make life good for all. Aristotle establishes the full connection between good life of the city and arete in Book Seven.
<br />
<br />        This connection can be summarized as the following: the city is for the best life possible, the best life is the life of happiness, happiness requires action, and action is the exercise of "arete".  Aristotle first defines the good life as the life that aims at happiness. He says that the object of the city "is the best and highest life possible. The highest good is happiness..." (1328a26). Aristotle also proposes that "happiness is a state of activity; and the actions of just and temperate men bring many fine things to fulfillment." (1325a16) The purpose of activity or action, "praxis", however, is exactly to do or achieve "arete". Aristotle writes, happiness is realized by "the actualization and perfect practice (praxis) of goodness (arete)" (1328a26).
<br />
<br />         The structure of the differing arete is as follows: Aristotle states that the rulers/statesmen have the arete of good man which allows them to rule, the citizens have the arete of good citizen that allows them to rule and be ruled, and the non-citizens/slaves have only enough arete that they are condemned to obedience. 
<br />
<br />        To Aristotle, the reason that people have different arete is that they naturally have different levels of intelligences and moral qualities. And since these qualities are what make a person and a city good, people are allotted proportionally equal but unequal political rights. On intelligence, he believes that some are just intrinsically better. For example, regarding slaves, he says, 
<br />
<br />         "...(and this is the case with all whose function is bodily service, and who produce their best when they supply such service)-all such are by nature slaves...... if he participates in reason to the extent of apprehending it in another, though destitute of it himself." (1254b16)
<br />
<br />         On moral qualities, in Chapter One of Book Seven, Aristotle says that external goods are not as important as moral goods are for achieving happiness, however, only some are capable of achieving high morality. He says, 
<br />
<br />      "you can see for yourselves that the happy life-no matter whether it consists in pleasure, or goodness, or both-belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost..." (1323a21) 
<br />
<br />       In Chapter Two, he makes it clear that the statesmen and philosophers, in another word, the rulers are most fit for the cultivation of morality and intelligence, which combines to be their arete. And since the goodness of the state needs morality, those statesmen and philosophers should rule. He writes, 
<br />
<br />      "Here, we may say, are the two ways of life-the political and the philosophic-that are evidently chosen by those who have been most eager to win a reputation for goodness (arete), in our own and in previous ages...for whether individuals or cities are in question, wisdom must aim at the higher mark." (1324a19) 
<br />
<br />       Certainly, Aristotle is right in pointing out that there exist differences between people. For a state to operate well, the people who are more equipped for intellectual and moral tasks should have more political rights. And if there really are those who have no "deliberative elements" in their soul, then certainly those people should be under the command of a master if not a doctor. There is an identical interest between the good rulers and the ruled, which Aristotle rightly points out in Book One,
<br />
<br />       "The part and the whole, like the body and the soul, have an identical interest; and the slave is a part of the master, in the sense of being a living but separate part of his body. There is thus a community of interest, and a relation of friendship, between master and slave, when both of them naturally merit the position in which they stand." (1255b4)
<br />
<br />       From the above summarizations of Aristotle's positions, it is clear that Aristotle's whole theory of proportional equality is based his belief that some have better moral and intellectual capabilities. However, although these qualities are important, the test that Aristotle uses for determining them is not an equal educational system in which all could compete equally or some ingenious device for detecting people's IQ, rather, the test is about people's wealth and birth. These are not the right standards by which one's abilities could be judged upon, and thus Aristotle's theory fails.
<br />
<br />          The importance of money and wealth is explicit in Aristotle's differentiation of the citizens from the non-citizens/slaves (the mechanics and laborers' works have a "servile character" [1277a29] ), and less explicit in his differentiation between the citizens and the rulers/statesmen. The first differentiation is as follows, 
<br />
<br />      "There are thus good grounds for the claims to honor which are made by people of good descent, free birth, or wealth, since those who hold office must necessarily be free men and pay the property assessment. (A city could not be composed entirely of those without means, ay more than it could be composed entirely of slaves.) But we must add that if wealth and free birth are necessary elements, the qualities of being just and being a good soldier are also necessary......The one difference is that the first two elements are necessary for the simple existence of a city, and the last two for its good life." (1283a3)
<br />
<br />      It is easy to look at the second part of this passage and be left with the impression that Aristotle is saying that money does not matter and that been just is the most important quality according to which one should be judged by. But the first part of this passage is far more important; it shows that Aristotle is building a city for the better off. As shown later in the book, Aristotle does not even consider the majority of the city citizens of the city. He says, "the conclusion which clearly follows is that we cannot regard the elements which are necessary for the existence of the city......as being `parts' of the city..." (1328a21). While the wealthier people must strive for intelligence and morality, try to be just and exercise their sacred political rights, the poor people are forgotten and are not even given the chance in the good constitution that Aristotle talks about. 
<br />
<br />      Although it is obvious that wealth and birth are not "natural" qualities that define people, Aristotle still insists throughout the book that the non-citizens/slaves are naturally inferior. Aristotle believes they have no arete other than those that allow them to be subservient to others. In Book One, he says about the slaves, 
<br />
<br />       "...in treating of slaves, that they were useful for the necessary purposes of life. It is clear, on that basis, that they need but little goodness (arete); only so much, in fact, as will prevent them from falling short of their duties through intemperance or cowardice." (1260a24) 
<br />
<br />      This idea of "naturalness" is easily disprove by the fact that Aristotle later says that what really makes the non-citizens/slaves, the mechanics and laborers, naturally bad is that they have no time for arete and the cultivation of their souls. He argues, 
<br />
<br />      "The best form of city will not make the mechanic a citizen. Where mechanics are admitted to citizenship we shall have to say that the citizen excellence (arete) of which we have spoken cannot be attained by every citizen, by all who are simply free men, but can only be achieved by those who are free from the necessary tasks of life." (1278a8)
<br />
<br />     This argument is nonsensical. All along, Aristotle has been saying that those who should receive no political powers are borne lacking the qualities that contribute to their arete. But here, by saying that citizens who do no hard-labor are better than mechanics and laborers simply because they have more time, Aristotle is indicating that the lower class lacks arete because of their lack of education, which is a social, not natural result. This is a gross contradiction.
<br />
<br />       The second differentiation between that of citizens and ruler/statesmen is trickier. Aristotle superficially says that the two are equal, but subtly there is difference.
<br />
<br />      The arete of the good citizens is to both be ruled and to rule. Aristotle writes,
<br />
<br />       "...the fact remains that the good citizen must possess the knowledge and the capacity requisite for ruling as well as for being ruled, and the excellence (arete) of a citizen may be defined as consisting in `a knowledge of rule over free men from both points of view'"(1277b7) 
<br />
<br />         Aristotle frequently mentions this view that the ruler/statesman and the citizens are political equals and should rotate positions. He says in Book One that "the rule of a statesman is rule over free and equal persons." (1255b20) He also says in Book Three when he tries to define citizenship that, "the citizen in this strict sense is best defined by the one criterion that he shares in the administration of justice and in the holding of office." (1275a19)               
<br />
<br />         However, hypocrisy emerges when he defines the arete of ruler/statesmen, who are the only good men. Contrary to before, he differentiates between rulers and the citizens, and makes one class higher than the other. Aristotle says "practical wisdom is the only form of excellence (arete) which is peculiar to the ruler... the virtue (arete) of a person being ruled is not practical wisdom but correct opinion." (1277b16)  
<br />
<br />       This is strange. If "practical wisdom" is what distinguishes the ruler from the ruled, then, when the ruler becomes a citizen again, is he suppose to loss his "wisdom" and become someone who only has "opinion"? And if the citizens are suppose to have "a knowledge of rule from both points of view" as mentioned above, why is Aristotle saying here that they are only capable of "opinions", which is far inferior to knowledge. 
<br />
<br />       Aristotle seems to be trying to fool most of the citizens into believing that they have equal rights as those who are ruling, while disenfranchising their rights at the same time. Aristotle does not explicitly say that wealth and birth would decide who should rule, but it follows from the arguments before regarding free time that they must. While many people could qualify as citizens if they are moderately well off (1279a25, in polity, the property requirement for citizenship is only arms), and could hence afford some leisure to cultivate their arete, but those most wealthy people who could spend all of their time for the cultivation of their soul must be the ones with the best qualities to rule. 
<br />
<br />       To be sure, this hypocrisy in another form is apparent right from the First Book in Aristotle's discussion regarding woman. Although he calls the relationship between husband and wife the relationship of statesmen and citizens, he in fact subjugates women to man. He writes, 
<br />
<br />       "In most cases where rule of the statesman's sort is exercised there is an interchange of ruling and being ruled: the members of a political association aim by their very nature at being equal and differing in nothing...the relation of the male to the female is permanently that in which the statesman stand to his fellow citizens." (1259a37) 
<br />
<br />       Aristotle is offering a grand contradiction within the space of a paragraph. He defines the relationship between masters and citizens as equal just before he says that one is "permanently" subjugated to the other, and yet, he still maintains that this relationship is indeed equal. 
<br />
<br />         To be certain, Aristotle is right in that even today, those who are of good birth and wealth are more likely to be suitable for higher social positions than those who are from lower social-economic backgrounds. And when one looks at the current President of the USA, one could trace his family's wealth and fame three generations back. However, these people who are borne in families of higher social status are only what they are because of the good family influence and the good education they had. 
<br />
<br />      The President went to the best of boarding schools, of universities and of businesses schools and his father was everything from the head of the USA to the head of the CIA; how is it fair to compare him to the Hispanic dish-washer whose parents worked illegally in that restaurant off the high-way, and who despite all eagerness to learn had to stay home to take care of his five younger siblings when he should have gong to highschool?
<br />
<br />      Aristotle is right in saying that people should achieve what their nature allows them to achieve, but he does not allow people's true nature to come into being. If slaves are given as much opportunity to study and work, then some of them surely will become philosophers, poets and other politicians. A city that allows that would be the city that is capable of achieving the best life possible for everyone.
<br />
<br />      Aristotle was intelligent, but he lacked the humility to realize that he did not know everything about human nature. There is nothing wrong with proportional equality, because the better should have, and have always had more power in states, but the key is how to find those good people who could contribute more to the arete of the society. Aristotle pointed out some of the right qualities that they need, but he wrote the Politics from the vantage point of the higher class, and classified people not according to their true abilities, but according to their social and economic conditions. In order to appease the lower social classes, he deceived them by giving them the rights of citizenship or by simply telling them that they are intrinsically incapable. And even for those who were citizens, he still tricks them into believing that they have more political rights they than really do. In this world, there is certainly no equality, not even traces of proportional equality, but most importantly, there is no freedom. There simply can be no freedom when people are locked into castes and can not realize their full potentials. </span>
