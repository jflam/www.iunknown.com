                <span id="Label1">When a great annual collection comes out, it's hard to know the reason  why. Was there a bumper crop of high-quality stories, or was this year's guest  editor especially gifted at winnowing out the good ones? Either way, the 2000  edition of <I>The Best American Short Stories</I> is a standout in a series that  can be uneven. Its editor, E.L. Doctorow, seems to have a fondness for the "what  if?" story, the kind of tale that posits an imagination-prodding question and  then attempts to answer it. Nathan Englander's "The Gilgul of Park Avenue" asks:  What if a WASPy financial analyst, riding in a cab one day, discovers to his  surprise that he is irrevocably Jewish? In "The Ordinary Son," Ron Carlson asks:  What if you are the only average person in a family of certifiable geniuses? And  Allan Gurganus's "He's at the Office" asks: What if the quintessential postwar  American working man were forced to retire? This last story is narrated by the  man's grown son, who at the story's opening takes his dad for a walk. Though  it's the present day, the father is still dressed in his full 1950s businessman  regalia, including camel-hair overcoat and felt hat. The two walk by a teenager.  "The boy smiled. 'Way bad look on you, guy.'"  <blockquote>My father, seeking interpretation, stared at me. I simply shook my  head no. I could not explain Dad to himself in terms of tidal fashion trends.  All I said was "I think he likes you." </blockquote>  The exchange typifies the writing showcased in this anthology: in these stories,  again and again, we find a breakdown of human communication that is sprightly,  humorous, and devastatingly complete. A few more of the terrific stories  featured herein: Amy Bloom's "The Story," a goofy metafiction about a villainous  divorcee; Geoffrey Becker's "Black Elvis," which tells of, well, a black Elvis;  and Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Third and Final Continent," a story of an Indian man  who moves to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Like the collection itself, Lahiri's  story amasses a lovely, funny mood as it goes along. <I>--Claire Dederer</I></span>

                    <span>I love the "Best American Short Stories" annual collections - if nothing else they let you catch up on all those issues of The New Yorker, Harpers, Atlantic, etc. you didn't buy! The quality of any given year, though, depends both on how good the material was and who the editor is - this year it's E.L. Doctorow and he does a great job (in terms of quality, sequencing, variety of styles - even the short introduction is a nice read). If there's a flaw it's an overreliance on well-established authors (Amy Bloom, Walter Mosley, Jhumpa Lahiri, even Raymond Carver(!)) - I don't know if all these are really up to snuff, but the overall quality is right up there and you can't beat the price. Reader Alert: In my humble opinion, the two best stories appears towards the end: ZZ Packer's "Brownies" - a parable about race and growing-up that's a bit reminicent of, dare I say, Ralph Ellison. And Ha Jin's "The Bridegroom" - a thought provocing morality play about politics of all types. Not to be missed! <P>A bonus in the authors' notes appendix lets the authors comment on their stories or writing in general.</span>

                    <span>Doctorow has excellent taste in short fiction. With only a few exceptions (Junot Diaz and Marilyn Krysl), the stories in this collection are excellent. Amy Bloom's story, "The Story", which i think is a great title, is an interesting story about writing, about the characters in the story, and it is a story about itself.Michael Byers has a great story about obsession and attraction rather than love (though he does go on a page or two too long). Ron Carlson has a wonderful story about about happiness and the ways you can get there. It is one of the best of these stories. There is a story from Raymond Carver, and it is as good as anything he has written. Kiana Davenport's story deals with abuse and family. Everett's "The Fix" is the best story in this anthology, which it's allusion to Christ, in a sort of Kafka-like way. Gautreaux's story about atonement is a winner as always. I remember reading Gurganus' story, "He's at the Office" when it was first published in the new yorker, and i remember thinking at the time that it had to be one of the better stories i'd read that year, so it was a pleasure to see doctorow select it. Aleksandar Hemon and Jhumpa Lahiri both have well told stories about being a foreigner in this country, though one has an uplifting feel and the other is more bleak, but both are a pleasure to read. Annie Proulx's "People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water" is a story you should read. but don't let the title fool you, it doesn't fit the story. Sherwood's story about loss is weak and a better selection could have been made, but it wasn't dull like the two mentioned earlier. i could go on about the stories i haven't mentioned, but there is a space constraint. i've only read best american short stories 2000 and 2001, so i can't say if these selected are better or worse than what is normally picked, but i can say that there are 18 stories here that are fine examples of what a short story should be.</span>

                    <span>I disagree with many of the reviewers. This is an above average volume. With the exception of a couple of stories, I found the rest all highly readable and some of them truly outstanding. Ron Carlson, Allan Gurganus and Annie Prolux's pieces are gems. Carlson's The Ordinary Son reads like Salinger's the Glass Family, a surreal journey the keeps you turning pages. I was disappointed when it ended. He's At The Office is one of the best short stories I have read in a long time, absolutely engrossing from the begining to end and tragic without the slightest hint of sentimentality. Hard to do. Prolux piece is from her latest collection which has some great stories in it, but this one is a killer. The rest all fall slightly below these in my opinion but they are all good reads without a great deal of blather. Worth the price of admission.</span>

                    <span>Yes, this seems to be an average year. 1999's edition was much better. In fact, I think the best story in the book was the introduction by Amy Tan! Doctorow's intro this year was pretty lame.<P>If you're looking for something more exciting, grab the Best New American Voices 2000.</span>
