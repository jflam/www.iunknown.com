                    <span>I have had the good fortune of being at some of the Favre cookouts and events they gave hosted the past couple of years. My wife and I have always loved the food - the Favre's have always put on a terrific display of food. With this book we have now been able to cook some of these meals at home. The recipes are very easy to follow and the results are truly delicious. Our favorites are Meemaw's Super Bowl Shrimp Creole, Scott's Paneed Pork Chops, and Chicken a la Clark - and those are the only ones we have tried so far! It is obvious that the Favre family has put a lot of time and effort into this book. Besides the wonderful recipes, there are terrific pictures, interesting stories, amusing Favre anecdotes, and helpful cooking tips. The book is top-notch and The Favre's should be very proud. <P>We highly recommend this book. Bon Apetite...</span>
