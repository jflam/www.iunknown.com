                    <span>Buy these DVD's! They are as good as it can get! <P>I need your help. I ordered my DVD set through amazon.ca. However, the set I received was defective...the collectable booklet was missing. Amazon.ca sent me a replacement, but the collectable booklet was still missing. Now, they are offering me a full refund, but that's not what I want. Those DVD's are so good, I don't want to get rid of them!<P>I'm willing to pay $10 to anyone who would be kind enough to send me the missing booklet. I know that some care about collectable items and others really don't. For the later group, helping me would be an easy way to make the DVD's more affordable for you! :-) PLEASE HELP ME!!!

                    <span>Without question, the superbowl has become America's biggest one day sporting event. The superbowl make hero's out of nobody's (see Timmy Smith, Doug Williams, Kurt Warner) or goats of out losers (see the 70's Minnesota Vikings, the 80's Broncos, and the 90's Bills). This dvd tells the history of the season and the highlights of the superbowl game. I am huge fan of the superbowls. I had recorded everyone when they used to come on ESPN2 and ESPN classic before the superbowl was to be played. I'm glad that now the Superbowls are now on dvd.</span>

                    <span>I've always been a fan of NFL Films' half-hour Super Bowl game recap/highlight shows that play on ESPN2 during the week leading up to the big game, and have always lamented the fact that they never bothered to put any of 'em out on DVD. Well, until about six months ago (as of this writing) when they finally came around and put the first ten Super Bowl highlight shows (as well as quick NFL season recaps leading up to the championship, and other bonus featurettes) out in a nifty DVD box set. Now they've thrown out the second decalogue of highlights from "The Great American Time-Out", featuring both good moments (the 49ers' first two wins in XVI & XIX; The 'Skins' first Super Bowl Championship in game XVII, and the Bears' 46 defense stealing the show in game XX) and not-so-great ones (The Raiders claiming games XI, XV, and XVIII, and the Cowboys picking up their second Lombardi trophy after XII). Now I can finally toss out a few more of the gradually deteriorating VHS tapes of those same segments that I taped off of ESPN2 a few years back!<P>While I thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks I laid down for it, NFL Films added even more value to the presentation by throwing in two featurettes in with each Super Bowl game. While I found most of 'em kinda interesting, I was also driven to nausea by the sappiness of a few of 'em. Runnin' the Saccharine-o-meter to the red zone was the piece on Anthony Munoz and his NFL prospect son, Howie Long discussing his life in football and how he's been keepin' himself busy after his retirement, and Jim Plunkett pulling himself off of the NFL scrap heap to lead the Raiders to two Super Bowl championships. I swear, if I hear one more interview where someone was talking about how much heart ol' what's-his-face had, or how so-and-so's toughness & drive really inspired the rest of the team, I'm gonna need insulin treatments!<P>Topping off this set's sack o' goodies is a booklet that features images and basic info on each contest, including the date each game was played and the city & stadium it was played in, program covers, championship rings, rosters, scores by quarter, final scores, and the name & position of each game MVP (or, in the case of Supe XII, co-MVPs). A glossy, full-color Super Bowl XX ticket facsimile adds a nice finishing touch to it all. Now if only they'd throw in a soundtrack CD of some of those amazing tunes that compliment the game action...<P>Needless to say, I can hardly wait to get the "XXI to XXX" set when it comes out. Just like this set has done, the third offering's gonna bring back more'n a few bittersweet memories! Um, the "bitter" part being the Cowboys' wins in XXVII, XXVIII, & XXX and the Giants holding on to win XXV. Er, and the "sweet" part being the Redskins' wins in XXII & XXVI, and the Niners taking Supes XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX. I'll laugh, I'll cry... I'll kiss another fifty smackers good-bye!<P>'Late</span>

                    <span>As a young kid growing up, I always looked forward to a couple of days before the actual Super Bowl to watch these old super bowl highlights on espn. I always recorded them on my vhs tapes. after a while, though, after playing them over and over again, they got worn out. When I found out that NFL films was releasing the first Super Bowl collection (I-X), I was really excited. I bought that set and it really surpassed my expectations. Watching all of the season in reviews and the super bowl highlights in the dvd format was stunning, seeing this with great clarity and stereo sound. <P>NFL Films has done it again with Super Bowl XI-XX. You'll never have to watch super bowl highlights on espn again. It's a joy watching these highlights from the end of the Steelers dynasty, to the beginning of the 49ers dynasty. Can't wait for Super Bowl XXI-XXX.</span>
