                    <span>This is an effective and balanced book. I found that it kept a good balance between pace of material encountered and ease of aquisition. It has quite a bit, takes it at a good pace, yet without overwhelming all at once. I have given it 4 stars not because it is lacking, but only with the hope that a great book will be made even better in new editions.</span>

                    <span>This book is great if you really want to master Nepali - if you are going to be going there for a long period of time, or if you are trying to brush up on your skills --including knowing the devengari script. After chapter 5, all of the examples are in devengari, so if you didn't spend the time learning it, the rest of the book is very difficult. If you are just going for a short trip, or going trekking, I would recommend the trekkers guide, or a book that you can buy once you get to Kathmandu that all of the peace corp volunteer get - it has all of the useful words and phrases and is sounded out in english script (conviently titled Peace Corp Nepali).</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a good guide to the basics of the spoken nepali language. You will get a good grasp of all the basics of grammar, reading, writing, and speaking. It moves at a fairly good pace and includes some insights into the Nepali culture and way of life too. I had the chance to take a Nepali class at Cornell this summer and my professor knew both authors very well and held them both in high regards for their expertise in designing an effective language learning guide. I gave it four stars because it does not touch on the importance of 'boltaciko nepali' colloquial nepali, or slang. You will find in your encounters with Nepali nationals that much like English their language is one that is not spoken the way it is presented in the grammar book. Keep this in mind as you learn, but I would highly recommend the book, to give you a strong foundation, and if you master it's contents you will be well on your way to being an effective speaker.</span>

It has an incredible pronounciation section and sections of dialogue that help also in understanding the culture of Nepal. i really recommend this book for somebody who is interested in fully undestanding the languauge. The writing section is also very helpful if you with to learn Nepali script. Be sure to also order the tape that accompanies the book because it helps to hear the pronounciation keys as well.</span>
