                    <span>I travel extensively and am a fan of Frommer's guides which I generally find to have a nice assortment of options in varying price ranges.  The volume on South Africa however, was a great disappointment.  If Frommer's were to be believed, you had to pay $200 and up for a decent hotel room.  Fortunately I have often traveled in South Africa, enjoyed its reasonably priced accomodations, and knew such prices were nonsense.  I stayed in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and other top destinations in season for less than half that much.  The guide also overlooked  destinations a bit off the beaten path and proved of so little use to me that I didn't bother to pack it home with me. I strongly suggest the Eyewitness guide instead or just surf the web for tons of great information from the South African Tourism Board.  </span>

                    <span>An excellent reference book for anyone visiting Southern Africa. We only found a few minor errors but the recommendations on where to go and what to see were very useful. <p>We're looking forward to going again and will certainly take this book along. We didn't have enough time to see it all.</span>

                    <span>We visited South Africa for 20 days in July 2000, driving from Cape Town  to Kruger.  Before we left we sat down at a large book store and reviewed  all their South African travel books.  This one looked the best and proved  to be very useful, particularly for accomodations.  Some of the prices had  changed but the standards and services were exactly as described.  This is  a great book for travellers who are above the backpacker/budget level but  not up to "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."</span>

                    <span>I went in March 2000 and returned a week ago from the Western Cape. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL TRIP! But, talking about the book...<p>Prices for gas and some of the attractions, like Cape Point and a couple nature reserves  we visited were already outdated. Gas is nearly R3/litre! I understand  their economy isn't doing well, so they've had to increase prices to the  visitors. Tourism is their no. 1 business.<p>There were several things I  remember reading in the text, then later, when I wanted to see it again, I  couldn't find them in the index...stuff like the Vergelegen Winery (which  has amazing views and delicious wines!) and others. Not all boldface terms  are in the index. This is something that could really be  improved!<p>Lastly, I must reiterate what my hosts said: They've seen many  rediculous books on Cape Town and the Western Cape and this is not one of  them.<p>I debated between 3 and 4 stars, but remembering my frustrations  with the index, I knocked it down to 3. :)</span>

                    <span>In December 99 we used Frommer's 00 South Africa for a nine day tour by car through the Western Cape -- a good test for relevance and comprehensiveness.  We found it by far the most helpful of the guides we  looked at.  An amazing amount of detail, good maps, lots of interesting  background information, and thoroughly entertaining.  How all guidebooks  should be.</span>
