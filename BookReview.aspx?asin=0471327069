                    <span>i have a limited knowledge of accounts, & this book was absolutely brilliant in bringing me up to speed with the basic mechanics, rather than the whys of it all. The lucid manner in which the subject matter is explained hinges on the graphical layout employed allowing you to become involved in the process.
<br />It does not set out to be exhaustive & other books should be used for in depth studies (eg identifying suspicious activities). It is however excellent in accomplishing precisely what it sets out to achieve and brings life to the numbers. All it needs now is a color edition, enabling more complex modelling.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent in the following ways : <p>-succeeds in explaining in a concise (+- 100 pages) and clear way the basic principles of financial statements.<br>-the special format of the book is excellent in that it shows most examples and related text without having to turn the pages.<br>-there is enough white space, allowing you to make annotations.<p>Strongly adviced for anybody owning a company or for management / accounting students.</span>

                    <span>John Tracy does explain the 3 important "sheets" of a complete financial report.  But he failed to help me understand what can be ascertained from more abstract concepts like cash flow or depreciation.  His (lack of decent) explanation of why depreciation expense shows up in cost flow calculation appears to account twice for the same $ (once in profit and once in cash flow).  His explanation of trying to use EPS & P/E ratio to determine the value of a privately held company share went no futher than this: "you could try to sell my your privately held share at any price you want, but I wouldn't have to accept it".  That's not an explanation, just a statement of the obvious.  The book needs more prose and examples of how the concept of a healthy (or unhealthy) company can be determined from a financial report.  In fairness to Tracy, perhaps the latter half of the book addresses my needs, but I quit at page 76 (1/2 way through the book) after an inadequate explanation of depriciation expense as positive cash flow.  I'll give another, more rigourous text a chance at that.</span>

                    <span>As a teacher of business management, I have found the one component of training that often frustrates most students is understanding and preparing a cash flow statement, profit and loss statement and a balance sheet.  This book is written in a manner which certainly simplifies the understanding of the statements, but it would definitely be a plus if the reader had some prior knowledge of basic accounting principles.<p>Financial statements are, for some, a challenge and one they can easily master with an understanding of basic accounting. For others with no prior knowledge of accounting, financial statements can be a nightmare.  While this book will HELP TO SIMPLIFY the matter, without some previous experience the book may be quite confusing.  First of all, one should at least be familiar with general accounting terminology.  If you are, it will simplify this book enormously and make the learning experience more enjoyable.  However, be prepared to sit down and devote your utmost concentration to the book. The subject matter is not one that can be mastered by skimming through the book in an evening or two.  For many individuals, understanding financial statements is a course that takes months to completely understand.  Some learn the process easily, others never master the challenge no matter how long or hard they try.   The degree of success usually depends, in part, on apptitude, commitment and previous knowledge and experience of the reader.</span>
