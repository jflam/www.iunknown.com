                    <span>The pictures are stunning.<p>But it is only a coffee-table book, and there it will remain,  because pictures is all it is. You get no sense of place; it is impossible to orient yourself ... a nice picture of an elephant is just that, and this book provides no context whatever.<p>But, it does have nice pictures.</span>

                    <span>These images bring the Serengeti to you. This being largely a pictoral tour of the Serengeti, words do it little justice. If you are an intelligent animal lover with a pulse, you will pay twice the cover price for this book.</span>

                    <span>Having just returned from Kenya and Tanzania and as an aspiring  photographer myself, I was anxious to get my own film developed. I did and  had some good shots, but was dissappointed because only a few of my shots  conveyed what I felt when I was actually in Africa.  Only a little bit of  what I captured on film was something I could use to show people when they  asked me how my trip was.  Out of my own photographs, only 3 or 4 really  conveyed the emotions and awe I felt in viewing the African wildlife and  landscape.  <p>This book is a completely different story.  Every single  photograph conveys all of the beauty and awe-inspiring nature that is  Africa.  I can look at these photos and say "this is exactly what  Africa is like."  These photos are so beautiful that just by looking  at them I begin to feel some of what I felt standing on the plains myself  at dawn watching a family of lions no more than 100 yards away.  Iwago's  use of composition, light, and technique clearly convey life on the  Serengetti.  Everything from the absolute power of the lion to the complete  goofiness of the Wildebeast is conveyed wonderfully in this book.<p>If you  have any of the same interests I do in wildlife and Africa go on safari.   If you can't do that, at least do yourself the favor of picking up this  book.</span>

                    <span>We recently returned from Tanzania and Serengeti, after seeing this book in the airport in Africa at the start of our trip I could not carry it around for 5 weeks up Mt Kilimanjaro, after returning to Australia and  finding it very difficult to get, I am glad that I have found it.  A truly  lovely piece for the coffee table</span>
