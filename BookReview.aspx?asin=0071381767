                <span id="Label1"><p>On the surface, choosing the correct propeller for a particular boat seems simple. But one factor affects another, which then affects another factor, leading many boaters to believe that propeller selection depends more on black magic than logic.</p> <p>All the questions are answered in this complete reference, the first of its kind. This clear, easy-to-use handbook for all small boats is written not for Ph.D.s seeking the latest wrinkle in high-tech propeller design, but as a practical aid for the average mechanic, engineer, boatbuilder, fleet operator, serious yachtsman, or naval architect.</p></span>

                    <span>The author has boiled out all the complicated Bessel functions and the reader is left with the bottom line for basic propeller selection. If you are serious boater interested in propellers this is the book for you...you don't need to PhD in Naval Arch to understand this. Very straight forward approach. If you have prop related or powering questions, buy this. For 13 bucks you are going to spend more on gas your next outing due to your poor prop. <BR>I would have given it 5 stars if the pictures were in color and more recent.</span>

                    <span>I love the mathmatical models in this book. It really helps a reader of average (myself) intellegence to project how a propeller will work in different situations. I made some spread sheets to work out the models and that really helped.<P>It seemed to focus on the marine boating field, so I wouldn't expect too much if your interest is strictly in speed boats.</span>

                    <span>Dave has done an excellent job of clearly covering a very complex subject. He gives you quick practical ways of estimating as well as more detailed methods for determining propeller requirements and performance. This book will benefit anyone dealing with propellers. This includes boat owners, repair yards and design offices. I am a professional engineer, practicing in naval architecture and marine engineering. As a result I have read a lot of material on this subject. This is the best reference on propellers that I have seen to date.</span>

                    <span>This is an extremely readable book for a technical subject tome. It is one of the better organized technical treatises I have seen. Whether you just want to select a propeller for your boat or want to design boats and propellers the book has something for you; though the casually curious may find themselves skipping a lot of engineering content. Tells you how to proceed in propeller selection in a parsimonious, no nonsense manner. And not simply how to do it, but the theory and reasons behind what to do are included as well. A complete index and list of suppliers makes this book a good reference tool.</span>
