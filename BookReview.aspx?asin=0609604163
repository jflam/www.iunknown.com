                <span id="Label1">Microsoft chairman Bill Gates is by no accounts a kind, nurturing type of manager. In conversation, according to <I>Renegades of the Empire</I>, Gates is said to challenge and goad people just to see how robustly they'll defend a position. He may not know whether they're right or wrong, but he likes to see how confident they are. In that environment, the meek don't do particularly well. But the three "software warriors" portrayed in <I>Renegades of the Empire</I> were over the top, even by Microsoft standards.<p>  Alex St. John, Eric Engstrom, and Craig Eisler started at Microsoft as evangelists, the guys who persuade companies to create products to run on Microsoft operating systems. All three, separately and together, would end up giving the company fits with their cockiness and contrarian ways. Eventually, they would team up on a project called Chrome, a revolutionary technology designed to bring three-dimensional graphics to the Web. While these three bigger-than-life characters are vividly portrayed, this is mostly a story about technology: where the ideas come from, how it's developed, how internal company politics affects its development, and how outside companies are courted and cajoled to participate. Drummond, a skillful writer and dogged journalist, thoroughly explains all the technology--but, in the end, the acronyms take over. This makes for a tough read if you're not technologically inclined. Still, anyone with the slightest tech background should enjoy this peek behind Microsoft's silicon curtain. <I>--Lou Schuler</I></span>

                    <span>It's nice to know what happened inside of Microsoft for the DirectX and Chrome development drama, but I found author patronising these warriors in a way which is not convincing. It keeps saying that "they are smart, they are super..." but never really showed me why they were so.<p>It's a book that doesn't have in depth technical juice, and fails to uncover the business acuman in context.</span>

                    <span>I was slightly disappointed with the style and the completion of the book.  The author seems very smitten with the main protagonist (St Johns) which led to some boring exchanges and I felt ruined some of it.<p>Being a person that breifly used Chrome (the Java tool released by Microsoft to do graphics on the Internet) before it was pulled I had always wondered about the people and politics behind it.<p>The history and development of DirectX is interesting as are the characters that shaped it.</span>

                    <span>The tone of this book is consistent - the author paints the various "characters" as larger than life, nary a non-heroic thought among them. I don't recall if Drummond was actually there as the events he illustrates took place, nor if he even claims to have been as it's been awhile since I read this book. If you do read it, realize that the main players, while dynamic and influential, certainly did leave their respective marks. But any technological "legacy" has been revolutionized in their absence. For the most part, the people left behind at Microsoft to deal with the remnants of these "revolutionary software warriors" are happy to have finally finished scraping the marks from the walls.</span>

                    <span>DirectX is the software component in Windows 95 (and later versions of Windows) that helps developers build graphics applications. This book beatifully describes the happenings in Microsoft which culminate in DirectX being a component of the operating system. The heroes are three Microsofties, nicknamed the Beastie Boys for their aggressive tactics in getting things done. The book is also a story of these three engineers and in particular about Alex St John. Evangelism to push software to customers, elaborate marketing stunts to introduce software, interactions with Apple and other companies during those times, the anti-trust case, are some of the really interesting parts of the book. <p>Throughout the book, one gets to appreciate the creative spirit and thirst for better software that drives the engineers. Not only does the book shed light on the psyche of the software engineers involved, it creates an image of what its like within the walls of the software behemoth. Anyone interested in programming will certainly find this book extremely enjoyable and will readily relate to the cause pursued by the programmers in question. If you are not a programmer, you might find it a wee bit uninteresting at places. <p>I would specially recommend this book to anyone who has done programming with OpenGL or any other graphics library. This book will be a work of history for people into graphics and gaming.</span>
