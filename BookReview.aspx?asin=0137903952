This textbook is up-to-date and is organized using the latest principles of good textbook design. It includes historical notes at the end of every chapter, exercises, margin notes, a bibliography, and a competent index. <I>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</I> covers a wide array of material, including first-order logic, game playing, knowledge representation, planning, and reinforcement learning.</span>

                    <span>I think the book is good overall, it could be more focused in some places and have better examples for the students.
<br />
<br />My major point with writing this review though is to counter false claim from the reviewer who wrote the "Survey type of book, shallow but good for reference", the book does cover Simulated Annealing, see page 116 in the International Edition for instance.</span>

                    <span>This is currently the best general purpose book on AI (the field). It is by no means the best book on any individual topic though... but I guess that wasn't the point of the book to begin with.
<br />
<br />I'm not particularly happy with this book though. I think it's the language, or the examples, or something, but often it's just not `clear'---not as intuitive as I'd like. Many teachers seem to use it in a `general purpose course on AI' though (not anything particularly detailed, so it's `ok'---there are worse books on the subjects).
<br />
<br />In short: as a general purpose AI book on everything, it does its job, but don't expect it to be anything other than a glorified field overview.</span>

                    <span>Until recently, my Algorithms book was my favorite text book ever.  However, AI: A Modern Approach has supplanted it.  This book is the most thoughtfully designed, easily understandable, clear text I've ever used in over 28 years of attending schools.  I really knew nothing about AI when I took my first grad class in AI, but this book, along with a pretty great instructor, has been a wonderful resource, more than any other book I've used.  I have not need to google for more information or speak to the professor.  The answers are here--clear and concrete.
<br />
<br />Have no fear and trust this book!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The book offers mathematically based coverage of the most important topics in AI. It has a very pragmatic view and does not spend too much time with the over-hyped topics, such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms. Instead, it provides clear and easy to understand examples for most of the introduced concepts. 
<br />
<br />The text requires some knowledge of computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Sections on topics that require extensive outside knowledge, such as computational learning theory, are not covered very deeply, but usually offer nice insight to the concepts and basic principles.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book both for beginners to exact AI as an introductory text and to more experienced researchers as an invaluable reference. I found it to be the most useful book I own.
