                    <span>Hello:<p>In Andy's review, he mentioned errors in the book.  This is correct. Due to some software changes since its 2001 publication, there are some code bits that need to be adjusted to make things work.<p>While HungryMinds is no longer publishing under that label, they are part of Wiley and Wiley provides the needed info.  This book's errata, which includes solutions for these issues, may be found at http://www.wiley.com/extras/xml_crash_course/ .</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for newbies like me, but there were a lot of errors (mostly incorrect names for associating files) that you have to figure out on your own.  The errors occur once every 2 to 3 chapters, so it isn't too bad - just annoying.  From what I've seen, the CD has the correct file names so there's some relief there.  Unfortunately, the publishing company went out of business so you can't go to their website to get updates with corrections.</span>

                    <span>If you are new to XML and wish to know how XML relates to HTML, DTD, XLST, XPATH, and XHTML, this should be your first book.<p>The book is clearly written in bite sized sections with quizes that follow.  Each section reiterates concepts of prior sections to ensure you understand what you read.<p>I completed the book in less than the recommended 15 hours and can say than I have nearly 100% comprehension of the material.<p>I commend the authors on a job well done.</span>
