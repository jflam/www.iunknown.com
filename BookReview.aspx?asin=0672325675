                    <span>I needed to learn a little SQL to be able to run scripts in my new job.  This book is not as elementary as I'd hoped.  It is well formatted and easy to read, but lost me not too many pages in.  
<br />
<br />I was okay with the Select and Where queries, but got to page 30, where it said the following statement as it related to using single quotes - "The single quotes are used to delimit a string.  If you are comparing a value against a column that is a string datatype, the delimiting quotes are required"  HUH??????
<br />
<br />Sorry, close book right here. Nothing identified what that meant.  I need a classroom and an instructor.  Once I learn what all this is about, I will write a book for people like me.  </span>

                    <span>This was laying around the office and I needed to pick up SQL so I gave it a whirl.  [I would have never have choosen any programming book with the phrase 'in 10 Minutes' in the title!  What a crock.]  
<br />
<br />I typically work in IDL and Perl and need to add a bit of mySQL.  
<br />
<br />To me reading this book is like trying to follow the path of a running squirrel.  It's jumping all over the place.  The thoughts are unclear and lack flow.  It's supposed to be a primer but in the scatter shot approach it really makes a mess and winds up missing the connection between points.
<br />
<br />I'm looking for something better, and it's certain to take longer than 10 minutes.</span>

                    <span>The title is "Teach yourself SOL in 10 minutes" so you should know that this is just a starting book and not a complete explanation of the language. And as a starting book this book is great! If you want to learn how to build multiuser relational databases then I would look for a book that doesn't have "in 10 minutes" in the title, but if your looking to get the jist of SQL then this book is for you. I bought the ebook edition and was able to download it instantly. The author includes links to 2 free database utility's, one of which he wrote, that are worth the price of the ebook alone!</span>

                    <span>I loved this book on SQL.  Read it cover-to-cover (including appendices) and found it easy to understand and learn from
<br />very efficiently.  The author anticipates the special cases and questions that will occur to the reader following each exposition, and addresses them well.  And I appreciated that it had an accompanying web site for downloading the example databases and scripts.
