                    <span>A book on weight training that is designed for golf-specific muscles to improve performance (strength, stamina, flexibility, etc.). Different programs for in off and even pre-season. This book gives me motivation to workout - to help lower my scores. <P>I would recommend this book to any golfer that thinks fitness can help his/her game (it can! just ask Tiger:)</span>

                    <span>As a personal trainer, I am interested in finding a niche and thought that golfers might be a good idea and was disappointed to see this book (a pamplet really) seemed to be just basic strength training. The workouts do not have any chest exercises but in a later section there is a full chest workout (bench press etc.) in the visual examples. Very confusing. It does not explain why the pectoral muscles might hinder the golf swing or why it is not included in the workouts. It stressed rotator cuffs, and shoulder but only had 2 rotator exercises...<BR>So, I am back to the driving range! Don't waste you dollars on this!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Fist of all from the front cover to the back cover of this 64 page book on weight lifting and golf, the word GOLF/GOLFER is only mentioned 27 times plus or minus one or two times and "continuing to swing your racquet during the off-season" once (all in the introduction chapter). Also in the introduction, the book mentions "performing exercises that can be detrimental to your game", but never tells you what they are or expounds on that important bit of information at all. The book gives you what it thinks are the important body parts to be trained for a more balanced and powerful swing (Hips, Mid-section, Shoulders, Hand/Wrists/Forearms and Hamstrings). The book does a fair job at explaining Off-Season, Pre-Season and In-Season training and the exercises to be preformed. However, here is the kicker, nowhere in any of the exercise programs is there a mention of a chest exercise, but in Part III of the book, (Recommended Exercises) it devotes four pages to chest exercises. Now, I know that lifting and increasing the size and muscularity of your chest is detrimental to your golf swing. Johnny Miller proved that, he was lifting long before Tiger and Dave Duval made it a popular thing to do. However, what Johnny fail to calculate during his chest training is the changes it would cause in his swing, although he got stronger, the muscularity in his chest changed his almost flawless swing and all but ran him off the PGA tour (I know, he had putting problems too). This book quadruple bogeys here by not including this very important information and by including chest exercises in the recommended section of the book, which tends to be contradictory if not just confusing.<BR>Conclusion: This book is a weak attempt at cutting and pasting the exercises from any general weightlifting manual that gives information on full body workouts. By adding the word GOLF 27 times and Off-Season, Pre-Season, and In-Season training to the manuscript does not make it a weightlifting guide for golfers. What a sham!!!</span>
