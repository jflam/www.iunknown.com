                    <span>In the last couple years I must have read more than ten books on this subject. Jerry' is hands down the best. While most other authors give tips, he goes in-depth and focus on the importance of having solid content in our presentations, a good "story" as he says. Worth the extra cost.</span>

                    <span>I got this book based on the other reviews I read here.  There is some good information, but it could be condenced to 5 pages.  It's geared towards his business, which is helping CEOs develop their pitch to venture capitalists.  In this sense, and in many others, he doesn't pratice what he preaches, namely WIIFY--what's in it for you.  He writes to a narrow audience though it's pitched to a general business market.  Would you beleive this guy has never had a job where he had to do formal presentations himself?  He was in the movie/TV business and a friend in high places, Compaq CEO, introduced him to an awesome contact in Silicon Valley.  He made a business as a consultant from that contact, which led to this book.  I think this hole is evident in the material.  </span>

                    <span>You may be a skilled presentator, but your so called "support material" may be working against you.  I give presentations almost every day since I work as a consultant and the audience response is better since I started following the book's advise. The book's writting is easy to understand and can be read very fast.  The advice the author gives is easy to follow and it translates into achievements in real life.    This book should be required reading for everybody in college,  I'm giving it to the personnel under me as required reading. It's a great book.  It has some typos and as verything it could be improved, but it's a great book.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book after the executives of my company raved about Jerry Weissman's work in helping them prepare for our IPO.  Unlike many other books on this topic, I found it to be very useful because it provided a framework that was simple yet creative.  The real-world examples he uses are great and they make it a more interesting read for those of us who enjoy learning more about the techniques used by successful people.  Jerry is starting to conduct public seminars in the Bay Area but if you can't make it to a seminar, the book is a great alternative.</span>

                    <span>The lessons in this excellent book should be studied and applied by everyone who has to give presentations. In terms of audience connection and persuasive technique, Abe Lincoln must have known everything here (except, perhaps, the details of PowerPoint). And that's good, because you don't need anything new or fancy to give a great presentation, you just need a message and clear instructions on how to deliver it - so, here they are. The book is cleanly written with pop-out boxes, sample graphics and corporate examples. Anyone who ignores its powerful basic rules will fail at presenting. Failure means boring the audience and leaving them unconvinced and unwilling to hear more. This is your cure for those blues. The book's flaw is the author's tedious self-promotion, but he's a former TV guy, so what the heck do you expect? The bottom line, we attest, is that what he says, you need to know.</span>
