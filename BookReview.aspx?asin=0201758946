                    <span>Any criticisms you have encountered about this book being biased towards prepress are true. But if you are involved with PDF in prepress, this book is very good.
<br />
<br />This book will take you from beginner (but not novice) to advanced intermediate. It won't take you to expert; but then expert comes with experience. Given that each prepress environment has its own peculiarities, you'll have to work within your system to take it to its limits. This book can help some of the way.
<br />
<br />My only complaint is related to my personal situation. On occasions, concerning some particularly fine points, the book suggests "ask your prepress partner". I am trying to become that prepress person, so I found this frustrating. Understandable, but frustrating.</span>

                    <span>I needed something more comprehensive and revealing than the usual offering of beginners texts. Yet, I WAS a beginner.<p>This book not only covers the general abilities of Acrobat, it discuses little known intricacies and technical issues that will make you a power user in record time.<p>Remarkably, the information is explained in simple, ordinary language.</span>

                    <span>I started working for a medium sized ad agency 2 years ago. Every document we produce has to be made in to PDF format for review by our clients. I could make a PDF, but really had no true understanding of the settings and what I was really doing. This book is truly excellent at giving a novice a complete understanding of the PDF format. For someone already knowlegeable about the PDF format it is also a very valuable reference. This is one of the most useful computer books I have bought in years and I buy alot of them. When our tech-guy has problems with Acrobat he comes to me and borrows this book.<p>The best thing about the book is that it breaks down PDF creation by program. For example, if you use Quark Xpress there is a chapter dedicated on how to use Acrobat with Quark. If you use Microsoft Word there is another chapter on using Acrobat with it. These chapters present you with real world scenarios and how to deal with them.<p>This is not some kind of quick start guide. It does get in to some detail and that helped me a great deal. It doesn't just gloss-over a subject or give you bare-bones steps on how to do something.<p>This is an easy to understand book that will help out anbody at any level with using Acrobat. I can't say enough good things about it. This is the first book I have purchased in the "Real World" series of books... it won't be my last!</span>
