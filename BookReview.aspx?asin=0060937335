                    <span>I bought this book in 1990.  I carried it around in my purse for over a year reading and re-reading it.  It helped launch me in the career of my dreams.  Whenever I felt afraid, I would read this book.  Whenever I felt I wouldn't make it, I read this book.  I will give my daughter a copy when she graduates high school.  Dr. Dyer shares personal experiences and practical examples to help guide you.  He has been ahead on the road of happy transformation and he shares insights that are rock solid.  If I was stranded on a desert island, I'd take this book.  I have the audio cassette version as well, and am buying the CD version, too.</span>

                    <span>This book is abound with breathtaking insights, i had a look at it and liked the title as i was beginning a study on prosperity, because in my life there was a lot of financial uncertainties and believed a lot of rubbish about succeding, from this book i learned to affirm myself and the world around me, as i realised that prosperity is not about who raised you, what your career and level is, but upon the level of faith and spiritual savvy which is easily obtainable if one only asked for it.
<br />
<br />There are a lot of other sub-topics cavered in the book with a view for readers to gain transformation which is a requisite to achieving it, some of the exercises are kinder troublesome, like forgiveness, which is almost impossible for a majority of us people, but as we learn in the book, lack of forgivenss is one of the final blocks that can curb transformation.
<br />
<br />I also gained a little bit of understanding of some of the concepts introduced in the Matrix movies in this book.</span>

                    <span> Dr. Wayne Dyer has crafted yet another amazing book on personal transformation.  In 'You'll See It When You Believe It' he gives a detailed account of how to change not only the way you perceive reality, but reality itself. He shows how to bring your reality to a higher and more enlightened level which will necessarily include manifesting good, being internally driven, heightening the power of coincidence and connection, getting in the flow of the universe, achieving a greater sense of serenity, being in the moment, and being free of negative and fruitless emotions.  It's the sort of book that makes you want to highlight passages and ideas.  The text is filled with personal stories, examples and anecdotes to teach and inspire.  It's ideal for those needing a little nudge (or a big jolt) in life.  And it's ideal fuel for change.  </span>

                    <span>I must say that it took me awhile to look at the pages in this book and listen to them.  I was doing exactly what Dyer warns against, trying to use my ego and mind alone to learn what he was saying, like viewing H20 alone instead of experiencing water.<p>People like Wayne Dyer are often dismissed as "New Age" and unworthy of any attention.  The principles that Dyer writes and demonstrates rather effectively in this book, however, are actually the things often needed most in today's world.  Dyer demonstrates the power of positive thinking and shows how we are actually "dualistic" as distinct individuals with our own powerful minds while being members of a greater picture and whole at the same time.  <p>Also, awesome insight into the great human family, and how each and every one of us affects the whole family with our very "small" thoughts and actions.</span>

                    <span>I must admit that I am a Dyer fan and have studied a fair amount of his work. This CD is as good as I have come to expect from Wayne Dyer. He relates the information in a way that makes it easy to understand and to relate too. The information is inspiring and thought provoking. If you are looking for tranformational information to reach higher levels of enlightenment, but are tired of speakers that use a great deal of lofty terms, this is the CD for you. Simple, straight talk that makes understanding easy and inspiring. If you are wanting something to effect change in you're life, here it is.
