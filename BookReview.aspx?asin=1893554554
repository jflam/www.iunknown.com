                <span id="Label1">At the onset of "Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity," Leon Kass gives us a status report on where we stand today: "Human nature itself lies on the operating table, ready for alteration, for eugenic and psychic 'enhancement,' for wholesale redesign. In leading laboratories, academic and industrial, new creators are confidently amassing their powers  and quietly honing their skills, while on the street their evangelists are zealously prophesying a posthuman future. For anyone who cares about preserving our humanity, the time has come for paying attention."  <P>Trained as a medical doctor and biochemist, Dr. Kass has become one of our most provocative thinkers on bioethical issues. Now, in this brave and searching book, he also establishes himself as a prophetic voice summoning us to think deeply about the new biomedical technologies threatening to take us back to the future envisioned by Aldous Huxley in "Brave New World." As in Huxley's dystopia, where life has been smoothed out by genetic manipulation, psychoactive drugs and high tech amusement, our own accelerating efforts to master reproduction and genetic endowment, to retard aging, and to conquer illness, imperfection, and death itself are animated by our most humane and progressive aspirations. But we are walking too quickly down the road to physical and psychological utopia, Kass believes, without pausing to assess the potential damage to our humanity from this brave new biology.  <P>In a series of meditations on cloning, embryo research, the human genome project, the sale of organs, and the assault on mortality itself, Kass evaluates the ongoing effort to break down the natural boundaries given us and to remake the human body into an instrument of our will. What does it mean to treat nascent human life as raw material to be exploited? What does it mean to blur the line between procreation and manufacture? What are the proper limits to this project for the remaking of human nature? These are the questions we should be asking to prevent runaway scientism with its utopian longings from reshaping humankind in the image of our own choosing.  <P>Kass believes that technology has done and will continue to do wonders for our health and longevity and that we have much to be thankful for. But there is more at stake in the biological revolution that saving life and avoiding death. We must also strive to protect the ideas and practices that give us dignity and keep us human.  <P>"Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity" challenges us to confront the posthuman future that may await us by thinking deeply about the life and death issues we face today.</span>

                    <span>There are so many publishing errors in the first paperback edition (2004) of Leon Kass's book that it is almost unreadable.  It is obvious that no one even bothered to look at the book before sending it to retail.
<br />
<br />Do a quick read of Chapter One and you will see what I mean.  Sentences are left entirely unfinished from one page to the next, leaving the reader wondering how much other text has been omitted.  Although page 35 starting with the word "nogoly" is pretty classy, my favorite example is the transition from page 37-38.  Here, Dr. Kass is begins to frame an argument, but the sentence is never completed.  Then, the next paragraph begins, "Crudely put, the argument could be stated this way."  What way?  Of course the irony is all the more poignant because this series of publishing mistakes follows Dr. Kass's meta-observation about the technology used in producing this very book.  Good stuff.
<br />
<br />I would not be nearly as concerned had this book not been a god-send for my present research project.  But $17 later, I guess I have to track down a hardback copy in the hopes that I can actually read what Dr. Kass has written.</span>

                    <span>If your someone who believes there are simplistic,easy rational answers to lifes deeper problems and that experts should be the ones to decide for the rest of society what those answers are then this book is not for you. But if you are like me and believe that biotechnology is troublesome challenge  and that all Americans should have serious questions about then this book is about as probing as it gets.
<br />I understand other reviewers who perhaps rated this book poorly because they have difficulty contemplating issues that may be disturbing, ambiguous=perhaps they prefer to live in a simplistic world where experts make all the decisions without them having to struggle with issues on stem cell research, the definition of life, the proper use of technology.  Emotions can be difficult to deal with when it comes to issues of what is life-but to "einschrankung" or reduce the issues to mere rational analysis would be tantamount to converting into a simple mathematical problem. Biotechnology problems are more complicated then that and Kass has a deep appreciation for making sure the human element is considred in thinking about such issues. Its understandable how some reader who have been trained in engineering that the emotional and human factor is irrelevant-that it should be just a matter of utilitarianism-they have been educated not broadly-and probably have a narrow minded view of what it is to be human. But biotechnology issues cannot be reduced to mere technocratic calculation.But with more then a few journals and books pointing to how technologically illiterate the average American is books like Kass's invite the reader to become more literate and to feel their opinions matter. This book is also good from a critical media literacy perspective as Kass utilizes the idea of this and critical discourse analysis. Alonmg with Anthony Giddens and Zygmaunt Bauman Mr Kass is an expert wo is secure enough in his views to invite the reader to do their own independent thinking- too often books are written by  infallible experts who believe that readers role is to be a mere receptacle of expert opinion. Mr Kas i someone who thru his books and articles has been engaged in these issues for a long time-as should all Americans. This book serves as a launching pad for readers to deeply engage on issues that should not be left to expperts who often make little if antyy effort to listen to the concerns of Americans.
<br />I regret that some readers prefer to quickly close their mind on issues that require deep sustained thought that  neither ideology alone nor so called expertise can easily or quickly resolve.</span>

                    <span>Leon Kass is a wise and humane thinker. As a physician and as a moral philosopher he is uniquely qualified to deal with the issues being raised by the latest biotechnological developments. His concern is to preserve the freedom and dignity of humanity, against the unthinking onslaught of the ' improvements ' that may destroy us. 
<br />It seems to me that his goal is admirable and his arguments strong, but that the marketplace of technological one up-man-ship and human pride greed and ambition will not prevent many different kinds of ' progress' for a few that will be detrimental to all. Even if Kass were to succeed within the United States in restraining certain kinds of research, there would be no stopping teams of researchers elsewhere who would for profit and glory produce ' designer babies' and ' new forms of machine- man hybrid life' and ' indefinitely long - lifed human beings' and countless other developments which again might seem beneficial for a few but which will be detrimental to our common humanity. 
<br />Kass is a clear and convincing writer in discussing a whole host of issues in regard to what we may do to ourselves in our laboratory future. This book is highly recommended if only because it will enrich the reader's sense of what is presently at stake, and what might possibly be done to make us more human not less</span>

                    <span>I'm really surprised that this book has received such positive reviews. Although it has some good points, 'Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity' suffers from some very serious flaws.<p>The main focus of this book (which is actually a collection of previously published articles, so don't bother buying it if you've been keeping up with Kass's other works) is human dignity. Kass believes that all human life has an inherent dignity that transcends our scientific understanding, and that we should be wary of new technologies that would violate our dignity. This is certainly an appealing concept, but Kass fails utterly in his attempt to transform it into a coherent bioethics policy. <p>How do we know if something violates human dignity? If it gives Kass a creepy feeling. That's the main problem with this book; although Kass talks a great deal about the importance of human dignity, he isn't interested in rational, coherent analysis of ethical issues. Kass seems to be writing primarily to fellow religious conservatives who already share his technophobic views. If you don't already agree that cloning, stem-cell research, organ sales, in vitro fertilization, euthanasia, and genetic engineering are morally repugnant, there really isn't anything in this book that would cause you to change your opinion. Although Kass toys with various philosophical justifications for his views throughout the book, in the end he always seems to base his opinions on his own visceral emotional reactions. This isn't just my opinion; Kass plainly admits it himself. On page 61 Kass criticizes conventional ethicists for their reliance on logic and failure to take human emotions into account: <p>"Philosophical ethics today is rationalist, I would say hyper-rationalist, and I allege, unreasonably so. The dominant mode of American philosophizing today remains analytic. It concerns itself with the analysis of concepts, the evaluation of arguments and the criticism of justifications, always in search of clarity, consistency, coherence. It spends little time on what genuinely moves people to act - their motivations and passions, that is, loves and hates, hopes and fears, prides and predjuces, matters that are sometimes dismissed as nonethical or irrational because they are not simply reducable to logos. Revulsions and their correlative taboos are often overlooked; since they cannot give incontrovertible logical defenses of themselves, they tend to fall benieth the floor of ethical discourse. As a result, that discourse focuses almost exclusively on matters conceptual and logical." <p>Yes, you read that correctly: Kass is taking a heroic stand against rationality, clarity, and coherence. Apparently Kass has forgotten that in a liberal democracy we don't generally base policy decisions on what we find creepy or unappealing. The sort of rational, analytical examination of contemporary issues in medical ethics that one would expect in a serious policy discussion is sorely lacking. Kass spends an entire chapter (which he titles 'The Wisdom of Repugnance') trying to explain why rational discourse should be put aside in favor of emotional reactions, but it isn't very convincing. <p>Many of Kass's views are extreme, even for a conservative. Kass not only opposes controversial practices like euthanasia and human genetic engineering, but also relatively mundane things like in-vitro fertilization and organ transplants. Although the subject isn't brought up in this book, it's worth mentioning that in the past Kass has even come out against medical students dissecting human cadavers. <p>Although 'Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity' gives a fascinating look into the mind of President Bush's head bioethics advisor, I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a serious discussion of contemporary issues in medicine or biotechnology.</span>

                    <span>In his book Life, LIberty and the Defense of Dignity, Leon Kass cites a few times that 2/3rds of the population are opposed to cloning. Well, I am not one of them. There is much to disagree with here and I've done much of it. But unlike those shoddy books like Fukuyama's Our Posthuman Future, or Bill McKibben's laughable diatribe, Enough, I can disagree with Kass while still respecting him as a thinker. I even nod my head at some of his points. <p>About half of this book deals with abstract, and half, concrete, issues. His abstract sections I was almost in total agreement with. Ethical philosophy, he writes, long ago lost track of how to deal with issues rather than theories, and real peoople rather than 'rational man' constructs. Minutia is argued on a quest to develop a consistent theory of the human right and good. BUT NO SUCH THEORY NEED TO BE CREATED! We are dealing with people who make most decisions on a hearty combination of feeling (not amenable to intellectualization) and rational thought. This is where Kass comes from. <p>Add to this that biology has gone on so well with the reductionist program that even it has started to lose track of how to deal with the whole person. Like wantling to understand a person-in-full by studying the small minutia of their lives seperately, event-by-event; you won't get the feel of the whole person that way; she must be studied as a whole person. Biology, by breaking us down to the smallest constituent parts, don't explain us, so much as break us down to the type of bite-sized chunks they find helpful in THEIR studies. <p>So Kass starts from the philosophy of the whole person. It is here that I feel he uses this more as an excuse to be inarticulate than a tool to REALLY examine the issue. Whether it is cloning, euthenasia, the selling of organs; he keeps taling about how our human dignity is threatened but never even attempts to explain what in the world he means. <p>He argues that our instinctual revulsion to such processes may reflect a deeper wisdom that intellect can't articulate. But didn't we also feel revulsion to the idea of heart transplants too? Many of us feel revulsed by the very idea of surgery (going under the knife and all). Does that mean that we are expressing a 'deeper wisdom' and should not have surgury at all? I think our revulsion to biotech comes more from the thought of the unknown and our desire to hold on to the "natural order of things". <p>Life, he tells us, is precious. Thus, we must be very careful with how we treat it. I agree. But why does it follow that we have to, then, leave birth up to the chance process that causes miscarriages, deformities, premature deaths, and...let's be honest...unwanted babies that may well grow up to abuse? And why does it follow that an old woman who is nearing a painful end to her life (with only a glimpse of hope for recovery) be made to live out her last days when she wants to end it? <p>To be sure, there are quite a few philosophers who are just as sensitive to human dignity as Kass is who take the opposite conclusions. John Lachs ("Community of Individuals", "Relevance of Philosophy to Life") and Sidney Hook ("Convictions") are two notable examples. <p>To close, though I agree with Kass's theoretical goals, I disagree on virually everything else. This book, though, is professionally writte, gives some (some, that is) strong points and never comes off as zeolous, abrasive, or mean-spirited toward critics. Read this - even if you don't agree with Kass.</span>
