                    <span>Helen Whitney's production, "Richard Avedon: Darkness and Light", provides a comprehensive overview of the career, and also to some extent, of the personal life of this exceptional photographer. The program details Mr. Avedon's work, which over the past fifty years has attempted to "nurture perceptions that most people discard".<P>The first thirty minutes of this film describe Mr. Avedon's journey, from his work in Paris fashion magazines in the year 1946, to around 1966 when he became temporarily disillusioned with the social life within the fashion world. The next twenty minutes work to describe his growth as a portrait photographer. During this period, the human face becomes the "primary focus of attention" of Mr. Avedon's eye, with portrait styles ranging from explosive multiple exposures to serene comments on human dignity. Most of the work of this period was photographed against Mr. Avedon's "signature" solid white background.<P>The documentary then becomes somewhat more personal in describing Mr. Avedon's relationship with his father, a Russian Jewish immigrant, during the final stages of his father's struggle with terminal cancer. Photographs of his dying father were made, however, thoughts regarding possible "invasions of personal privacy" and the meaning of the quality of their relationship at that time are explored.<P>The program describes Mr. Avedon's trip to the American West, while recuperating from health problems. There, he made photographs of working class people, drifters and generally those who exist outside of the gaze of the mass media. The final thirty minutes of the program become more philosophical in nature, with meditations on Mr. Avedon's relationship to his subjects and reflections on his reputation within the world of photography.<P>The subjects of Mr. Avedon's photographic work represent people both known to the general public and those unknown. These images serve as unique documents of the diversity of human experience in much of the later part of the twentieth century. So lovers of photography, and of the arts in general, will not want to miss this captivating documentary.</span>

                    <span>A well done and informative DVD. I use it in my photo classes. My only complaint is that it is not closed captioned for the hearing impaired. I have students who are hearing impaired and this lack of captioning makes it difficult for al to enjoy.</span>
