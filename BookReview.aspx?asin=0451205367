                    <span>Hello all,
<br />
<br />Firstly, should state I have read the translated version of this book in Chinese. This book is probably one of the most useful personal finance books I've read. The advice, seemingly simple and straightforward, truly does make a difference in planning one's future.
<br />
<br />For it does not promise instant rags to riches, other practical advice includes 'working hard in one's job', 'saving 10% of your monthly salary' and 'do not be too stingy, enjoy the rest of the salary and life's many wonders' while keeping strictly to the principles of savings and investing.
<br />
<br />Right now, I'm working on 2.5% savings, it's less than the recommended amt but it's a mindset of "less now, more later". While paying off one's loans and debts, while saving, can feel the security and empowerment that comes with increasing one's savings as described in the book.
<br />
<br />In the end, what the book preaches is sticking to a simple formula of 
<br />1)Earn one's money through labour
<br />2)Save 10% of earnings
<br />3)Spend the rest of 90%
<br />4)Invest savings
<br />Repeat infinitely.
<br />
<br />The analogy of using a seed to describe the growth of money is apt as it requires discipline, patience and perseverance.
<br />
<br />A recommended read.</span>

                    <span>I must disagree with some of the references throughout the book, in particular about the wearing of "the finest garments/robes" and eating "the finest foods". It is my belief that in order to become truly rich, one must have self respect, and by saving money from the clothing one wears s/he will have a hard time in the professional and personal life where everything is judged by its appearance. It often wise to pay the full price - there is no cutting corners with excellence. Try saving money of your clothes and work for any big company. See how far ahead you will get. Also, it is always the best choice to spend extra money on the finest foods, as it goes inside your body it has a lot of effects especially on the brain. Other than that the book was great!</span>

                    <span>George Clason's Richest Man in Babylon is considered a classic in its field for good reason.  This slim volume offers common-sense advice on how to gradually build solid wealth.  Clason offers no get-rich-quick schemes or stock market tricks.  Instead, he offers solid foundational principles which anyone can follow, such as "Save ten percent of your income" and "Live within your means".  While they may seem obvious, far too many people fail to utilize them.
<br />
<br />Clason preferred to dispense his advice in the form of parables rather than simple lectures, so this is far more readable than your average investment or personal finance tome.  The writing style, which is imitative of "King James English", is a bit corny, but this does not detract from the read.  The stories are not exciting, but interesting enough to keep your attention.  Most importantly, the principles are valid no matter what age or economy you live in, so the book, despite its age, is a wonderful introduction to the basics of personal finance for anyone.</span>

                    <span>History has described Babylon as the greatest example of man's ability to achieve noble feats by using every possible resource available to him. All of the resources supporting this large city were created by man. This is precisely why George S. Clason decided to spin his tale of financial understanding in this ancient land; the very mention of this legendary city evokes visions of wealth and splendor. `The Richest Man in Babylon' offers insights that aid its reader in wealth acquisition, how to maintain that wealth, and make one's reserves earn more money. In order to properly portray such an endeavor, Clason takes us to Babylon where the basic principles of finance are still in use today. Each chapter describes, through the use of fictional characters, how to achieve and maintain wealth in seven steps. After having finished this easy to follow financial guide, the reader is more prepared to make the life changes necessary to acquire wealth and make one's money earn even more.  Also recommended, `The Baron Son' by Vicky Therese Davis et al.</span>
