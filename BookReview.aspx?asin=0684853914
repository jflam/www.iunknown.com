                <span id="Label1">In a stunning feat of meticulous reportage, Pulitzer Prize winner  Richard Ben  Cramer ultimately puts to rest the "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?"  question with iconoclastic bravura. In Cramer's evaluation, the hero America  held onto so desperately for so long was really a creation of a nation's  communal imagination. The Joe DiMaggio that America tried so hard to believe in  was never really here at all.<p>  There was, of course, a Joe DiMaggio, and he had a splendid career in Yankee  pinstripes--once hitting safely in an unimaginable 56 consecutive games--and a  troubled marriage with Marilyn Monroe, each augmenting the other in our national  mythology. But myths tend to be skin-deep, and Cramer's biography thrives in an  internal geography well below the surface. The map he charts is of a cold,  small, often nasty, uncaring, resentful, self-centered man, a man of public  grace and private misery who broke friendships, shunned family, and chased money  with the same focused energies he once harnessed to run down fly balls. It's not  a pretty picture. <p>  Scrupulously researched and elegantly written, <I>The Hero's Life</I> is filled  with stories and reminiscences, both on and off the field, from others--not  surprisingly, DiMaggio offered no cooperation--that both illumine the man and,  more fascinatingly, explain our very need for him. Amid all the success and  adulation, there was little joy in DiMaggio's life, and few moments--beyond the  real heartache he felt over Monroe--of connection with others beyond Joe's  personal need for others to serve him. "No one really knew what it meant to have  spent a half-century being precisely and distinctly DiMaggio," Cramer writes,  "what we required Joe DiMaggio to be. No one knew, as he did, what it cost to  live the hero's life. And no one knew, as he did, precisely what it was worth."  It seems our nation turned its lonely eyes to a proud, but empty shell; Cramer's  superb book helps us understand why we did, and how DiMaggio was able to take  all the good will extended him and give so little back. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>Man, was my attitude toward the Clipper changed by this book. What a (...) Joe D. was. Selfish, greedy, nasty - a real jerk.
<br />Of course, was everything Cramer wrote true? Tough to prove, because there's very little provable documentation. You just have to take Cramer's word for it. 
<br />But there is no doubt the Clipper had to have the moniker "The Greatest living player."
<br />That in itself proves what an egomaniac narcissist the Clipper was.</span>

                    <span>If you are a Yankee fan, you will not agree with this review.  DiMaggio grew up very poor in a large family.  Had to fight for everything in his life.  The descriptions of old San Franciso were great.  Ben Cramer paints DiMaggio as the best ever, read this again Yankee fans Ben Cramer said he was the best, hitting, running, defense, sense on the field. everything he did was exraordinary.  All the reviews which did not like the book never disagree with this assessment of DiMaggio.  The baseball writing of DiMaggio was great.  Look if he was a quite, private person more power to him.  If you are a Yankee fan or DiMaggio worshipper stop reading the book after the baseball section of the book.  After this section this is where many people have a problem.  I thought this section of the baseball card signing shows, his autographs and how he craved money and respect (many people do, not anything wrong with this) were how DiMaggio lived his life his he got out of baseball.  But people do not want DiMaggio portrayed in this light.  If you are a regular fan who wants to read Ben Cramers portrayal of DiMaggio this is a great book.  Many people have a different view of DiMaggio's life.  Who really knows how athletes live their lives.  Many people confuse how people conduct themselves on the field of sport so they must be great people.  This is not a true comparision.  Look for a real hero in our teachers. military, social workers.  There are athletes who do lead great lives we just don't hear much about them.  Read the book. Ben Cramers writing style make this a great read.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book spares no opportunity to trash the man.  Things that are really irrelevant - Monroe's life and treatment in Hollywood before Dimaggio, his sex life, etc. are devoted large amounts of space.  
<br />
<br />Compare this book to his book on Ted Williams and you can see how Ben Cramer treats his "friends" (Williams) and those he holds in contempt.  Even in the Williams book, he slams Dimaggio.  At times it seems almost pathological, his fixation on tearing down the reputation of this man.  I am sure that Dimaggio is far from perfect (who isn't), but this seems to go above and beyond the course of biographical inquiry into perhaps - slander or a vendetta. 
<br />
<br />My recommendation is to skip the book, read Halberstam's "Summer of 49".  It combines sports and personality much better and unlike Ben Cramer's book, doesn't make you feel like you need to take a shower after reading it.</span>

                    <span>There must be some big, hidden legal, personal, or editorial reason for the terribly awkward structure of this book.  It begins with Joe as a kid, covers hime season-by-season with the Yankees, degenerates into tabloibism from the time Joe met Marilyn until her suicide, and then skips from 1962 to 1989 without any explanation at all.  This is something you just don't see from major authors and major publishers.  What happened?
<br />
<br />As is usual from old political reporters writing books (think Halberstam or Woodard) there is no scholarship or authentication.  You simply have to take the author's word that things transpired as they did. Bearing this in mind,nobody should be surprised that Cramer's approach is a hack-job -- but he does that to everybody -- there are no good guys in Cramer's world.  Everyone has dirty laundry.</span>

                    <span>Joe DiMaggio began as an immigrant boy who made it big in
<br /> baseball during the first half of the previous century. He 
<br /> came from a family which included 9 children. One of his first jobs was selling "The Call" for .03 apiece. His parents were Rosalie and Giuseppe DiMaggio. Initially, he had some problems in school; however, he quickly rose as an important Rookie with the Seals in 1933. At one point, Joe made 47 hits
<br /> consecutively. At age 19, he signed for a second year with the
<br /> Seals. He came to New York in 1938 and by 1942, he carried the
<br /> Yankees to a championship and himself to an MVP. Despite the
<br /> great accomplishment, he did not get compensated financially
<br /> until later on. The work is a "must read" for every baseball
<br /> enthusiast.</span>
