                <span id="Label1">Anyone who has managed the process of developing or redesigning  a Web site of significant size has likely learned the hard way the  complexities, pitfalls, and cost risk of such an undertaking. While  many Web development firms have fantastic technical expertise, what  sets the topnotch organizations apart is the ability to accurately  manage the planning and development process. <I>Web Redesign: Workflow  That Works</I> directly addresses this crucial area with a specific,  proven process.<p>This brief but important book lays out a specific  five-step strategy--called the Core Process--that can always be applied  to the development of Web sites and fine-tuned to almost any type of  project. Each step--defining the project, developing site structure,  visual design and testing, production and QA, and launch and  beyond--contains three related but distinct tracks. The text begins  with a brief overview of each of the steps, then delves deeper into  each with detailed explanations as well as specific forms and  project-management strategies. This book does not cover back-end,  server-side programming. Instead, it focuses primarily on the visual,  conventional components of a Web site.<p>Authors Kelly Goto and Emily  Cotler compiled this book in an attractive, easy-to-read format. This  process guide uses numerous full-color screen shots to illustrate site  examples, as well as plenty of site diagrams and sample forms. The book  even has a companion Web site with downloadable forms in PDF format to  put the Core Process into immediate action. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B>  <ul> <li>Step 1--Defining the Core Process: discovery, planning, and  clarification; <li>Step 2--Developing site structure: content-view, site-view, and  page-view; <li>Step 3--Visual design and testing: creating, confirming, and  handing off; <li>Step 4--Production and QA: prepping, building, and testing;  <li>Step 5--Launch and beyond: delivery, launch, and maintenance. </ul></span>

<br />
<br />I've used the information from both Workflow that Works to develop a creative design process for nearly every company I have worked for or with.  
<br />
<br />I've purchased copies of this book for some traditional designers to help them understand the differences between our worlds.  It's written in such a way that they get it right away.</span>

<br />
<br />If you like to build houses without blueprints or drive across the country without a map, this is probably not the book for you.
<br />If you like to build web sites that work with a high liklihood of being on-time and on-budget...read this book.</span>

                    <span>The first edition of this book has been something of a bible for my small design shop, though much of the numbers and timelines were a bit science-fiction. The second edition does remedy some of this, and adds a nice chapter, but isn't all that much different from the first, so I wouldn't bother purchasing it if you have the first one.
<br />
<br />Also please note that much of the content mentioned in the book as being available for download on their website isn't there. Seems like they haven't really gotten around to finishing the job! But nevertheless, a good book, and two very talented and capable writers.</span>

                    <span>since creating my first web site in 1994, i've waited to find one book that actually encapsulates a core process into one book. we've all used this same process, called it different things and even added our own steps and 'methods'. all in all there wasn't much new to get from it in my own opinion. 
<br />
<br />but for someone who has never been involved in the design and development of a web site, this book is a must have. </span>
