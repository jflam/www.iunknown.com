                    <span>     I haven't used VB since version 4.0 years ago, A few weeks ago I bought VB .NET Step by Step the complete learning edition (comes with VB .NET standard). I picked up the step by step book and set it back down, very boring. So I bought VB .NET for the absolute beginner... This book is great within 5 or 6 chapters I was completely comfortable with VB again (I wasn't that comfortable with VB 4.0 in the first place), I'm just about finished with the book now and am ready to go back to school armed with this new knowledge for the new VB .NET course they just started offering.
<br />     Any way my only regrets is that this publisher does not make a C++ .NET for absolute beginners... Anyone who may have some suggestions please e-mail me: jaycosby@adelphia.net (please, no boring titles)...
<br />
<br />Sincerly,
<br />Jay Cosby</span>

                    <span>Here are the ADVANTAGES of this book:
<br />
<br />1) This book is TRULY designed for programming beginners!  In other words, you do not have to have prior programming experience in order to be able to learn from this book.
<br />
<br />2) Each chapter provides clear, easy to understand, programming examples which are throughly thought out by the author.  Due to this, it makes learning a lot of fun -- and quite entertaining!
<br />
<br />3) The coding samples are clearly explained.  For a fact, this is my first programming exposure to the .NET platform and I am rapidly learning to write neat software with this book.
<br />
<br />4) Don't listen to the others who are giving this book a bad rating.  The only truth to their statements is that this book does use (in some chapters) older, and well-known programming commands, which Microsoft would prefer went away.  However, these statements are perfectly legitimate to use -- and are frequently used in software developed to this very day.  Besides that, the rest of their complaint's are mostly unnecessary nit-picking...</span>

                    <span>It starts out with some really basic stuff, and than walks you through to the Intermediate Level. I had looked over about 30 other books before settling on this one. Those other books just don't give you enough beginning information. I think this book is probably one of the best ones out there. Learning Visual Basic.NET is not easy, but this book really helps.</span>

                    <span>The fact that you are reading the details of a book titled "Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Programming for the Absolute Beginner" means that this is the book you are looking for!  The review saying this book is not for a beginner must have a Visual Basic .NET book of their own on Amazon! <p>IMPORTANT: Not all books claiming to be for "BEGINNERS" are what you think! Because VB.NET is a NEW language and not a new version of Visual Basic, even advanced VB programmers are "Beginners" to VB.NET. However, all the terminology and concepts are still the same, there are just new ways to write the code. If you are a true beginner and buy the wrong book, you'll be back on Amazon looking for a book on Visual Basic 6.0 so you can understand your book on Visual Basic.NET! <p>This book is for TRUE beginners with NO past experience with Visual Basic!<p>That said...<p>If you are like me and learn from "hands on" experience, this book is for you. I was on a mission to learn VB.NET and I had absolutely no experience with Visual Basic or Visual Studio. I spent $1000 for an ElementK subscription because they offered two separate eLearning courses on VB.NET that were created by Microsoft.  After a full day of taking a course, all I had to show for it was 30 pages of notes that contained nothing but definitions and snippets of code. I never saw a single example of code that made up a complete application.  <p>Frustrated, I decided to see if I could find a good ebook from Books24X7.  Since there were over 50 of them on VB.NET, I had to play "Eenie-Meenie-Minie-Mo" on several occasions.  Luckily I didn't have to pay each time I chose a book because all the ebooks seemed great until I realized after a couple chapters that I was supposed to have experience with Visual Basic or Visual Studio version 6.   <p>Then I came across this ebook in the ElementK Resource section.  I learned more about VB.NET in one hour than I did using Microsoft's training!  <p>Each chapter ends by having you create a program using what you've learned.  After a few chapters, you've subconsciously learned the same information and more through repetition rather than trying to memorize your way to VB.NET.<p>(So you don't get the wrong opinion about ElementK, only the VB.NET courses are made by Microsoft. All the others they offer are excellent) <p>Trust me!  You can't go wrong with this book if you are a beginner.  And if you have a background in VB, you an jump to Chapter 5 and start learning new information right away.<p>You won't just learn how to program with VB.NET, you'll have EXPERIENCE programming VB.NET applications.  <p>I have never taken the time to write a review on ANYTHING! (And seeing how much effort it took to write this one, it will be the last! ha ha!) But, I know what it feels like to have a sea of books to choose from.  It's like putting your all your money on "Hope This Is Useful" to win in the fifth! Not to mention that you don't won't know what they meant by "Beginner" until you open the book.  <p>I wish someone pointed me to this book from the start, so I figure I might as well be a pointer for someone else.<p>Thanks for reading my lengthy review...</span>
