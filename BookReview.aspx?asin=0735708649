                    <span>Without question, this is the best book covering SQL Server I've ever owned. It is written simply with a minimum of word clutter. A majority of the topics are pertinent to SQL 2000 as well as SQL 7.0 (SQL 2000 is more or less SQL 7.5 in my eyes).<P>I recommend this book to any experienced DBA's out there who need a virtual DBA within arm's reach. <P>Sharon... write another book on SQL.NET PLEASE!!!</span>

                    <span>Sharon Dooley does a fantastic job in the reference book. This book is the expert sitting in the chair next to you when you have a DBA task to do and you need help. If you're new to SQL Server, this guide isn't for you YET. Sharon Dooley covers the how, the why, and the when. She assumes you already know the what, so learn the "what", and then you'll LOVE this book for many crises to come.<P>-MCSD from the NW</span>

                    <span>This book helped me when I was moving databases from one machine to another and I had to fix some orphaned users. How many other books would even address this issue? None, I think. Most other SQL Server books seem to be outlines of BOL and little else. This author has obviously taken a different approach, that of a working DBA with problems to solve.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Dooley is among just a handful of people who can write about SQL Server at such an experience level. She shares her deep expertise and wisdom gained through hands-on use of SQL Server and real-world implementations. I also enjoyed generous warnings and tips which appeared throughout the book. They make the book fun to read and vividly illustrate technical points. As I read the book I kept thinking, "This is so useful and practical!" Ms. Dooley does an excellent job in presenting the information in a way that is best to learn and remember. Obviously, the author's experience as a prominent SQL Server trainer helped her to organize the book in such a great fashion. <P>I recommend this book to a wide range of SQL Server administrators and developers. The book covers SQL Server 7.0, has some mentions of SQL Server 2000, and also refers to older versions that may benefit users who have experience with prior releases. Developers, especially advanced ones, will also benefit from the best coverage of DMO I've seen in any resource.</span>
