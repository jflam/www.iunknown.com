                    <span>This book explains how to cover up bad points about yourself, and how do deal with personal or illegal questions, but certainly gives  very few good answers to help win a job.  There are plenty of better interview books out there.</span>

                    <span>No general tips here or vague advices. This book gives very useful tips on how to answer some very tough and specific interview questions.  This is really the book you need if you anticipate a really difficult and long interview in front of an evaluation committee. Thanks to this book, none of the questions I was asked during my interview came as a surprise.  And, in the end, I got that dream job I wanted.  However, you should forget this book if you are naive enough to believe you can prepare a serious job interview in 24h.  You need to give yourself a lot of time in order to assimilate all the material.  </span>

                    <span>An entire book of ONLY interview questions is just too much of a good thing, IMHO.  There are several books which have a chapter on interview questions, and list only the ones which are you really likely to encounter, which I have found much more useful.</span>

                    <span>The beginning chapters are just fluff & common sense. However, it will at least get you thinking about what you may incounter during an interview. I wouldn't rule this book out completley. The biggest problem I had with this book was that, unless you have tons of time to practice and study each question, it is simply impractical to expect to cover all the material. My advice would be to prepare more general areas for the interview. Focusing on particular questions is almost a waste of time.</span>

                    <span>Maybe I'm just nit picky but although there are some informative tidbits, I feel this book is poorly written. There are other, better Job Interview books on the market. If you're going to plunk down some hard-earned money for this, you're making a mistake. Buy it used. That said, the follow up to this book, something like More Answers to 250 questions (or something like that) is a much better buy.</span>
