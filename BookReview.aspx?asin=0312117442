                    <span>I've been going out with my boyfriend for 5 months now. Everything has been great but there had been one aspect of the relationship that was creating tensions. He didn't know how to kiss differently...just one way ALL the time. It was gets a little old, and getting to the point where I didn't want to get intimate and kiss. I had to someway ameliorate our relationship before we just ended it. Our five month anniversary was April 6 2000 and I bought him this book, and he laughed. We would hang out alone and try them out. It's improved our relationship 100% and I can't wait to kiss him when we're together! We both realized what we want "physically" out of each other in kissing and such. It was wonderful!</span>

                    <span>I personally didn't enjoy this book. It's printed on cheap paper, and it doesn't contain any photographs or illustrations, except for a few line-art pictures for decoration only. The bulk of the book describes 24 types of kisses.<P>This book could be interesting for people who are in a romantic relationship who would enjoy reading about and trying out some different kissing techniques described.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book on kissing -- period. Not only does it offer creative ideas for beginners, it has plenty to suggest for advanced kissers as well. Sure it deals with some kisses that you may have heard of before (like the eskimo kiss and the french kiss) but it treats them in depth so that even experienced kissers will learn something new. (By the way, if you think the eskimo kiss is just for kids you haven't read this book.) The best part of this book, though, is all the great romantic ideas it offers experienced kissers. It's down to earth and practical, like Ovid's THE ART OF LOVE, but devoted all to kissing. Who knew that lip-o-suction could be done in a pulsating action? Who else tells you how men and women respond differently to french kisses? Do you know how to do the Trobriand Islands kiss? This wonderful volume tells you everything there is to know about kissing and it's by an author who has done his research, having surveyed over 100,000 people! It's written in a romantic style that's appropriate for teenagers as well as adults. And because it's a whole book devoted exclusively to kissing, it's something you could give as a gift without embarrassing yourself. If you love to kiss, do yourself a favor and get it. I consult it before many dates and it always inspires me. After all, isn't that what a book on kissing is supposed to do?</span>

                    <span>This is one time I wish I hadn't listened to the other reviewers. I didn't find this book at all informative. It could be slightly entertaining at times but it is not at all educational. I had thought this was to give tips and specific instruction on kissing. I thought that this was meant to help improve ones kissing ability. It is kind of childish and it is not beneficial. It talks about kisses in general terms. It even talks about "butterfly" and "eskimo" kisses which is something that 5 year-old children utilize. I am not 5 years-old and I want some specific adult help to become a fantastic kisser. I don't know what else to offer as a substitute to this stupid book other than practice, practice, practice.</span>
