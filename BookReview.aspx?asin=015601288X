                    <span>Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I'm among those who do know what kind of responsibility it takes to own a dog. I'm the happy 'Mom' of 2 terriers, one of which is a rescue dog. It is true about rescued animals - they know they've been given another chance and will give you their love many times over.<P>Elizabeth Hess was down to earth in showing the trials and successes an animal shelter goes through. If you know someone who's not sure about getting a pet, I highly suggest they read this book. It'll make them think twice. If you know someone with misconceptions that all shelter animals get homes, give them this book as a wakeup call! A pet can take up as much or more of your time than a human baby, but the human race has made dogs, cats and other animals disposeable. There are happy endings as well as sad in the book, but it's worth buying. As the kids would say, we give it a 2 paws up!</span>

                    <span>For everyone who has ever adopted an animal, surrendered an animal, loved an animal or simply wants to know how we who work at a shelter manage to hang in there, this is the book. Elizabeth Hess has done a marvelous job recording her insights into the very stressful, often frustrating, often heartwarming aspect of this very difficult job. It is not a depressing book, but, rather, a realistic one. I could have written every single word she has put on paper, even though my shelter is many hundreds of miles away from hers and deals with a different population. What most people do not realize, and which this book points out, is that it is a humane shelter's job to protect the animals, most of which are abused and neglected, and get them into stable, non-abusive homes. This can be source of stress, as the average person thinks of a shelter as a pet store. We are far more than that, as Ms. Hess points it. She covers the horrors of puppy mills, the frustrations of working with an abusive public and non-caring judicial system, and the marvelous families who adopt and care for the unwanted and suffering. The most wonderful animals are found in shelters, and often some of the most wonderful people. Thank you, Ms. Hess, for letting everyone see this.</span>

                    <span>I've volunteered at the animal shelter in my town for a few years now, but have never had quite as much insight as this book provided. I get the feeling the shelter in the book has a smaller volunteer base than the shelter I have dealt with based on the details they were willing to share with her. This was a very uplifting book that explained a lot about why shelters work the way they do (ie rules about who can adopt, what happens when they get lost pets, etc.). Unfortunately, it is most likely to be read by the people that already understand these rules and why they exist.</span>

                    <span>This behind the scenes look at an animal shelter and the everyday lives of the animals and people that work there is a beautifully told, heart warming story. It certainly drives the point home (did for me, anyway) to adopt your pet rather than buy from a breeder or pet store. It's a book you'll not want to put down, and will remember long after you have. My friends will all have copies coming!</span>
