                    <span>Franklin Delano Donuthead has a problem or two --- his name, for starters. He also worries constantly about his own health and safety. One side of his body is growing faster than the other. It's less than an inch, yet Franklin measures every day. He memorizes the probabilities of his death in different ways --- car accidents, drowning, etc. --- and is on first-name terms with Gloria, the chief statistician for the National Safety Department. He calls her frequently.<P>Franklin's concerns never stop: he stresses over girls and ponders the possibility of his mother finding a husband. She points out that she is hampered by his habit of interviewing her dates and handing them medical questionnaires.<P>New kid Sarah Kervick slouches into Franklin's ordered and hygienic world. She doesn't brush her hair, has a few brown teeth, and doesn't bother to wear warm clothes or mask her attitude. He hasn't known Sarah ten minutes before she's socking the school bully. Franklin's teacher assigns him to help Sarah adjust to her new school. Soon, Sarah and Franklin's mother become friends, and his mom even hires Sarah to help teach Franklin to play baseball.<P>Before Franklin can say "please wash your hands before touching me," he is involved with "rude, law-breaking and violent" Sarah. He is disgusted with this state of affairs. However, Franklin soon discovers a hidden side to Sarah. Her dreams, abilities and home life challenge his opinion of her. Sarah's life makes him view his own problems in a new light.<P>Franklin tells his story so humorously that his self-centeredness is quirky rather than obnoxious. The comic tone is balanced by a few surprisingly sad moments. The conclusion, demonstrating how Franklin has changed, is hilarious yet sweet.<P>Anyone hungry for a helping of belly laughs plus a tender side dish of unexpected friendship should find DONUTHEAD a tasty read.<P> --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)</span>

                    <span>The main character is neurotic and quirky as heck, but he really grew on me (in a good way). The secondary characters are well-developed, showing both sweetness and flaws. I found myself rooting for everyone. <P>In this original and funny novel, a hypochondriac boy, his baseball-loving mom, and a Washington Bureaucrat a long-distance phone call away work together to change the life of a tough-as-nails girl. You'll definitely laugh, and you may also cry.<P>This mom, along with her ten-year-old daughter, really enjoyed the book.</span>

                    <span>Parents-- This is a great book for kids!! Donuthead is a neurotic hypochondriac who unwillingly becomes friends with a girl who is his exact opposite. The characters are likeable, even Donuthead, and the pace is fast and fun. Be aware that there is a brief section where he discloses he was conceived via artificial insemination which could lead to a fun discussion.</span>
