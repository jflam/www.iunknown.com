                    <span>I read this book while taking an advanced class in heuristics. I found the book to be extremely well written and very compelling to read. Although dealing with advanced topics, the authors' friendly and clear writing style makes it accessible to anyone with a CS background.
<br />
<br />The first half of the book is on search heuristics, covering methods such as traditional searches (exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, A*, etc), methods to escape local optima (simulated annealing, tabu search), and, perhaps most interesting of all, evolutionary algorithms. I later found out that these topics are typically taught in undergraduate artificial intelligence courses, an elective I never took. The second half of the book covers even more advanced areas, such as contraint-handling, neural networks, and fuzzy systems.
<br />
<br />The authors use three recurring example applications to demonstrate each search technique: the boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), travelling salesman (TSP), and a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). I really liked the consistent use of these three examples, as they give a sense of continuity throughout the book that helps the reader compare search techniques clearly. I had of course studied the TSP problem in my undergraduate algorithms class but never  in the context of such interesting approximation algorithms. In my heuristics class we had assignments to implement the TSP search problem using the Lin-Kernighan method, dynamic programming, and an evolutionary algorithm.  
<br />
<br />The written English in this book is simply outstanding and crystal-clear, which was something of a shock since I was unable to even pronounce the first author's name. The writing is in a very friendly tone with elements of humour dispersed throughout. Interestingly, in the summary chapter, there is an anecdote on the 1980s TV show Magnum PI (I even remember the mentioned scene myself), further revealing the friendly, plain-English tone of the book. Perhaps the best part of the book is that the numerical mathematical discourse is kept at a minimum (used largely for the NLP problems), so people who haven't taken calculus in ages (like me) can easily enjoy the book.
<br />
<br />As an added bonus(!), between each chapter is a brain-teaser problem like those found in those legendary Microsoft interview questions. 
<br />
<br />My only complaint is that there is no simple analysis of the running time complexity of each algorithm, which even in its simplest form would have been a great thing to read about.
<br />
<br />In summary, this book is an excellent read if you enjoy the topics covered. Highly recommended.

                    <span>I first ordered this book thinking it was George Polya 's book "How to solve it", then I realized it wasn't and I bought it anyway since I thought it might turn out as a "must read" book, just like Polys'a book.<p>One one hand it was a dissapointment, because the books are not written in the same manner and don't attact similar problelsm.<p>But then, this book makes you look into problems, and realize that usually we people are usually good in solving problems of the sort we learned how to (well... duh!), but surprisingly, we have a hard time solving even trivial problems if they are not placed in the context we got used to seeing them.<p>This book comes and tries to make things better in this department, showing you some general methods for solving problems, and also showing problems and suggested solutions along with a long discussion.<p>You should be able, once you've read the book and put your mind to it, to be better in understanding problems, understanding which tool to use for solving them and finally, understanding the tools enough to be able to actually solve the problem.<p>I enjoyed the overview of methods, and there are many such methods throughout the book (perhaps a complementary book for learning which "machine learning" methods are available these days and what sorts of problems they are useful for solving would be Tom Mitchell's "Machine Learning" book).<p>I wasn't sorry for buying this book. I'm happy I was fortunate enough to bump into it.</span>

                    <span>I am a computer scientist, but have gotten impatient over the years with the needless formalization that occurs in algorithmic texts. This is a delightful breath of fresh air in terms of balancing erudition with attempts to be "user friendly". If you want the latest and greatest twist to a well known technique, this book won't provide it. But it does a great job of competently and lucidly explaining the value proposition behind each optimization method and how to gradually upgrade from applying it naively to the more intricately optimized applications. Well done!</span>

                    <span>Clearly this is an outstanding book. It takes the reader close to the current knowledge frontier in the domain of heuristics of optimization. The style is educational and the prose supports it. That is probably the reason why everyone rates the book so high. However, it does have a downside: multiple (or reference) readings are not as easy. What helped for the first reading gets in the way for the others. Oh well... Can't really win, can you?<p>The references are ample and very detailed. That is necessary because some of the treatment (not all, by any means) is  rather descriptive sometimes and will necessitate looking them up and some references (not all, by any means) may not be easy to find (you'll be the judge...). Also, if you are looking for up-to-date treatment of multiobjective GA's, you won't find it there because, well, the field has already evolved.<p>So, overall, this is a "must buy" book and you will not have to take on a second morgage to purchase it. That's good!</span>
