                <span id="Label1">If film has a language, <I>The Filmmaker's Handbook</I> is your translation guide, dictionary, and phrase book. In over 600 pages, 18 chapters, and nine appendices, the authors detail virtually everything you need to know about filmmaking.<p> There is probably more information here than anyone needs to know, from which lens to choose all the way through final editing and sound mixing. But too much information is not a bad thing. This is the kind of book that a blossoming filmmaker will surely grow into.<p> Much of the book focuses on gear and hardware, and rightly so since making a film or video is both dependent on and influenced by the gear that is used. This handbook describes the differences between the tools--film stock, lenses, lighting setups--and the impact of each on the look of the finished product.<p> This new edition has been updated to include information on digital cameras, the digital video format, nonlinear editing systems, and other contemporary tools. It's odd to see a picture of the Canon XL-1--a very popular and state-of-the-art digital video camera--in a book whose first edition came out in 1983.<p> <I>The Filmmaker's Handbook</I> is an indispensable guide for any filmmaker, or for anyone who wants a better understanding of the language of film. <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>The Filmmaker's Handbook is a comprehensive guide to the art & science of filmmaking. Though it is currently falling abit behind with it's coverage of digital technology, as this is moving so fast it's hard for any book to stay current.<P>It has a lot of excellent information though, and goes into detail many other books lack. It's useful as a reference guide, and not so dry that it doesn't make an interesting read. If you are studying film, or want to get into the industry this book is a must have.</span>

                    <span>As an aspiring young filmmaker, the first thing I was told to do was go out and get a copy of the Filmmaker's Handbook. Imagine my surprise when I found out that the book had been updated in March of 1999, and that now it included all kinds of information about the digital age. I have learned so much from this book. The book goes over the entire film process, and does it in a straight-forward manner. It is a great start for beginners, yet it includes a rich amount of information for the professional. Anyone who has ever thought about a career in film really needs to get a copy of this book. Written in a manner that neither patronizes nor confuses the reader, the Filmmaker's Handbook is the best book I have skimmed or read on film, and believe me, I've looked at a lot.</span>

                    <span>I was assigned to read this as a textbook for my film class and wow, this book gets down to every little technical detail you could think of when it comes to making movies. This is definitely an invaluabe resource for anyone who's interested in making narrative, documentary, experimental, or corporate movies with a video or film camera(s).<P>The book explains the differences between the multitude of film systems from super 8 to 35mm, it goes into detail about how the camera works, discusses how to take care of your equipment and why, and goes all the way up to funding and distributing your movie. There are nine appendices which includes charts and calculations on how to adjust certain aspects of the camera/lens/etc. to get the certain look you want. So if you're on a set and need to adjust something on (or inside) the camera but are unsure of the calculations, it's just quick flip of the book to the appendix to find what you need.<P>The book also deals with the scientific features of filmmaking so anyone can get a better idea of how the various aspects of filmmaking work and which way of doing things is best for the filmmakers particular needs.<P>A few problems arise however. The technical jargon can be overwhelming sometimes and may require you to reread a paragraph several times in order to get a clear understanding of what the author is talking about. The fact that there's no glossary doesn't help that problem either. My biggest gripe however is the lack of coverage on digital filmmaking. The book is outdated and lacks the information needed for people wishing to make movies with DV cameras. Despite those problems, I still HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone wishing to make films.</span>
