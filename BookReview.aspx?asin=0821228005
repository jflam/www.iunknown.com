                    <span>Joan Koh, the hostess/writer/associate producer of "Kitchen Design" and "Bed & Bath Design" evokes a domestic goddess comfort zone, so that the reader wants to step into the cover illustration, sit down at the granite kitchen island/breakfast station with a cup of java and pick Kohn's brain about how we can stop being afraid of having a kitchen that we (a) enjoy being in, (b) enjoy cooking in, (c) don't mind showing the in-laws, and (d) can create without breaking the bank.
<br />
<br />Sitting in your own kitchen while reading this book is a great first step to overcoming "kitchen anxiety". Whether Kohn guides you through the various stages with checklists galore, questions to ask yourself (do you want a kitchen for show, or will you cook Thanksgiving dinner? Do you want the kids to feel welcome?), and over 230 stunning photos of real-life kitchens, as well as the inside scoop from designers, architects and decorators.  Yes, you can have a good relationship with your contractor!
<br />
<br />In part one, Kohn gives the overall broad picture, the blueprint if you will, with seven chapters on design essentials: vision (first and foremost), essential kitchen design elements, working with what you have, budget, ideas, style, and the design team. In part two, she delves into your vital tools: the function, the raw space, your floor plan, your personal style, and your personality.
<br />
<br />Kohn's inviting photographs, easy to understand user-friendly format, and expertise take the nightmare out of creating the recipe for your dream kitchen.

                    <span>I am re-doing my circa 70's kitchen and didn't know where to start for ideas.  Most magazines don't have enough examples of full kitchens.  Joan Kohn shows  all types of kitchens, big, small, upscale and practical.  The photos are great too.  She shows many materials and finishes that I hadn't even thought of.  It's like having 50 magazines in one book - only better!</span>

                    <span>I have been looking for books to read and refer to about kitchen design and renovation--and I finally found what I was looking for! Joan Kohn's book is inspirational when it comes to helping you make decisions about one of the most important rooms of the home--the kitchen. I realize that there are so many choices, but it comes down to what each individual needs and wants and Joan Kohn makes figuring this out a snap. The color photos throughout the book are beautiful and it is well worth its price for all of the information and illustrations it provides. I highly recommend it.</span>
