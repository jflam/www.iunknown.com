                    <span>I came across this book through one of the Seattle area purchase-circles. Its a complex story in a simple setting - the story of a family each with their own wants and needs, and a larger story of life through the father's patients, or research subjects. </span>

                    <span>Michael Byers shares with us many fallible and well-intentioned characters in his novel of discovery and loss. Set in and around Seattle, Washington, we encounter Dr. Henry Moss, a medical researcher working with children afflicted with Progeria (a rapid-aging disorder). Moss lives with his Austrian-born wife, Ilse (also a doctor) and their two teenaged children, Sandra and Darren. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Moss' work and patients deeply affect him. One boy in particular, William Durbin, touches a chord inside Henry's heart. He deeply regrets being unable to save this particular child and wishes he could halt the rapid destruction of his bones, skin and tissues. By absolute chance, he encounters another family whose elder son has a mutated strain of the disease. He is seventeen, an age unheard of for someone with Hickman's, and seemingly in perfect health. Could this boy's cells hold the answer to what medical science had previously hoped to find? Should Dr. Moss research this new set of cells (and endanger his own career in the process) in order to help William Durbin survive?
<br />
<br />We are shown the everyday dilemmas of people who are set slightly aside from the rest of us. Doctors charged with the care and knowledge to not only help their current patients, but to possibly change medicine and the world. Teenagers who struggle to stay close to their family when each member is pulling away in his or her own direction. Neighbors who flaunt their material possessions and withhold honest friendship are united by another's mysterious actions. Throughout, we are reminded that chances not taken and thoughts left unsaid can be an albatross around our necks. 
<br />
<br />This novel is an insightful gem into the worlds of medicine and human relationships. It should not be left unread.

                    <span>Although the plot of this book can be summarized in a sentence, during the 400+ pages of it you learn nearly encyclopedic knowledge about each of the characters -- their motivations, their histories, their hopes and desires.  You get to spend at least a chapter inside each character's head, and the author does a great job of bringing the characters to life.
<br />
<br />The Seattle setting is completely accurate, including lots of little out-of-the-way spots only a native knows.  Apparently the author's father works at the University of Washington hospital, which explains it.
<br />
<br />I was a little disappointed by the way the plot was SO realistic -- no dramatic denouement, no resolution to several characters' turmoils, no good guys or bad guys... this was refreshing in a way but, novelistically, curiously unsatisfying.  Well worth a read anyway.</span>

                    <span>I was a bit disappointed in the book because it was billed as 'medical-ethical thriller', but was much more a quiet look at an American family.  That is not a problem of course, just what I expected.  It is a book of quiet grace.  The characters are all fleshed out and almost like people we know.  They have real concerns, real ideas, real problems.  The story has it's ups and downs, as in real life...it does not have huge, shattering plots twists--again, that is just right for the novel.  If you are looking for a sweet, sad, and ultimately hopeful potrait of America at the turn of the century, this your book.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful book! The characters are very well done. I chose this book because I suffer from a chronic disease (and hope for a cure), but then I enjoyed Ilse's immigrant points of view, having met my US husband in Europe myself (I'm from Germany).<p>However, I would have expected better research of Ilse's background: Ilse's mother gives her marks when Ilse leaves for Paris - but the currency of Austria used to be the Schilling, not the Deutsche Mark (now it's the Euro). When Ilse speaks German, it sounds like straight out of a dictionary - no grammar knowledge whatsoever. And so on and on...<p>Byers knows how to write and does it very well, so maybe he just needs an assistant for the research part. Despite its shortcomings, I loved the book and will recommend it.</span>
