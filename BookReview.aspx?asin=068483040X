                <span id="Label1"><P> Dr. Bob Rotella, whose clients include Nick Price, Davis Love III, Tom Kite and Pat Bradley, is firmly established as the premier performance enhancement specialist in the golf world. In <I>Golf is a Game Of Confidence,</I> "Doc" Rotella focuses on the most important skill a golfer can have: the ability to think confidently. <P> Confidence, or "playing with your eyes," can be the difference between making par and a bogey, one-putting and three-putting, winning and losing. To help listeners revolutionize their own course management and mental game, Rotella relates stories of the game's legendary figures, and allows the listener not only to get inside the ropes but also to get inside the heads of the game's greatest players in their most important moments. <P> Filled with lore about the great players, great courses, and great tournaments, <I>Golf Of Confidence</I> inspires golfers to reach new heights in their games and their lives.</span>

                    <span>I started reading this book three days ago. Today I competed in a small golf tournament and won. I shaved a good five strokes off and had the funnest round iv played in a long time. This is a good book, it shows you the do's and don'ts in preparing for a shot, hole, or match. Read this book.</span>

                    <span>Rotella has over twenty years working with champion athletes, many of them the best golfers in the world. <P>What he's discovered and passed on to his clients his that golf begins and ends with confidence. <P>Rotella uses his advisees such as Brad Faxon to an amateur like Bill Shean to help them with this vital part of the game.<P>You'll learn about many of the terms you hear the expert commentaters speak of on the TV telecasts, "stay in the present," breakthrough moments, staying within yourself, trust, etc.<P>I disagree with some of the reviewers who say is all rehash, or else why would the best players seek this guy out? Maybe those who think it's simple stuff rehashed should be able to perform as those that feel the opposite, that they have to work on their mental game as well.<P>For us who do work on the mental game, consistent routine, etc., this book is a great help. Buy it, you'll like it, your golf will benefit.</span>

                    <span>I just want to say that this book was very helpful in increasing my confidence in my all around game. We all have rounds where we hit the ball extremely well the front nine and blow up on the back or vice-versa. Though it doesn't really give instructions or tips, it's what you take from it that is so beneficial. I played a few days after reading just the first few chapters and what I took from it was to "stay in the present". Every time I found myself getting ahead with my score or dwelling on a poor execution, I would say to myself, "Just stay in the present" and I played one of my best rounds ever. I would very much recommend this book to anyone who has ever "blown-up" during a round.</span>

                    <span>This contains a whole bunch of case studies -- some of pros you've heard of and some of amateurs -- who have consistenly played a higher level of golf because of self-confidence. Okay, great. But once I'm convinced of that (after the first chapter) this book is pretty short on things to do to improve your self-confidence. Save your money and spend it on his audio tape, "Putting Out of Your Mind". At least it has some advice on how to improve your game, rather than point out the obvious: success breeds success, and self-doubt is a real killer of your golf swing.</span>

                    <span>"Golf is a Game of Confidence" has helped both my wife and I lower our handicaps and play the game with much more enjoyment. Each chapter of the book is dedicated to stories from different golfers of all abilities - male, female, professional or amateur - whose game of golf has been helped through consultations with or reading the advice of Robert J. Roteela. Basic training tips, such as "Staying in the Present" "Be confident with your club selection and swing" "Dedication to the short game" and "Not keeping track of your score" really do work. You'll find a lot of great advice in this book.</span>
