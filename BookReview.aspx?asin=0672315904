                    <span>After buying many useless books on the VB API programming I bought this one after I read the reviews, and it is the ultimate reference ever. 
<br />
<br />If you are thinking of buying it, read the other reviews - they describe it more than I do - and go ahead and get it. It's worth every ounce of its weight in pure gold.

                    <span>it works well as a desktop reference but it also takes a little time to explain some of the more hardcore concepts.  i recommend this book to ANYONE wanting to start and sucessfully finish an API project.<br>  from this book it is apparent that mr Appleman believes VB can do ANYTHING by using a little API and, after owning it for a few months, you'll know it's true and you'll know how to make it happen too.  a must-have for any self-respecting vb programmer</span>

                    <span>This is a very long book and actually very comprehensive.  It <br>gives required information for you to do your own construction to access Win32 API calls in VB, but then it also gives you plenty of constructed code so that you can just use them right away.  <p>The meat of the book is Part2: Win32 API Functions.  Here is where you'll find conversions already done.  You can simply go<br>to the appropriate section of the book and look for your function conversion.  The index is rather well put together, start there of course.  But you may ask: "What if my conversion isn't in the book?"  Well, theres good news -- he explains how to do the conversion.  And whatever section (for example, Bitmaps and Icons) of Win32 your funcion falls in, in Part 2  there is a chapter for it, and in the beginning of that chapter Dan goes on and on about relevent attributes about the potential data type (e.g., Handles, or Device Independent Bitmaps) you'll need to find a VB counterpart for.<p>This book is exTREMELY long, so don't think that you'll be reading through it.  It's not designed to be read that way.  Here is how you use the book.  <p>Look for the Win32 function in the index.  <p>If you dont see it, go to the section of the book that most likely deals with it (for example, go to Device Contexts to find SelectObject).  <p>If its there simply copy the conversion.  If its not read how to do the conversion then (don't read how to do it until you need to do it -- save yourself some time and thinking).<p>Why only 4 stars?  Eh, it's kinda boring.  And I'm one of those C++ guys at heart.  And we SelectObject()s the old fashion way. =)<p>I should also mention that this book has examples in every chapter.<p>Me.SayGoodbye()</span>
