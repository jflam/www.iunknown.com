                <span id="Label1">Programmers and software architects don't really make a conscious decision to design an application (particularly one with online exposure) around the three-tier model-view-controller design pattern anymore. Three-tier, largely because of its adaptability and stability, is the norm. All of which means you need a database to underpin each of your applications. Designing your databases correctly can make the difference between slow-running, complicated code and software that's speedy, modular, and easy to work with. <I>Database Design for Mere Mortals</I> prepares someone with only a passing familiarity with databases for the important job of building the persistence layer (also called the data model) for software.<p>  Michael Hernandez explains database design in tradesman's terms. That is, he shows his readers how to identify the business problems that have to be satisfied by a database, then proceeds to explain how to build a solid solution to them. Hernandez's approach combines procedural guidelines (first identify critical facts, then apply a certain logic to yield tables, then establish cross-references, and so on) with practical definitions that clear up much of the rich trove of jargon surrounding databases. He walks through numerous examples, and doesn't shy away from the complexities that always exist in real customers' requirements. If you're not familiar with database design, and want to be, this is the book you need. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to design databases that fit business requirements and make software construction easier. In addition to explaining relational database concepts, the author explains data integrity, null values, keys, table relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many), and data types. He emphasizes processes designers should follow in building a new database or improving an existing one.</span>

                    <span>Michael Hernandez does a great job of explaining how the relational model works, and how a database should be designed from start to finish. Most of us will probably not follow his advice, though. 
<br />
<br />If you do decide to follow his advice, then be prepared for a very lengthy trip when designing your DBs. I tried on my first DB and found that the company I was designing the DB for started to get slightly irritated. This is because in this book Michael suggests you have a full blown manager and or user meeting with virtually every single change you make (also meetings for requirements, ideas, characteristic identification, user input meetings, manager meetings... oh look, a change happened, now we have to go through all of the same meetings again... and again... and... >yawn<... every other page in this book suggests another meeting). I must have had 25-30 meetings total, which just isn't necessary. Also, there is all sorts of spec sheets you should fill out for every single aspect of the database. I would probably just use a modeling tool (such as Visio) instead of going through this daunting task (I would have had to fill out over 300 spec sheets just for the fields!... it was a big DB)
<br />
<br />Although his way of designing is probably the way you should really go, I found that designing a sound database doesn't require quite so much work. You can do most of the design process if you have a good modeling tool, which is what I ended up doing and my DB turned out quite well (you still should conduct meetings, but not for every single aspect of the database... your clients will begin to think you have no idea what you're doing). However, this book pounds the relational design in your head so much, that you can't help but get over the tough learning curve of how a relational database really should be designed.</span>

                    <span>At the end of the day no one in the commercial world (i.e., in the real world ) is going to pay you for your theoretical knowledge of database design (unless, of course, you are on the development team at Oracle or Microsoft). This book imparts the fundamental knowledge of DB design whether you're using Access or Oracle and is the ideal complement to the theory laden books by C.J. Date and others.   </span>

                    <span>First thing's first, this book is not for anyone who wants to get a database up and running right away. I was reading a tutorial on database design over at Webmonkey and this book was recommended. So I got it, read it, and realized the Webmonkey tutorial was more effective than this book. It's not that this is a horrid book or anything; it's really more about the *PRINCIPLES* of proper database design and that's where its strengths lie. Moreover, I commend the author for wanting to make it so the common man could grasp the concepts. The problem is, though, this approach works for say a page or two but spread across 500+ pages and it becomes mind-numbingly borrrriiinnnnggg! An inordinate amount of time is spent on interviewing, re-interviewing, and interviewing people some more to gather values for your database (when much of it can be attainted through common sense), things like field specifications are OVER-explained, and uninspired writing (at least throw a bad joke in once in a while to show you're trying!) constantly leave the reader's attention span short.</span>

                    <span>I have to temper my enthusiasm for this book with the perspective gained by reading the negative comments of those who seem to be, by and large, professional database developers, programming experts, and teachers. First, I just gotta say: "no offense, but geez, what a bunch of snotty know-it-alls!" Now that I have that off my chest, this book was manna from heaven for me! I am a newbie, I'm using Access, I'm trying to create a system for my workplace (without knowing what I'm doing, mind you!), and I learn best through a logical approach, reinforcement, and repitition. I actually enjoyed the experience of skipping some paragraphs thinking, "yeah, yeah, you said that already, I GOT it!" But I think even having that experience helps me learn by shoring up the information deposit in my head. If you're in my situation, and you like starting at the beginning and getting a solid foundation, AND if you're not a big whoopdie doo database mogul, you will love this book! BTW, this is not a book about Access or any particular brand of database software, but a book about FUNDAMENTALS of database design that is probably most appropriate for people who don't intend to make their living designing databases. I'd bet that's a lot of people.</span>

                    <span>After trying to figure it out on my own, buying 3 differend $50 books, reworking my database project a half-dozen different ways, losing sleep, pulling my hair out... I finally found what I needed in this book. I think it is especially helpful for me because I've done enough trial and error to be truly convinced that I cannot avoid paying attention to the basics. For the first time, I feel like I know what I'm doing, at the foundation level at least. This book is written in amazingly clear and precise language, with a brilliantly logical organization. It reinforces learning through a deliberate method: "first I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you, then I'll actually tell you it, then I'll tell you what I told you (then give you a case study and a quiz)." Awesome. SO HELPFUL!! I don't know when I've felt so grateful for a book. If you're new to Access, or want to learn a solid method for building the foundation and framework of a database, I can't recommend this book highly enough.</span>
