                    <span>This book ranks as the single indispensable guide to hiking and/or climbing Colorado's highest mountains. Not only does Mr. Roach supply the reader with thorough and accurate route information, but he includes occasional wry observations on both mountains and mountaineers. We can only hope that the publisher will soon see the wisdom in printing another edition of this classic. Even for the person who makes but a single ascent per year this book ranks as a "must have."<P>The only criticism I have of the book is that the mileages listed (in the edition I have) tend to run shorter than the actual mileages of the routes. My brother and I jokingly refer to "Roach miles" and then make the necessary 10-15% addition to the miles listed for each route when planning our trips. My suspicion regarding the origin of this "discrepancy" is that the mileages given in the book may be based solely on horizontal distance and might not take the vertical dimension into account.</span>

                    <span>If you are into skiing Colorado fourteeners, you might want to check out the Dawson guides, but personally, this book by Gerry Roach is my favorite guide for climbing Colorado's 14,000 foot peaks. Gerry Roach's guidebook provides very good information about the relative difficulty of different hiking and climbing routes, good route maps, photographs of the peaks, and detailed route descriptions. His guidebook provides alternative routes for most of the peaks, and I like the way he lists his favorite routes as "classics." Gerry Roach's guidebook is also more economical than the Dawson guides.</span>

                    <span>I own shelves of hiking guides, but this one tops the list. Not only is it informative, instructive and accurate, Gerry Roach writes well and gives the hiker all the essential information needed to make the trek. I live outside of Colorado and only visit for a few weeks each year, specifically to climb 14-ers. Being unfamiliar with the Colorado roads and most of their trailheads, I necessarily rely on this guide to get me to the trailhead with no hassle and accurate driving directions. Roach has never disappointed me. He gives exhaustive directions and includes a map for each trek. If you need a four-wheel drive vehicle to get to your destination, he will let you know. If you have a drive on a dirt road for 6 miles to reach the trailhead, that information will be included. <P>He also describes the trail conditions, whether it's rocky, has scree, is exposed and has a ranking system for how difficult the hike is. If there is scrambling involved or permanent snow fields, he lets you know. If it's a class 3 hike but listed in other guides as class 4, Roach makes the correction and explains why he feels this way. <P>There are separate chapters on the unique and often volatile weather in the Colorado peaks. This is imperative for out-of-state hikers who aren't familiar with the frequent, violent afternoon thunderstorms in the Rockies. When I did Pike's Peak for the first time, I photocopied Roach's chapter on this mountain and took it with me in my pack, and was glad I did. When the thunderstorms began, I descended ASAP, following his advice. This is an outstanding hiking guide. I wouldn't hike in the 14-ers in Colorado without it and neither should you. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>My wife and I have found Gerry's book to be invaluable in getting the beta necessary to climb Colorado's 14ers. His consistent no-nonsense approach gives climbers what they need for a successful experience. We keep the book on the coffee table year-round and often thumb through it in the dead of winter, looking forward to our next adventure.</span>

                    <span>Im sure it is a great book. But I will have to say that the true roll dogs get out on their own and make these books that hundreds of people like you guys buy. Get out on your own and explore Colorado besides buying some book and going places where many have already been.</span>
