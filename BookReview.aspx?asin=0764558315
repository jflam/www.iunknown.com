                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>   <p>   <i>Expert One-on-One J2EE Development without EJB</i> shows Java developers and architects how to build robust J2EE applications without having to use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB). This practical, code-intensive guide provides best practices for using simpler and more effective methods and tools, including JavaServer pages, servlets, and lightweight frameworks.   <p>   <b>What does this book cover?</b>   <p>   The book begins by examining the limits of EJB technology &#8212; what it does well and not so well. Then the authors guide you through alternatives to EJB that you can use to create higher quality applications faster and at lower cost &#8212; both agile methods as well as new classes of tools that have evolved over the past few years.   <p>   They then dive into the details, showing solutions based on the lightweight framework they pioneered on SourceForge &#8212; one of the most innovative open source communities. They demonstrate how to leverage practical techniques and tools, including the popular open source Spring Framework and Hibernate. This book also guides you through productive solutions to core problems, such as transaction management, persistence, remoting, and Web tier design. You will examine how these alternatives affect testing, performance, and scalability, and discover how lightweight architectures can slash time and effort on many projects.   <p>   <b>What will you learn from this book?</b>   <p>   Here are some details on what you'll find in this book:    <ul>    <li>How to find the simplest and most maintainable architecture for your application    <li>Effective transaction management without EJB    <li>How to solve common problems in enterprise software development using AOP and Inversion of Control    <li>Web tier design and the place of the Web tier in a well-designed J2EE application    <li>Effective data access techniques for J2EE applications with JDBC, Hibernate, and JDO    <li>How to leverage open source products to improve productivity and reduce custom coding    <li>How to design for optimal performance and scalability    </ul>    </span>

                    <span>Rod Johnson is doing a great service to the J2EE technical community with his books. This latest book is definitely a myth buster, that I was personally looking for.<P>I will tell you right away that this is not an anti-EJB book<BR>that tries to prove you a case against EJBs. This is not a <BR>cheap "Spring" framework promotion book either. This is a very mature expert one-on-one advice that is well worth getting.<P>Rod gives you a nicely rounded manual how to architect solid J2EE application using the latest and greatest practical solutions available both through the open source and JSR community. He propagates two extremly important ideas:<BR>Lightweight containers and (simplified) Aspect Oriented Programming. Moreover, ha makes a very strong case for the application of Inversion of Control principle (IoC) in your applications. If you are not familiar with IoC: I see it pretty much as a savior to a J2EE technology. J2EE grew incredibly big, complex and fluffy in the recent years, and is at risk of being outflanked by more simplistic .NET solutions.<BR>IoC offers "back to basics" approach where you as a good OO architect focus on the solid business domain model without poluting it with the infrastructure code. Through IoC supporting methods (such as Aspects) you then externalize the infrastructural pieces (transactions, pooling, persitence, logging, auditing,...) that make you apps run in the enterprise environement.<P>Rod's book gave me a very good basis for the creation of my own state-of-the-art J2EE solution and I am grateful for it. It is the best thirty-some dollars that I spent in the long time. <P>One more thing, this book in NOT a re-write of his previos book "J2EE Design and Development". I have both and they are not the same. I think you have to have both on your bookshelf in order to get the full treatment.</span>

                    <span>Rod Johnson again offers to his fans another great Java best-seller. This book is the next level of his previous book "J2EE Design and Development" and offers different information on different purposes but it doesn't about bashing EJB's or some kind of "Spring framework for all purpose" tool.<BR>This book covers very important topics like Architecture (a vision from J2EE past and present), Lightweight containers and Spring (covering its principal features) and a "Sample App" to give us a very excellent example on using all the stuff. Great job Rod !</span>

                    <span>This book builds a great case for an EJB-less architecture, the arguments and points are layed out very carefully and very well. A different architecture is presented, with plenty of help on how to get the benefits of an EJB container without the pain. Unlike many other books in which the author seems to hope you will take his or her advice simply because it is in print, Johnson and Hoeller back everything up. The book flows well, and contains very few mistakes that I have noticed (and those were very minor editing slips). I hope to see more from these authors. In the meantime, I guess I can chuck all those EJB patterns books on the shelf and just put this in there...</span>
