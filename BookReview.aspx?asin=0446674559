                    <span>This book has been around a long time (1983) and has gone through 3 editions. Obviously it is not without charm and appeal. One reason is because the author stresses the more fantasy oriented role of the creative thinker. By using exercises that are ambiguous and metaphors to make his point such as comparing the more creative, diffused, playful `soft' thinker to the `hard' more logical, rational, reality thinker, people get lost in this book the same way they do in an Alice and Wonderland tale. Creative, Heinrich Kley inspired illustrations by George Willett add to the magical setting. However, the author does not offer any concrete plan to increase creativity, as is done in 'The Creativity Formula' (www.creativityformula.com), and one comes away from this book with the same euphoric feeling one might get after watching a Peter Pan movie. "Oh, if only I could fly."

                    <span>Roger von Oech is one of the older voices in innovation. A Whack on the Side of the Head was originally published in 1983. Von Oech is different from most innovation gurus in that he is genuinely well read. At first you might not know it. This book, like most others in its genre, has a seemingly endless number of cute quotes and little stories. Do these guys spend all their time collecting this stuff? Von Oech was a Phi Beta Kappa classics major, who then got a Doctorate at Stanford in the history of ideas. What this means is that he has a good nose for distinguishing important ideas from interesting stories. That, no doubt, is why his book is still selling well twenty years later.</span>

                    <span>I first came across Roger Von Oech when I was a trainer - training other leaders - in a worldwide youth organisation.  The ability to think outside the square is important in any lifepath and Von Oech is easy to dip in and out of to get prompted in another direction when life the way ahead looks too narrow.
<br />
<br />After borrowing them from libraries many times over the years I now own my own copy of both this and A Kick in the Seat of the Pants, also by Von Oech.  I use them frequently and highly recommend them both.</span>

                    <span>After reading the rave reviews, I expected a much better book. It's okay, but, basically, goes over the same old stuff other books do. Nothing new. It's kinda of read one you've read them all.</span>

                    <span>There are some self-help books which are enjoyable to read, but may not be entirely beneficial. A Whack on the Side of the Head falls close to this. What it offers isn't really groundbreaking. Heck, I can sum it up like this: "do something different when faced with a problem." But sometimes we need to be reminded of what seems obvious because we, as society, have come to ignore the obvious. So this 150 page reassurance isn't a bad thing to look through. Like I said, it was enjoyable to read because of the way it was written. It had a lot of spelling errors, though, and the author doesn't exactly treat other's quotes right. Not to mention a plethora of pictures so wacky, they're disturbing. But for those who are struggling with ideas as of late, give it a whirl.</span>
