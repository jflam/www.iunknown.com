                <span id="Label1">A compelling and intimate exploration of the complexity of a  bicultural immigrant experience, <I>To See and See Again</I> traces three  generations of an Iranian (and Iranian-American) family undergoing a century of  change--from the author's grandfather, a feudal lord with two wives; to her  father, a freespirited architect who marries an American pop singer; to  Bahrampour herself, who grows up balanced precariously between two cultures and  comes of age watching them clash on the nightly news.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book. I'm a "full blooded" Iranian who has spent almost her entire life in the US and I learned a lot about how difficult it is to be "do-rageh" as a child, a teen and as an adult. I have some friends who are mixed and I understand their situations a little bit better now. <P>I didn't always agree with how the author represented how it is to be Iranian and sometimes I was a little angry with her but on the other hand, she did an excellent job demystifying Iranians and the Persian culture. I just came back from Iran a few months ago and a lot of the sights and smells that she describes in her book brought back a lot of good memories from my trip.<P>I hope she explores this subject further.</span>

                    <span>For those interested in Iran, Tara Bahrampour gives a wonderful view of her loved homeland which she lived as a child. She describes delightfully her older childhood years in American and then has inciteful descriptions when she returned to Iran as a young woman. Her Iranian family is warm and interesting. I feel I know Iran better after reading her book. I especially like her use of Farsi words throughout her book. John J. Casalino</span>

                    <span>This beautifully written book pulled tears from my eyes, laughter from my mouth, and feelings from my heart. Many thanks to the author for encapsulating her family's personal story and sharing it with the world. I completed the book in less than two days, unable to set it down, and now I cannot wait to enjoy it again hoping I can identify with something I did not before. I'm eagerly awaiting Tara Bahrampour to captivate the world with a sequel.</span>

                    <span>If you're living in a Western country and like to learn about foreign cultures then get this book immediately! The half-Iranian half-American author knows both the Eastern and the Western world so she knows exactly how to write about her homeland and make us understand its rich culture. This is a book full of interesting details, it's like a rich panorama which shows us the life of different classes of society in Iran from the poor to the rich, and it's also a family saga of three generations with a grandfather who is a rich man with two wives living in the old-fashioned way, a father who is married to an American, and the author and her siblings who are between two worlds. Lovely story. Thank you Tara.</span>
