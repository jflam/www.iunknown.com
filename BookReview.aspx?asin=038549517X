                <span id="Label1">At once a pioneering study of evolution and an accessible and lively reading experience, <b>The Mating Mind</b> marks the arrival of a prescient and provocative new science writer. Psychologist Geoffrey Miller offers the most convincing&#8211;and radical&#8211;explanation for how and why the human mind evolved.  <br><br>Consciousness, morality, creativity, language, and art: these are the traits that make us human. Scientists have traditionally explained these qualities as merely a side effect of surplus brain size, but Miller argues that they were sexual attractors, not side effects. He bases his argument on Darwin&#8217;s theory of <i>sexual </i>selection, which until now has played second fiddle to Darwin&#8217;s theory of <i>natural </i>selection, and draws on ideas and research from a wide range of fields, including psychology, economics, history, and pop culture. Witty, powerfully argued, and continually thought-provoking, <b><i>The Mating Mind</i></b> is a landmark in our understanding of our own species.<br></span>

                    <span>Science at its best: explaining much with few assuptions. This is a book about sexual selection: how all humans show off to tell others they have good genes. Contrary to natural selection, sexual selection explains things like telling stories, playing sports, writing books, pursuing scientific careers, struggling for financial success. Women try to persuade men they are young and fertile, and men - that they are intelligent enough to provide women with needed support. That is why we buy too many cars, waste money in expensive restaurants, possess yachts not having time to enjoy them and build 1000-feet buildings to have our headquarters there. All those strange things intelectuals sweared unexplainable are easily understood. Of course, evolutionary psychology and sexual selection are still developing, and majority of hypotheses in this book are not yet well established or proved, but they simply can't be wrong. As with publishing of 'The Origin of Species' every open-minded person is struck with obviousness and power of this theory. ...Maybe not so, because as Miller admits he is only bringing us back Darwin's theory of human nature outlined in his 'The Descent of Man'. Then people were not yet ready for the truth. Are we?</span>

                    <span>Geoffrey Miller is probably the handsomest evolutionary psychologist in the business, which may be (or, then again, may not be) why he chose to concentrate on the neglected topic of sexual selection. This updating of Darwin's "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex" is tons of fun to read, and seems to authoritatively answer a lot of the questions about why art exists that Steven Pinker's "How the Mind Works" tended to gloss over. (Short answer: cuz chicks dig it).<P>However, anyone familiar with Darwin's book will note that Miller prudently left out one of the "The Descent of Man's" major themes: how sexual selection leads to differences among the races. As a young man starting out, Miller can be forgiven for not touching that huge taboo, but as his reputation solidifies, we can only hope that he returns to the crucial question of human biodiversity. <P>I also look forward to his future writings on IQ. He is one of the few evolutionary psychologists (who study human universals) who is also a behavioral geneticist (who study human differences). We're desperately in need of somebody who can synthesize the two fields. Miller has the talent, and hopefully he can muster the courage to shatter the Tooby-Cosmides party line that thinking about human differences is evil, or boring, or just not done in polite society, or whatever their latest reason is. <P>Despite these missing pieces, "The Mating Mind" is an impressive launch to what should be an impressive career.<P>Steve Sailer -- President, Human Biodiversity Institute ---</span>

                    <span>When virtual reality gets cheaper than dating, society is doomed......the title is Dogbert's succinct perspective of evolutionarty psychology focusing on human sexual choice and male courtship effort. <P>As a neophyte I was impressed with the intriguing ideas evenly sprinkled throught the book. Principal among these was the runaway brain, fitness indicators and the handicap principle that Miller uses as a basis to explain human mind's intricate evolution. Miller tries to argue that any form of sexual selection for fitness indicators should even out genetic variation in fitness - which means if females favor tall males then all males should be tall. Yet we dont see that and the differences remain in the species - so why does evolution allows such differences. Another interesting idea, originally proposed by Zahavi, is the handicap principle - which is advertising fitness and "sexual ornamentation" by handicapping an individual with a survival cost. It basically means fit peacocks showing off extravagant plumage to attract mates even if it means making themselves more prone to predators or simply carrying the extra load around risking their survial. Highly evolved fitness indicators means using costly signals to attract a mate. In human terms it might transform to - you buying an expensive diamond ring from Cartier for your lady-love fully aware that its gonna make a dent in your pocket, will add no survival benefit whatsoever to you or her but yet show her that you make so much money that not only you can buy that ring but you are willing to devote tremendous personal resources to win her. <P>Evolution of human morality - which itself is a costly indicator, may also have been selected through sexual choice. Morally uninspiring traits have evolved to be sexual turn-offs in human male-female dynamics. One entire book on this is Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley. Moreover generosity to blood relatives could be genetic selfishness. It was rather surprising to read that even art could have been evolved through sexual choice. Hand-axes could have been the first Objects 'de Art - some were too cumbersome and costly to have been practically used - might suggest at mental and physical fitness value. Art is afterall an application of skill beyond the necessary and some of them might have been crafted just for asthetic value. All fitness indicators are hence costly and used to enchance sexual status and find out for yourself whether the converse is true. <P>The book has so many compelling ideas that any one review cannot do justice to it. If you are still undecided about buying a book on evolutionary psychology, this one is highly recommended. By the way, it would not be a bad idea to read this book with one of Leil Lowndes. Although they deal with varied disciplines, you'll find that they complement each other.</span>

                    <span>I started following Geoffrey Miller's work 6 years ago when all that was available was his PHd thesis and some journal articles which I found original and entralling. The Mating Mind, Miller's first book, lives up to the ideas first discussed in his thesis but now presented in a more focussed yet relaxed fashion.<P>Miller makes clear an argument the humans evolved according to sexual selection, an suggestion that Darwin first proposed in Descent of Man. Males and females picking each other for specific attributes drove, through sexual selection, an evolution of human features including brain size increases, sexual organ characteristics and human behaviors.<P>It is an evocative story, and one that may even be supported by recent studies in neurological disorders characterized by maturational delay. If the engine behind Miller's runaway sexual selection is a slowing down in maturation rates (neoteny) revealed in the fossil record by a decrease in sexual dimorphism, then the neurological, physiological and behavioral tendencies of humans with disorders characterized by maturational delay should reveal the kind of human the Miller describes as transitional to modern times.<P>It is not often that an evolutionary theory uncovers an opportunity to reveal clues about our origin in the present day. Miller's theory does this. Kudos to an original and well thought out exposition.</span>

                    <span>I could not put this book down. Any student in psychology or biology should read this book. Any man who would like to understand the underlying reasons of what works on the flirtation market should read this book. This book was down right sexy. Do not start reading it with modern societies' moralities in mind. What it means to be human and human sexuality is a lot older than modern views on sex. This book explores the reasons behind all the things we do in order to "get some". A wonderfully informative read. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that I was looking for more specific information gleaned from specific studies. Some readers may not need that but I was looking for it. I love it that my favorite book "Clan of the Cave Bear" was cited. (Not in a supporive way but I was still glad to see it mentioned anyway.)</span>
