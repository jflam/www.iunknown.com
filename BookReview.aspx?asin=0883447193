                    <span>Transforming Mission is a scholarly, in-depth study of major missionary paradigms from the first century until the present.  Bosch's point of departure is that the Christian faith is "intrinsically missionary."  He distinguishes between the missio Dei - God's own involvement in the world, and Missions - the church's missionary activity.  He believes that to carry out God's mission the church can neither focus its activity exclusively on saving souls nor on this-worldly human progress -it must do both.  <br>     He first surveys the New Testament model of mission, claiming that the advent of Jesus of Nazareth marked a significant change in the concept of mission as understood in the Old Testament.  Jesus' ministry was characterized by inclusiveness and breaking down barriers between people.  His goal was directed toward all Israel rather than only the remnant of the faithful.  Bosch makes the point that one of the most well-known missionary texts, the Great Commission, cannot be divorced from the rest of Matthew's gospel.  He believes that Matthew envisions a mission to both Jews and Gentiles and that this mission is characterized by discipleship and a call to challenge social injustice.  Luke's understanding of mission highlights repentance and forgiveness of sins as well as economic justice and peace-making.  Paul's understanding of mission focuses on the church as an eschatalogical community which is works for the improvement of society while awaiting the ultimate renewal of all things with the parousia. <br>     In the second part of his analysis Bosch draws upon the work of Hans Kung and Thomas Kuhn.  Kung identified six periods within the entire scope of Christian history during which a particular paradigm was prevalent: 1) The apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) The Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) The medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) The Protestant Reformation paradigm, 5) The modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) The emerging ecumenical paradigm.  Bosch makes a theological application of Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific paradigm shifts, claiming that the six historical periods in the history of the church were each characterized by a particular theological paradigm.  He points out that theological paradigms, unlike their scientific counterparts, do not make a complete break with old ideas.  Sometimes elements from older paradigms are incorporated into new ones.  Old and new paradigms can often exist simultateously among different groups of believers.  Occasionally an old paradigm is rediscovered by a later generation.<br>     At the conclusion of his survey of historical paradigms, Bosch emphasizes that mission is ultimately multidimensional.  The contours of these many dimensions are shaped by six major "salvific events" chronicled in the New Testament: Christ's incarnation, by which he fully experienced the challenges and struggles of being human; his crucifixion, which signifies the completeness of his service and self-sacrifice; the resurrection, which conveys a message of victory and hope for humanity; the ascension, which calls Christians to work for a new order here on the earth which issues from above; Pentecost, which inaugurated the era of the church as a distinct community where social renewal is made manifest; and the parousia, which sets the sights of the church on the imminent and full realization of God's reign.   <br>       The depth and comprehensiveness of Bosch's work make it an important resource for any serious student of Christian missions.  His many years of service on the field as a missionary coupled with his extensive theological training have given him many valuable insights into his subject matter.</span>

                    <span>Transforming missions is a scholarly work of importance for all scientists occupied with cross cultural encounters and matters of religion. The author, David Bosch, is one of several missologists who willingly share his  rich and well documented work with other disciplines.<p>The book is well  researched and the author is able to communicate complicated theological  matters in a most convincing way. The book is readable and accessible to a  long range of intrested persons and not merely to experts or specialists.  <p>From a scholarly point of view Bosch provides the researcher with an  analysis that gives a good framework for further research on the matter of  missiology and historical cross cultural encounters. However, I miss  references and analysis that can be more easily related to central social  science authors like Giddens and  Habermas and modern philosophers of care  and interpersonal relationships. <p>I also miss a more penetrating  discussion of the Eastern Orthodox churches and the paradigm shift in their  missiological thinking.  <p>Bosch has provided as with a bridge of  understanding that is most helpful. His book will hopefully be read by many  and will most certainly provide inspiration for many scholars.</span>
