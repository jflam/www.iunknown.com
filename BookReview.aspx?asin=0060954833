                    <span>If you are one who often dreams of Africa, then you've probably heard of Kuki Gallman, a brave woman who begins her 2nd memoir with those very words: "I was born in Italy, and from earliest childhood I dreamed of Africa." African Nights, the sequel to I Dreamed of Africa (now a movie in which Kim Bassinger stars), is a reverent anthology about the author's experiences in Kenya. In her first book, readers learned of her life tragedies--her husband's fatal plane crash and her son's death from a poisonous pet snake's bite. The stories in African Nights take place afterwards and illustrate a venerable woman's courage in the face of the wild and beautiful East Africa. Stories such as "Elephant Ballad," "Night of the Lions," and "The Brigadier's Cheetah" pay tribute to the glory of African animals and homage to the humans they encounter. But these are more than stereotypical animal tales set in beautiful Kenya. "A Maasai Woman," one of the most original stories in the book, recreates an afternoon Ms. Gallman spends with the woman in her boma (compound). In less than six pages the author authentically presents a wealth of obscure tribal custom. Sure, most of us never give Africa a second imaginative thought beyond the hackneyed portrayal of the lone warrior with his spear or herds of zebras running from lions. What makes Ms. Gallman's writing unique in the nature writing genre is her deeply religious connection to our African heritage and a poetic ease for sharing it. After reading this book, you may feel that you have breathed the perfume of tropical herbs while hearing the bass vibrations of elepants in a deep green distance. Or you may end up going to Africa to know the Garden of Eden for yourself. If not, this book offers pleasure and wisdom for loving Africa and Africans as the author surely does.</span>

                    <span>I read I Dreamed of Africa a few months ago and fell in love with it. It is great. I have alway planned to one day live in Africa and so it was a great inspiration. As soon as I finished it I ordered African Nights. This book of short stories didn't grab me in quite the same way. Some of the stories are fabulous, particularly the last and longest one about a month-long walking trek bringing camels from northern Kenya back to the ranch. Many though focus on the same theme of "happy days" before the death of her son. They tend to be more reminiscing, more descriptive memories, than plot. If you love African wildlife, or have read Kuki's other work and loved it, you'll like this book. If you are going to read only one, though, read I dreamed of Africa.</span>

                    <span>This book was very interesting, descriptive, mystical and provocative. I enjoyed reading the details that painted a picture of Kenya in my head. The short stories were often touching, tragic, joyful, and sometimes unbelievable. I thought this was definitly worth reading, but you should borrow it from a friend, the library or buy it used because it isn't nearly as good as Kuki's first book I Dreamed of Africa.</span>

                    <span>I understand that Mrs. Gallmann's writing style and in fact, even her stories, are not suited to everyone's tastes. But I also feel that the basis for some of these reviews is quite ridiculous. The spelling "errors"? Oddly enough, these are likely not errors, simply European takes on English words. People seem to forget the Kuki is an Italian and, therefore, not necessarily keen to Americanized spellings. The editor likely saw no need to alter these words as they are easily understood either way and, in fact, I myself have seen the words that the reviewer was referring to written in the same manner before. A mild complaint at best, I would say.<P>I also fail to understand the reasoning behind the anti-colonial reviews written mainly by a few North Americans. I believe we are the last people who should be allowed to speak of colonialism. True, Kuki may be just another white colonial in Africa, a land that has had its fair share of problems in that department. But, she has also done more to bring focus to that country and make the stories of this vast and beautiful continent/country known to the rest of us. Who cares where she has garnered her money from? She obviously comes from a quite wealthy family and she runs a major organization and has worked dutifully on her FARM (yes, it is a farm, remember that. They state explicitly that they have sold livestock from very early on) for close to 30 years.<P>Alas, not everyone can see the simplistic beauty in her words. A true poet does not have to conform to the normal style of writing. (don't forget - the last few "tales" in "African Nights" were taken directly from her diary - even if words are misspelled, perhaps the misspellings were left in for authenticity's sake). Kuki is an incredibly descriptive writer and I find myself yearning to read more. As I stated in my review for "I Dreamed of Africa," I have been fortunate enough to have brief contact with Mrs. Gallmann herself and found her as truthful as she is in her storytelling.<P>So, ignore the negative reviews and take a step into this incredible woman's life.</span>
