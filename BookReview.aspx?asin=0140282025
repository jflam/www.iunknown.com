                <span id="Label1">How much do we humans enjoy our current status as the most intelligent beings on earth? Enough to try to stop our own inventions from surpassing us in smarts? If so, we'd better pull the plug right now, because if Ray Kurzweil is right we've only got until about 2020 before computers outpace the human brain in computational power. Kurzweil, artificial intelligence expert and author of <i>The Age of Intelligent Machines</i>, shows that technological evolution moves at an exponential pace. Further, he asserts, in a sort of swirling postulate, time speeds up as order increases, and vice versa. He calls this the "Law of Time and Chaos," and it means that although entropy is slowing the stream of time down for the universe overall, and thus vastly increasing the amount of time between major events, in the eddy of technological evolution the exact opposite is happening, and events will soon be coming faster and more furiously. This means that we'd better figure out how to deal with conscious machines as soon as possible--they'll soon not only be able to beat us at chess, but also likely demand civil rights, and might at last realize the very human dream of immortality.<p>  <I>The Age of Spiritual Machines</I> is compelling and accessible, and not necessarily best read from front to back--it's less heavily historical if you jump around (Kurzweil encourages this). Much of the content of the book lays the groundwork to justify Kurzweil's timeline, providing an engaging primer on the philosophical and technological ideas behind the study of consciousness. Instead of being a gee-whiz futurist manifesto, <I>Spiritual Machines</I> reads like a history of the future, without too much science fiction dystopianism. Instead, Kurzweil shows us the logical outgrowths of current trends, with all their attendant possibilities. This is the book we'll turn to when our computers first say "hello." <I>--Therese Littleton</I> </span>

                    <span>Ray Kurtzweil mentions some impressive things in this, but for every viable argument he puts forth, he spouts off two bits of obvious nonsense. If you read this book, I suggest you skip the first two or three chapters--after that, he stops making so many predicitons and keeps himself a little more grounded. 
<br />
<br />On the whole, entertaining but not edifying.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book when it came out. The movie A.I. was released in same year, so the book had great timing. Sadly, techno enthusiasm died down with 9/11, Iraq, and NASDAQ meltdown.

<br />The book offers a compelling guide to the future.</span>

                    <span>Seriously, Ray Kurzweil may just be on of the top scientists and thinkers of our time. This talent created the synthesizer -- so he certainly understands how human beings work and play but he was also given big honors by the White House and is recognized by MIT and more as a major talent. From building new brains in boxes to Transhumanism and how we can avoid being what Star Trek calls Borgs is all discussed in this book. What is most fascinating though is his timeline that takes us year by year through 2029 --when machines may be smarter than humans. What happens then-- is it iRobot or is it Blade Runner or Star Wars?? You'll find out more about his thoughts and research in this book and of course his most recent books. He looks at several areas -- not just machine intelligence, he discusses telemetry-- machines talking to machines, artifical intelligence and most importantly in the next decade or so intelligence assistance (IA) talking about how machines, neural nets, bots and more will augment and enhance our intelligence in not only helping us what books and media to read and use but in learning, training and even security. So much to read --but this is one you should have on your bookshelf forever-- want to know whats beyond 2029 -- he hints at the next century too. </span>

                    <span>You might as well have picked this up at a local Star Trek conference.  As a Ph.D., and an active researcher in both artificial intelligence and cognitive science, I feel somewhat slighted that those of us who are trying to make real engineering progress in the AI arena are being represented by sensationalistic rubbish like this.  It's widely accepted in the AI community that our entire research agenda will be made or broken by whether NP-complete problems will eventually be soluble.  Kurzweil should go back and read up on Turing, especially his Ph.D. thesis.  As for those who are looking for accurate predictions concerning the future of intelligent machines, look elsewhere.  Take it from someone who knows, there's a LOT of work left to be done...and we don't even know what's doable yet.</span>

                    <span>Ray Kurzweil has me convinced. I'm a believer, a Kurzweilite. His descriptions of what the future has in store for us are so compelling, so arresting, I can't wait for the next 100 years. (And he has me convinced that I will live to see them.)

<br />Bring on the Age of Spiritual Machines!
