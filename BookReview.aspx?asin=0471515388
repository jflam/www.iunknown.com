                    <span>This book is definately worth purchasing -- particularly for those new to independent consulting.  Although the copyright date is 1990 (Howard died in the early/mid 1990s and the book hasn't been updated since), most of the material is timeless. It is often difficult for independent consultants to get sample copies of proposals, interim reports, and final reports.  This is particularly the case for those new to consulting without an established peer network.  This book solves that delimma and illustrates the marketing role of the proposal and subsequent interim and final reports.  Are you serious about building your consulting business?  Prove it to yourself: buy a copy of this book today.</span>

                    <span>This book came just in time.  My consulting practice took off suddenly and I literally dashed to amazon to search for a book with information I could apply right away.  It was an invaluable aid.  And after a couple of years, it is still a useful reference, always close at hand.</span>

                    <span>The items covered in the book are basic and need to be discussed.  However, the sample items and some tables used show data from 1988.  This info is not useful.</span>

                    <span>I first picked up this book at the library when starting my consulting agency.  I found it so valuable as a second and third read and as a resource, that I ended up paying almost $20.00 in late fees.  I should have just bought the book, as should you.  I highly recommend it.<p>There are MANY of these types of books out there, but this is definitely in the 'Gotta have it' section.  I bought it and continually use it as a resource.<p>The greatest part is that it covers some VERY difficult material well.  I found fee setting and the interim and final reports extremely difficult to do before I bought this book.<p>It is important to note that this book is not just for independent consultants, but for anyone selling consulting services and other professional services.<p>If you are not sure whether you want it, get it at the library and take a look.  Just remember to take it back!</span>

                    <span>As an experienced consultant I've found this book to be extremely useful when I stumbled across it. I've recently started my own consulting practice and have found this book to contain some really useful information and steps on setting up your fees along with developing contracts. It reads very easily and walks you through the process step-by-step. Wish I had found this book while I worked for a larger consulting company, it would have helped out a number of times when trying to walk through the process, or as an education for anyone developing proposales, fees, and contracts. Highly recommend it for anyone in the consulting field (either solos or working for one of the big boys).</span>
