                    <span>A great biography of one of the greatest Presidents of the twentieth century. Lyndon Johnson, whether people like it or not, has left an indelible mark on American society with his programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, his tough and admirable stance on civil rights, and, in a very different way - his war in Vietnam.
<br />
<br />Doris Kearns Goodwin, who first met Johnson while a student at Harvard, and became close to him in his later life, has written a book that is much a memoir of her times with the man as it is a general overview of his life. Other reviewers have complained that her study of Johnson is too psychological, and places too much importance on linking his childhood experiences to his later life. I strongly disagree. Too many biographies of important people seem to gloss over their childhood, but understanding a person's childhood is paramount in understanding how it shaped their outlook on life. Another common complaint of this book is that Goodwin is not critical enough of Johnson, but again, anyone who has read this book properly will know this is simply not true. Goodwin time and time again highlights Johnson's flaws - his tendency to withdraw from competition if he felt there was the slightest chance of him losing, his childlike love of power, and his inability to admit where he went wrong. If anything, I believe the author does not praise Johnson high enough.  
<br />
<br />Vietnam of course was a mistake, no one in their right mind would claim otherwise, but domestically, Johnson was an undeniably outstanding President. People have time and time again claimed that Vietnam was the main factor that undermined Johnson's Presidency, which I agree with, but I also think the other big mistake Johnson made was becoming President after Kennedy. Lacking his predecessor's good looks, charm and charisma, Johnson was never going to win over the American people in the way that Kennedy did. But his ingenious negotiating skills, his concern for the country's poor, and his stance on civil rights that saw him do more for African Americans than any other President in history barring Lincoln, means that Johnson was more than a worthy successor. His Great Society programs, while not as successful as he would have hoped, still helped in the fight against poverty. Even with Vietnam, many contemporary historians contend he had fewer options than was believed at the time, and the way Nixon initially handled the war before pulling out shows that Johnson should not be judged so harshly on the subject as he has been.
<br />
<br />A beautifully written tribute to a great President and an equally fascinating character.

                    <span>As far as "popular history" goes, this one is not bad.  There are certainly better books addressing the life of this fascinating person (Dallek's work and Caro's work comes to mind), but for those interested in LBJ, this is a very good start.  The book is well researched, and while you may disagree with some of the author's "cause and effect scenarios," they are logical and do give food for thought. Some of her assertions certainly make mroe sense than many I have read.  This work is not as detailed as I like (that is just me), but does cover quite a lot of gound in a very readable form.  This book has been in publication for sometime now, but it is still well worth adding to your LBJ collection if you have not already done so.  Very much recommend this one. </span>

                    <span>I am (was?) a great admirer of Doris Kearns Goodwin's work. "No Ordinary Time" was a masterpiece of historical writing. But this early biography of Johnson just doesn't stand the test of time. It's MUCH too theoretical and lacks narrative drive. Johnson was an immensely interesting figure. It says everything that this book makes him dull.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to find an biography on Lyndon Johnson because I was doing a reading of a script for a screenwriters class based on his life. I chose this book because I do not usually read such detailed historical books. This book was very easy for me to read and understand. I was pleased that the background about his childhood was included because I wanted that for my research. I also think it is very interesting to learn about what makes a leader great - how he was raised, etc... I think this is a good book for someone who wants to get a thorough understanding of the complete life of Lyndon Johnson.</span>
