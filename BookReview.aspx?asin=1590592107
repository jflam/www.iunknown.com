                    <span>Swift 3D is the popular application that helps you to create and export your 3D creations to Flash. The program features plenty of tools and features that make the program useful for beginners and seasoned 3D professionals. Because of the program's coverage of complex material, it takes a book such as Foundation Swift 3D to guide you through the world of Swift 3D (version 3).<P>The book starts you off at the basics. You are introduced to the program, and the examples help you to get a good feel for using Swift 3D. You learn how to create new objects, adjust lighting, move the camera, incorporate textures, and more. Besides just introducing you to Swift 3D, the various authors share their tips and terminology when it applies to 3D modeling in general. You also learn how to integrate the program with Flash MX.<P>You will definitely like the writing style of the authors. By no means do the authors shy away from teaching you how to create elaborate, complex examples. They provide various alternate explanations, screenshots, and even sample files from the included CD to help you along the way. Some of the elaborate examples you create involve a miniature city with complicated buildings, a 3D logo, a motorcycle, and more. All of that is created in Swift 3D!<P>Overall, Foundation Swift 3D is a great book. The authors' ability to teach Swift and complicated 3D concepts is excellent. If you are interested in learning Swift 3D for the first time, or if you are interested in expanding your knowledge of Swift 3D, you will definitely find the book worthwhile</span>

                    <span>I wrote a review for this book the day after it came out. Hopefully it will not be deleted again. Anyway, the book is a fabulous reference guide. The "Friends of Ed" publishing company has, as usual, come up with a great lesson book. I have waited a long time for a book to come out on this fabulous 3d program. The manual that comes with the software does not go into great depths as to what the program offers but this book does. No offense to "Erain" because there products are awesome.</span>

                    <span>I awaited this book for a long time (2 weeks in the mail) and the wait was well worth it. The day I got I couldn't stop reading until my head hurt and I usually wear off after the first chapter of most books, it's that good really!!! This book covers a lot of ground, from modelling a Harley to a city to a lego cube. It also explains a lot of 3D terms I wasn't even aware of.. with all that said, buy it now with overnight shipping!<BR> <BR>Well, that's all I have to say. Praise to Friends of ED!</span>
