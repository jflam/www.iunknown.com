This book includes a unique interactive format, provides practical applications for programmers, and details solutions that are diffucult to find in help files and standard documentation. This book is thought-provoking reading for all Visual Basic programmers -- not just in answering problems, but also introducing some neat techniques you may never have thought of for giving your programs real power.</span>

                    <span>If you're not familiar with John Smiley's style of teaching than you're in for a treat! He uses a call-in cable TV show as a setting for 100 of the most common Visual Basic questions asked by beginner and intermediate users alike. This book is unlike any other that I've read on the subject. While many authors will try to cram as much info as possible into their book, Professor Smiley has a much more laid back approach. He explains the answers in easy-to-understand language without "talking down" to you or filling your head with a lot of jargon. The best that I can say about this book is that I've learned more from "VB 6 Examples" than I have with any other VB book that I've ever read. Highly Recommended!</span>

                    <span>This was my 4th book on Visual Basic, and I liked it so much that I immediately bought all 4 of John Smiley's books on VB. He takes an interesting but dry subject matter, and makes learning it fun by using a "virtual" TV show to answer common questions and problems. The book is full of examples to help the user understand what is happening within VB, and the reader ends it with a better understanding of the elements of programing. The key to this book, and what makes it so entertaining, is the conversational method that he uses to reinforces the concepts he is teaching. This conversational method makes the reader feel that they have sat in on a question and answer session, and have 'understood' the material. A very good second book on VB, as it will reinforce the main concepts, and make them a resource that you will understand.</span>

                    <span>The book is basically a dialogue from the author's class on visual basic databases. I found this writing style to be very annoying and not easy to follow. The whole book is centered around one project and presents a narrow viewpoint rather than the more comprehensive approach to database design I was looking for.</span>
