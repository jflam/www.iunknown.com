                <span id="Label1">Don't think <I>Joe Celko's Data and Databases: Concepts in Practice</I> is for computer beginners. It starts by defining mathematically what data is, relationships between data, and how all this becomes the information and wisdom that you really want from your database, with a host of fascinating examples and warnings. Read the introduction and you'll even understand statistics better.<p> The data and relationships in any database are only ever a subset of the real world with just the attributes and relationships that matter to how your database needs to work. As well as explaining all the concepts you need to build and design databases, Celko shows why these matter and how to decide what entities to use to represent data. He covers the major database design techniques; this soon becomes technical, with code snippets and references to various database theories, but usually the examples make sense of it all. <p> The section on time is fascinating as well as useful, but while the Y2K discussion covers all the important issues, it does seem dated, referring to problems in DOS and Windows 3.1 rather than Windows NT or Windows 95/98. Read this to understand the problem, not for information on how to fix it. The details of how to deal with numerical data, text and "exotic" data like multimedia and geographical information, how to encode data, and how to check for errors are certainly useful, but oddly all of these come before the explanation of what relational databases actually are and how they work. <p> You'll still need to learn the specifics of whatever database application you plan to use, but if you're a computer professional and you need a fast introduction to the nuts and bolts of database theory and programming, start here. <I>--Penny Jannifer, amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>The author starts with saying: "This book is a collection of ideas about the nature of data and databases". Perhaps this is the reason that it is a bit chaotic, there is no red line throughout the book. But I  found some of the sections very interesting, like the data structures and  relational tables. I would recommend the book to everyone who would like to  explore the ideas behind relational databases and who wants to become a bit  more advanced. But do not take it for granted all he says. Some of it  points are discussible and everybody can have his own opinion, like the use  of intelligent and surrogate keys. I like surrogate keys very much. Users  always want to change their typing errors, no matter if it is the primary  key and has some child records attached to it. <p>There is one thing I do  not like that much in his books. His likes to show that he knows a lot or  knows where to find it, without any use for the book. This irritates me a  bit. For example, why on earth list the axioms of intuitionist mathematics.  I suppose I am one of the few readers who heard about intuitionism before  and it is of certainly no help in this book. It is not there for the  purposes of the book! Or another example, section 1.2.2 tells a bit about  bad math. He tries to show that reporters cannot do simple math. But why  does he assume there is a linear relation between weight and burned  calories? May be there is a fixed amount of calories that you always burn,  no matter what you are doing. I am not an expert on calories, but his logic  of showing somebody's errors is not always correct. The correct answer for  this calorie problem should be: we do not know and the 'proof' of the  reporter is wrong. This does not mean the proposition is wrong! Another  mathematical error, he writes that: "The idea of a limit is that there  is a value that the sum never exceeds". Well, this is the definition  of a upperbound. In case the function is non-decreasing the smalles  upperbound will be the limit, it is easy to proof this. Of course, this is  not a math book, but if you use the techniques you should be  correct.<p>However, still a nice book to have and Joe mailed me always back  when I had a remark or question. This care deservers one extra star!</span>

                    <span>This is a strange book. I had a continual feeling of disjointed writing presenting a rag-bag collection of unconnected ideas.<p>If you need an introductory book on data and databases then DON'T buy this book, as it's  nothing of the sort. If you need a book giving a complete, thorough  grounding in all aspects of relation theory, data and databases, again  DON'T buy this book. However, if you work with databases for a living,  already have a reasonable understanding about them, and want an assorted  collection of discussions about the nature of data and databases then  certainly DO consider buying it - you may find it gives deeper insights in  this case.<p>The title is interesting - "Data and Databases",  which reflects the book itself. The first half of the book mostly discusses  the nature of DATA, with the second half mostly about DATABASES.  "Concepts" - certainly, the book is mostly about concepts.  "In Practice" - definitely NOT the case, as the book is mostly  conceptual with very little of a direct practical nature.<p>I found the  chapter on Keys most useful - an in depth discussion about surrogate keys,  which most books barely mention at all. However, even this chapter reflects  the general nature of the book. For any given topic, Celko picks a specific  aspect which interests him, discusses it at length, but gives very  superficial coverage of other equally important aspects of that  topic.<p>The main problem with this book is that the description on the  back cover is a blatant misrepresentation of its contents. It leads you to  believe it is a comprehensive grounding in all aspects of data and  databases, but it simply isn't. Celko admits as much in the Preface,  stating it is "a collection of ideas...not a complete, formal  text".<p>Previous reviews range from 1 star to 5 stars, but both types  of reviews are actually equally valid depending on where the reader is  coming from. If you are new to databases and looking for an introductory  text then this book is NOT for you, despite the publishers claiming so on  the back cover. If you are experienced with databases then certainly DO  consider it, as it does give insights you don't normally come across.<p>I  would have given four stars, but can only give 3 due to (a) the disjointed  presentation of topics, and (b) the blatant misrepresentation by the  publishers about the book's contents. However, I do recommend it to  experienced database professionals.<p>(p.s. - before someone else goes on  about reviewers who don't what they are talking about, I've spent over a  decade earning my living developing databases, and spent literally  thousands of hours doing formal study to Masters level, so I do have a  reasonable idea what I'm on about).</span>

                    <span>This book is a perfect reminder of the publishing truth that the people who write jacket copy have almost never read the book they are writing about. While this book is advertised as an "introductory book",  it is nothing of the kind. A more revealing title would be "Assorted  Thoughts on Data and Databases", and in fact the author admits as much  in his preface: "This book is not a complete, formal text....I simply  did not have the time or temperament to do a formal text." In each  chapter the author dwells on some ideas and gives others a glancing  mention, seemingly at random. There's nothing to tie the sections and  chapters together other than their broad relation to the subject of  databases.<p>	There are some books that people find useful long after  they have been acquainted with a subject--books that articulate ideas and  principles that they have internalized from long experience and that elicit  a "Yeah, that sure is true" response from the intermediate or  advanced reader. This might be one of those books. But speaking as one  programmer with some database experience, looking for books to supplement  the knowledge I'm having to acquire on the job by necessity, this wasn't a  helpful book for me. If you're looking for a true introductory text, spend  your time and money elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>There are many, many SQL books in the market. Very few good ones. And even fewer excellent ones. This is one of those few outstanding books which not only teach you some of the basic concepts but also to think. Readers of  common trade books may get disappointed by its style, because it is simple  but deeper and these readers expect the ABC of the other books. But please  do persist and it will eventually change the way you think about databases  and consequently the way you work and think about what you do and how you  do what you do.</span>

                    <span>This is to the Beginners Whom Complain about something they know very little about:<p>I often wonder why people assume that an introductury book should start with the first lesson.  Consider: should a book on  Introductory Theorical Physics begin with addition and subtraction.  I have  worked with databases for 20 years and have invested thousands of hours in  learning my craft (pay attention: LEARNING my craft).  With today's  promises of how to become this or that in 21 days, it's no wonders why many  beginners are dissatified.  Beginners should begin not start in the middle  or the end and expect to accomplish something.  Joe Celko's books are for  people who have begun to accomplish and takes them to better  accomplishments with the investment of thosuands of hours of learn time -  not simply for the quick buck! .  Like my example about Theoritical  Physics, it teaches THEORY concerning advanced physics and beyond and makes  an assuption that you can add and subtract (even with the word  introductory).  If you're not sure about normalization, relational theory  (or relational algebra as it is sometimes called) or database theory, or  how SQL works under the hood and you want to learn ... then learn how to  add and subtract before you try to solve the riddles of the universe.  (A  word of advise: as you are learning ... keeps those riddles close in your  mind).  And by all means quit showing your IGNORANCE by critisizing those  whom have deidicate their lives to a lifetime of hard work and study for  the benefit of the rest of us poor mortals.  Humble yourself because I am  here to tell you that your knowledge is NOT THAT GREAT!  Quit moaning  about 'it doesn't makes sense' or it 'rambles from one theory to another'.   Instead LEARN. If something in one of Celko's books don't make sense then  continue your research until it does. As with all things you LEARN to  MASTER. It takes TIME, PATIENCE and HARD, HARD WORK.  Nothing is EASY until  YOU MAKE IT THAT WAY!  Remember fractions in the six grade ... seemed  confusing and difficult. A few weeks of hard study and attention to detail  brought out the SIMPLICITY of them. Everything is easy after you KNOW IT.   Getting to KNOW IT is HARD ... but also FUN ... if you have the RIGHT  ATTITUDE.  Failure in the computer industry is strictly about nothing but  the WRONG ATTITUDE. JUST SO YOU KNOW ... Celko's books are CALCULAS to the  professionals and not just FIRST GRADE MATH.  Next time you want complain  ... tell yourself you know nothing ... because the truth of the matter is  ... YOU DON'T!   And for those in the COMPUTING FAMILY whom wish to learn  and not complain (myself included), whether you are a beginner or a master  keep ON COMPUTING by sharing YOUR WISDOM for the BENEFIT of all  MANKIND.<p>Now For Joe:<p>When I buy SQL Manuals I search for one name ...  Joe Celko.  My SQL techniques have improved to the point that I am doing  things with SQL that people around me say can't be done.  It's not because  I am a master, it's simply because Celko's books teaches you think about  SQL in a different way ... ACTUALLY ... in way that SQL REALLY WORKS. Not  like some of those spoon-feeding books that show you how to DO something  without telling why you are doing, and, without explaining the consequences  or the effects.  Celko's books teach you think about what you're doing and  WHY you are doing something a certain way.  Celko's knowledge is invaluable  to a Database Professional.  The techniques I now have is a direct result  of mastering, through hundreds and hundreds of hours of practice and  evaluating the lessons thought by Joe Celko.  By mastering these  techniques, one at a time, I have been able to pick up ANY DATABASE  (Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle, SQLBase and Interbase) and master  there SQL Language in a couple of days ... if not hours.  I have found that  understanding the SIMPLE lessons given in his books have taken me up many  levels.  Celko's SQL for Smarties is a BIBLE and A MUST.  GOD, what a great  book... Now Joe's mastery over the database continues to impress.  Joe, my  hat is off to you and by the way ... thank you for caring about ME (someone  you don't even know).</span>
