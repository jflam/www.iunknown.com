                    <span>I like the picture book.  It's Helen Keller.  Helen Keller was born in Tuscumbia Alabama.  A girl would like this book if they bought it.  6 years old, 6 1/2.  I thought I was back in Helen Keller's year.  -- Written by Meg, age 5 1/2</span>

                    <span>No, it isn't the full biography of her life that one might expect to find in an adult level book.  But, I think it is pretty obvious that it is a picture book.  As such, it is perfect for small children.</span>

                    <span>I must take issue with the last reviewer. This book provides no basic information about Helen Keller. In fact, in this version, Keller doesn't even graduate from college.  How would you like your own productive life of 88 years reduced to your pre-college days?<p>And we have wonderful photos of Keller's final 66 years, that would have made for fantastic illustrations. Marching for peace; learning to speak so she could denounce the murder of coal miners; helping to found the American Civil Liberties Union; casting her first vote, having been an ardent suffragist.<p>The story of Helen Keller is one of a person who used her fame to promote social justice, peace, and human rights.  You'd never know it from this piece of claptrap.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is TERRIFIC! It told the story very, very well. I loved reading it to my 7-year-old daughter. When we were through, she exclaimed, "Read it again!" I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book for my 9 year old to help with a biography book report. It is a bit too easy for a third grader as she read it in just a few minutes but it provides the basics for a report.</span>
