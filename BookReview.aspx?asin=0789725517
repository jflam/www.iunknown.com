                    <span>This book is an awesome resource for learning to use photoshop for web development.  It takes you through setting up photoshop's settings, all of the tools as well as the process that you will have to go through as a developer.  It is very straight forward without to much fluff.  It is also easy to read and look at with an appealing layout and pleasant color pictures and examples.</span>

                    <span>Although I'm not an absolute beginner to Photshop, there's so much in Photoshop which I don't understand or have not dabbled with before. This book covers all the basic stuff you need to know to use Photoshop for the WEB, and then some. <br>"A guide for serious beginners" as it's aptly labelled, it has step-by-step instructions, diagrams and screenshots galore, covering all bases.<br>Very clearly written, and elegantly designed (the icing on the cake). Good Job. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent primer. Work your way through the examples and you'll have a good grounding in the use of Photoshop and Image Ready for the web. The downside: Sometimes where it would be nice to download the graphic used in the book to try out a function, but it's not available. In other instances, the accompanying file has a different name in the book.<br>In places the proof reading is sloppy: graphics supposed to highlight features don't point to the right place.<br>Perhaps most seriously, the author is almost entirely focussed on building a website in Photoshop and Image Ready. Slicing up graphics certainly isn't the best way to build a site. But these are niggles; get this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book if your focus in using Photoshop is primarily the development of graphics for web design.  It's easy to follow and straight to the point for the beginner.  It's helpful to those familiar with earlier versions of Photoshop, who want to become familiar with the new layout of Photoshop 6.  I wouldn't recommend this book for earlier versions of Photoshop (though the author says it can be used for 5.5 if you can supplement the instructions in the book with your knowlegde of various features).<p>The book is full-color and filled with screenshots that make it incredibly easy to find on your own screen the exact function that is described in the book.<p>Photoshop has really evolved to be a handy aid for web development.  This book covers everything you need to know to get a webpage under construction quickly and painlessly.</span>
