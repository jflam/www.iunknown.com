<br />				Book Review
<br />Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai by Yamamoto Tsunetomo
<br />Translated by William Scott Wilson
<br />Publisher: Kodansha International (JPN) 1979; reissue edition Jan. 1,1992
<br />180 pages Price $9.00 ISBN#: 4-7700-1106-7
<br />Genre: Nonfiction; Eastern Philosophy
<br />	Hagakure is a manual to gain understanding of way if the Samurai.  It is also, a collection of thoughts and sayings, written by a former samurai. An example from the book is this one; " It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream.  When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream.  It is said the world we live is not a bit different from this." 
<br />	The author did achieve his purpose of the book. The purpose was to inform a wise way of living to dying; from learning to teaching. Such as this one " In affairs like law suits or even in arguments, by losing quickly one will lose in fine fashion.  It is like sumo [wrestling].  If one thinks only of winning, a sordid victory will be worse than defeat. For the most part, it becomes a squalid defeat."    
<br />	I recommend this book to any reader who likes books on philosophy and if the person is very spiritual.  It's a true classic in a book collection!

                    </div>
                    <span>This book was written in the 18th Century by a monk.  It was thus written long after the Samurai had ceased to be real warriors: the age of feuding clans had ended early in the 17th Century.  The kind of lifestyle described in this book by the author Tsunetomo is quite simply a lifestyle that was never led.  While it is not entirely 'pure imagination', it is a work that focuses on all the most extreme and suicidal examples of Samurai behaviour.  The author was trying to 'bring back' a macho ideal of bushido that had in fact never existed.  He was upset by the way that the Samurai class had lost their martial edge.  Unfortunately, his own biases distort the truth of how Samurai of previous eras lived their lives.  We have a great deal of evidence from earlier periods pointing out that the Samurai enjoyed the pleasures of life, and tended to behave as humans, unlike the robotic and slavish picture portrayed by the author.  To give a Western analogy, his book is like the works of 19th Century Europe which romanticize the lives of Medieval knights: attributing knights with single-minded devotion to the Code of Chivalry and submission to their 'ladies'; while in reality the Code of Chivalry was never really formulated, and the 'ladies' were other men's wives.  I give this book two stars because it is of some use in understanding what an 18th Century Japanese bookworm thought the old Samurai were like, and there is some cultural interest in that.  If you want a book that gives a real picture of Samurai duties, lifestyle and obligations, then read the 'Code of the Samurai' which was written in the 17th Century, which, although a time of peace under the newly-installed Tokugawa regime, was only starting to lose its martial traditions.  By the time Hagakure was written in the 18th Century, the true memory of the 'Age of the Country at War' was very confused and blurred.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span> The hagakure is a short book, but that does not mean that it is a short read. On the contrary, this is longest short read you will ever encounter. This book is dense, it will take you many reads to undestand this book. I have lost count of the amount of times that I have read it. 
<br />
<br /> Many deride this book as being written by an armchair samurai, noting the fact that yamamoto tsunetomo never actually fought in any battles. But this is the wrong way to look at the book. The Hagakure was written by a peace time samurai for peace time samurai, and is thus valuable for american practioners of the way. An invaluable book, recommended to all.</span>

                    <span>I read this book when it was near/below freezing outside; I sat on a metal bench.  I read with such intensity, that I needed the cold to dedicate my mind to the words I was reading.  I was often confused by the writings, where I would think about them in great detail until the message became clear.  Each paragraph is very important.  It is a short book, but it should take longer to read than the Bible.  I read it in two weeks, thanks to the cold, but, still, I missed more than I can imagine.  Should your eyes miss one word, or a single thought take you away, you need read the passage again and again.  This book will change your perspective... change how you view life.  It is VERY philosophical, if you concentrate on the reading.  I recommend it to those who need change in their lives, those who feel powerless but especially those who feel they cannot control their thoughts.  This book is about concentration, dedication and loyalty.  This is an important piece of literature!</span>
