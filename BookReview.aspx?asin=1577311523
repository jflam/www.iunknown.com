                <span id="Label1">Ekhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the <I>now</I> is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice, and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.<p> Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into <I>The Power of Now</I>. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence, and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolize "break time." This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, <I>The Power of Now</I> reads like the highly acclaimed <I>A Course in Miracles</I>--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>With no experience in "spiritual writings," I started listening to "The Power of Now" on CD. Although I have yet to hear the reportedly biased ideas regarding special access to presence for women or gays, I have heard more than enough to have learned to recognize presence in myself and to laugh at the insanity of my mind-generated dark moods and recurring funks.
<br />
<br />Tolle does have something of a "holier (more spiritual?) than thou" attitude, but it does not bother me. Quite the contrary, I feel like I have been waiting to hear this stuff my whole life. Another reviewer (IAF_67) complains of a lack of techniques or exercises for achieving "presence." I don't think he or she was ready to hear how simple this is. You merely have to recognize the "voice" in your head that is so concerned with all the things it is concerned with as not your true self.
<br />
<br />Tolle asks if we want to be miserable. We do not, but he points out that so many of us are so intensely self-defined by our problems that we cannot see ourselves any other way. Too bad for them. Keep reading. Start over if you need to. Much as my differential calculus professor told the class years ago - just keep after it, you will get it eventually.
<br />
<br />I went to my daughter's confirmation the other night. Her younger brother was "about to die" wanting to leave. My wife was not to keen on sitting around afterward for the refreshments, either. Thanks to Tolle, I was able to avoid sharing their stress, I reveled in the joy of so many others around us, I hugged and kissed my daughter . . . and had another piece of cake! 
<br />
<br />Today is my favorite day! Treat every moment as if it is the one you chose. Read Tolle.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In all of my 62 years, I have read numerous works on the topic of spirituality. Mr. Tolle's book follows many classics of which I so enjoyed-works by Ram Dass, Deepak Chopra, Andrew Harvey, Matthew Fox, Marianne Williamson, Alan Watts, Krishnamurti, Cayce ..ad infinitum. And though I enjoyed much of Tolle's book when it first appeared five years ago, when I look at it now(couldn't help but comment here on the author's vain and frighteningly egotistical preface to the new paperback edition), I am really wondering just who this teacher is.  
<br />
<br />I had the misfortune of hearing him speak when I was traveling in England last year, and the pomposity of which he came off -really appalled me. I never saw such an egotist in all my life. (in a so-called spiritual teacher-this is a bit off-putting) Tolle resonated with such vanity-that the spiritual "truths" he was attempting to make rang hollow. To me, those who remain modest and sincere and generous toward others are the real teachers. (Deepak Chopra, to me, is always so gracious and humble when he speaks; I also like Carolyn Myss and Andrew Weil-actually-- many spiritual communicators who come from a medical background-seem to walk their talk). 
<br />
<br />I can only say to those readers out there: "yes this is a good book-but pay attention to what may lie beneath the surface ". To me, the real spiritual teachers are always humble and helpful toward others. Tolle -in person- is very different from what he appears in his DVDs and books-I have heard he is cut-throat and very competitive when it comes to others' works (unfortunately, a good source of mine knows he has hurt others.) Bottom line? Everything must serve him. And that always says it all. Just be aware and go within and listen to your own inner communication to the divine. Forget this guy. 
<br />
<br />As one luminous Galilean soul once said: "By their deeds you shall know them".

                    <span>Recently a cousiun of mine was killed in a car crash and, bieng only 12 it was very hard, but tolle tells us to not dwell in the past and has helped me a great deal in coping with the trauma. Also my end of yr exams are coming up and that will help me in the hard tests. I think that tolle is a genious and he has influenced my life a great deal.

                    <span>I used to waste time obsessing over why my boyfriend dumped me and why I had not achieved what I wanted financially until I read this book.  Eckhart Tolle explains WHY you should let go of the past and move into the present moment. He exlains that if you refuse to forgive others, you are resisting life. He motivates you to live in the now with the WHY! Another wonderful book, Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, teaches you HOW to deal most effectively with disturbing feelings, overcome sef-sabotage and how to make the most of the present moment.  I absolutely recommend each of these books.</span>

                    <span>When first introduced to this book, I was highly skeptical.  After all, I have already read many religious, spiritual and philosophical texts.  Reading was able to fulfill me momentarily, and there was a gradual "let-down" as spiritual sensations became "medusa"d into cold stone intellectual mind-stuff.  This book was able to point past itself, allowed me to watch myself inspite of mind-stuff, and to be able to find peace in the present moment.  A must have for all seekers.</span>
