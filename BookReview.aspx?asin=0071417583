                    <span>The main premise behind Career Warfare is that one should approach building their own reputation the same way that companies approach building their brand - thoughtfully and methodically, not forgetting for a moment that having a terrific brand is the key to success.  This book trains you to be conscious of how your actions, words, and even appearance have a direct impact on your brand.
<br />
<br />The book, written by David F. D'Alessandro (with Michele Owens), has a decidedly practical tone.  Mr. D'Alessandro draws upon his numerous professional experiences (including both successes and mistakes), as well as many colorful examples from the world of business and politics, to create in effect a handbook for building your reputation.  Reading this book is akin to having a frank conversation with a seasoned mentor who is willing to give you candid advice on how the world of business really works and warn you about the multitude of potential pitfalls.  
<br />
<br />The different parts of this book will apply to different stages in your professional life: starting from the very beginning with instructions on building credibility in your very first job to the summit of your career, coaching you on how to handle power and visibility and not get burned.  Some of the other key lessons include "managing" your bosses, minding your manners, handling your enemies, navigating the day-to-day corporate jungle, and dealing with setbacks.  
<br />
<br />While it gives an excellent overview of the different issues and strategies to be aware of throughout your career, it only manages to scratch the surface of many subjects.   Even though the book may sometimes lack depth, its conversational style, combined with key points highlighted and singled out throughout the book, makes it an enjoyable and highly digestible read.
<br />
<br />Its limitations aside, Career Warfare is a book that I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in enhancing their personal brand - particularly, those who work (or plan to work) in a corporate environment.  It is never too early (or too late) to start building or modifying your brand, and this book is an indispensable guide to doing so.</span>

                    <span>I guess I came across mention of this title in an issue of Fast Company, but I can't be sure. It seems like something they would feature in the magazine, though.
<br />
<br />I wasn't that interested in this book initially, but it quickly grew on me. D'Alessandro (in partnership with Michele Owens) speaks from with an assured voice and what is, obviously, real-world experience. Even more, the book is filled with clear and illustrative examples of what can go wrong, and right, as you build your career.
<br />
<br />I am happy to see a CEO focus on something of use to everyone instead of the usual accounts of how they crushed the competition and turned themselves and their shareholders into ultra-millionaires. Everyone works. Everyone has a boss and nearly everyone can benefit from this book.
<br />
<br />D'Alessandro speaks about the need to "analyze" your boss into one of the 7 archetypes he has developed from his experiences. Are they a "Little League Parent" or a "Mentor"? A "Wastrel"? A "Pariah"? How can you identify the and how do you develop your career with, or in spite, of them. While you certainly want to judge people solely on the management skills, understanding the basic types can help to make you life easier.
<br />
<br />The author's experiences and insights dovetail nicely with my own career experiences. I have seen almost all of the boss varieties he describes, both bad and good. It is always a reassuring to hear that you aren't the only person to have struggled with career issues.
<br />
<br />Career Warfare is one of those books that should be given to every college student sometime around their junior year. I know I certainly would have been spared a lot of "hard knocks" learning had this book been available back in the early 80's. Reading this book could prepare new careerists for the realities that will face and give them a "leg up" into the working world.
<br />
<br />Current managers can also benefit, as well. The book is an excellent way to do a "gut check" and see if you are really the manager you want to be. Idealistically, I would also recommend this book even the most experienced managers so they might recognize any bad habits they might have adopted over the years and seek to correct them, even at this late date.
<br />
<br />D'Alessandro gives some excellent advice for "getting along" in troublesome work environments, but shares my assessment that there are times when you should never compromise your ethics. It is always better to find a new job than find yourself under investigation. Being out of work damages your personal brand much less than becoming a convicted felon. Ask Martha Stewart.
<br />
<br />Overall, this book was an easy and engaging read. One that reinforced my own experience and beliefs, yet also elicited new thoughts and concepts on what it means to have a career.</span>

                    <span>The book gives very general and common advice. Advice looks dress well etc is not the kind of advice people expect from such a book. May be the author was trying to write the book for a very wide and general audience. Decent book for someone in the initial phases of career. For experienced readers, "The 5 patterns of extraordinary careers" is a much better book.</span>

                    <span>and examples about the skills necessary to realize their ambitions in various business cultures. Author David F. D?Alessandro is a marketing guru, and a skilled phrase maker and spin doctor. To his own surprise, he was offered a chair at the management table where the bottom line decisions get made on his way to becoming CEO of John Hancock Financial Services. In the framework of rules for personal branding and in the interest helping you play office politics successfully, D?Alessandro spins dozens of yarns that bring context and reality to a subject that is often speculated about by authors who have never really achieved the success their books describe. His advice is ruthlessly honest, pointed, witty, precise and ripe with polished anecdotes. For this reason we recommend this book to business persons anywhere on the corporate ladder who suspect their battle plan may be ready for a few new moves.</span>

I would strongly advise that all business leaders read this and especially those just out of college trying to build their 'career brand'!</span>
