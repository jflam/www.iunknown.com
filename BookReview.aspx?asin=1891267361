Clear and easy instruction from one of America&#146;s most famous professional bartenders makes for fun browsing of drink options and mixing, stirring or shaking. "What shall we have tonight darling? a Screamer, or a Screaming Viking? Perhaps a Scarlet Letter, a Seduction, or a Screw-Up. How about a Sand in Your Butt? Is that anything like a Sex on the Beach #1, #2 or #3? Actually, I like the looks of the Sex in a Hot Tub and we could finish the evening off with the Shark Bite." You will have lots of fun with this most comprehensive and contemporary bartenders guide.</span>

                    <span>This book is without a doubt the best investment I have ever made. When I had an interest in bartending I snagged a copy of this and started studying... as a result I now make a comfortable living bartending, and enjoying my job.<BR>It doesn't have every drink known to man (what book could?), but it will cover most everything you need... It will give you quite a good start on what mixes well with each other. The guide to liquors at the back is quite nifty as well, since you can always impress your nitwit patrons with booze knowledge. Don't hesitate on picking this up.</span>

                    <span>I had to write a review after reading the prior one of a man in search of a picture book. There are a plethora of [bad] picture drink books on the market. It is funny, he was looking for a common thing (a [bad] picture drink book) and he got the finest drink recipe book ever written. The author painstakingly alphabetized and reworked thousands of drinks. He threw out all the [bad stuff] and made a No [fooling] essential tool, that restaurants, bars, and liquor stores must carry (they all seem to). The book is unbiased (no liquor companies pushing their product) It lays flat so I can work and read at the same time. I own a 4th, 5th and a 6th edition and I await new editions. I have learned from them all....THE BARTENDER'S BLACK BOOK IS A 5 STAR BOOK.</span>

                    <span>I'm a bartender and there is always one customer who comes along and orders a drink you dont know how to make. Behind the bar we keep several drink books, but this is the only one that actually gets used. Easy to read recipies, non-coded names for liquors, short, sweet, and to the point. Spiral binded so the book will not close while you are mixing. Contains the most variety of drinks I've seen from Vodka Collins for beginners (which most books don't have) through Long Islands all the way to a Mongolian Mother for the more adverse. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to shake, stir, or blend.</span>

                    <span>It does seem to have an awful lot of recipes crammed in there, but I was looking for a book with a bunch of curiosity-provoking, colorful pictures... something to make a guest say "hey, I want one of those!" It looks like a phone book inside-- lots of small writing, listing one drink after another.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent. My husband works part-time at a liquor store and they have a copy there to help the customer's know what goes into their drinks at a bar. That way if they want they can purchase what they need to make them at home. The book is awesome. I'm always referring to it at the store so I decided I'd like a copy for at home. So I ordered it online from Amazon.com.</span>
