                    <span>To enjoy this book rather that use it as a kind of "Ripley's Believe It or Not" reference book for Catholics, read the foreword written by the widow of this recently deceased author. She humanizes this lovely little book in a very touching way. LoBello's personal life motto was "Work hard, Pray hard, Play hard." This book is his play. The author was himself a respected journalist and this is his collection of tidbits that just did not have a proper place in print for him before. And, they are funny and fascinating. Having dallied with cigarette smoking myself once, I just loved knowing that Pope John XXIII succumbed on a regular basis. Who knew there have been Pope abdications and even a layman and a woman Pope??? Read the Book! The last part has longer sections on a few topics that need time. Here is where LoBello's talent as a writer is truly evident. He takes a few provocative topics like Exorcism, Canonization, and the Vatican as Film Maker, and makes for great reading on them. The chapter on Pope Pius XII and his assistant, Sister Pasqualina, is riveting. Between her and Pope Joan, LoBello makes the men on the throne a shade paler. I read this book in one well-spent hour, and it is still a keeper. I will reach for it over and over and over.</span>

                    <span>Nino Lo Bello has provided a fun and fascinating look into the Vatican and Catholic Church. While I am not a Catholic, I found it easy to read and it explained many aspects of the Church. It dealt honestly with some of the Church's dark history. I also gained an even greater respect and admiration for Pope Paul II. It is a fun and informative read.</span>

                    <span>"Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, dean of the College of Cardinals, issued a public apology for having written the forward to [the Italian edition of Nino Lo Bello's] book on Vatican anecdotes, which he said lacked respect for the Vatican 'and especially for the person of the supreme pontiff.' " {NCR, 10/6/00, p. 10}<P>One wonders why this 1998 trivia collection has caused such a fervor, but an examination of its contents, indicates that the curia-crats are lacking in a sense of humor and chutzpah. Perhaps the extended appendix about "La Poppessa," Sister Pasqualina Lehnert, " the German born housekeeper, confidante, adviser, and closest aide [for 41 years] to . . .Pius XII," and chief source for Pius XII's cause for sainthood is one such impropriety.<P>Perhaps the short paragraph about Pius IX use of the death penalty as ruler of the Papal states creates a problem. Perhaps the one page devoted to Opus Dei, the source of Dominus Iesus, caused some embarrassment. Unfortunately, the late author's description of the steps to sainthood is hopelessly out of date in the face of John Paul II's assembly line. However, he does list those 40 non-existent saints whom Paul VI removed from veneration in 1969, such as Christopher, Valentine, Anastasia and Barbara. Lo Bello notes that "other saints are optional on the basis of local loyalties. For instance, Saint [Patricus] is fine in Ireland [and the United States], but according to a Vatican official, 'holds little interest for the Cambodians.' "<P>Yes indeed, this is a humanizing book which tweaks those who would sanctify pontiffs and popes. I have placed it on my shelf next to "Rome Has Spoken" and "Papal Lies," right above "The Bad Popes" and "Sex Lives of the Popes," and below Cardinal Ratzlinger's exegesis on the Catechism. I suspect the publisher may run out of copies shortly. <P>"The book, which could be read as portraying 'surprising and ridiculous' foibles of modern popes, 'truly is not good, nor true nor opportune,' [Cardinal] Gantin wrote in a letter published by the Italian magazine 30 Giomi."<P>"I ask the pardon of all those who may have been surprised, scandalized or not edified by my naive involvement in this affair," the Dean of the College of Cardinals wrote.<P>Definitely, a must buy and must read.

                    <span>This book is not limited to those of the Catholic faith for all-in-all it is really not about Catholicism but rather about the past & present of the Vatican & those people associated with it. Lo Bello's use of an interview-style format makes the book so much more enjoyable. The content in the book is not the common questions most tourists ask about the Vatican but more unique, sometimes scandalous, things most people probably did not even know about. There is no bibliography so you wonder where Lo Bello got his information but nevertheless this book is full of history & facts that does not lose its flavor.</span>
