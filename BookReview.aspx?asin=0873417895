                    <span>Shephard created a book satiated with texture, woven in embroidery of dyes and rituals. In African Accents, the author shares with us her stories through textiles. She recreates African accents for readers who have formerly collected pieces of cultural tradition and for the newly converted. Scanning through the craft section of any bookstore, one could notice a scarcity of African crafts, house style, and decorating books. With this book, Shephard undertakes a worthy task. The author's time spent in Senegal piqued her already flourishing interest in African design. Shephard prefaces each chapter with anecdotes, the significance of fiber technique, and facts about the fabrics used for the easy to follow hand-made crafts she shares later in the book. The author separates the fabric regionally and explains the social and rich cultural aspects tied into the various designs and processes.<BR>	The first part of the book is devoted to recreating the essence of each separate style of fabric, (that is, if you choose to). Some fabric recreations are simple and others are intricate including embroidery and weaving. Shephard cautions that replicating the fabric does not replace the real thing, but could rather deepen one's appreciation for the years of apprenticeship. In reproducing the designs on the fabrics, the book includes actual sized symbols with their meaning. Some of the Ashanti designs on the fabrics, the author indicates, are the equivalent of the European family crest.<BR>	In part two of the book the chapters are devoted to each room of your home and the art of gift giving. Secrets and tricks are provided to lend your pillows, clocks and picture frames the professional touch. There is certainly no limitation of "how to" procedures. I tried a few myself and although the suggestion of the staple gun for the kente stool fell short of my expectation (probably the gun itself) I pulled out the old hammer and nail and my stool looked unfailingly as Shephard had promised. Some of the crafts, if you were not handy with a sewing machine would be better left to the local tailor. Yet, there was a time when a sewing machine was a staple in most family's homes. The art of sewing and the practicality of its uses have been forgotten. But if sewing seems impossible for you, Shephard happily offers other easy alternatives.<BR>	This is a consummate reason for a recommendation of this slim book to be on the shelves of all art leagues. The book makes it apparent that Spanish and French artists popular in the 19th and 20th centuries have gained much of their appeal with the use of African art infused with their own. Shephard's passion for the continent exudes throughout the book, aquatinting the reader with crafts and fabric otherwise inaccessible. It is a craft-book du nouveau, a comprehensive history lesson, and a full color tabletop book. It is a significant forefront of a happily growing movement. Through this thoughtful undertaking the beauty of the textiles, that have been admired and used for years, could now have intimate meanings and representations. Choosing that kente, Kuba or mudcloth after reading Shephard's book will add new substance to its use.<P>Yasmain Broady-Soya...</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed lisa's book but I'm not much of a craftsperson. I love african style, and came away with some good ideas. Some of these projects require more than I am willing to give. I'm into simplistic projects that look like there was alot of effort. The projects range from easy to not so easy. The are some good internet sources but some of them are no longer avalible. I have not attempted any of the crafts in the book but I'm looking foreward to Lisa's next release (coming out in October). I think her next release may be what I'm looking for.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Shepard's knowledge and appreciation for African textiles and crafts is shown with style throughout this book. The craft instructions are clear and easy to follow (even for a novice craftsperson like myself!) The photographs are terrific also, they act as real motivators to try some of these great decorating ideas. How refreshing to see a crafts and decorating book with culturally diverse appeal!</span>

                    <span>African Accents by Lisa Shepard is more than just another book with homey decorator projects for the Do-It-Yourselfer. As Shepard makes clear in her introduction, her passion for genuine African fabrics is based on admiration for their strong colors and designs coupled an educated appreciation for the craftsmanship that goes into their creation.<P>Since she recognizes that collection of these beautiful fabrics may well be beyond the reach of the average pocketbook, she sets out to teach us how to duplicate the look with affordable materials and then provides detailed instructions for sophisticated decorating projects that are reasonably easy to accomplish.<P>Make your own stamps with potatoes, compressed sponges or rubber stamps to get the look of Adinkra cloth. Shepard provides over 20 different Adinkra symbols to copy together with their African names and meanings.<P>Choose from over a dozen images to create unique Korhogo designs (and I dare you to resist trying the panels and floor cloth projects in the book). Try mudcloth, Kuba cloth or Kasaii velvet. <P>The instructions are clear and the power of the designs would enhance just about any room in your home or office.<P>They would also be fairly easy for a school group or Scout troop to teach children about the strength and beauty of the cultures they represent. I can easily imagine a group of kids having a good time creating Adinkra stamps at a children's birthday party.<P>Shepard expresses the hope that working on the projects will increase the readers appreciation for the real thing. A quick glance through this lovely book will convince you.</span>

                    <span>Once I saw the title of this book, I knew I could not pass it up. I was not disappointed! Being a weekend crafter and sewer, I like to find quick and easy ways to accent my home, clothing and gifts. It's all here in African Accents. After reading the book I learned things I did not know about the history and art of West African designs and fabrics. African Accents is a 'must read' for those interested in ethnically diverse and fun ways to decorate the home and create unique gifts and crafts.</span>
