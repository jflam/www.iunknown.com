                    <span>Fiona and Shrek are blissful ogres on their honeymoon in "Shrek 2," the delightful new animated film from Dreamworks. Shrek would like nothing better than to wallow in the swamp and lie on the beach with the love of his life. The couple's solitude is disturbed, however, when the fast-talking and impudent donkey who was Shrek's sidekick in the first movie knocks on their door and makes himself at home. Donkey is too clueless to know that two's company and three's a crowd. Shrek is even more chagrined when Princess Fiona's parents, the King and Queen, invite their daughter and her new husband to the palace. Shrek correctly predicts that his in-laws will be shocked when they discover that their daughter married an ogre. In fact, the King desperately wants Fiona to dump Shrek and marry Prince Charming, a fey blond egomaniac who is overly attached to his pushy mother. All this conflict puts a strain on the newlyweds.<P>"Shrek 2" scores in all areas. The acting is marvelous, with Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz heading an all-star cast. Jennifer Saunders is a standout as an aggressive fairy godmother with a mean streak. The animation is terrific, the special effects are marvelous, and there are musical numbers, satirical allusions, and lots of sight gags to entertain kids and adults alike. Kick back and enjoy this perfect summer movie.</span>

                    <span>With a cast that includes John Cleese and Julie Andrews as Princess Fiona's royal parents, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, both Antonio Banderas AND Jennifer Saunders stealing the show as Puss-In-Boots and the Fairy Godmother, respectively, SHREK 2 actually manages to do the seemingly impossible: build on---and even improve upon---the original! Usually, the first in any film series is the best, being fresh & original; sequels almost never live up to the original story. However, SHREK 2 plays not like a sequel; it's really more of an extension of the wacky SHREK. It actually throws more at you this time around, and resultingly turns out to be a laugh-a-minute animated comedy that blows you away. It is startingly original, inventive, edgy, satirical, rude, crude, romantic, cute---all at the same time! Mike Myers still does an incredible job as the voice of Shrek, as does Eddie Murphy as the motormouth Donkey and, of course, Cameron Diaz as the feisty Princess Fiona. I couldn't count all the great lines there are in the film! Also, as visually stunning as the 3-D CGI animation was in the original, it is even more amazing this time around: for example, Prince Charming looks so real that you have to remind yourself that he's not CGI. SHREK 2 is a feast for the eyes, yet you don't even realize how much it is because you're too busy laughing at the hundreds of gags, of which I will not dare to reveal!<P>As with the original, this film is not appropriate for kids under the age of 8. As with the original, more than 20 million kids under the age of 8 will have seen this film by this time next year. That's just a fact of life, I guess! Already SHREK 2 is breaking box office records, most notably the coveted five-day-opening-weekend record, earning over $125 million. It will undoubtably end up with an over-half-billion-dollar take at the U.S. box office alone, easily surpassing that of the original. But really, it isn't all hype: SHREK 2 definitely earns its standing as the most anticipated movie sequel of the year. Add to that the best comedy of the year!<P>MOST RECOMMENDED</span>

                    <span>Hilarious. Adults will love it's fast paced, bit mature, twisted humor. I liked it much better than the first Shrek. The laughs come at a non-stop fast pace. There are no boring parts. Small children may not catch much of the humor (at least I hope not), but the movie is a visual masterpiece. A feast for the young viewer's eyes. Great fun. Loved it. </span>

                    <span>This is a great film. It has a good moral and is a good family film. Most of the the innuendoes and other innapropriate jokes will go over the heads of most children.</span>
