                    <span>Boooooooooring! Homechick tripped me out, sharing her lewd fantasies with the world. It was plain to me that Pac used her as a distraction while behind bars. If she wasn't beautiful he wouldn't have given her and her letter the time of day. And his constant requests for more pictures...what do you think he was doing with them??? Why didn't he try to make something happen with her upon his release? In the media I've heard about his relationship with Jada and even Keshia is mentioned. But no word of any Angela. She was straight up used and played. Maybe she thought having "exclusive" Tupac letters made her special but the book only served to bring to light how foolish she was.</span>

                    <span>I think that this book was very well written and extremely honest.  I think that it reflected the mind set of both Tupac and Angela and it showed that neither of them were under the impression that they were eachothers ultimate loves.  They had a connection and he appealed to her senses and longings and she appealed to his situation and held him down mentally getting him through one day at a time with her poems and letters. I'm glad I bought this book because being such a huge Tupac fan, it gave me a side of him I had never seen and it was him telling me through his letters and poetry and not Angela telling me anything about him.  She's very talented and I commend her for sharing such private information with the world.  Information that none of us who read it would have ever seen or known had she not shared her letters. I e-mailed her to let her know what I thought and to my surprise, she e-mailed me back. She's as cool as she was in the book. It was two gemini's expressing fantasy with eachother at a time when they both needed it. Everyone should e-mail her and ask her anything you want to know at www.AngelaArdis.com, she will answer back, just like Tupac did for her. (smile) I highly recommend this book 2 all his fans and those who are just curious.

                    <span>I liked the book and all of the poetry in it, but all of the lustful poems confused me when tupac had a woman who was his potential wife.  I think Angela got played in a few ways.</span>

                    <span>While I was looking over the book in my local bookstore I was unsure about buying it. First because it felt as though I was invading Tupac's privacy. Second because I thought that Ms.Ardis was nothing more that a groupie that was trying to use Tupac's name to make a quick dollar. Needless to say I went ahead and bought the book. The poetry from Ms.Ardis and Tupac is great. I hated the fact that some parts in the book were her fantasies instead of the matter at hand. When I got to the end of the book I felt as though Ms.Ardis had been played and she didn't even know it. The poetry in the book is great. The rest is just (in my opinion) useless information. I could have also done without Ms. Ardis discussing her need to defecate.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book!!  It showed a tender, vulnerable, lonely Tupac.  I loved reading the letters in his own handwriting.  It was very intimate.  Makes me wonder if there are any other Tupac prison letters out there... </span>
