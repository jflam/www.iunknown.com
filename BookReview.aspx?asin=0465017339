                <span id="Label1">The best-selling enfant terrible of the Reagan revolution offers advice to today's budding conservatives--the very people he sees as the true "radicals" of tomorrow. <P>Dinesh D'Souza rose to national prominence as one of the founders of the Dartmouth Review, a leading voice in the rebirth of conservative politics on college campuses in the 1980s. <P>He fired the first popular shot against political correctness with his best-selling expos&#233; <I>Illiberal Education</I>. Now, after serving as a Reagan White House staffer, the managing editor of <I>Policy Review</I>, and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, he addresses the next generation in <I>Letters to a Young Conservative</I>. Drawing on his own colorful experiences, both within the conservative world and while skirmishing with the left, D'Souza aims to enlighten and inspire young conservatives and give them weapons for the intellectual battles that they face in high school, college, and everyday life. <I>Letters to a Young Conservative</I> also illuminates the enduring themes that for D'Souza anchor the conservative position: not "family values" or patriotism, but a philosophy based on natural rights and a belief in universal moral truths. <P>With a light touch, D'Souza shows that conservatism needn't be stodgy or defensive, even though it is based on preserving the status quo. To the contrary, when a conservative has to expose basic liberal assumptions to scrutiny, he or she must become a kind of imaginative, fun-loving, forward-looking guerrilla--philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical. <P>Among the topics Dinesh D'Souza covers in <I>Letters to a Young Conservative</I>: <BR>--Fighting Political Correctness <BR>--Authentic vs. Bogus Multiculturalism <BR>--Why Government Is the Problem <BR>--When the Rich Get Richer <BR>--How Affirmative Action Hurts Blacks <BR>--The Feminist Mistake <BR>--All the News That Fits <BR>--How to Harpoon a Liberal <BR>--The Self-Esteem Hoax <BR>--A Republican Realignment? <BR>--Why Conservatives Should Be Cheerful</span>

                    <span>This is an especially good book for the interested high school student and every college student. As a 53 year old, I found it an entertaining, informative, and stimulating read. At times I laughed out-loud. At times I went deep into thought. Mr. D'Souza's book will fascinate any socially or politically curious reader - conservative, moderate, liberal or libertarian. <P>Mr. D'Souza writes clearly and sometimes humorously about the hot-button issues facing Americans today. Using fact, reason, experience and his awareness of literature and history, he brilliantly describes liberal and conservative thinking in our country and examines their intellectual and historical underpinnings.<BR> <BR>A native of India and a man 'of color', he offers an enlightening and informed perspective on multiculturalism, immigration, capitalism, feminism, affirmative action and other currents affecting contemporary American life. With practicality and common sense, he offers a view of the challenges all Americans face in order to survive as a viable nation in the global context.</span>

                    <span>Occasionally a book comes along that validates the old cliché about being so good that you can't put it down. Dinesh D'Souza's Letters to a Young Conservative is absolutely one such book. In it he writes a series of letters, thirty-one in all, to a fictional young undergraduate conservative named Chris. The premise is that Chris has written D'Souza after seeing him speak at his university. Chris is overwhelmed by the leftist politically correct atmosphere at his college and D'Souza comforts him by giving counsel on every imaginable topic in the realm of ideas. His arguments draw on nearly twenty-five years of street fighting within the conservative movement. This work is part of a series by Basic Books of established older masters offering advice to the young, and includes Christopher Hitchens' outstanding Letters to a Young Contrarian. <BR>D'Souza's book is a moving, exquisite pep-talk for all right-minded thinkers regardless of age. It is not an explosive tirade and instead is a series of quiet, rational arguments designed to illustrate that anything is possible if one is reflective and patient. The work is truly deceiving due to its accessibility and style. D'Souza is not verbose and writes highly comprehensible sentences. The clarity of the text is problematic as you may plow through a few pages before realizing that D'Souza has just written something quite profound. As a warning, you should not begin reading this hardback if you have vocational or personal interests that cannot be immediately neglected because the enlightenment the book issues is highly addictive. <BR>The material is serious for the most part but there are a few occasions where the reader may find his or her self laughing out loud after ingesting the exploits of D'Souza and his college peers who worked at the samizdat, The Dartmouth Review. They were one of the first, if not the very first, alternative conservative college publications in the country and the militancy of the left at Dartmouth propelled D'Souza to their ranks even though he initially entered college as a liberal. <BR>He and his friends bait the existing power hierarchy repeatedly but on no occasion so humorously as when they protest the university's expenditures on the Gay Students' Association. The Dartmouth Review viewed this as being inappropriate and discriminatory as it was awarding funds to individuals based on sexual orientation only. Their way of dealing with the quandary was quite novel to say the least. <BR>D'Souza and peers, to illustrate the ridiculousness of such organizations, formed The Dartmouth Bestiality Society and even appointed a president and zookeeper. They then went to the dean to ask for support but the dean responded that no support was necessary as there was no interest in such activities at Dartmouth. The President of the Bestiality Society responded with, "That may be true, Dean Hanson, but it is because of centuries of discrimination! Those of us who are inclined toward animals have been systematically excluded and ostracized. Our organization will provide a supportive atmosphere in which people of our particular sexual orientation are treated with respect. At Dartmouth...let us put an end to beast phobia." [p.28] Their method may be extreme but it teaches the moral that ridicule is a potent force when dealing with the absurdity that is multi-cultural theory and diversity in America. They may not have won the battle but nearly everyone held the Gay Students' Association in a different light after their proposal. <BR>D'Souza has some very original arguments in the book that should help the reader in dealing with the ever present emotional tirades thrown by liberals. This reviewer's favorite chapter was the one on the temperament of conservatives versus that of liberals. The most important point in the book, and certainly the argument that the author most needed to make, is that conservatives are a far happier lot than liberals. This is due to the fact that we have already embraced the realities of our world and the inherent flaws within human nature. As we view ourselves as being part of a historical continuum, we do not attempt to wrestle with forces that cannot change so we accept our limited place in the scheme of things and never experience emotional meltdown when we discover that legislation cannot alter the flaws of humanity. <BR>This book is a recording of quintessential songs to be learned and sung by any who are a David beneath the boot of the leftist Goliath. This Goliath has the media as a sword and the universities and the public schools as his spear, but with the help of D'Souza, independent media outlets, and patriotic fervor, we may be able to stone this unruly Goliath back into the bronze age.</span>

                    <span>Mr. D'Souza seems intent on dividing America into irreconcilable groups, liberals and conservatives. Most people in the street would be shocked to know that we aren't Americans anymore but - liberals and conservatives locked in a culture war, and that one can be a liberal by default, by failing to kowtow to the author's views. <P>This, and every other country needs uniters, not dividers. September 11 doesn't seem to have given conservatives any reason to reconsider their divisiveness.</span>

                    <span>July 2, 2004. Saw Farenheit 911 this week and needed an antidote. (...) I had received Letters to a Young Conservative as a gift two years ago and had it in my "to read" pile. I came of political age under Reagan. He was the first president I could vote for. He was the first politician I ever volunteered for. He provided a very positive and affirming vision of what it means to be an American and how to participate in our democracy and the world. Up until the 60's it was pretty clear what it meant to be an American. Most people agreed on a large number of core values. Somehow in that drug/sex haze that begat me (born 1964), our parents decided to try and throw everything before out and start over. D'Souza does a very good job of reminding us why that was a silly idea and how the legacy of free everything still haunts us today. <P>This is the kind of book you can pick up anytime and open to any chapter and find thought provoking prose. Each chapter has a specific topic or theme. If you want to understand the falacy of the Anti-Globalists argument, turn to chapter 26 (particularly relevant given current events). Want to understand why the Catholics, once the party of Kennedy, are now up for grabs? Want to know how and why the heartland of America, once working class Democrats, are now all Republicans? Turn to chapter 29. My favorite is probably chapter 18, "How to Harpoon a Liberal". Full of juicy tidbits from his many campus visits and the direct confontations with tenured liberal professors and brainwashed freshmen students. When you are young and still rebelling against your parents, it is fashionable to take up any cause identified on the "fringe". When you are older and hopefully have your own family, you usually come to realize the value of law, society, family, values, and why "traditions" work. When I was young, I was also incredibly fearless, egotistical and selfish. I thought nothing could hurt me, I knew most of the answers and whatever I liked was right. In the end, much of the liberal agenda is selfish kids not growing up, not accepting responsibility and learning to trust others. <P>The young liberal would say "whatever feels good, do it". The young conservative has an uncomfortable feeling with that. Something about imposing his minute by minute egotistical desires on the world doesn't seem right. If you feel this discomfort and want to know why and how to explain it, read this book.</span>
