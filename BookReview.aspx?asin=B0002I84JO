There he meets a neighbor, Christian, who, on a bet, tries to seduce him. When Christian exposes Davis' secret desire, Davis rejects Christian for being shallow and empty. As each boy's reality is shattered, the two are drawn into a passionate romance that risks destroying their lives. Audiences, young and old and straight and gay, have been moved to tears by this beautiful story of the transformational power of love and family.</span>

                    <span>It was 2am when one of my friends said, hey, let's watch this movie.  He'd seen it before and I protested, but to no avail.  As I sat watching it, I fell in love with the characters and their struggles.  The movie takes you through so many  emotions.  As I was sitting on the couch, I just started bawling.  It's so deeply moving and emotional.  No matter what your take is on being gay, this movie is a must see.  It isn't some anti-Mormon movie or a "look at how gay we can be."  It's one of the most touching and inspiring films I've ever watched.</span>

                    <span>On a whim, I paid for rhis movie on pay-per-view.  As I began watching it, I was immediately hooked!  I couldn't stop watching!  This movie made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me want to scream!  Any movie that can make me do all this is worth the money!  I ran out a few days later and purchased this movie for myself.  Now, I watch it about once a month if not more!  If you're like me and enhoy a movie that can pull you into it like you are one of the characters.  You feel the movie in your heart, then you'll love Latter Days!</span>

                    <span>The intriguing thing about this movie is that it doesn't hit you over the head and force you to like it. The dynamics of the characters unfold at just the right pace so the viewer has a chance to disseminate what is going on. Writer/director CJ Cox, drew on personal experiences growing up in the Mormon church to tell this story. I think if he had been Muslin, or Pakistani, he would have used that religion as a basis for the plot. The real irony to this story is how organized religion can be so hateful, bigoted and ignorant that it's ok to for them to be that way as long as they put the lord behind or in front of it.
<br />
<br />I truly enjoyed watching this film, and have watched it several times since. There could have been more depth and dimension to other supporting characters, but I can see that the director didn't want to detract focus away from the main characters. After all it is a two hour movie and not a documentary. Being 19 years old isn't a pre requisite to understanding what this movie is about., I can still relate and appreciate what the story has to offer, which is understanding, compassion, humanity, empathy, self worth & unconditional love. 	
<br />
<br />It can be said that watching this movie can have a  life lesson effect, which can have us searching within ourselves to ask certain questions.. How does my existence fit into the scheme of things? Do I have the capacity of love unconditionally? Am I shallow and ignorant enough to put my needs above someone else that I profess to care about? Can I accept and love myself enough, and believe my self worth? Am I loved by others? We as humans have a tendency to put ourselves on pedestals,  professing at times what great people we are, and all the good we do. The reality is  we gloss over, and at times completely omit certain truths to our darker nature hoping  that the good we do will shift the focus. </span>

                    <span>I love this movie.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  The story is unique.  That said, the reason that I have only given it for out of five stars is because the plot moves a little bit slowly.</span>

                    <span>I'm a 20-year old guy leaving in L.A. and I had never been interested on watching gay-related films, but now that I've seen Latter Days, I can't believe what I missed when it came out on the big screen. For anyone who has a true heart, this movie will really touch it. I just want to cry everytime I watch it because it shows that gays can also have a relationship with true love. I liked the way the movie go, first they met and Aaron showed Christian that life insn't all about sex, fun, and being shallow; that it should be about believing that one can become something else no matter what. Then later at the right moment came the kiss and finally almost at the end they got together, it was amazing! The movie is based on a true story and it does show. I still don't know for how long I'll keep watching it because everytime I do it leaves butterflies in my stomach, can't help it!</span>
