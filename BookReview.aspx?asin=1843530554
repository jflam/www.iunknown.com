                <span id="Label1">INTRODUCTION  <P>Tuscany and Umbria harbour the classic landscapes of Italy, familiar from a thousand Renaissance paintings, with their backdrop of medieval hill-towns, rows of cypress trees, vineyards and olive groves, and artfully sited villas and farmhouses. It&#146;s a stereotype that has long held an irresistible attraction for northern Europeans. Shelley referred to Tuscany as a "paradise of exiles", and ever since his time the English, in particular, have seen the region as an ideal refuge from a sun-starved and overcrowded homeland.  <P>The expatriate&#146;s perspective may be distorted, but the central provinces &#150; and especially Tuscany &#150; are indeed the essence of Italy in many ways. The national language evolved from Tuscan dialect, a supremacy ensured by Dante, who wrote the Divine Comedy in the vernacular of his birthplace, Florence. Other great Tuscan writers of the period &#150; Petrarch and Boccaccio &#150; reinforced its status, and in the nineteenth century Manzoni came to Tuscany to purge his vocabulary of any impurities while working on The Betrothed, the most famous of all Italian novels. But what makes this area pivotal to the culture not just of Italy but of all Europe is, of course, the Renaissance period, whose masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture are an intrinsic part of any tour. The very name by which we refer to this extraordinarily creative era was coined by a Tuscan, Giorgio Vasari, who wrote in the sixteenth century of the "rebirth" of the arts with the humanism of Giotto and his successors.  <P>Nowadays Tuscany and Umbria are among the wealthiest regions of the modern Italian state, a prosperity founded partly on agriculture and tourism, but largely on their industrial centres, which are especially conspicuous in the Arno valley. Nonetheless, both Tuscany and Umbria are predominantly rural provinces, with great tracts of land still looking much as they did half a millennium ago. Just as the hill-towns mould themselves to the summits, the terraces of vines follow the lower contours of the hills and open fields spread across the broader valleys, forming a distinctive balance between the natural and human world.</span>

                    <span>Of all the guidebooks I've ever used, this one is the best. Extenstive information not only for the main tourist attractions in the area, but also good information for the smaller out of the way towns. This books is utterly thorough and accurate. The information on art and its historical background is significant and comprehensive. It's well organized and easy to use. And it pointed us to great restaurants. This guidebook literally contains two or three times as much information as the other ones. I couldn't be more enthusiastic. By the way, if you're going to rural Tuscany and Umbria, you'll have a fabulous trip and this book will make it even better.</span>

                    <span>I can safely say that this is one of the best guidebooks I have ever carried with me. It's complete, accurate and well-written. I was amazed by the amount of research that must have gone in to making this book: there is a lot of interesting history (including excellent boxes with 'small history' and interesting stuff on all the peculiarities of the towns you might pass by), a lot of information (maps, accomodation, general atmosphere) on even the smallest towns, great descriptions of regions and highlights. I was never disappointed with the recommended things, ranging from restaurants to sites and museums. There is not only info about art, but also about food, trendy cafe's, quiet and less touristy villages etc. It really seemed to me that the people who made this book, known the area very well and spend a lot of time making a perfect guidebook that suits everybody. It's also the most recently published guidebook on the region, which means even the prices are correct. Highly recommended!</span>
