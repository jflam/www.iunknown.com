                            							<p>One day, Daddy put Ben&#8217;s favorite train Henry in his pocket. He was cleaning up the house the night before he was going to Las Vegas for the MIX conference. When Daddy got up the next day, he brought Henry with him in his pocket! Silly Daddy!</p>
<p>When Daddy got to the airport, he reached into his pocket for something else, and he found &#8230; Henry! So Daddy decided to take a picture of Henry at the airport:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img020.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img020" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img020_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a></p>
<p>Soon, it was time to get onto the airplane. Here&#8217;s a picture of Henry looking out the window just before the airplane takes off!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img021.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img021" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img021_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After a long plane ride, we finally landed in Las Vegas. Henry was excited to be off the airplane. Here he is in front of the gate, D25:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img022.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img022" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img022_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>We got into a taxi van to go to our hotel. Here is Henry looking out the window at some of the signs in Las Vegas. It was a sign for <em>Defending the Caveman:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img024.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img024" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img024_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>When Henry got to his hotel, the <em>Mirage, </em>he saw the biggest fish tank he had ever seen right behind the check-in counter. Look at all the fish!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img025.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img025" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img025_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Next, we went up to our new hotel room on the 5th floor. We opened the curtains and saw all the other hotels outside! The hotel that Daddy was going to for his conference was right across the street. It&#8217;s called the <em>Venetian</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img027.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img027" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img027_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>It was the afternoon, and it was time for Daddy to take a nap before dinner. After he woke up, we went with Henry to go across the street. On the way out, they saw some dolphin statues. Here&#8217;s Henry in front of the dolphins:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img028.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img028" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img028_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After they walked across the street to the Venetian, they saw a water fountain. Henry wanted to take a closer look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img029.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img029" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img029_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>There were also people floating around in gondolas. Henry wanted to have a ride:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img030.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img030" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img030_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Daddy and Henry went inside the Venetian. They saw lots of paintings on the ceiling!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img031.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img031" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img031_thumb.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p>
<p>Later, they went into a big indoor shopping mall. There were even gondolas inside! Henry wanted to say hello to the people!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img032.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img032" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img032_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Daddy was walking into the MIX conference when he saw a tiny model of the Venetian hotel. Henry wanted to take a closer look. Here&#8217;s Henry flying over the model of the Venetian! It looks like he&#8217;s a <em>giant</em> engine flying over the real hotel!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img033.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img033" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img033_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>When Henry got to the conference, he went to the MIX Sandbox area where he signed up to give his own talk about Ruby, Ruby, Ruby! Just kidding. It was really Daddy who was giving the talk!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img034.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img034" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img034_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Daddy and Henry were getting hungry. It was time for dinner! They went to a nice restaurant called <em>Canaletto</em>. Here&#8217;s Henry eating some oil:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img035.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img035" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img035_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Henry drinking some wine:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img038.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img038" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img038_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After a big dinner with lots of wine, it was time to go back to the hotel for sleepy time. The next morning when Henry woke up, he had to go and check his email at Mix:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img041.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img041" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img041_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After checking his email, he had to go and eat some breakfast. It was some bacon and eggs with mushrooms!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img042.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img042" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img042_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After breakfast it was time to watch the opening keynote. Here&#8217;s Henry watching Ray Ozzie give a talk about the future of Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img043.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img043" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img043_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>After watching the keynote from the overflow room (the place where trains had to watch the keynote because trains didn&#8217;t actually pay to go to the conference), it was time to go play in the MIX Sandbox. Henry had a big surprise at the Sandbox. He made some new friends. Here&#8217;s his new best friend, Roby the Robot (aka Channel 9 guy).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img085.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img085" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img085_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Henry had a lot of fun playing with Roby. It was a pretty busy day, and Henry decided that he needed to get a massage. OK it was really Daddy who needed to get a massage. But here&#8217;s Henry sitting on the massage chair after Daddy&#8217;s massage:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img086.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img086" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img086_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>It was time to go back to the Mirage to get ready to go out to see a show. On the way out of the Venetian, Henry stopped to have a drink in the fountain, and to listen to the man playing the accordion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img089.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img089" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img089_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>It was a fun show called <em>Mystere</em>. They don&#8217;t allow trains into the show, so Henry had to stay back at the hotel room to watch American Idol all by himself. He had a good time though.</p>
<p>The next day, Roby came over to play. Henry and Roby went outside to play in front of the Venetian. Here they are on a nice, sunny day:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img091.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img091" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img091_thumb.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p>
<p>When they went inside they saw the wheel of fortune game. Roby was too young to go into the casino, so we had to take a picture of Henry:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img092.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img092" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img092_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>We went over to Daddy&#8217;s talk about Ruby, here&#8217;s Henry getting the computer ready for the talk about Ruby:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img093.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img093" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img093_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>The talk was lots of fun &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t really a talk, it was a conversation with some nice people who really like Ruby. Henry and Roby worked up a real appetite listening to Daddy talk to the nice people. It was time for a snack. Lucky for them, there was lots of ice cream to go around!</p>

<p>It was time for dinner! Henry, Roby, Daddy and some of Daddy&#8217;s friends went out to eat at the <em>fin</em> Chinese restaurant in the Mirage.</p>

<p>It was time to go back to the hotel room so that Roby and Henry could watch Daddy hack on Dynamic Silverlight code. By the morning, Daddy had everything ready for his talk at MIX. Here&#8217;s Roby and Henry helping to hold up Daddy&#8217;s computer on stage just before his talk:</p>

<p>Once the talk was over, it was time to have some fun! Roby and Henry decided to go and play the Rock Band game. They didn&#8217;t do so good since they were really little and couldn&#8217;t play the really big instruments. But they did have fun watching other people play:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img097.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img097" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img097_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Roby and Henry realized that they were inside most of the time. They found out that the Mirage has a pool outside and that there was a big yellow thing in the sky called the sun. They went outside to have a few drinks by the pool. Here they are in front of the waterfall!</p>

<p>Now, a Las Vegas experience wouldn&#8217;t be complete without playing a hand of black jack:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img099.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img099" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img099_thumb.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> </p>
<p>Daddy and a few of his friends decided to go walking around Las Vegas. Where did they go first? The Sony Store, where Roby and Henry watched Ratatouille on the 52&#8243; LCD TV:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img101.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img101" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img101_thumb.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p>
<p>They also walked around Caesar&#8217;s Palace and had their picture taken in front of some of the big sculptures:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img102.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img102" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img102_thumb.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p>
<p>Finally, it was almost time to go home. There was one last picture that they took in front of the giant horse and dragon thing before they got on the plane to fly home to Seattle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img103.jpg"><img border="0" alt="img103" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/img103_thumb.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p>
<p>It was a fun trip. Henry had a great time. He made a new friend, Roby! But best of all, Henry was really happy to come home to see his most favorite boy in the world: Ben!</p>
<p>The End.</p>

<p>Last year I was involved in the keynote, so by the time it happened, I had heard it several times already. This year, I could just sit in the audience as a spectator. And wow, what a show!</p>
<p>Highlights from the <a href="http://visitmix.com/blogs/2008Sessions/KYN0801/">first keynote</a> for me were:</p>
<p>1. NBC Olympics demo. The whole picture-in-picture thing with live interactive stats was stunning. I&#8217;m hoping that Verizon gets FIOS to my house by the time the Olympics start &#8230;</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/">Hard Rock Cafe Memorabilia</a> app. The <strike>Seadragon</strike> Deep Zoom technology was amazingly well done. And nobody tops <a href="http://blogs.vertigo.com/personal/scott/Blog/default.aspx">Scott Stanfield</a> for meticulous demo preparation. Well done!</p>
<p>3. Aston Martin. Well, the demo was OK (and the cars are awesome), but <a href="http://www.carpages.co.uk/aston_martin/aston-martin-new-director-of-design-31-05-05.asp">Marek Reichman</a> from Aston Martin was awesome. He was totally &#8216;on message&#8217; about Aston Martin and the superlatives (and his accent) that he used to describe the car were priceless.</p>
<h3>The Ballmer / Kawasaki Show</h3>
<p>The second keynote was pure entertainment. <a href="http://visitmix.com/blogs/2008Sessions/KYN0802/">Guy Kawasaki and Steve Ballmer</a> put on a show to remember (apparently quite unlike the <a href="http://valleywag.com/365665/twitterati-lashes-out-at-interviewer-after-zuckerberg-keynote">Zuckerberg / Lacy show at SXSW</a>). There were lots of good-humored barbs traded back and forth and Ballmer gave as good as he got. It really presents Steve in a good light -both as a guy who can take a joke, as well as a guy who really understands the industry and knows how to set the direction for the company.</p>
<p>Highlights for me were:</p>
<p>1. Jab at the MacBook Air &#8220;being heavier than my PC&#8221; (27:20) and &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a bake-off between my Tosh and that thing backstage&#8221; (27:50).</p>
<p>2. Kawasaki&#8217;s suggestion that Apple is a chihuahua to Windows that Microsoft kicks away (along with Ballmer&#8217;s imitation of a chihuahua)</p>
<p>3. Steve&#8217;s revelation that he gets 60 pieces of email a day (with no human filters) and that he responds to them personally (or delegates to someone to follow up).</p>
<p>Of course, there was also a reprise of Monkey Boy that made the headlines as well.</p>
<h3>Introducing Dynamic Silverlight</h3>
<p>This year, our talk was on Friday morning. I&#8217;d much rather get talks over with earlier in a conference since it means that I can relax and enjoy the show but such is life. This year, we had a pretty ambitious agenda planned for our talk, and with the exception of the voices that I could hear from the PC on stage, it went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Here are some links to the talk that <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/blog/">Jimmy</a> and I gave this year. It&#8217;s available in a bunch of formats:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://visitmix.com/blogs/2008Sessions/T28/">Silverlight</a> player</p>
<p><a href="http://msstudios.vo.llnwd.net/o21/mix08/08_MP4s/T28.mp4">iPod formatted MP4</a> (57.6MB)</p>
<p><a href="http://msstudios.vo.llnwd.net/o21/mix08/08_WMVs/T28.wmv">WMV</a> for Zune (84.1MB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The slides are available online, but they&#8217;re largely content-free. The real meat of the talk is in our demos, and I wrote out those demos as a series of three blog posts:</p>
<p>Part 1: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">Hello, World! in Dynamic Silverlight</a></p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html">Managed JScript and flickr</a></p>
<p>Part 3: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-2.html">Integrating Silverlight with ASP.NET MVC</a>
<p>You&#8217;ll need the latest bits that we uploaded just after my talk to run these demos. You can download them <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/dynamic-silverlight.zip">from here</a>.</p></p>

                            							<p>We&#8217;ll finish off our tour of Dynamic Silverlight (DSL) by looking at how we can connect it with an ASP.NET MVC app. Building on our flickr photo search app from <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html">Part 2</a>, we&#8217;ll add support for saving links to your favorite photos to your MVC app. This is what the final app looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_15.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_14.png" width="500" height="425" /></a> </p>

<p><strong>Configuring ASP.NET MVC</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial shows Visual Studio integration so you&#8217;ll need to have the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio installed along with the Silverlight SDK. Let&#8217;s open up the solution in the demos\mvc_start sub-directory using Visual Studio. The first thing you should notice is how we&#8217;ve organized things in the project:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_16.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_15.png" width="253" height="444" /></a> </p>
<p>This is pretty much the standard ASP.NET MVC directory layout (I started from an ASP.NET MVC project); I added the App and Assets directories.</p>
<p>If you look at the App directory, you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve also added all of the DSL assemblies that are needed to run the app. Since we&#8217;re going to be running Chiron statically (eg zap everything in this directory) instead of dynamically (look in this directory and figure out what languages I&#8217;m using and then find and zap all of those files), those files <em>must</em> be in that directory.</p>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll make sure that Chiron is integrated into the build system. If you recall from <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">Part 1 of this series</a>, Chiron is our local web server that will automatically generate XAP files. Since we&#8217;re now going to be running using the ASP.NET Development Web Server, we&#8217;ll need to <strong>statically</strong> generate our XAP file. The good news is that it&#8217;s pretty easy to do this: you just need to add a post-build step to your project. The bad news is that you&#8217;ll need to build the project to run changes in your script files &#8211; just refreshing the page in the browser won&#8217;t do the trick. I know I&#8217;ve been caught by this once or twice while writing this app.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add the post-build step. Open your Project properties page, click on the Build Events tab, and add this string to your project:</p>
<p>$(ProjectDir)DynamicSilverlight\chiron.exe /d:$(ProjectDir)App /x:$(ProjectDir)App.xap. </p>
<p>It should look like this when you&#8217;re done: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_17.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_16.png" width="487" height="379" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice that there&#8217;s a DynamicSilverlight subdirectory which contains a local copy of Chiron. I did this so that this would be a self contained project. Once we work out the details of how we&#8217;ll setup the paths and ship Chiron as part of a DSL SDK, you won&#8217;t need the DynamicSilverlight directory. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need to make other change to the project file: enable Silverlight debugging on the client. Click on the Web tab in the project&#8217;s properties dialog and make sure you select the Silverlight checkbox under the Debuggers section: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_18.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_17.png" width="500" height="280" /></a> </p>
<p>Next, we have to generate the correct HTML to boot our Silverlight app. We&#8217;ll edit the code under Views\Home to add the Silverlight boostrap &lt;object&gt; tag to our MVC app: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_19.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_18.png" width="483" height="838" /></a> </p>
<p>If you build and run your solution, you should see the app start up in your browser. If you look at the file system, you should see that Visual Studio + Chiron has generated the App.xap file for you. </p>
<p><strong>Tour of the Ruby code</strong> </p>
<p>The Ruby code looks an awful lot like the JScript code from <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html">Part 2</a> except for the parts of the app that generate WPF. In the JScript code, we were generating XAML strings and injecting them into the page. But we can do much better in IronRuby <img src='http://iunknown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>We build up the WPF element tree for the photo and its border using this fragment of Ruby: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_20.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_19.png" width="493" height="364" /></a> </p>
<p>One of the reasons why programming with XAML is so easy is that the XAML parser does a lot of the heavy lifting involved in doing the proper <em>type conversions</em>. If you&#8217;re programming against WPF directly, you&#8217;re going to have to ensure that properties are assigned values of the correct type. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fair amount of code in Silverlight.rb that does property transformations. For example, take a look at the code that sets render_transform_origin: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_21.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_20.png" width="369" height="183" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice how we convert the Ruby array parameter into a WPF Point object before assigning to the property. Also notice how we&#8217;ve monkey-patched this behavior in the UIElement class, which is where the render_transform_origin property is introduced in the type hierarchy. All current and future descendents of UIElement will automatically inherit this behavior. </p>
<p>Another thing to point out is BounceAnimation. This is a class that encapsulates a WPF storyboard that knows how to generate the &#8216;bounce&#8217; effect that you&#8217;ll see when the photos appear (side note: I&#8217;m not really a Silverlight guy, I only play one on TV, and I&#8217;m too embarrassed to say just how long it took me to figure this out last year). If you look at the definition for BounceAnimation in Silverlight.rb, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s quite compact: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_22.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_21.png" width="485" height="770" /></a> </p>
<p>The other important thing to point out is that you now have a <em>named</em> animation. So you can now nicely encapsulate different animations, like Twirl or Zoom or Fade and simply apply them to your elements without having to copy and paste XAML. </p>
<p>While generating WPF trees using Ruby is more compact than generating them using XAML, there are other reasons why it is useful. Recall the code from Part 2 that loaded the images: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_23.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_22.png" width="492" height="301" /></a> </p>
<p>This code uses a grotesque hack to ensure that the WPF for the photo isn&#8217;t inserted into the scene <strong>until the image has finished loading. </strong>How does it do this? By loading the image <em>twice. </em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how we can elegantly solve this problem by programmatically loading the photo from flickr: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_24.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_23.png" width="363" height="215" /></a> </p>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re using the Silverlight WebClient API to <em>asynchronously </em>download the image. The open_read_async method initiates the download, and the open_read_completed event fires when the download is complete. The args.result property references a Silverlight Stream object which we pass to the set_source method of the Bitmap object (created earlier). Notice how we can use a Ruby closure to close over the bitmap object without resorting to passing it as a parameter to the event handler. Finally, we inject the canvas object into the scene, and tell Silverlight to begin playing the animation that we assigned to the scene. </p>
<p><strong>Posting back to MVC</strong> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add some additional functionality to the app. First, let&#8217;s add an event handler to each photo so that it sends the photo&#8217;s URI back to the MVC app when you click on it: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_25.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_24.png" width="485" height="228" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice that we&#8217;re just posting the URI back to the server. Let&#8217;s look at the ASP.NET MVC code that handles the HTTP GET request. This code lives in the Controllers\HomeController.cs file: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_26.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_25.png" width="485" height="161" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice how we&#8217;re just stuffing URLs into the ASP.NET Session object. It&#8217;s an exercise left to the reader to add user management and hook this up to a database to make this a real multi-user app. </p>
<p>Once the user has selected some favorites, we want to let them see their collection of favorite photos. First, we&#8217;ll need to add some code to our HomeController to display the view: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_27.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_26.png" width="497" height="104" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice how we&#8217;re adding our list of semi-colon separated URIs to our ViewData. </p>
<p>Next we&#8217;ll generate a new &lt;object&gt; tag that injects a list of favorites into the initParams property. We&#8217;ll need to add a Favorites view to our MVC project. Everything in Favorites.aspx is identical to the code that I showed you earlier for Index.aspx, except for the part where we set the initParams property: </p>
<p>&lt;param name=&quot;initParams&quot; <br />&nbsp; value=&quot;urls=&lt;%= ViewData[&quot;urls&quot;] %&gt;,debug=true,reportErrors=errorLocation&quot; /&gt; </p>
<p>Here, we retrieve our list of URIs from ViewData and inject it into the page.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll add a button that connects the UI on the client to the Favorites view. Open Views\Shared\Site.Master, and edit the code in there to add a Favorites button: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_28.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_27.png" width="410" height="211" /></a> </p>
<p>If you run the app now, you&#8217;ll be able to add photos to favorites, and look at your favorites. The solution is also in the zip file &#8211; look in the mvc_end sub-directory. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exercise left to the reader to improve the UI of the app so that favorite photos are selected when you click on them <img src='http://iunknown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>
<p>We saw how IronRuby can generate WPF scenes without using any XAML at all. The heavy lifting of doing the type conversions is done behind the scenes by the code in Silverlight.rb. We also saw how straightforward it is to add some Dynamic Silverlight code to an MVC app. It&#8217;s as simple as adding a post-build step and adding some the DSL files to a standard MVC project.</p>

                        <div class="entry">
                            
                            							<p>In <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">part 1 of this series</a>, we looked at how to build a simple Hello, World application using Dynamic Silverlight and IronRuby. In this part we&#8217;re going to build a more sophisticated application using Managed JScript, IronPython, Silverlight 2, and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">flickr API</a>. It lets you find the most interesting 5 photos for your search term using the flickr api:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/App.png"><img border="0" alt="App" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/App_thumb.png" width="500" height="291" /></a> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by walking through an existing JScript app that knows how to display flickr photos on the screen. Download the source code for this tutorial from here: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/files/demos.zip">Download demos.zip</a></p>
<p>Open a command prompt, navigate to the demos\flickr_start directory and startup the application using Chiron:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/chiron_start.png"><img border="0" alt="chiron_start" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/chiron_start_thumb.png" width="500" height="203" /></a> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look inside of app.xap, which was generated by Chiron:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/app.xap.png"><img border="0" alt="app.xap" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/app.xap_thumb.png" width="422" height="205" /></a> </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see that the assemblies for managed JScript, and Dynamic Silverlight (DSL) are in the xap, along with some Silverlight controls assemblies from the Silverlight SDK. The complete list of assemblies can be found in AppManifest.xaml:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_1.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb.png" width="500" height="353" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice that there is also an assembly called contract.dll &#8211; more on this assembly later.</p>
<p>This is a Managed JScript application, and execution begins in app.js.</p>
<p>In Silverlight 1.0 applications, you modified an existing scene by injecting XAML strings, much like how you would use innerHTML in the HTML DOM. In the next part of this tutorial, I will show you how you can do the same thing using just code (and it turns out to be considerably harder than just injecting strings).</p>
<p>The initial scene is defined by app.xaml:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_2.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_1.png" width="500" height="194" /></a> </p>
<p>This file shows off some cool new Silverlight 2 features. First, notice the two XML namespaces. The c and e namespace prefixes are mapped to types in the System.Windows.Controls, and System.Windows.Controls.Extended assemblies. These assemblies contain our new Silverlight Controls, which are available as part of the Silverlight SDK. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m also really pleased to see that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/03/05/silverlight-2-beta-1-controls-available-including-source-and-unit-tests.aspx">we&#8217;re releasing the source code for these controls</a> under the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/limitedpubliclicense.mspx">Microsoft Limited Public License</a>, as well as the test harness that Shawn&#8217;s team uses to test these controls. Awesome. We&#8217;re moving in the right direction folks, and <em>we&#8217;re not done yet</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/sburke/WindowsLiveWriter/Silverlight2Beta1ControlsAvailable_A5F1/image_2.png" width="500" height="354" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we&#8217;re using two simple controls: the WatermarkedTextBox (which makes it trivial to create a <em>Search</em> textbox a&#8217;la the search widget in all modern web browser), and the venerable Button.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the code in app.js to see what happens when you click on the Search button:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_3.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_2.png" width="398" height="243" /></a> </p>
<p>We bind a JScript anonymous method to the search_button control&#8217;s click event using a familiar (to C# developers) delegate-style binding syntax. Notice how we&#8217;re also using a JScript closure to bind to the App instance and the application&#8217;s root visual. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bit of magic going on in scene.search_text.Text. Here, we&#8217;re using a DLR feature called <em>member injectors</em>, to dynamically inject attributes onto the scene object. Next, let&#8217;s look at how we generate our flickr query:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_4.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_3.png" width="411" height="224" /></a> </p>
<p>Here, we initiate an asynchronous REST all to flickr. QUERY contains a scary flickr REST string that we&#8217;ll append our search term to. Notice how we again use an anonymous JScript method which functions as a closure to perform an action when the download is complete.</p>
<p>The OpenReadAsync method returns a .NET Stream object which we can pass to Silverlight&#8217;s built-in JSON serializer. This is where the fun begins <img src='http://iunknown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The original version of this application was written in IronRuby, and I didn&#8217;t have a working JSON deserializer handy. While Managed JScript can certainly use any of the widely available JavaScript JSON serialization libraries, I didn&#8217;t have this luxury in IronRuby. Instead, I used the built-in Silverlight JSON serializer. Unfortunately, this API is designed to be used from statically typed languages. Once we finish implementing the Ruby language, we&#8217;ll be able to use an off-the-shelf Ruby JSON serialization library. For the time being, however, let me describe the hack that lets you use the Silverlight JSON serializer from a dynamic language.</p>
<p>The inject_photo_list method creates an instance of the JSON serializer, and passes the QueryResults CLR type to its constructor. It then dots into QueryResults to retrieve the properties that we need to retrieve images from flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_5.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_4.png" width="477" height="304" /></a> </p>
<p>But where did QueryResults come from? At the top of the file, you&#8217;ll see this call:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_6.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_5.png" width="199" height="32" /></a> </p>
<p>Recall that we had a reference to contract.dll in AppManifest.xaml. This assembly contains the static definition of the JSON result set from flickr. The source for contract.cs can be found in lib\contract.cs. You&#8217;ll also find a build script that shows how to compile an assembly for Silverlight, assuming that the paths to the Silverlight SDK line up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_7.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_6.png" width="449" height="600" /></a> </p>
<p>The get_photo_url method generates the url that we&#8217;ll use to get each photo, and you can see how easily we can consume the C# type definitions from Managed JScript:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_8.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_7.png" width="438" height="86" /></a> </p>
<p>Finally, we generate the XAML for the photo in the BouncePhoto function:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_9.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_8.png" width="492" height="301" /></a> </p>
<p>Can anyone spot the grotesque hack in this example? This hack will be fixed in the next part of the tutorial. For the time being, however, it works <img src='http://iunknown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Mixing in a little Norvig</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you look carefully at the screenshot of the completed app, you&#8217;ll notice that the app suggested another spelling for &#8216;howse&#8217;. That suggestion was courtesy of Peter Norvig&#8217;s awesome <a href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">naive spell checker</a>. Here it is in its entirety (just 21 lines of Python 2.5 code):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_10.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_9.png" width="500" height="371" /></a> Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if we could just <strong><em>use </em>this code from our Managed JScript application? Let&#8217;s take a look at what we need to do to make it happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, we must add a reference to the IronPython assemblies to our AppManifest:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_11.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_10.png" width="404" height="48" /></a> </p>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll need to download Peter&#8217;s code, as well as <a href="http://norvig.com/big.txt">big.txt</a>, which is a 6MB &#8216;training file&#8217; containing about a million words that is used to train the spelling corrector. Both of these files will be added to our app directory, which means that they will be downloaded within the XAP file:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_12.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_11.png" width="493" height="293" /></a> </p>
<p>You might be wondering why we didn&#8217;t just download big.txt from the web. I chose not to because I didn&#8217;t want to modify Peter&#8217;s code at all. Files that are downloaded as part of the XAP can be read using the standard IronPython file I/O libraries.</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s look at what we need to do to access IronPython code from Managed JScript:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_13.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_12.png" width="388" height="96" /></a> </p>
<p>This code loads the managed spell.py module and stores a reference to the correct method. That method is invoked in the spell_check method, which also generates the UI for the suggestion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_14.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.iunknown.com/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb_13.png" width="463" height="505" /></a> </p>
<p>Managed JScript has very nice cross-language integration, which only requires loading the module and invoking it.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We took a look at Managed JScript as a language that you can use to write Silverlight apps in the browser. You can access the Silverlight libraries, as well as a custom C# assembly that contained the types we used in the Silverlight JSON serializer. Finally, we saw a nice example of integrating a piece of code directly off the Internet, written in a different language (Python) into your Dynamic Silverlight app.</p>
<p>In the next part of this series, we&#8217;ll take a look at integrating our application with ASP.NET MVC, and switching the language back to IronRuby on the client.</p>

                            							<p>Our team is happy to announce Dynamic Silverlight (DSL), which integrates our DLR dynamic languages with <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>. It requires Silverlight 2, which includes the cross-platform CLR and a set of libraries for rich graphics, media and web programming. It is packaged as a Silverlight extension, which means that it is downloaded in addition to Silverlight on an as-needed basis. </p>
<p>DSL has a runtime and an SDK component. The runtime consists of two assemblies: Microsoft.Scripting.dll, and Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll. You&#8217;ll also need the language assemblies, which are IronRuby.dll and IronRuby.Libraries.dll for Ruby and IronPython.dll and IronPython.Modules.dll for Python. The runtime component is a <em>small</em> additional download. Today, the IronRuby Silverlight runtime is just a <strong>712KB download</strong>, which takes less than 5 seconds to download over modern broadband.</p>
<p>There is also an SDK component to DSL. The piece of software that you&#8217;ll interact with the most is our local web server called <em>Chiron</em>. Created by John Messerly and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/">Dmitry Robsman</a>, it gives you a very nice interactive development experience using nothing more than your local file system. Let&#8217;s take a look at Chiron.[1]</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/dynamic-silverlight.zip">link to the download</a> of the Dynamic Silverlight SDK. The dsl.bat file can be found in the \bin directory of the SDK.</p>
<p>Open up a command prompt and ensure that Chiron is on your path:</p>
<p><a title="Chiron by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312058786/"><img height="500" alt="Chiron" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/2312058786_1480b77a73.jpg" width="432" /></a></p>
<p>Next, use our template generator to create a starter IronRuby Dynamic Silverlight project:</p>
<p><a title="DSL by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311248879/"><img height="197" alt="DSL" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2311248879_612c9630db_o.png" width="477" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;ve generated a set of starter files for you. To run this app, type chiron /b on your command prompt:</p>
<p><a title="StartChiron by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312058842/"><img height="349" alt="StartChiron" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2138/2312058842_243c71ce66.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This should bring up a browser window with the current directory&#8217;s contents displayed:</p>
<p><a title="Directory by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312058854/"><img height="235" alt="Directory" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2384/2312058854_b81eb6c749_o.png" width="453" /></a></p>
<p>If you click on the index.html file, you&#8217;ll see that the browser fetches a number of files from the server, and displays our Hello, World message:</p>
<p><a title="Hello IronRuby by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311248947/"><img height="189" alt="Hello IronRuby" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2311248947_8c1990bffb.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Xap Appears by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312058906/"><img height="187" alt="Xap Appears" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2248/2312058906_cde036104c.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Chiron prints a list of files that the browser requested. The interesting file is app.xap. This is the way we package Silverlight components for distribution. It&#8217;s just a ZIP file with a different name. To look at its contents, just point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:2060/app.xap">http://localhost:2060/app.xap</a>, and you&#8217;ll see that it contains:</p>
<p><a title="app.xap by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312058948/"><img height="301" alt="app.xap" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2312058948_b1d59e7d89_o.png" width="463" /></a></p>
<p>This illustrates what Chiron does: it <em>dynamically </em>packages everything that you need to run your DSL application into the XAP and serves it up to your browser. The core DSL runtime pieces and the IronRuby assemblies are in the file, along with all of the other files that we generated in our starter application.</p>
<p>Binaries are listed in the AppManifest.xaml file that Chiron generated for you. You can see how Silverlight 2 boots DSL when you open the file:</p>
<p><a title="AppManifest by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311249035/"><img height="218" alt="AppManifest" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/2311249035_f0aca845f2.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The EntryPointAssembly is the DSL &#8216;shim&#8217; that connects the DLR to Silverlight. The EntryPointType is the name of the type that Silverlight will run when it starts up. DynamicApplication derives from the Silverlight System.Windows.Application type, which defines the Startup event which is used to bootstrap the DLR.</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s look at index.html. The &lt;object&gt; tag is all that is needed to startup Silverlight. No more external JS files for folks who are familiar with the older Silverlight 1.1 Alpha. The source attribute points to app.xap, and initParams are used to pass initialization data to your program. </p>
<p><a title="ObjectTag by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311249057/"><img height="306" alt="ObjectTag" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2231/2311249057_2dc2fbc780.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the reportErrors = errorLocation parameter. This points to a &lt;div&gt; element that we generated for you. We use this &lt;div&gt; to report runtime errors and their stack traces to you.</p>
<p><a title="errorLocation by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311249067/"><img height="107" alt="errorLocation" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2125/2311249067_2b88769e81.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This element also has a dependency on error.css to define the formatting for the error messages. I think it&#8217;s pretty cool that we were able to use the extensibility mechanisms of Silverlight to inject custom DLR error message formatting into Silverlight.</p>
<p>Next, lets look at app.rb:</p>
<p><a title="App.rb by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2312059014/"><img height="224" alt="App.rb" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2312059014_5f89386b9b.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that we just run this script and inject our hello world message into the element tree defined by the XAML:</p>
<p><a title="App.Xaml by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311249103/"><img height="180" alt="App.Xaml" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2065/2311249103_9a723117d0.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little bit of magic in layout_root.message.text. The message XAML element is a child of the layout_root element. How does Ruby resolve these references? The answer is found in the required file, Silverlight.rb:</p>
<p><a title="Silverlight.rb by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2311249143/"><img height="331" alt="Silverlight.rb" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2311249143_b80b7d081b.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re adding a method_missing method to the FrameworkElement class and the SilverlightApplication class. So when we try to retrieve layout_root, it delegates to the SilverlightApplication&#8217;s implementation of method_missing. It dynamically invokes the target passed in m, which invokes the generic method_missing method in FrameworkElement. This gives a very natural feel for &#8216;dotting through&#8217; a set of contained XAML elements, which is largely made possible by the Ruby programming language.</p>
<p>I hope this post gives you a feel for what Silverlight programming from IronRuby looks like. In the next part of this series, we&#8217;ll look at how we can build a more sophisticated application that uses network stack, JSON, flickr, and some funky animation as well.</p>
<p><strong>[1] The fine print:</strong></p>
<p><del>There&#8217;s still some work that we have left to do before we can push the sources and bits out. The code is baked, but packaging this stuff still takes some time. Check back here on Friday, the day of my talk at MIX (you are going, right?), and you&#8217;ll have some bits that you can use to follow along with this tutorial</del>.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/dynamic-silverlight.zip">link to the download</a> of the Dynamic Silverlight SDK.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to have a working install of CRuby to run some of our utilities. I recommend the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">Ruby one-click installer for Windows</a>. This will be fixed in the next release of IronRuby.</p>

<p>We announced <a href="http://www.ironruby.net">IronRuby</a> almost one year ago at MIX. We&#8217;ve come a long way since then, and we&#8217;re <a href="https://content.visitmix.com/public/sessions.aspx">going back to MIX</a> to talk about where we are, where we&#8217;re going and how you can help. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had a lot of fantastic help from our community to get us to where we are today. Our early contributors, Curt Hagenlocher and Peter Bacon Darwin helped us kick start the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html">Open Source</a> phase of IronRuby. Our most recent contributor, <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/02/welcome-wayne-k.html">Wayne Kelly</a>, is helping us drive our libraries effort while the team was busy getting ready for MIX. And to cap things off, Huw and Dermot over at Sapphire on Steel have recently released their free <a href="http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-For-IronRuby">Personal Edition of Ruby in Steel for IronRuby</a>. </p>
<p>The team spent the past month working on <a href="http://silverlight.net/Default.aspx">Silverlight</a> integration. Yes, this means that you will be able to run Ruby in your browser in a safe security context. As of today, that means that you can run Ruby in your browser with just a 730K download (over and above Silverlight 2 which weighs in at around 4MB). Our Silverlight integration bits (and sources)will be available @ MIX once John Messerly works his magic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be @ MIX all week and would love to talk to folks who are interested in our work. I&#8217;m using MIX to try out my new Twitter account (john_lam); you can <a href="http://www.twitter.com">sign up</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/john_lam">&#8216;follow me&#8217;</a> on Twitter.</p>

If you like what you see in these talks, we&#8217;d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Our languages team is growing fast; we have <strong>five </strong>open positions as of today. We need devs for <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=7C2E33E8-5A9C-44F3-A1CE-DA2D66DC3C8B">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=8BEEE2C2-A95D-41C6-9075-CF6347EE07F1">IronPython</a> and F# and testers for <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=FF36A073-D1E8-49A9-B942-AFA4AB2B437E">IronRuby</a> and F# (the links to the F# jobs will appear soon). In the meantime, feel free to contact me (jflam at you-know-where) about any of these positions, and I&#8217;ll put you in touch with the right folks.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t do your job all by yourself. As <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/">Gretchen Rubin</a> says, one of the secrets of adulthood is &#8220;It&#8217;s okay to ask for help&#8221;.</p>
<p>Twice a year, folks from our offices around the world (collectively, &#8216;the field&#8217;) come to Seattle for TechReady. It&#8217;s an internal conference that the product groups use to help folks in the field do their jobs better.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I gave my &#8216;Why Ruby?&#8217; talk at TechReady. It tried to answer a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should you care?
<li>Why is Ruby interesting?
<li>Who is using it and were they successful?
<li>What is my team doing about it?
<li>What is our roadmap and how will we get there?
<li>Why is Open Source important to our future?</li>
</ul>
<p>To some folks who read my blog, the answers to these things are obvious. But remember, not everybody is you. Not everybody cares about the same things that you do. Reaching out to folks who don&#8217;t share your world view is a big part of how you can change the way things are today. And that&#8217;s a big part of what I do around here.</p>
<p>I got the most value from giving my talk when I spent some time hanging out with folks from my talk. Over some beers I had a chance to learn what folks in the field care about, how they get measured, and how we can help each other. Next time I give this talk, I&#8217;ll know exactly what to say. Talks are for your audience, and understanding what your audience cares about is the key to success. </p>

<p>*</p>
<p>I recently started re-reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins">Jeff Hawkins&#8217;</a> most excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1203000854&amp;sr=8-2">On Intelligence</a>. This is easily one of the best books that I&#8217;ve ever read. In it, he presents his model for human intelligence, which is based on what he calls a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-prediction_framework">memory-predictive framework</a>. Human brains can do complex things (like catching a ball) in about half a second. In that time, given the fact that a neuron takes 5ms to fire, your computation path is at best 100 steps long. His theory is that you don&#8217;t compute the solution, but instead you <em>recall</em> the solution. Jeff also has a company called <a href="http://www.numenta.com/">Numenta</a>, which implements this algorithm in software today, and there&#8217;s an SDK!</p>

                        <div class="entry">
                            
                            							<p>We live in a world where most of us say &#8216;thank you&#8217; using an email with a single word: &#8216;thanks&#8217;. I&#8217;m as guilty of this as the next guy. Yesterday I was reminded of the kind of world that we could live in.</p>
<p>When I got back to my office after a day&#8217;s worth of meetings in different places, I found a package on my desk. It was postmarked from London, Ontario, Canada. I looked at the name &#8211; it didn&#8217;t jump out at me. It was a fairly big, and moderately heavy package. I first thought hmmm &#8230; I&#8217;m not the kind of guy that a Unabomber-esque person would want to take out, right?</p>
<p>A quick search via Google jogged my memory. The sender was <a href="http://www.edwardog.net/">Edward Ocampo-Gooding</a>, one of the organizers of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> conference. I had met him at RubyConf, and he had sent me a mail out of the blue a few months ago asking for an introduction to <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a>. It took me maybe 30 seconds to fire off the email that introduced them to each other and I promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>Once I had confidence that the package wouldn&#8217;t blow up when I opened it, I looked inside. I found a small gift and a <em>hand-written letter</em>:</p>
<p><a title="Letter from Edward Ocampo-Gooding by John Lam, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/john_lam/2258093208/"><img height="500" alt="Letter from Edward Ocampo-Gooding" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2400/2258093208_162f59ae42.jpg" width="333" /></a></p>
<p>There was a link in the letter. When I clicked on <a href="http://www.edwardog.net/john-lam-is-the-man">the link</a>, this is what I saw:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2271/2224891925_b4d378419e.jpg" /></p>
<p>This was a really thoughtful and touching way to say thank-you. It says a lot about the character of this young man, and a reminder to the rest of us about how to treat others who help you out. I guess the way I&#8217;m thanking him is through this blog post <img src='http://iunknown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>BTW, I heard awesome things about the CUSEC conference this year from folks that I know personally: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001039.html">Jeff Atwood</a>, <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/conferences/cusec2008.html">Zed Shaw</a>, and <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/01/23/hacking-the-noosphere/">Jon</a> all wrote glowingly of their experiences.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Just the other day I was watching Randy Pausch&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5784740380335567758">Other Lecture&#8217;</a> on Time Management. Randy talks about the stack of blank thank-you cards that he keeps on his desk. He makes a point to hand-write thank-you notes to people who have helped him out. Not quite what Ed did for me, but an important thing to do nonetheless.</p>
