                <span id="Label1">Nick Kelsh's winning formula for creating the consistently top-ranking titles in his category? Simply put, Kelsh can teach anyone--with any kind of camera--to take great pictures, by showing how he takes his own great pictures.  <P>Kelsh presents more than 40 new picture-taking scenarios--the types that fill everyone's photo albums. Whether capturing milestones such as graduations or weddings, or the unexpected occurrence, such as a beautiful sunset or a pet in a funny pose, Kelsh's readers will learn to make images they can be proud of.  <P>Each spread addresses one photo idea, with simple techniques and tips explained using a "predictable amateur photo" compared to the same image improved by professional wisdom. A special 8-page gatefold demonstrates "how to photograph a vacation." These are the photo-ops of our daily lives and, mundane or special, they represent what everyone really wants to know: how to take a picture of a group of friends, how to photograph a private moment, and even how to take a good picture of something you want to sell on eBay.  <P>Special attention is paid to the growing number of people working with point-and-shoot digital cameras. Kelsh has photographed the entire book with one and he includes advice on how to use it as well as image storage for the digital family album.  <P>You've photographed Baby and Family. It's time for the rest of your life in <I>How to Photograph Your Life.</I></span>

                    <span>I enjoyed each moment reading this book. I plan to re-read it multiple times in future years. What makes this book really stand out is that it presents examples of what not to do (pictures that look "common") side-by-side with better ideas, presented using simple and touching text. The design and pictures make this a work of art. It is not about my camera; it is about me. I have been taking photos of my family over 30 years, and this book encouraged me. I want to get out and experiment even more.</span>

                    <span>This is the most practical book on photography I have read. And I have read many, many books over the years.<P>I would get lost in f/stops and shutter-speeds and light-meters and fiddle endlessly with my SLR camera. I bought this book after I had just sold my SLR and got my first digital camera, a Canon S50. My eyesight is not so good anymore and I wanted an easy to use point and shoot with some manual features.<P>After reading this book, I have been getting some pretty amazing pictures with my new digital camera. I shoot many, many pictures and come up close to the subject and a lot of the time, just turn off the flash. And the pictures that have resulted are the best I have ever taken (I love taking people-pictures).<P>Some 30 pictures I took recently of a little girl in a matter of about 45 minutes came out so good, her dad couldnt stop thanking me for the great pictures. To me only two of them were outstanding. Is this my new skill, am I now a terrific photographer? Pshaw ! I simply followed Nick Kelsh's advice and just came in close and shot many pictures. And some of them came out just great. Really !<P>I now have this book plus Kelsh's "Family" and "Baby" books. Enjoyed reading them and re-inforcing the advice so it becomes second-nature when I am using my camera. By the way, if you like shooting portraits, using window-light is absolutely the best way to go.</span>

                    <span>The focus of this book is creativity in photography for people who haven't done a lot of picture-taking. In addition to showcasing some simple concepts, this book gives creative ideas and suggestions for all kinds of challenging photography situations (birthday parties, family meetings, the list goes on). Kelsh's emphasis is on simplicity and ingenuity, and is guaranteed to transform your ho-hum snapshots into enlargement-worthy favorites.<P>This book has a few simple concepts that will revolutionize the way you take pictures (as well as the way you look at people). What could be simpler than the tips found in this book? We can all get closer, turn off the flash, take a lot of pictures (a few rolls at a time), and look at situations from unexpected perspectives. And yet, with just these basic tips, Nick Kelsh assures us that we will begin to take photos that will be treasured as instant classics.<P>Kelsh's tone is encouraging, conversational, and assuring. He is part-professional, part-everyphotographer. He is equally comfortable with portrait photography and snapshots. He avoids technical jargon and sticks with phrases we all like to imagine in connection with our own photos: "the envy of all your friends," "compliments on your photos," "people will ask you to photograph their children," and so on. <P>You'll love your first reading of it, and I bet it will become a favorite over time. I'm tempted to buy several copies to give to friends. So don't wait -- get it, read it, and start taking pictures of your loved ones! And check out ALL of Nick Kelsh's titles!</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up when I was considering teaching an amateur photography class at an outdoor retreat thinking I might get a few tips and some sample photos to show the class. What a surprise when I realized that this was the perfect, concise, easy-to-understand guide to taking great photographs with a basic, point-and-shoot digital camera! Kelsh is funny, easy to relate to, easy to understand, and obviously very good at what he does. I've since bought all of his books and have given copies of this one to my friends and family. If you like to take pictures, BUY THIS BOOK!!</span>
