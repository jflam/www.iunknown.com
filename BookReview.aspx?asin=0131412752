                    <span>This is one of the few books available that attempts to make sense of enterprise architecture (as opposed to the software architecture for individual information systems). It sets out to be a guide to the main themes in the field and largely succeeds in this aim.<P>The book provides well written, practical, accessible overviews of a number of topics important to enterprise architecture, including infrastructure architecture, software architecture, service oriented architecture, data architecture, product line architecture and architecture for the presentation tier, as well as a set of extensions to RUP (known as "EUP" - see http://www.enterpriseunifiedprocess.info) and sets of practices to help make architecture and modelling "agile".<P>There's a lot here of value and the book is one that's easy to recommend to those interested in developing into the role of enterprise architect.<P>The limitations of the book are probably inevitable, given its fundamental form (covering a wide range of topics and being written by six authors) but it does have some.<P>Each of the subjects covered is described in a single chapter, leading to a relatively shallow degree of explanation and you're often left with a lot of questions - particularly how to apply this knowledge. Having said this, the text provides plenty of suggestions for further reading to address this problem.<P>The wide range of subjects also leads to a certain degree of fragmentation, and the book could do with a stronger introduction to provide a "roadmap" to its content and to explain why these are the critical subjects to cover.<P>Finally, there is also a certain amount of variation in style and depth between the different subjects, a problem that is probably inevitable where six authors and ten subjects are involved. An example of this is where software product lines are really just introduced (with little guidance as to their application - which is actually quite tricky), while in contrast, the sections on agile modelling and SOA contain a lot of useful advice to guide their use.<P>These relatively minor gripes aside though, this is certainly a book to have on your bookshelf, if you are involved in the development of enterprise system architectures.<P>I'd also echo a previous reviewer's comment that the book is well produced, albeit with a few missing references.</span>

                    <span>Confused about getting your message across to the geek next door? Confused even about what (s)he does? Wonder why it takes six months to change the color of a button on a web page, or how to get data from one part of your business to another? Then this book is for you!<P>Enterprise Architecture is not going to make you into a developer (and why would you want to be one, in the first place? For the pizza and sugar-filled drinks?) but the book provides a congent explanation of the tasks that should go behind the development of enterprise-wide systems. This is of particular value if your work requires that you interact with architects and technical leads - you can gain a solid understanding of their concerns, the technical pressures with which they live, and their goals. <P>Of course, there's the caveat: the book describes ideal development, or at least what its authors believe to be ideal development of large-scale systems. Too many of my experiences have been in businesses that would have profited from their CTOs having read Enterprise Architecture - perhaps if more do, there will be fewer late nights!<P>I give this book 5 stars as a review, and as a value to the manager. Were I in the trenches, I might reconsider - the work concentrates on breadth, not depth. To the authors' credit, of course, they make that fairly clear from the start, and there are guidelines as to where to search for more. Who knows how long they'll last, or how long this book will remain current, but for now, it's the best book I've found on the subject, and instead of using it to prop up a shaky table, I have it as reference when I'm speaking to engineers by phone!</span>

                    <span>I have been waiting for a book like this for several years. There are many books on enterprise architecture that cover the Zachman framework and reiterate principles from SEI, but none that look at enterprise architecture from a practical perspective. This book provides a framework for thinking about how software development should occur within the enterprise and presents strategies and techniques for improving individual and team performance.</span>

                    <span>Overall I was impressed with the quality of this book. The authors took a fresh look at enterprise architecture as traditionally practiced. <P>I would only recommend this book if you are an experienced architect. If you don't have a few large-scale type projects under your belt, you won't think many of the suggestions are useful, applicable, or even necessary. If you do, though, reading this book will be well worth your time.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because Scott Ambler was listed as a coauthor. What I received is a book that is uneven in editing and content, and next to worthless as a "Practical Guide". There are some areas in the book that are worthwhile, but on the whole this book is out of touch with contemporary practices in enterprise architecture and how to approach it.<P>My advice is to avoid this book. A more realistic, realworld and practical approach to architecture can be found in "IT Architecture Toolkit" by Jane A. Carbone, ISBN 0131473794.</span>
