From its beginnings with President Roosevelt making a secret wartime flight in 1943 - to the historic flight that returned President Kennedy's body to Washington after his assassination - to the closing months of the Clinton administration, Air Force One takes you through the history of the world's most powerful plane. Features exclusive interviews with Presidents George W. Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter.</span>

                    <span>During President Clintons state visit to NZ last year nothing seemed to define the imperial US presidency more than his arrival in his personal jet-a modified boeing 747 no less.<BR>It was not so much the plane itself, grand as it was but also the preceding paraphenalia of accompanying aircraft bearing personal security and bulletproof limousines. The entire apparatus of presidential security was on the move. For every visible SS agent their were 4 in the background. Waiting and watching....for anything.<BR>Even The Queen is now relegated by her own government to the first class cabins of british airways, alas. Not to mention the mothballing of her private yacht. It says a lot for a nations head of state in what conveyance they choose to travel the globe. <P>I was impressed with the dedication and professionalism of the crew designated to work in AF1-although a certain servility is required their downright obsequiousness seemed to be a job requirement. From the captain even to the lowliest steward, to be seen and not heard. Do not speak unless spoken to. To some a reminder of the Nixon years.<BR>The obligatory escorted tour through a plane only a few are priveleged to see up close-the plush carpets the spacious interiors and conference rooms and secretarial offices echoed a businesslike atmosphere, and everywhere the presidential seal as if anyone would forget who the main passenger was. If it lacked the luxurious interiors and gold fittings of the Sultan of Brunei's own 747 no-one noticed. Besides such extravagance would seem garish and gaudy. The might of the US industrial military complex was enough to offset any hint of that.<BR>The brief history of previous presidential aircraft did seem to concentrate of the Kennedy years more so than those preceding and following, otherwise it was informative-showing us old newsreels of Eisenhower and Truman and even FDR's one overseas trip during the war-to Casablanca. The triumphant times-Nixons 1974 trip to China and the sad times.The familiar picture of LBJ taking the oath in the cabin of AF1-Jacqui and Lady bird beside him that sad day in Dallas so many years ago. <P>Finally we must spare a thought for Bill Clinton, now a private citizen who out of all the perks of office must have enjoyed this one the most, as any political leader would have. During his eventful 8 years in office the president seemed to be constantly filmed arriving somewhere in presidential state-stepping of alone as protocol dictated- with the familiar blue fusilage behind him like some imperial backdrop. I now sympathise with his current circumstances-Poor Bill travelling 1st class on a commercial airliner just isnt the same.</span>
