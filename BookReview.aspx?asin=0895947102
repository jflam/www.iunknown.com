                    <span>I am a humane educator at an animal shelter. I have read many a book about animal behavior in my line of work. This is by far THE BEST book I have ever read on cat behavior and I often recommend it to adopters and potential adoptors. It is now circulating around the shelter workers to keep them informed on how to counsil cat caregivers.</span>

                    <span>I've had this paperback for more than 4 years and its the my first source for dealing with feline problems - and with 11 cats disagreements do crop up from time to time.<P>While all the chapters make for fascinating reading, the chapter on the use of BACH FLOWER REMEDIES was outstanding. I had never heard of the Bach Flower Remedies but started using them after reading Pam Johnson's comments -- and with wonderful results. <P>A gem of a book - packed with kitty lore and sound advice on how to handle behavioral problems in a sympathic, understanding manner -- not to mention cats who are shy, agressive - introducing new pets -- you name it. Pam Johnson, you ROCK!</span>

                    <span>People without experience with cats often regard them as cold and aloof, but it's not true. Cats are sensitive and loving. They crave affection from you. They dote on routine, security, and comfort. Give them this, plus playtime with you each day, and you will have a cat that will love you. Unfortunately, cats can suffer trauma from past mistreatment, injury, terror at loud noises, or other unpleasant events. (Our cat hides behind me and peers out while the housekeeper runs the vacuum sweeper.) Cats suffer depression from loss of a family member, a move to a new home, or almost any change in the familiar routine. The author does a masterful job of showing us how to cope with a cat's traumas and develop a happy, purring cat. Our cat awarded five sniffs to this gold mine of information and advice.</span>

                    <span>As a Pet Sitter, I deal with kitty problems all the time. At Holiday Season, I buy this book for all my new clients. It is the best thing you can do for your cat and for yourself. Everyone appreciates how much they can learn from this little gem of a book; but mostly the cats benefit. They live longer, healthier and happier lives. As far as I am concerned Pam Johnson is the Cat's Meow.......</span>

                    <span>No matter how bad your cat is, the answer to your prayers is in this book. I learned so much about why my cat was being aggressive. The chapter on litter box problems was not only informative but fun to read. My friends have been so impressed with how well behaved my cat acts now. Every cat owner should have this book in their library.</span>
