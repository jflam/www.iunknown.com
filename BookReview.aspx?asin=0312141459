                    <span>Even if you are not an avid movie watcher,like I am, I'll bet there are a few lines from your favorites that have stayed with you. Heck, you may even use them in your everday conversations with others, and not even know that you're doing it. It happens naturally, without thought, or planning on your part. <P>Author Jai Nanda's What's That From?, celebrates some of most memorable movie lines in the history of the medium. The book is chock full of trivia, that not only asks where the lines originated from, but who said what as well. Like most trivia books some of the catagories have really easy questions, while others proved to be quite difficult, and I was forced to peek at the answer. The book works best when at a party or with friends. The book is divided into six sections and covers all of the classics-as well as some of the more obscure films of the last century.<P>Nanda provides an introduction; acknowledgements, and tips on how to use the book The book was published in 1996, I would say that, it's about time that someone publish a second edition. In the meantime, 192 page book is recommended for both film buffs, and the casual viewer alike. **** Stars</span>

                    <span>For many of us, the quoting of movies is second nature. We do it all the time, often without realizing it. And often times we know of movie quotes that are familiar even if we've never seen the movie. The book brings all of this to bloom in a wonderful book asking you to recognize quotes both general and specific to an actor, theme or movie. As the book progresses the quizzes become more difficult, and provide a real challenge to even a movie geek. Just the kind of book to have fun with some friends over a few beers. No lofty ambitions here, just a hope to make you think, and be entertained.</span>
