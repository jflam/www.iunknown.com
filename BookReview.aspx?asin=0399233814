                    <span>Aha!  I re-found the book I read no so long ago!  It's better than this one, because it was written by Seppala's good friend, Elizabeth Ricker.  It's from 1930.  It's called Seppala, Alaskan Dog Driver.  Yeah, I know, Togo is a children's book.  But personally, I prefer the longer books with more information and real photos packed into them.  In that case, it's Ms. Ricker's book for me!  But who am I to put down this book, if you or your kids like it?  Go buy it now!   </span>

                    <span>I once thought Balto (He is a hero too) was the hero of the Serum Run, but now, I know it's Togo.  All those brave dogs deserve recognition, but Togo's story deserves to be better-known.  Go, Togo!</span>

                    <span>I have read many accounts of all the dogs in the Great Serum Run, but this is definitely not in my top ten.  There are more pictures than dialogue, and it's intent is to 'glorify' one dog and leave the rest all out as if they had nothing to do with the serum run.  I think they all deserve credit for what they did.  I don't like Balto, nor Fritz, nor Togo above all the others; I liked them all, and i think they're all heroes.  I only wished the people would tell the actual story about the sacrifices that ALL the dogs made during those dark days in history, instead of singling out and 'glorifying' dogs like Balto, Togo, or Fritz.  That's why I hated the movie "Balto" so much.  And if they release "Togo" I would hate it just as much.    </span>

                    <span>Robert Blake does his homework, writes a beautiful story and even paints the illustrations in this beautiful children's book. Togo is a heart-rending story about the Siberian husky some folks believe was given short shrift after the Great Serum Race of 1925. Togo, his handler, Leonhard Seppala, and his team of brave sled dogs ran a total of 260 miles, farther than any team of dogs during the dramatic race against time to get diphtheria vaccine to Nome in January, 1925.
<br />
<br />The book includes a map of the trail that begins in Anchorage where the serum is loaded onto a train and taken to the end of the line in Nenana. There the dogsleds take over. Seppala and his team leave Nome headed for Nulato, 300 miles from Nome, where they are to pick up the serum and take it back to Nome. They race through a raging winter storm for three days. On the fourth day, they almost miss the musher they're to meet because Seppala can't see or hear in the storm.  However, Togo's ears shoot up, and Seppala finally hears the other musher's voice. Another team ends up taking the serum the last leg to Nome, and this is where the controversy begins.
<br />
<br />The other musher, Gunnar Kaasen, and his dog, Balto, owned and trained by Seppala, made the final leg of the journey, also with much difficulty. A hero's welcome awaited them in Nome, and Kaasen's and Balto's names became well known around the world. Togo gave his all to get the serum to Nome, and never raced again. Balto spent his last days at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, along with his sled mates, and a statue of him was erected in New York's Central Park.
<br />
<br />However one views the days after the race, it was nothing short of a miracle that the dogs and mushers of the great serum race covered the same distance in five days that it took the U.S. mail system 30 days to cover, and did so in the most horrendous weather conditions imaginable.
<br />
<br />Mr. Blake is also the award-winning author of the children's book, Akiak, about another great Iditarod husky. Also recommended: Balto and the Great Race by Elizabeth Cody Kimmel and The Great Serum Race by Debbie S. Miller.

                    <span>Look; I'm only here to fix some mistakes and typos in my other review, entitled, "Oh, Quit your Whining!"  First of all, when I said, "The staute in Central Park does say it's Balto," the actual thing was, "It does NOT say it was Balto!"  And, "Togo was not the only one who ran 91 miles in the frantic delivery.  His team helped him to pull the sled."
