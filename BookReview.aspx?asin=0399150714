                <span id="Label1">All the cycling world would love to know Lance Armstrong's training techniques and share in his incredible drive and personal will to win. Now, they-and any fan, reader, casual or dedicated cyclist-can learn all the invaluable training tips, state-of-the-art techniques, indispensable nutritional advice, and revelatory goal-setting and mental exercises that Lance and his personal coach have perfected during their four victories in the Tour de France. With photographs and illustrations throughout, Carmichael explains a step-by-step program to get you fit, fast, and on the road to becoming a champion in your own right. This is the must-have fitness/cycling book of the year.</span>

                    <span>Some of the reviews really dissed this book. I thought it was pretty good. I have read several others and would suggest Friel's book is the best overall, but I thought Carmichael did a better job of discussing the importance of aerobic base, raising threshold power, and focusing each period on developing a specific capacity. Interestingly, his method for raising threshold power seems much different than Morris (but similar to Friel, I think). He also presents some topics such as riding in a pack that Friel doesn't really cover. I guess his past as a pro comes in handy for this.
<br />
<br />The book sounds like it is going to be one long commercial at first, but don't worry too much, that does get better.
<br />
<br />It could use some better illustrations, charts, etc, but overall I thought it worth reading if you are interested in structured training.
<br />
<br />He has a couple interesting stories about training some of the pros, their experiences, and how they related to their subsequent seasons. He should write a book on this stuff someday. That would be an interesting read.</span>

                    <span>I figure if Chris Carmichael is coaching Lance Armstrong, then he probably has some worthwhile things to share with the rest of us wanna-bes.  If you have little or no understanding of cycling, training periodization, nutrition, tactics, or sports psychology, then you will definitely benefit from Carmichael's book.  For those of us with a little background in these topics, you will probably enjoy reading the book, but its unlikely that you will garner any new insights to bicycle training or racing.  I agree with my fellow raters - this book is an advertisement for Carmichael Training Systems (CTS).  If you want (can afford) a coach, don't bother buying the book - pay a coach.  I buy books so that I can learn enough to put together my own plan.  If you want to do that, I recommend Joe Friel's outstanding The Cyclist's Training Bible (fantastic training plan advice, emphasis on goals, periodization, nutrition, etc.)or Smart Cycling by Arnie Baker (great indoor trainer workouts).  Carmichael's book will make for good reading for any cycling buff, but you won't find out any "secrets" about Lance's program, and you will get more for your money with the other two books.  Plus who wants to pay for CTS advertisement??</span>

                    <span>The Ultimate Ride picks up and refines where a previous collaboration between Lance and Chris titled "The Lance Armstrong Performance Program - 7 Weeks to the Perfect Ride" left off. The Ultimate Ride provides enough detail in the areas of goal setting, proper training routines, nutrition, and overall bike and body awareness that I constantly pick it up and refer to it as a reference tool before and after a ride. If you have constant pain after a ride there is a chart in there to break down the causes of such pains. If you want to know how to eat and drink in preparation of a race or long ride or what is best to eat and drink for recovery after the ride, it is in there. If you want to learn to climb better, it is in there. Riders of all levels will find nuggets of information that will make them a better cyclist.</span>

                    <span>I would assume that most people who buy this book do so because they're looking to self-train themselves and need some guidance on how to do so. That, at least, is the reason I looked into it. Unfortunately, the Ultimate Ride is inadequate for such a purpose.<br>  Carmichael emphasizes that periodization is the best way to organize your training year. However, he gives you no advice on how to actually do this. He tells you its important, but doesn't get into the hows and whys of it. He gives examples of training months (4 total), but offers no insights on planning subsequent months, or on linking months together coherently. He tells you that you should gradually increase "workout stimulus" in a stairstep fashion, but doesn't describe how to actually do it.<br>  This is the biggest problem with Carmichael's book- he tends to tell you that things are important, but doesn't bother describing how to put them into practice. As a cyclist you already KNOW that these things- training principles, cycling techniques, skills, etc.- are important- that's why you bought the book to begin with! What you need to know is HOW to improve them. This is where Carmichael fails.<br>  I suspect this failure is intentional. The reviewer below who likened the book to an infomercial was spot-on. Carmichael is trying to sell his training program, CTS. The reason this book is so spotty is that he wants you to go out and join his program to get the answers and the training that this book leaves you hungry for. This is pretty shoddy business, if you ask me.<br>  I give it two stars because there is a smattering of helpful information, such as nutritional concerns and some good workouts. But much of the book consists of stuff you already know, or is filled with "Ra-ra-you-can-do-it-you're-the-champion-110-percent!!!" pop sports psychology that you could get from any junior high gym class. Extremely disappointing, can't even recommend it for absolute novices.</span>

                    <span>About 40% of this book presents the best written summary that I have seen on bicycling-related nutrition, physiology, tactics, and training.  The other 60% is an infomercial for the Carmichael Training System (CTS). The book presents its information in a very redundant fashion, frequently repeating the same points over and over.  For season veterans of bicycling who read a lot, you won't find too many new revelations to justify purchasing the book, however, the few that you do find may make it worth it.  For those who are newer to the sport and who want to improve, I'd recommend this book.  The best parts of this book are easy to read and have invaluable information.  Skim the other 60% unless you want to pay for CTS coaching and need to understand more about it.</span>
