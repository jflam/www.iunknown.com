                    <span>I chose this book out of the myriad of Dreamweaver MX instruction books because (a) it has practical exercises - I learn better by DOING, and (b) it has pictures/screen shots - I'm visual and need to see what someone else is doing in order to learn it.<P>The CD-rom that comes with the book contains files that you copy to your hard drive and use with each chapter of the book. <P>I'm very pleased with this book. My only complaint is that, as a newcomer, the book has taught me how to use Dreamweaver MX but I still don't grasp some of the concepts behind it. For instance, the book shows how to utilize Dreamweaver MX to produce your site, but I still don't comprehend the "assembly line" concept of spitting out pages. I understand what templates and libraries are, but since the book concentrates on preassembled examples I don't really have an idea of how to start my own site from scratch. <P>This is not a big complaint. I've learned so much from the book anyway, and find it very clear in its instructions.</span>

                    <span>... I am an experienced website designer but I've been using Homesite editor and want to ramp up quickly in Dreamweaver MX. I've opened and tried using Dreamweaver before, but I didn't like the interface. Now I know I have to tackle it ...<P>"Dreamweaver MX Unleashed" seemed to cover the basics, if you are already familiar with web design. This is not a beginners book. Half the book is more advanced and gets into programming. I think I saw some .NET stuff in there. I would consider it after being more comfortable with Dreamweaver and also wanting to advance beyond design into web development...<P>So, "Hands On Training" (H.O.T.) is the book I'm buying today. .. It comes with a CD which says it contains the software (I have no idea if it is a trial version or if you have to buy a license, or what). The CD also contains other helpful files, including some training videos you can watch on your computer--they said they included these little videos for some of the concepts/tasks that are harder to explain in print. And, one of the things that sold me was in comparing the first chapter. There is a little bit of hand-holding, but immediately I saw the value in that. H.O.T. pointed out that when you open Dreamweaver for the first time, you are asked to choose one of three interface layouts, one of which is similar to Homesite (perfect for me). I would not have known that if I had bought the "Visual QuickStart Guide" because the reference to this feature was much more obscure. I figure there must be more good tips that H.O.T. will give me up front, instead of me digging for them or being completely unaware.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for my wife for her birthday, as she is now designing sites for my web design company. I also work in conjunction with teams of people on web sites as the project manager, and in IT rolls, working with numerous programs. I decided to take a look at it the first time waiting for a dance recital to start. I couldn't have bought her a better book.<P>I have worked in Dreamweaver since version 2 and bought several books for the program, but this book is the best! In fact, it's the best technical book that I have for learning programs. It's got an incredible organization. I have tapped into it myself to catch up on some of the new features that I would have otherwise missed since I do these things in other programs. <P>This book gives you everything you need to know to produce an awesome web site, and it does it in a fresh way. You don't feel like you're looking at a technical book, and you can sense that the writers have a passion for what they are doing. Did I say organization? I know I have but I had to say it again. Great book, can't beat it.</span>

                    <span>When I first started website design, I coded everything by hand. But it seemed like most of the web developers that I spoke with were using or converting to Dreamweaver. Not wanting to fall behind, I downloaded a free trial from Macromedia and was totally lost and discouraged. I bought this book out of desperation and boy was I happy that I did. I couldn't believe how easy it was to use Dreamweaver and how better my sites looked. This book takes you through lessons step by step with wonderful examples and clear instructions. It's so fun and easy to read you don't get bored. I stayed up so many nights because I couldn't put the book down. The CD-ROM includes all the files as well as trial versions of Dreamweaver and Fireworks. <P>Because of this book I learned how to use Dreamweaver and Fireworks within couple of days. I have created 3 different professional sites within 2 weeks. Now I'm more confident and ready to tackle other projects. <P>I wish that college programming courses were taught like this instead of those boring and unuseful lectures and labs. <BR>When they came out with Dreamweaver 2004 and Flash 2004 books, I bought them instantly without any hesitation. Only thing that I wish is that they had more advanced topics in these books. However, my prayers have been answered! They are coming out with Better and Beyond books which will cover some of the advanced topics. I can't wait!</span>

                    <span>If you're running System X on a Mac G3 machine, than this is the book for you, assuming of course you've upgraded from Dreamweaver 4 to MX. If you haven't than you certainly should think about doing so.<P>Others have said it, and I'll second the motion, this "Hands-On Training" book should have been the one to come with the official program. Garo Green and Lynda Weinman from lynda.com assume you have only limited knowledge of how your Mac works. No knowledge of HTML is required. If you can work your mouse, you're ready to go. You'll be designing your first website in no time at all. This one gets two thumbs up.</span>
