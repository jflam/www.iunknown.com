                <span id="Label1">This first book from Chicago author Chris Ware is a pleasantly-decorated view at a lonely and emotionally-impaired "everyman" (Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth), who is provided, at age 36, the opportunity to meet his father for the first time. An improvisatory romance which gingerly deports itself between 1890's Chicago and 1980's small town Michigan, the reader is helped along by thousands of colored illustrations and diagrams, which, when read rapidly in sequence, provide a convincing illusion of life and movement. The bulk of the work is supported by fold-out instructions, an index, paper cut-outs, and a brief apology, all of which concrete to form a rich portrait of a man stunted by a paralyzing fear of being disliked.</span>

                    <span>It's hard to put to words what Chris Ware has done with this book. The sheer amount of energy and dedication alone is overwhelming, the detail is lavish. The story on its surface seems shallow, but the power of this work is in the details.<P>What I loved most about this book is the black humor. I was amazed at tangents Ware arrives at, the little mini-dreams Jimmy Corrigan dreams.<P>The true measure of an artist is his ability to make the difficult look easy, and this must be said of Ware. Some of the art is actually breathtaking. I found myself just staring at the pictures, wondering where it all came from.<P>In his Afterword, Ware calculates that the time it took for him to read his own book (5 hours) to the amount of time he spent with his father. <P>5 hours well spent, I suppose.</span>

                    <span>I read Chris Ware's comics in New City when I was living in Chicago--curiously at first--who are all of these odd adults with potato-shaped heads and elderly-looking children? But I became addicted to the story where, well, not much happens at all. And I guess it's kind of the point, capturing the aloneness and awkwardness that takes up so much of our time.<P>This book is just beautiful--I had to stop reading several times to just marvel at the meticulously detailed panels (he had to have been drawing nonstop for years to get so many pages of ultra-precise art), and to take a rest from the overall story, which at times is so right on with it's depiction of loneliness and rejection that it just breaks your heart. A good breather: unfold the dustjacket, on which Ware has drawn out the origins and relationships of the characters, a clever and amusing twist on the "family tree" that sometimes serves as an appendix for other multi-generational epics.<P>I've been looking for a Chris Ware book for years--and Jimmy Corrigan has exceeded my expectations.</span>

                    <span>Years from now, people won't remember that the graphic novel was once a marginal format, consigned to hobby shops and newsstands. Literary historians, however, will point to Chris Ware's Jimmy Corrigan as the book that brought graphic novels out of the dark and into the cultural spotlight.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Ware does an amazing job of creating one of the most moving graphic novels I have ever read. The painstakingly detailed drawings add an unparalleled scope to this novel following the meek Jimmy Corrigan, as well as the 1893 story arc following his equally downtrodden grandfather of the same name. The dream tangents are vivid and beautiful, and only occasionally introduced before hand ("I allowed myself to luxoriate in one of my favorite semi-conscious conceits"). Do yourselves a favor and READ THIS NOVEL RIGHT NOW!</span>
