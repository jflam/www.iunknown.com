                    <span>This Book is just a monolithic reference that I used for a class. Don't try and learn from it.<p>The PMP exam is not as hard as you think; yes it is high pressure, time wise. It has primarily 2 types of questions. 1 is memory recall. 2. Is testing your experience, that is to say how do you respond to a given situation, what is your rational or judgment? And every question is tied directly or indirectly to the PMBOOK. Read it Twice. I used The PMBOOK with a book written in narrative style chapter for chapter against the PMBOOK. It's called "Information Technology Project Management" by Kathy Schwalbe. It has some simple IT examples that most business people can understand after all Project Management is irrelevant to industry. And The Project Manager (person) is not. Also Parts of the book  "Project Management: The Managerial Process" by Clifford F. Gray.  For Scope, Time, Cost, and Risk. The cheapest and "good" situational questioner (with explanations and references to the PMBOOK) and memory jogger (two products) come from ESI international, do a search on the web for company info; the author is J. Leroy Ward. These two books again are mapped directly to the PMBOOK. Use your experience, Intuition and smarts to answer the questions. Memories all economic formulas. Sleep tight and then go do the exam</span>

                    <span>I had to use this book for a project management class.  I can safely say that everyone taking the course dislikes this book.  I could see this being used as a reference later on after one has a good foundation built in project management but as for someone looking to break in to the subject, without someone who is experienced in PMP standing over you explaining the confusing charts and graphs, this book would bore someone to the point that the rewards of project management aren't worth the torture of having to read this book.</span>

                    <span>I am a 2nd-year MBA student taking a course in Project Management, and this is the required text for the course.  The professor insists that this is the preferred text for PM courses at other universities, but everyone in the class (the professor included) is thoroughly unimpressed by this book.<p>The first half of the book focuses largely on soft skills, and is mainly a rehash of the topics covered in a basic organizational behavior class, or even a psychology or sociology class.  The material covered is very dry and very repetitive, and is almost entirely solid text, with few diagrams to illustrate the points of the discussion.  The author also makes excessive use of verbose bulleted lists.  Normally, I appreciate bulleted lists as an easy to read, concise way of conveying information, but this author often composes each bullet point as its own paragraph.  Such an approach defeats the purpose of using bullets in the first place.<p>The second half of the text does improve somewhat over the first half.  It begins an explanation of the more tangible aspects of project management, including the creation of work breakdown structures, scheduling projects, making budget projections, and applying techniques to keep a project on track.  However, the style of writing is still quite thick, and makes for a slow read.<p>As of now, I have limited exposure to project management, and I have read no other books to which I can compare this one.  However, I would be surprised if there isn't a better book on the market.  Kerzner's book will eventually give you the information you're seeking, but you'll have to work hard to get there, and you'll need to wade through a lot of excess to get to the real meat of the topic.</span>

                    <span>If you have questions on any aspect of Project Management, this is the book to consult.  From organizational behavior and structure to planning, scheduling and controlling processes vital to the successful practice of project management.  Most of the vital issues are discussed in a thorough, thoughtful way.<p>If the book has a weakness, it is in the area of Integration - in my mind, the most difficult section of the PMP exam.  The book is not only written as an undergraduate and graduate students, but also functional and senior managers.  Its structure reveals the author's apparent belief that the practice of project management is more behavioral than quantitative.<p>His first five chapters lay the foundation for an understanding of project management principles.  Chapters 6 through 8 deal with support functions of conflict and time management; chapters 9 and 10 deal with management support.  Quantitative approaches to planning, time, cost and performance are developed in Chapters 11 to 15.  Chapter 16 deals discusses trade-offs.  The balance of the book deals with advanced topic and future trends. <p>If your budget limits you to the purchase of one project management, this is the one to own.</span>

                    <span>Several people I have talked to seem to have mixed feelings about this book. Most never get past the first few pages in the book and many are afraid not to have this book prominently displayed on their desks. The latter is to avoid someone mistaking them for a junior project manager. <p>The best way to review this monumental book on project management is to list the most common arguments for and against the book.<p>The book presents comprehensive knowledge of project management that you can substitute only by purchasing several books on the subject by other authors. Dr. Harold Kerzner is also one of the most respected experts on Project Management. Dr. Kerzner now has several companion books to supplement this main text book. One area that the book was considered lacking in the past was  with regards to case studies. You can now buy his latest book that is dedicated to covering just case studies. The writing style is extremely easy to read and follow. Once you read his explanation on any topic, you will find that it is hard to disagree with him because his explanations are very compelling. <p>The reasons many people have disliked the book - the book is too boring to read, it is too long a book, it is a compilation of bullet lists, there are not enough case studies (or problems/exercises), etc. I can't say anything about the first complaint because it is actually true but if you are in the middle of a project and have a burning question, I can promise you that is isn't so boring to pull up the relevant section in the book and find a reasonable explanation to your question. The book is very long because it is an exhaustive treatment of the Project Management field. There is no reason to read it in one sitting. Regarding being a compilation of bullet lists, it does seem that way. But when you have been in project management for a while and have an appreciation for the difficulty of the field, the lists don't get in the way. The author has enough explanations surrounding the bullet lists that I never found them annoying. To address the complaints regarding case studies, problems/exercises, there is now a book dedicated to case studies and I believe there have always been workbooks that he authored which contained more problems/exercises. <p>A good approach to follow regarding the usage of this book is to buy it early on in your career but stop after reading just the first few chapters. As you are gaining experience and have been exposed to a majority of the project management field, it is time to refer to this book more often. I have followed the book through several editions over the years and looked up various topics as questions popped up in my mind while going through a project. I am yet to finish the whole book (this is my 7th year reading the various editions of his book) after all these years but I didn't expect to. It is a great reference book and I have been using it as one.<p>There are better books to read on project management if you looking for a quick overview. 'The Little Black Book of Project Management' by Michael Thomsett comes to mind along with 'Project Management - Planning and Control' by Rory Burke. If you are looking for help with the PMP preparation, I highly recommend 'PMP Exam Prep' by Rita Mulcahy. Read my review on her book for more detailed information on taking the exam.<p>IIL offers several Project Management classes that are taught by excellent instructors if you like what you read in this book and are looking for more of the same. A copy is given out as part of the class materials (for some of their classes). I hope you benefit from reading this book as much as I did and thanks for your patience. This is indeed a difficult book to review.</span>
