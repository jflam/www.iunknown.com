                    <span>This is a great all around prep book for visiting Basque country.  I then took it with me on my trip.....and everywhere I went in San Sebastian, Bilbao, etc people said: 'Oh, yes.....Kurlansky is far and away the best book about Basque country.'  Any questions?</span>

                    <span>for most parts of the book Kurlansky does give vvv interesting information on the Basques, their laguage, culture and their aspirations and mindset.... the book portrays the world through the eyes of the Basque people.... however is not a history on the Basques per se....</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book until I reached the last chapters. 
<br />
<br />These last chapters (20th century) offer a very biased account of Spanish and Basque history. Misrepresentations range from mere embellishments about Basque contributions, to suspicious omissions (e.g. the most unpopular actions of the Basque ETA are not mentioned), to outright falsehoods, even about facts that can be easily checked online (e.g. the results of the Spanish Constitutional referendum of 1978 in Catalonia and Galicia, Maastricht and the EU, and so on in a long list).
<br />
<br />All in all, I am disappointed because a case for Basque independence can be made without resorting to falsehoods. If you are really interested in Spanish and Basque history in the 20th century I suggest Raymond Carr and Paul Preston, both of them recommended by Kurlansky in the appendix (I wonder if he ever read their books).
<br />
<br />Another anecdote that bothered me is his account of Elcano's role in the mutiny against Magellan. Grab Bergreen's "Over the Edge of the World" for a truthful and well documented account of the event.</span>

                    <span>I read The Basque History of the World about one year ago. I had been asked a few times about Spanish history, and found myself quite ashamed not to know more. So I decided to grab a couple of books.
<br />
<br />My boyfriend and I read it together by night, and although it is quite catchy, and easy to read because of Kurlansky's love for Basque culture, it is amazingly biased. Kurlansky is definitely not a historian, and although it never claims to be history, I wonder what to think about someone who does not give any of his sources.
<br />
<br />The book is at the same time quite confusing. I knew the story -not the details or dates-, but my boyfriend got lost frequently.
<br />
<br />If what you want is an easy-reading, then this may be your book. Kurlansky is higly partial, and his history of events is rather incomplete, so in my opinion, it should never be used as a reference.</span>

                    <span>You hear about Basques in newspapers all the time:  ussually about some violent situation attributed to them.  What you don't hear in the 10pm news is what these people have done for humanity, and how the good Basques have to pay up for the violence and errors made by the few ill behaved ones.  Mark Kurlansky fixes that.<p>The Author correlates the history of this little understood/known group of people, and how they have iteracted with neighboring countries, and how they have helped shape the world as we know it today.<p>Great history book, and entertaining as well.  Now I must read "Salt" and "Cod".</span>
