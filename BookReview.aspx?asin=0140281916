                    <span>This book is by far the best business reference book i read in a long while. Its negotiations theory is supported by psychological research which make sense and help you remember why the offered techniques are useful. The fascinating real life anecdotes help clarify the theory and make this book a fun read. For those who are looking for a serious book and a tool to handle different negotiation situations successfully, I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I really like the subject of negotiation. As a matter of fact we all negotiate, I'm an engineer and I negotiate all day: with marketing, with manufacturing, with suppliers. I needed some key concepts to bring with me in every negotiation. I knew I was naturally doing something good and something bad in every negotiation and I needed to become more reliable.<br>This book gave lots of good inputs, starting from my favourite: know your style. I now realised how, being almost a natural "compromiser" or "problem solver", I need to improve in those negotiations where stakes matter more than relationship. A very interesting book for people who want to be more effective and want to analyze their own behaviour in day to day negotiations.</span>

                    <span>This book is an improvement on what "Getting to Yes" tries to achieve.  It is much more descriptive of the mechanisms of negotiation, with often three or four stories, as opposed to one for each topic in "Getting to Yes".  It breaks down negotiation into four parts (Preparation, Information Exchange, Bargain, and Settlement), and goes into each in depth, with many stories (the most I have seen in a negotiation book, which I appreciate).  Also tackles the negotiation process from the standpoint of people who are very competitive and from the standpoint fo people that are non-confrontational, which I found useful as well.</span>

                    <span>G. Richard Shell's book on negotiation was my first read on the topic, aside from a little Dorling Kindersley guide. This is not a book to teach you how to be a cutthroat or hardball negotiator, it is a book designed to help YOU get the best solution every time.<p>The author is to be commended for a number of achievements in this book. First, the writing was excellent -- easy to read, yet not simplistic; interesting enough that I actually enjoyed it; and extremely well organized. Unlike maky other books, the anecdotes are both interesting and well-used to illustrate his points.<p>Second, the author presents guidance on a wide range of issues. One section helps you identify your bargaining style and then gives you suggestions on how to maximize its effectiveness. Another offers advice on how your strategy should change based on the relationship (or lack thereof) between the two parties. This book is not just for MBAs; it's for all people, since everyone negotiates in various forms with everyone else. <p>Third, the book achieves an excellent balance between theory and practice. Shell refers to numerous psychology and economics experiments to describe the ideas beneath the negotiation process, but he also gives real-world advice on how to put these ideas to work.<p>Finally, a section on ethics is included which, although enlightening enough to provide a basic knowledge of legal, moral, and practical implications of various bargaining strategies, is really only a primer to a much larger topic. <p>Again, this was a truly excellent book, especially for anyone looking for a first read on the topic.</span>

                    <span>I've recently completed a Masters degree with a dissertation comparing authentic to simulated sales negotiations from a linguistic point of view. My research reading was limited not only to publications in the field of linguistics, but also general `business' books as well. On the whole I find this latter category somewhat lacking in rigour and prone to a glibness of language and analysis that is at best irritating. Shell's book, Bargaining For Advantage is one of the finest exceptions to this trend I have come across in many years and I recommend it to anyone wishing to improve their negotiation skills, or to negotiation trainers like myself, always on the lookout for new insights and serious analyses.</span>
