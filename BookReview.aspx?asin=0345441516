                <span id="Label1"><b>&#8220;Forget the edge of your seat. <i>Last Breath</i> takes you to the edge of your life, for a pulse-pounding glimpse into the Great Beyond. There are many ways to risk your life in the out-of-doors, and Stark has captured them in exquisite and harrowing detail.&#8221; <br>&#8211;JIM ROBBINS<br>   Author of <i>A Symphony in the Brain<br></i></b><br>An enthralling blend of adventure and science, <i>Last Breath</i> re-creates in heart-stopping detail what happens to our bodies and our minds in the perilous last moments of life when an extreme adventure goes awry. <br><b><br></b>Combining the adrenaline high of extreme sports with the startling facts of physiological reality, veteran travel and outdoor sports writer Peter Stark narrates a series of adventure stories in which thrill can cross the line to mortal peril. Each death or brush with death is at once a suspense story, a cautionary tale, and a medical thriller. Will they survive, or will they succumb? Readers will shiver with a man lost in the snowy woods, suffering from hypothermia and tearsing off his clothes as he&#8217;s burning up from the cold; they will hallucinate with a young woman stranded at the top of Annapurna as she experiences a cerebral edema; and while a kayaker tumbles helplessly underwater for two minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, readers, too, will gasp for their last breath.</span>

                    <span>This book is entertaining, but many times follows a very cliche pattern of speech and character. The first thing that the consumer must know is that these stories are FICTIONAL and based off of several accounts that the author received from friends and interviews. Somehow the information presented packs less of a punch with the knowledge that the stories are not true. Also, I could not help but get the sense that the author was trying to impress me with his outdoors saavy (he repeatedly trumpeted his talent as a backcountry skiier and kayaker and such) and his misguided word usage. The medical information is sometimes informative and other times very cloudy and vague. Stark's attempt to mix medical fact with fiction is a bit akward. Do NOT look to this book for survival skills! At best, it provides a small window into human physiology.<P>Overall, this book is a fun and fast read, but not worth adding to your library.</span>

                    <span>Last Breath is a book that strives to be at once emotionally compelling and supremely factual. Or something. I don't see any evidence that it is trying very hard. Last Breath falls short in both aspects; the story telling is abysmal and its factual segments are at best dumbed-down, at worst outright wrong. Stark relies too much on proximity to death as a way to affect the reader: having blunt emotional trauma on his side, he spurns all aspects of good writing, and in this I include original metaphor, realistic characters, engaging writing style, and the junior-high rule (which still applies) of not using the same word twice in one sentence. All of the characters in Last Breath are alotted (at most) two traits: first, a piggish whininess and, second, a generic characteristic intended to generate sympathy. In several stories, Stark holds the families of his protagonists hostage in order to bully us, the readers, into craving a happy ending. Poor Jeremy! What will become of his little daughter? It made me want a lobotomy. The narrative, dull and cliche-ridden, lurches back and forth between the ordeals of irritating protagonists and a mishmash of anecdote and diluted physiological fact. In trying not to write over the heads of his audience, Stark oversimplifies and introduces ambiguity into everything that he tries to explain. Furthermore, neither he NOR his editor can be trusted as credible, having let slip the following statement, which is significantly contradictory of actual fact: "This is because [cardiac muscle] contains negative ions- certain types of atoms that are missing electrons." The most readable parts of Last Breath are the largely unaltered stories and anecdotes, not difficult to find in their original contexts, that Stark has gathered from others. In the end, this book does not convey any deeper understanding of death, and, in its attempts to marry the realms of fact and fiction, it lacks merit in either. I feel stupider for having read this.</span>

It's an edge of your seat book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is involved in sports of any kind. It really makes you think. Highly recommended!!!</span>
