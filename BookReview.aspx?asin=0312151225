                    <span>Having read all the wonderful reviews on this book reveals us a blessed lot. Ms Dening is truly gifted in her understanding of the ways I Ching is supposedly intepreted and she has no parallel when it comes to accuracy. Reading the wisdom made so simple and logical by the author is almost like having a celestial dialogue with the I Ching Sage himself. Like many, I have had studied this ancient wisdom for more than 10 years and read many books on this art, but truly, Ms Dening is THE authority for its accuracy and subtle messages. <p>Her book has NEVER been wrong in the advice dispensed for the path set and I am always grateful to have this friend looking out for me. There was one time I "disobeyed" the advice and out of self pride, I made a serious mistake in deciding on an investment that truly turned bad (as the I Ching had predicted against all odds).I really paid the price for my own foolishness and am still paying for it now. I have had since apologised to it's essence and reverted back to respecting the accuracy and wisdom without doubt.<p>If you really want to know what actions to take or to hold, or how to approach problems in the best ways possible, or even know whether the climate is right for investments, then start a friendship with this "bible"...you will be a changed person and a better one for it. Good luck.</span>

                    <span>The book has a nice layout and is easy to understand for a new user of the I Ching.  I first checked this book out from the public library, but after three renewals (and my husband also interested) I knew it was a book I  wanted in my personal library.  I find it very useful in bringing to light  aspects of a situation that I had not noticed before.</span>

                    <span>I've used many I Ching books and I've settled on two that I find most useful.  I first burrow through the exhaustive and incredible oracular translation by Ritsema/Karcher to stretch my own ability to contact the oracle to get very specific feedback.  It's then refreshing and quite revealing to then use the Everyday I Ching as it so easy and readable and accurate.</span>

                    <span>I've been using the I Ching for twenty years and have to say this is the most insightful book I've read on it in that time.  It's ideal for anyone who might have felt put off by the often arcane concepts of the I Ching but would also be very useful for seasoned users who will find Sarah Dening's insights add depth to the traditional text.  It fulfils its title perfectly: an ideal companion for everyday use with the I Ching.</span>
