                    <span>I thought this book was very well written and very easy to read, but it is for the absolute beginner. If you know how to use your camera to take photos in differnt lighting situations (you know when to use your flash) then i think you would find that you are abit beyond this book. </span>

                    <span>I had spent many hours in the book stores reading and looking over digital photography "How to" books. When I happened on David Huss's book it did not take me very long to realize that this was the book I had been looking for. Easily read. Honest advice. Many "Digital Photography" books devote large sections to photo editing programs. Well how about getting a handle on how to take satisfactory digital pictures first. Only the last two chapters out of a total of 20 chapters are devoted to photo editing. More than enough for the average "point and shoot" person. If you find the manual which was provided with your digital camera daunting and confusing with a very long and steep learning curve, get this book. You will be doing yourself a big favor and you will be glad you did.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great resource for someone looking to learn more about digital photography.  It is especially helpful if you have a camera that is more than just a "point and shoot" and can change your settings manually.  The chapters are very well organized by topic and are filled with professional tips for getting the most out of your camera.  Everything is explained in language that an inexperienced photographer can understand, and the text is accompanied by many full-color illustrations.  While many other books that purport to be overviews of digital photography devote a lot of pages to "post-processing" images with software (like Adobe Photoshop), this book focuses almost entirely on the art of composing and taking good pictures.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for my son, who is new to digital photography. After receiving the book, I quickly realized that it would be a superb single-volume resource for all persons interested in digital photography, whether newcomers or more experienced professionals. So, I immediately ordered a second copy for my own use.  The book is well-organized and packed with helpful hints, notes and warnings.  The reader can quickly locate a topic of particular interest and find numerous photo images which portray the finer points of digital photography.  At the same time, the novice will find the text very readable, user-friendly and easy to follow.</span>
