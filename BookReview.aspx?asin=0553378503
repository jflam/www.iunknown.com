                <span id="Label1">In the tradition of <B>The Snow Leopard</B>, <B>Circling the Sacred Mountain</B> is a remarkable account of spiritual adventure through the magical and forbidding landscape of remote western Tibet. A promise of spiritual transformation inspired Robert Thurman-renowned Buddhist scholar, teacher, and close friend of the Dalai Lama-to take a group of trekkers to Mount Kailash, the holiest of Himalayan mountains, and teach them an accelerated path of Tibetan Buddhism. Among the group was a former student and longtime friend, Tad Wise, who struggles with Thurman's teachings as much as with the rigors of high altitude. Together, they take us through an ominous border crossing to sites few Westerners have seen: sacred graveyards, majestic monasteries, and the meditation caves of ancient masters. Chronicling the inner as well as the outer journey, confrontations both physical and metaphysical, <B>Circling the Sacred Mountain</B> is an exciting account of a challenging journey towards enlightenment.</span>

                    <span>This book was an exhilarating reading experience. With Tad Wise's descriptions of the scenery and Robert Thurman's vivid teachings, I felt as if I was there with them learning and experiencing everything. Their journey was long and storied and well presented. Seeing the experience from two sides, the teacher (Thurman) and the student (Wise) give a wide view of this country and its religion. Wise's antidotes add the human side to the experience. It shows how even you can achieve these great things. I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates journeys, religion, or even just a good true story. Thurman and Wise's account make the trek memorable.</span>

                    <span>When I purchased this book, i was trepiditious about Mr wises particpation. After all.Mr thurman is an acknowledged authority on tibetan buddhism,a friend of hh dalai lama,and wise is a alcoholic,trying to come to grips with his life. well, thank God for mr wises input in this Book1 It made it readable, and somewaht enjoyable.Mr Thurman comes off as a bullying professor,another self important gasbag who has spent too much time in academia.I have no doubt that he is a sincere buddhist,though what comes off here is a longwinded,pedantic bore.The cloak and dagger bit is a little much,though I am sure his fans will eat it up[will the chinese catch me at the border,etc.]The chinese come off rather brutally ,especially in regard to the compassion esposed throughout this book. For the truest of true believers,though Mr wises is entertaining, engaging and I'd travel with him anytime. Just leave Mr thurman home with a mirror and tape recorder.please.</span>

                    <span>This book, I suppose, could be read by one of two groups of people. First: it could be read by the New Age Hippie traveller types looking for an intreguing story about a man travelling. I more approve of this kind of reading..... Tad Wise part of the story is told with humor and warm feeling.... The second, more Buddhafied group, looking to Prof. Thruman as a kind of guru, is not going to get enough here. Bad Dharma. Too little. <P>Perhaps, if one was going to read his sermons with a couple of other books, one could get a good understanding of something. It when accompanied by Wise's prose is fairly... um, enlightening....<P>I'm afraid that lots of people are going to miss that though.... If the two journeys are disconnected, the book goes to become mediocre..... keep that in mind!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is a miracle. It joins the opposites of the deepest teachings with human weaknesses, the highest revelations with guides to daily practices, all in a setting of great natural majesty. The bravery of the Tibetan people as they live under Chinese oppression shines through. I am reading the book for a second time now.</span>

                    <span>A terrific book! Thurman's lectures on Tantric Buddhism are fascinating, and they are counterpointed well by Wise's narration of the trek to Kalias, his own failings and fears, and his relationship to his teacher. Thurman is (as always) enlightening and impressive, and Wise's story is wonderful in that he is "only" human, too-- it makes the path toward enlightenment seem possible for the rest of us! Also, it's a great book about an exciting trek to the backcountry of Tibet. A wonderful book!!</span>
