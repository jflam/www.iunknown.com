                <span id="Label1">Young wizard-in-training Harry Potter has had his hands full during his  first four years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As if studying  spells and pleasing professors isn't enough, Harry has heard evil voices in the  walls, rescued petrified students, fended off convicts escaped from wizards'  prison, and played elaborate and grueling games of Quidditch. Between school  sessions, he summers with the horrendous Dursleys, who seem to want nothing more  than to crush our hero's spirit. Only time will tell how Harry will manage the  certain dangers and escapades in store for him over the next few years.<p>  The first four titles of J.K. Rowling's phenomenally popular series are now  available--in paperback--in a handy boxed set, perfect for the legions of  children whose big brothers and sisters have made off with their copies. These  adventures are surely on the road to becoming classics; don't wait to collect  them! The set includes <I>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</I>, <I>Harry  Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</I>, <I>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of  Azkaban</I>, and <I>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</I>. (Ages 9 and older)</span>

                    <span> It's Harry Potter, what can I say?  It's the series that got kids reading again.  Everyone knows the plot.  A boy wizard named Harry grew up with his cruel muggle (non-magic) aunt and uncle after his parents were killed in a car crash. At the age of 11 he's informed that he's a wizard, and that an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents and very nearly killed him.  His aunt and uncle dissaproved of the world of magic and tried to keep everything a secret from Harry.  He's taken away to live at a castle called Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards where he befriends the studious, proper Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasly, a poor boy who lives in the shadow of his brothers Charlie, Percy, Bill, and Fred and George.  In book 1, Harry arrives at Hogwarts and finds that someone there is secretly trying to destroy him and is hiding a VERY big secret from the rest of the school.
<br />
<br /> In book 2, an unknown assailant is attacking students and everyone thinks Harry's doing it.  We learn that no less than THREE characters are not what they seem.  We are also introduced to Ron's younger sister Ginny, who has a crush on Harry.
<br />
<br /> In book 3, a murderous madman is on the loose and seems to be coming after Harry. But who, exactly is he?  And the very LAST character you'd ever suspect of being evil reveals his true self.
<br />
<br /> In book 4, Harry is enrolled in the Triwizard Tournament, where three different magical schools select students to compete in daring, dangerous tests of school.  Harry also attends the Quidditch world cup with the Weasleys and has a frightening run in with Voldemort and his servant in a graveyard.  One character is tragically killed (I actually cried) at Voldemort's hand.
<br />
<br /> Book 4 is probably my favorite, along with 1, but there's really no such thing as a bad Harry Potter book.  The movies are fantastic as well, and the sixth book is due out in a few months.  </span>

                    <span>These books are the best I've ever read.  I'm 25 years old and I find myself anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.After each book you really feel as though you've spent a school year with these characters.They are a must read for any fantasy fan.Surely these books will go down in history as classic works of great fiction.The author truly understands how to develop characters, you will find yourself genuinely caring about what happens to them.Congratulations to the author for creating a series that has been, and I'm sure will continue to be enjoyed by millions around the world.</span>

                    <span> i think that harry potter is a great book series and i think that it is very well witten. I love jk rowlings imagination, and i think that anybody who criticizes this book series is just jealous becasue their brains are heavy and dead and they are sorry that they couldnt think of anything to write about that would make them rich! So I deeply admire jk rowling and all her work!! Whn i read her books she makes me look 'outside the box' and into a world of fun and imagination where anything can come true! Also, as a young writer she encourages me to do better!</span>
