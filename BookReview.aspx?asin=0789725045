                <span id="Label1">XML books are a dime a dozen, but many are quite tedious in the  way they methodically step through all of the various standards. Que's  Example series helps you learn by doing with countless examples that  build your knowledge through hands-on experience. <I>XML by Example</I>  covers an impressive amount of material in relatively little space,  providing critical XML knowledge using a reader-friendly format.<p>This  second edition has been updated to cover the latest and greatest  features of the ever-evolving XML standard. It includes coverage of the  final XML Schemas recommendation and the latest developments of XSL.   The book is quite suitable for anyone with basic HTML knowledge.<p>The  book steps its way through all the key topics--namespaces, models,  transformations, formatting, etc.--with a style that keeps you engaged  in what each topic looks like in real code, versus in theory. Plenty of  notes and cautions highlight important points and pitfalls. There is an  excellent presentation of how XML can be used to render formatted HTML  using Cascading Style Sheets and XSL--one of the first areas many  developers want to tackle when wading into the XML universe.<p>Advanced  topics such as SOAP and three-tier architectures are presented, albeit  only at a level of detail sufficient to familiarize you with the  concepts. <I>XML by Example</I> is an excellent place to start to learn  XML and a strong preparatory text for more extensive reading on the  subject. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I read the first 6 chapters of the book in 12 hours then I stopped and gave up from it, because I got lost and confused, and I feel like I need much more than that to know what's there in the XML world, well the book name is learn by example but actually it is not that, it is "get confused by examples", the examples are so easy to look at but after reading them and read the little tiny bit explanation about them if any, you don't know what is going on there and don't know what is the point, don't know why we want to do that, why we need that from the first place ??
<br />I'm not a new programmer but I just started learning XML and I really don't need a book from the very beginning but still I grabbed this book because I thought It will get me somewhere by practicing with the examples,
<br />there isn't enough examples showing clarity
<br />After that I started reading XML Bible 2nd addition, it has a lot of information and it has a lot more details about each topic compared to this book but still difficult to read and has lots of Errata !!!.
<br />I'm still looking for a book in XML that makes me really understand Schemas, namespaces, XSL, and XSLT, Xlink, relations between them and CSS,
<br />I'm using xmlSpy, and there you will find everything there regarding XML and how to make XSL, XSD, Schemas and DTD then the XML files and XSL and XSLT which really need to understand how they all work together but you find nothing about them in XML by example book, I'm not saying the book should explain xmlSpy but you have to know all these technologies to work on XML project.
<br />I couldn't give this book 2 stars because I can't recommend it to anyone. I can't understand why others can give it 5 stars, I don't believe they can do something with xml just by reading this book!!!
<br />In the end if you think you want to start with this book then don't, read w3c.School and get all the definition for XML technologies then get a much more detailed book for it which I'm still looking for.</span>

                    <span>I have read around 200 pages of this book, usually while traveling. I think the best thing about the book is, it's so easy to read. Its certainly informative and laid out in very simple language with simple examples. Good for beginners or for developers lost reading Heavy XML books. I unsuccessfully tried reading "XML Bible" before I bought this book. Although there are other great books that might go in more details, but if you are a beginner XML developer or manager, this could be a good starting point.</span>
