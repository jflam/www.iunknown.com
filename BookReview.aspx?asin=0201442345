                <span id="Label1">Multithreading--dividing an application into multiple independent streams of execution--is a powerful but potentially intimidating programming technique. <b>Multithreading Applications in Win32: The Complete Guide to Threads</b> teaches you how to build multithreaded applications step by step, starting with simple examples and gradually introducing complicating factors and the Win32 APIs you'll need to deal with them. After you've mastered the basic concepts, you'll learn exactly how to implement multithreading applications using C, C++, and MFC, plus specific applications of multithreading on the Win32 platform. The entire book maintains a conversational tone that helps make potentially complex topics understandable.  </span>

                    <span>It's old, and the sample code has some flaws, but the text is so damn clear that this book is a must buy. Nothing important is skimped, nothing is confused, nothing is concealed behind excess verbage. Both the Windows threading api and the deeper principles behind designing threaded apps are dealt with more than competently. A star taken away for some buggy sample code, but a star added for wrting clearly about threading, an area that's notoriusly hard to write about or explain well.</span>

                    <span>This is a very focused book.  I found it a good companion book to other Windows programming books.  It doesn't try to go into areas outside of it's scope like discussing MFC programming or C++ programming.  If you want to know about threads and how to program using the WIn32 threading model then get this book.</span>

                    <span>I have to say that this is a good book as other reviewers have said.<p>But I have to point out that there are some inconsistent parts in the book. I've tried to find errota on Addison Wesley's web site with no success. <p>1. Chapter 7, Data Consistency, Sample code "readwrit" which didn't give the consistent results if running the program several times. If letting the sample search pNode in the following text, it will give  0, 1, 2 findings from time to time, it never gives 5. It gives me the impression that multithreading has no accuracy in the beginning. // start here *  pList, pNode *  pNode, pNode *  Demonstrates an implementation of the *  Readers/Writers algorithm. This version *  pList, pNode *  pList, pNode *  pList, pNode // end here<p>2. Chapter 2, the source code shown on book (p63) is not correct as the threads (hThrds[slot]) were not closed. The file on CD is correct.<p>3. Building DLLs as given in p306. The authors pointed it out themselves that the sample code is not a DLL. For a novice, how can you expect him/her to generate correct codes? They need every possible source to figure out their problems. In fact I have a great pain when I read this part as this is exactly what I need. Maybe it will cost authors only several hours at most, but it'll cost readers weeks.<p>4. There are some other printing errors.<p>Although pointed above, I still like the book. It does provide extensive topics regarding to multi threading and many concise samples. You cannot find these from Petzold's or Prosise's books (They are excellent in general). Read this book with Jeffrey Richter's Advanced Windows (3rd Ed) will help readers to understand more about Win32 programming.<p>I would have rated this book 4.5 stars if amazon had had the level.</span>

                    <span>This book has been essential for writing our multi-threading, commercial  apps. The material begins by providing an explanation for why threads are  useful, and follows with a thorough explanation of how to synchronise the  activities of many threads. Synchronisation is perhaps the biggest obstacle  to producing a working multi-threaded app. I found the most useful chapter  to be 10: Threads in MFC. This shows how to create worker threads, derived  from CWinThread, instead of calling AfxBeginThread(). This allows you to  design classes that represent your threads in a more object-oriented way.  The book is clearly typeset, with good explanations of both good technique  and the common mistakes that can easily be made when starting out. The FAQ  section also helped with common problems that turned up.<p>I recommend a  good understanding of C++ to get the most out of this book, though this  isn't essential.<p>In my opinion, this is *the* book for understanding the  theory and practice involved in Multithreaded apps for Win 32. Fortunately,  I found this book before writing any multi-threaded apps and I cannot  recommend it enough!</span>
