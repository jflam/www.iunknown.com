                <span id="Label1">To describe <I>Touching the Void</I> as a mountaineering documentary would be to do this breathtaking drama an injustice. By intercutting narration from the climbers themselves with a nail-biting reconstruction of their remarkable adventure in the Peruvian Andes, the film has the best of both genres: the authentic stamp of factual storytelling and the edge-of-the-seat tension of a dramatic movie. <p>  In 1985, two British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, embarked on a daring--arguably reckless in the extreme--attempt to climb the previously unconquered mountain Siula Grande. A mixture of overconfidence in their own abilities and underestimation of the climb's difficulties brought them to grief after the successful slog to the summit. What follows is an often harrowing account of their perilous descent. <p>  Based on Joe Simpson's gripping book, the film boasts glorious widescreen photography of Siula Grande and its notorious glacier. Actors take the place of the two climbers for close-ups, though Simpson did return to Peru in order to reenact parts of his dreadful crawl back down the ice. The story of Simpson's almost-superhuman fortitude has become legendary in climbing circles, and even for viewers uninterested in mountaineering, <I>Touching the Void</I> is an astonishing slice of real-life drama, magnificently retold. <I>--Mark Walker</I></span>

                    <span>There are few documentaries that can truly take your breath away and "Touching The Void" is a masterpiece. The true story of British mountain climbers of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates balances story telling, suspense and brilliant photography without falling down. Their decision to be the first climbers of Peru's Siula Grande via an arguably unapproachable ascent blends bravery and madness. What got these arrogant climbers into trouble? What happened on that mountain when both 'knew' they would die? How could either of them survive? Most intriguing is how could a man locked in a deep lightless crevasse with a severely broken leg get miles down the mountain and glacier? It's all told with interviews with both climbers spliced in between truly remarkable cinematography. The panoramic views and the treachery of the mountains weather are captured like no other film has done before. It is a nail-biter.<P>The extras are wonderful as well. How this film was made is another exercise in major accomplishments and "Return to Siula Grande" is startling when trying to understand these two men's emotions after such an ordeal. They both were tested on their personal beliefs in God and mortality. Their conclusions will surprise you. It was clearly the event of their lives. Recorded in Dolby 5.1, the sound adds a level of realism unlike most films.</span>

                    <span>Back in 1985, two young British climbers traveling through Peru, decided to tackle the west face of Siula Grande, an 21,000-foot, unclimbed peak of the Peruvian Andes. Joe Simpson and Simon Yates make the ascent with relatively little problems. On the fourth day, as they methodically work their way down, Joe stumbles and breaks his leg. Instead of leaving him, Simon works out a way to start lowering his companion slowly and steadily, using a combination of both their ropes. He unknowingly lowers him over a 300-foot crevasse. With no way for Joe to climb up and the snow quickly slipping away from beneath him, Simon makes a decision to cut the rope.<P>What follows in "Touching the Void" is the story of both mens' struggles to make it back to their base camp. Simon, assuming that his friend is dead, slowly trudges down the glacier, suffering from terrible guilt over what happened. Joe, not knowing if Simon is still alive, must find a way out of the crevasse, even with the terrible pain coming from his broken leg. This is a remarkable documentary from director Kevin MacDonald, based upon the book by Joe Simpson. Full of dizzying visuals, you really have the sense that you are with both the climbers during their ordeal, not just physically but, thanks to some unique camera work, mentally, as well. What's most astonishing, though, is that this is a true story. You start to forget that for a moment while watching, then Joe or Simon appears on the screen to narrate and to explain their emotions at the time. An incredible film.</span>

                    <span>"Touching the Void" is a partly re-enacted documentary of a climb of the western face of the Siula Grande in Peru in 1985. The details of the climb make for a fine and gripping film.<P>The brief details of the climb of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is that their ascent is relatively straight forward despite the mountain being more technically difficult than they had expected. It on the descent that problems really began. Firstly and, obviously, critically, Simpson slipped on an ice ledge and smashed right leg. The only piece of good fortune being that no bone penetrated the skin. It was thus left to Yates to assist his partner to the base camp. <P>At this point, matters deteriorated further when Yates was forced to cut their connecting rope when Simpson had fallen over a cliff and was in danger of dragging his partner with him. Yates then proceeded to climb down having realistically left Simpson for dead. However, by a combination of luck and supreme courage, Simpson too made the descent but in a truly battered state. He had, for example, lost one third of his body weight!<P>Upon the climbers return to their native England, Yates was apparently criticised for cutting Yates loose. Simpson never joined this criticism but only praised Yates for his efforts.<P>The film is a re-enactment of the heroism of the two climbers. It outlines to all that mountain climbing is a dangerous past time that only the foolish and/or the brave can contemplate. The film should be seen by all if only for the wonderful telling of a story of heroism within a vast, magnificent and unforgiving landscape.</span>

                    <span>Watching TOUCHING THE VOID, I was reminded of the dangers that face Real Men. This was after I chipped a nail while opening a can of non-alcoholic brew. But, at least my Mommie was sympathetic.<P>In 1985, two twenty-something Brits, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, endeavored to climb the 21,000 foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Climbing successfully to the top was easy compared to getting back down, during which Simpson falls off an ice wall driving a shin bone up through the kneecap and splitting his femur. The only good news is that the skin wasn't broken. As Simon subsequently struggles to get the two of them back off the peak, cruel bad luck and circumstance contrive to pitch Joe into a crevasse. Thinking his friend dead, Simon staggers into base camp and prepares to return home. In the meantime, Simpson, still alive, must either go it alone or face certain death from exhaustion and dehydration. Being "between a rock and a hard place" takes on new meaning.<P>Since this pseudo-documentary begins with interviews with the real Simon and Joe, the audience knows from the start that the latter lives. But that fact doesn't detract from the nail-biting nature of this superb depiction of dogged perseverance and survival recreated by the climbers' own words paired with a brilliant re-enactment of the story both in Peru and in the Alps in which Nicholas Aaron stars as Simon and Brendan Mackey as Joe. The visual link between the four is seamless because the actors are beat-up and sun and wind-burned to the point of being unrecognizable anyway. The climbing scenes, filmed by Kevin Macdonald at night and during storms as necessary to remain true to the story, are perhaps some of the best you'll ever see.<P>The only other film that comes to mind which gives real-life testimony to Man's remarkable ability to survive against the most terrible of Nature's odds is the THE ENDURANCE (2002), a brilliant chronicle of Ernest Shackleton's doomed 1914-1916 expedition to the South Pole.<P>My easy chair and the trashy novels I read for vicarious thrills have never looked so inviting.</span>

                    <span>"Touching the Void" is indeed a remarkable story of survival. Joe Simpson's ordeal is vividly recaptured by director Kevin McDonald. McDonald's rather straightforward style, with the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates recounting their harrowing experience climbing, and then descending, the beautiful but brutal, Suila Grande, in the Peruvian Andes, works well here. If there is hole in this story, and I think there is, it's in Simpson himself. He's one cold fish, so it's hard to work up a real measure of empathy. You half expect him to quote Nietzsche at some point. No doubt he would tell you this bleak attitude toward life and death is what kept him going. Maybe, but you get the sense that this heroic effort is being told by a mechanical man - and he was that way before Simpson cut the rope. The only time I really felt for Simpson, was when he fell into delirium, and was plagued with memories of a bad song. It's only then that his control slips, and seems human at last.</span>
