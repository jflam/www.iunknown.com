                <span id="Label1">This colorful book celebrating fifty years of America's most prominent sports magazine  is certainly more practical than hoarding 2,500 issues. The six-part book plays to the strength of the magazine: "The Stories" and "The Photographs" sections are the largest. The 35 articles are truncated, often just whetting your appetite for more. The companion book <I>Fifty Years of Great Writing</I> offers many of these in their full glory. On the other hand, the pictures are often bigger than they were in the magazine (or could ever have been with the smaller size). Lose minutes staring at Michael Jordan or Walter Payton frozen in midair. Examine the juxtaposition of a close play at the plate with the bizarre styles of a 60s women's track team. Try not to be swept away at a shot of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain defining basketball. If you have picked up the special issues released during <I>SI's</I> anniversary year, you already seen a decent portion of this book. The notable new writing is Richard Hoffer's essay about the world (both sports and at large) when the magazine began in 1954 and senior editor Frank Deford's pitch-perfect introduction about why the magazine is special and how it grew up in the age of television. The section most folks will spend their coffee table moments is "The Covers," a listing of the entire magazine's cover images, both in chronological order and grouped in similar topics (Scandals, Presidents, Deja Vu). Punctuated by the best sport quotes, <I>SI's</I> "Signs of the Apocalypse," fascinating lists of athletes and teams that were on the cover the most times, and other sport tidbits through the ages, this area is sure to launch a thousand sport memories. Yes, all the swimsuit covers are in one place, too. One quibble: why is their "Sports Person of the Year" in the book not the same as their well-known "Sportsman of the Year?" <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>What a treasure! I got this coffee-table for my nephews (15 and 13) and my own son (13) for Christmas, and all gift-unwrapping immediately halted while they looked through the book. "Wow!" "Oh man, look at that!" etc. while they looked at the incredible collection of stunning sports photos from the past 50 years. Every SI cover is included, too, as well as selections from the best articles, and humorous quotes, even sports art. Everyone of every age picked this book up at some point on Christmas Day, sometimes in groups of 3 or more, all looking at the amazing pictures. The older people wanted to check to see if their favorites were included - and how DID Michael Jordan jump that high!? Look at OJ Simpson back when he won the Heisman trophy. And hockey players didn't wear helmets - not even the goalie?? - in the 1960's? Fantastic book.</span>

<br />Sharing a celebration of 50 years with Sports Illustrated made the purchase of this book a special delight. So much has happened in so many sports, but Sports Illustrated has been along for the ride. And in the special world of sports fans it has taken its own place. Acquiring an appreciation of sport beyond the mere competition has a lot to do with how Sports Illustrated impacts on your life. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the ability to receive Sports Illustrated on a weekly basis on the other side of the world has been affected by several vagaries - including the notion that although the British Empire was in decline, its magazines were far more preferable for New Zealanders than their American equivalents, and also the fact that it is only in the modern era of communications that it is easy to send a credit card number to facilitate delivery of whatever takes your fancy.
<br />
<br />The memory of seeing my first copy of Sports Illustrated sticks with me from my schoolboy years. It related to coverage of the 1968 Olympic Games and Bob Beamon's massive leap into the rarefied air of Mexico City. It was the age of dissent with the Black Power salute on the rostrum by Tommie Smith and John Carlos later encapsulated, if that same memory is correct, in a series on The Black Athlete in the magazine.
<br />
<br />As time has gone by access to the magazine has become much easier and its literature a welcome addition to that available in other publications on the events of the sports world.
<br />
<br />Fifty years is an outstanding achievement and a credit to those who had the vision in the first place. All of which is preparatory to saying that those days before the magazine was born are well covered in the textual side of this celebratory book, along with the various eras through which it has passed. 
<br />
<br />It features the best of what has happened, with brief out-takes from what are regarded as the finest stories. Fortunately, however, these are available in full, in the bigger book, Sports Illustrated - Fifty Years of Great Writing. Also recorded are some of the greatest photographs and also the art of sport, with a special favourite being the shot of Hank Aaron in full flight.
<br />
<br />A year-by-year breakdown precedes the listing of all the covers of Sports Illustrated and while that might seem a little gradiose it is a celebration after all, and it has to be acknowledged it represents something of an interesting timeline of its own. The passing parade of America's view of world sport it may be, but it is hard to dispute that Sports Illustrated has made its impact, and contribution, on the sports it covers.
<br />
<br />And this book is a fascinating reminder of all that has happened in 50 memorable years. For any sports fan, this book is a must.</span>
