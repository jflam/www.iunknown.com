                <span id="Label1">After reading <i>Behind Bars,</i> a no-holds-barred tell-all in the spirit of <i>Kitchen Confidential,</i> you'll never look at your favorite bartender the same way again.<br><br>Ty Wenzel offers a raw and clever account of slinging drinks in New York City on the Bowery before and during its renaissance. Wenzel, now thirty-six, has just thrown in the towel after a decade at the swank Marion's Continental Restaurant and Lounge--a gig that was supposed to be a temporary escape after corporate burnout, but instead, like with most bartenders, took over her life.<br><br>Honest, clever, and often scathingly funny, this memoir at once offers outrageous tales, the dirty little secrets of the trade, and inspired commentary on bar culture and the human condition. Wenzel's candid stories of life behind the bar covers everything: sex, money, celebrities, the tricks mixers play on you to get you to stay on that stool, how to jumpstart your own bartender fantasy, that all-important tip . . . and how "pink drinks" like the Cosmopolitan are ruining civilization.<br><br><i>Behind Bars</i> is also a riveting narrative of Wenzel's life outside the bar, which is complicated by her Islamic background, her drive to save enough money and get out of "the life," and the ultimate realization that the grueling lifestyle that is driving her crazy is also something she has grown to love.<br></span>

                    <span>I was given this book as a Christmas gift because I'm always going on and on about my favorite bars and the mixers there. When I finished reading Ms. Wenzel's memoir on slinging drinks on the Bowery for a decade, I laughed and high tailed it over to one of my favorite bartenders. I handed it over to him and said, YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS! All the times they told me that they're going to write a book about their experiences behind their bars... well, Wenzel did it first! And it was hilarious and eye-opening at the same time. I thought that the listed "pet peeves" were great as well as educational for hardcore regulars, and the glossary taught me the insider language. There are a lot of gross things about restaurants and the service industry, and Wenzel tells it straight up... literally. Her writing is raw, fun and at times very thoughtful and eloquent. She's had plenty of touching moments to balance out the in-your-face truths and sometimes frightening anecdotes. Her Islamic background was interesting as were other elements of her life outside the bar. <P>Want to ask your bartender out? She'll tell you how to do it. <BR>Want to know how to get a drink faster? She'll tell you what to do.<BR>Want to know if you're tipping correctly? She'll really let you have it.<BR>Ever wonder what they're thinking as you're babbling on? Wenzel doesn't pussy-foot around with what bartenders think. <P>Truly fun. And if you love it as much as I did, pass it on to your favorite bartender. They'll not only love you for it, they may get you a round on the house!<P>Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I read Behind Bars in one sitting. The double-entendre of the title is appropriate for this memoir because "the life" is not all that it's cracked up to be. I really felt that I was sitting in front of Wenzel at her bar on the Bowery listening to her tell her tales. The pace was wonderful in that it felt like a busy, crazy night at a hotspot in Manhattan. I wish I could have gotten a drink from Wenzel before she threw in the towel. <P>Her Islamic background made it more interesting, more than a chick-lit story of a girl in the big city. It was thought provoking in that her background was everything but where she ended up. Her prose is bitingly witty and brutally honest, yet as the time passes she softens to her regulars/orphans and the job itself. She doesn't pussy-foot around where tipping is concerned, and in fact, I've heard my own fave bartender talk about the topic in this way. In fact, I plan to get Behind Bars for her for Christmas, if she doesn't beat me to it. I already told her about it.<P>Lots of add-ons: funny glossary, recipes, pet-peeves and famous quotes about booze and bars. <P>Definite buy.<P>Jane Threlfall</span>

                    <span>I have always loved bartenders. It was a treat to read Wenzel's account of mixing drinks in NYC and what a joy/nightmare it can be. Her prose is raw yet polished, her stories sometimes horrifying. I learned a lot from it and despite her pleas to stop hitting on bartenders, I will continue to do so because I am further compelled by them after reading her book!</span>

                    <span>As a former bartender I hate to say something bad, but how much experience can a person get in two bars across 10 years? We never see behind the scenes of a hosted bar (tipping, forget it), we never see the true interaction of a bartender and cocktail server, we rarely hear the full scoop. Serving in a restaurant bar is different than a hotel bar, an airport bar, a nightclub, a race track (my least favorite).</span>

                    <span>Just finished Wenzel's account of her ten years in the bartending biz. I really liked the way it was categorized into sections, like "Sex with a Twist" and "Tip or Die in Manhattan" that allowed me to understand which area of the trade she was talking about. As a guy whose fascination with bartenders spans two decades, it was not only fun but insightful. How to ask out your favorite bartender? She explains it clearly. Her use of language is raw, just like what you'd expect from a "mixer" and when she does let her guard down, she's quite generous with her feelings particularly when it came to how she found out about her pregnancy and tidbits about her Islamic upbringing. I really found myself enjoying it. I even laughed when I was reading what I thought was a standard restaurant "glossary" only to find that to "Brit" was to "Stiff" someone. The book is clever, raw and entertaining. Though drinkers who have ever been cut off or thought she were entranced by everything they ever told her might not be too happy to hear that sometimes she were just nodding just to get through the night. Such is the life, I suppose. If you want something entertaining to read, this is a great choice. If you don't want to be told how to tip, you might go elsewhere because Wenzel doesn't seem to be someone who will sugarcoat anything. Another great thing about this writer.</span>
