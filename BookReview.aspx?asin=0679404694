                    <span>Wow... I read this in 5th grade and it was worth it! And then I read it again in eigth grade... The reason i love this book so much is that i won the contest for Nintendo with the information in this book. (animal crossing pioneer) <p>Well, I can't say enough for this book. I own the hardback, and plan to get the updated paperback soon!</span>

                    <span>This is ONE book that I just can't get out of my mind!  This book is a must get for gamers & Nsiders (The Official On-line Nintendo Club)!<p>Game Over gave a near-perfect insite to Nintendo's beginning of a  handfuda card company (Japanese cards), develop into a game / toy company,  & eventually entering the Video Game company.<p>David Sheff did an  excellent job in writting this book & does go in depth into things as  well as actual translation of the name ("Leave Luck to God" is my  favorite).<p>If the Nsiders is a cult/ religion, this would be our  bible!<p>This is a great book to read, even though there are slight minor  flaws & this version only goes up to 1993.  It's a must read good &  would Highly suggest picking up the revised sequal, "Game Over: Press  Start to continue"</span>

                    <span>Game Over is a terrific account of Nintendo's past, and is must reading for video game enthusiasts and historians.  Mr. Sheff had what seemed to be unparalleled access to Nintendo's inner workings, and brought back a  fascinating story on a family business made good in the international  community.  Unfortunately, the book falls for Nintendo's predictions for  the future (many of which were designed by Nintendo solely to draw  attention away from its rivals rather than to provide insight into their  future business plans.)  As long as the last parts of the book that attempt  to chart the future course for video games and Nintendo are ignored, the  book stands as an important work in video game journalism.<p>I do have a  few complaints with the contents and focus of the book; there are the usual  small factual errors which may obscure future historical video game  research; there are the regurgitations of various industry spokesmen  without proper interpretations; and there is the unwavering focus on  Nintendo which tends to downplay the parts played by their  competitors/rivals in the industry.  I have yet to read the updated version  of Game Over (Press Start to Continue), and the new version may rectify  some or all of these shortcomings.  Regardless, Game Over stands as a  slightly flawed, but amazingly useful research tool and entertaining book.</span>
