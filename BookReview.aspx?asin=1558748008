                <span id="Label1">Inspired by the many readers of <I>Chicken Soup for the Kid's Soul</I>  (one of many in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series), the authors decided to  reach out to young people at that incredibly confusing, exciting chapter of  life, the preteen years. Readers between the ages of 9 and 12 (give or take a  year) sometimes felt that the book for kids was too young, while the edition for  teens (<I>Chicken Soup for the  Teenage Soul</I>) was too old. In this warm, supportive anthology of true  stories by and about preteens, the very issues that seem so complicated and  insurmountable are addressed with intelligence and openness. Divorce, violence,  death, friendships, school, family, attitudes, changes, dreams... preteens have  a lot to offer and a lot to learn on these subjects. Many of the brief essays,  cartoons, quotations, and introductions are witty as well as wise and touching;  readers might devour the book from start to finish, drop in for a story here and  there, or focus on a concern that is most important at the moment. The preteen  years seem to be the perfect time to reach kids, before they are lost in teen  angst and coolness. And who better to learn from than their own peers? For some  added incentive to read, celebrities such as Mia Hamm, Karl Malone, and 'N Sync  have contributed essays as well. (Ages 9 to 13) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>This book is probably one of the greatest books I have ever read. Before I got it, I thought I was going through stuff that no one could relate to. After reading it for just a little while, I realized I wasn't alone. <BR> The sections in this book are Achieving Dreams, On Friendship, On Family, On Love, On Death and Dying, On Attitude and Perspective, Overcoming Obstacles, On Choices, On Tough Stuff, On Changes, and Eclectic Wisdom. You will laugh, cry, feel thankful, feel bad, and you can relate to some of the stories. Celebrities Mia Hamm, Karl Malone, Beverly Mitchell, and the members of *NSYNC add their feelings and stories to the books. <BR> I don't think you can be too young or too old to read this book. I have read parts to my parents, and they felt exactly the same way I did. My younger brother also enjoyed it. The book is narated with cartoons like the Family Circus, Calvin and Hobbes, and Dennis the Menace. <BR> After reading this book, I felt better about making new friends, my life, and the tragadies and unexpected things about being a preteen. I hope you do to.</span>

                    <span>The book contains loads of stories of tennagers who survived all this stuff, and acomplished dreams. It's really cool that such book exists that we can read stories of all these adolecents who want to share a storie with us. Some are funny, some are life learning. There are mostly sad stories in the book than anything else, but there good ones! Justdont get me rong, they dont soak the book. It's a nice book and I thing all the teens should read it, to know that there not alone.</span>

                    <span>This was a book that whenever you picked it up it touched your heart. It is hard to think that some preteens have to go through what they did. Laugh, cry, get mad, you will eventually do all of this when you pick up this book. I recomend this book to everyone that is having a hard time in their preteen days.</span>
