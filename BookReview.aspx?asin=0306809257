                    <span>As a 46 year old European who moved to the US three years ago this book was something of an eye-opener. It was helpful in understanding the tensions and in-fighting that takes place in American jazz. Although I am no longer sure what I call "jazz" qualifies as the real thing. My impression from the book is that in many American circles music produced by white Europeans cannot be described as jazz. <p>I agree with the book in that I don't hear a lot of interesting new jazz music coming out of the US at the moment, but probably I am looking in the wrong places. I would like someone to write a book that explains why there seems to be a dearth of US new music at the moment - is it all the fault of Marsalis? <p>For me the great jazz years were the 1970s (this could be my age, or I may be a moron). I started enjoying American jazz around 1972. Initially it was Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Weather Report and Gary Burton. Gradually I got into John Abercrombie, Oregon, Pat Metheny, Miles Davis, Bobby Previte, Bill Frisell, John Scofield, Larry Coryell, Mike Stern, George Russell, John Scofield and Carla Bley. Up to the end of the 1980s there seemed to be no end to the talent coming out of the US, and American jazz musicians seemed to have an amazing level of creativity. In recent years this flow of talent seems to have slowed down. <p>I think that the jazz critics are a major part of the problem. They tend to believe that the golden jazz years occurred before Miles went electric. The US jazz scene as presented in magazines like Downbeat seems caught in an insular time-warp, focusing on aging artists long past their peak, making music that sounds like stuff I have heard before. The music of Marsalis and the new traditionalists is popular with critics, even though it seems like a pointless exercise in pastiche. <p>The critics have a problem in accepting jazz with electric instruments or use different rhythms. They also tend to snobbishly promote difficult music e.g. Coltrane. Most critics don't really understand rock or know a lot about classical music. For people of my age, rock was the music of our generation.  <p>Annoyingly in his book, Nisenson writes about the technical superiority of jazz musicians over their rock counterparts, but I am not sure this is always the case. A lot of the old jazz musicians were self taught, and 1970s rock pianists like Elton John, Billy Joel, Rick Wakeman and Nicky Hopkins were probably "technically" better than Monk, Ellington or Basie who did not go to Music College. However, there is more to musicianship than technique. In his Kind of Blue book, Nisenson names Joaquin Rodrigo as Rodrigos, which is a small mistake, but more worrying I did not get the impression that he had heard Concierto de Aranjuez as a classical piece. With Spanish guitar and a symphony orchestra the music sounds a lot better than the version on Sketches of Spain recorded with trumpet and jazz band.</span>

                    <span>An engaging read, which helps among other things, to dissipate one's own dislike of<br>Mr. Marsalis's playing and unpleasant pontification upon matters<br>of which he has no new knowledge. One could not be accused of discrimination under "Blindfold Test" conditions in his case, however, his playing is indistinguishable from that of many players of either hue or nationality.<br>     The sad fact,however, is that here is a fairly entertaining<br>piece of writing wasted upon a subject which has sadly become rather trivial. The "innovations" in jazz since the '60s are hardly more than rather feeble attempts to catch up with the true innovations, in the USA, of great experimenter/composers such as IVES, RUGGLES, SEEGER, COWELL and CRAWFORD. Attaching one popular musical "style" to another, more lucrative, fashionable clich√©, is no more akin to "art" than childrens' daubings are truly "creative". Besides, most jazz has such limited emotional appeal; the visceral, gonad-centred extremes of exultation or rejection vie with the "personal sound"<br>to produce a rather self-indulgent outpouring.<br> There were some interesting linear novelties which did not conform to the mainly popular-song-based chord-sequences ( e.g. Tristano's and Konitz's lines) but most of these were nevertheless derived from them. (Accents on "conformed" and "derived").<br>     Sadly, I believe the author's title tells the truth; the pipers got too self-important. Aspiring or claiming to be an<br>artist does not achieve artistry. Jazz lost its frivolous audience when "Rock" shoved its backside in, and lost its serious adherents when it gave up sensitivity in favour of juvenile "funk", and introspection in favour of "energy".<br>Mixtures of any/all of these were just irritants e.g. "fusion".<br>     I  do wish he had gone on a bit more resolutely about just how truly tedious the so-called "modal" idiom became; yes, for a while it was bearable while Miles and Coltrane were discovering<br>how to do it, but it took TEN YEARS for it to be killed off, and then in came the Breckers ---now there are thousands of Brecker<br>comb-and-paper virtuosos. Mike Brecker was wonderful when with<br>Mingus's band, but his clones have never done him justice. If I never hear another Jamey Aebersold "I've paid my dues and learnt the scales and been through all the books about ii-iv-I and<br>chromaticism and developed my own sound" totally nondescript sax-player, I will be happy, and so will Mr Nisenson I'm sure. There is a hint of cold-blooded murder about all this.<br>    You may believe that non-American jazz criticism is ill-founded; I beg to differ - there are more well-disposed audiences in Britain and parts of Europe. This book will be widely read, I believe, on this side of the Atlantic. We have<br>musicians here you know. Have had for some years. Some of them<br>went abroad........<p>  <p>to</span>

                    <span>Many believe that jazz reached its zenith back in the late 50s ans early 60s, when the like of Miles Davis and John Coltrane walked the earth. Most of the jazz that sells these days dates back to this period. This is a golden spoon for the record industry. So be it because the music is still great (though no longer spontaneous). <p>Davis and Coltrane were innovators. Particularly in the case of Miles, there were many who detested his aversion to sticking with the same product. He was constantly pushing ahead. He paid his dues by living a very hard life in those early days. Now we have Jazz being institutionalized in places like Lincoln Center. Not much inovation going on there. If this is where jazz is headed. So be it. This book expands on this sad trend. <p>Just for kicks, I did a web search on the words "is jazz dead". What popped up was Jazz is Dead. Which oddly is a band featuring jazz musicians like Billy Cobham playing Greatful Dead music. I think that says it all.</span>

                    <span>When I started reading this book, it was at a time when I was a rock and blues fan trying to get into jazz and understand it better.  One question I always had at the back of my mind was, "Why is it that I usually like jazz records from the Fifties better than jazz records from the Nineties?"  Another was, "What separates good jazz from bad?"  Nisenson answers those questions in spades.  I can understand some of the criticisms of the book in the reviews below, but despite its title, Blue: The Murder Of Jazz is a great book for beginning jazz fans to increase their understanding of the music.  Serious jazz listeners will love it or hate it depending on their point of view, but I found it to be a quick read and highly informative.</span>

                    <span>This book was a lot of fun to read even if the "controversies" of jazz critics seem like a "tempest in a teapot."<p>The theme of this book is simple - that ongoing innovation is an essential part of the history of jazz, and that continued innovation is necessary for the vitality of the art.  While the tone of the book is at times a bit polemic, it is also informed by a passion for the music.  This makes the book far more interesting to read than a simple lifeless recitation of the facts of jazz history.  The book is actually an interesting and informative survey of the of the history of  jazz and innovation in jazz.  He also makes some very interesting points about the impact of jazz education and record companies on the recent evolution of the music.  Artists, he says, are signed too young, when they've been trained in school and not trained through "paying their dues".  <p>I found the book to be compelling reading.  I don't agree 100% with his assessment of certain artists and developments.  Nissenson appreciates "free jazz" and "fusion" far more than I do.  But I would definitely recommend this book to any student of jazz, or to anyone who wants to be more informed about the music.</span>
