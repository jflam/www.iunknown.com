                <span id="Label1">Accompanied by a menagerie of products, Ken Burns's expansive 10-episode paean, <I>Jazz</I>, completes his trilogy on American culture, following <I>The Civil War</I> and <I>Baseball</I>. Spanning more than 19 hours, <I>Jazz</I> is, of course, about a lot more than what many have called America's classical music--especially in episodes 1 through 7. It's here that Burns unearths precious visual images of jazz musicians and hangs historical narratives around the music with convincing authority. Time can stand still as images float past to the sound of grainy vintage jazz, and the drama of a phonograph needle being placed on Louis Armstrong's celestial "West End Blues" is nearly sublime. <p>   The film is also potent in arguing that the history of race in the 20th-century U.S. is at jazz's heart. But a few problems arise. First is Burns's reliance on Wynton Marsalis as his chief musical commentator. Marsalis might be charming and musically expert, but he's no historian. For the film to devote three of its episodes to the 1930s, one expects a bit more historical substance. Also, <I>Jazz</I> condenses the period of 1961 to the present into one episode, glossing over some of the music's giant steps. Burns has said repeatedly that he didn't know much about jazz when he began this project. So perhaps <I>Jazz</I>, for all its glory, would better be called <I>Jazz: What I've Learned Since I Started Listening (And I Haven't Gotten Much Past 1961)</I>. For those who are already passionate about jazz, the film will stoke debate (and some derision, together with some reluctant praise). But for everyone else, it will amaze and entertain and kindle a flame for some of the greatest music ever dreamed. <I>--Andrew Bartlett</I> </span>

                    <span>Very extensive compilation of the more popular jazz greats in history.  Covers many different genres in jazz, although I was very disappointed that Burns just casually dimisses the electric and fusion aspects of this great music.  In music, there are always new developments and music becomes progressive.
<br />
<br />It saddens me to see that great innovator like Miles Davis is afforded only 5 minutes on that particular style.  I seems like Ken Burns is almost ashamed of the development of modern jazz (fusion) that he omits it from this collection.  This is my only qualm about his work.</span>

                    <span>Ken Burns is a man who loves to tell a good story, and his stories always have heroes, tragedies, and reveal something about the heart of the American experience. Just as in his other epic made-for-TV epics THE CIVIL WAR and BASEBALL, as well as a host of shorter projects, JAZZ is a narrative that tells vividly the viewer something crucial about this nation. My conception of patriotism has little to do with the uncritical, jingoistic, flag-waving fanaticism that delusionally imagines that God somehow favors the United States above all other nations (an attitude that drove John Adams stark raving angry). My idea of a patriot is someone who can look at their country truly and accurate, not ignore the shameful episodes, not falsely embellish our virtues, and yet truly see the wonderful things we contribute. Burns is, for me, the consummate patriot. In all of his work he obviously grieves over the shameful racial legacy of our nation, but he exults over what has been achieved despite this. 
<br />
<br />This is a history of Jazz in America, with a qualification. "Jazz" for Burns means acoustic jazz, as opposed to jazz produced with electric, as opposed to merely amplified, instruments. If one is a fan of fusion or even electric guitar, one is going to find virtually nothing in this series. In fact, the ten two-hour episodes dispense with electric jazz in less than five minutes, and then as what is seen as a lamentable downturn in Miles Davis's career. 
<br />
<br />JAZZ chronicles the history of jazz from its birth in New Orleans roughly a century ago through its earliest stages to it maturation in Chicago and New York in the twenties and thirties to its influence on the birth of swing through the various Kansas City influences (whether Count Basie's own brand of swing to Charlie Parker) to its eventual breakdown into a host of schools of jazz. The heroes are the obvious ones. Above all, the series follows the story of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, who emerge as the twin magisterial figures of jazz: Armstrong the supreme instrumentalist and vocalist, whose influenced the performing style of everyone who followed, and Ellington who is portrayed not merely as the great jazz composer but also the great American composer (a contention that others besides Burns makes). Nearly as important are a host of other iconic individuals such as the immortal Billie Holliday, innovators like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillepsie, the irrepressible Chick Webb, the tragic Bix Beiderbecke, pioneers like Sidney Bechet and Coleman Hawkins, and the marvelous Lester Young. Literally dozens of major and minor jazz figures have their stories told through a wonderful combination of still photography, recordings, readings by actors, and film footage. 
<br />
<br />The best thing about JAZZ is that it can serve either as a visual treat to established fans of jazz, or as a primer and introduction to those who know nothing about it. Though everyone will in the end have wished that there might have been a bit less on this or that figure, or a bit more on this one or that (surely they could have found a few more minutes for Sarah Vaughan? Or many more minutes for John Coltrane?), no one can say that Burns and his team didn't try. 
<br />
<br />One of the strengths of Burns's series is his great group of commentators. The single thing that made THE CIVIL WAR so exciting was Shelby Foote's extraordinary contributions. JAZZ also benefits by some great verbal assistance by a first rate group of people. Gary Giddens enlightens nearly everyone he reflects on, as does Nat Hentoff and Stanley Crouch. But the best comments by far, especially in the early years, are those by Wynton Marsalis. He invigorates the series partly through his enormous love of the music, partly by his extensive knowledge of its history, partly through his wonderfully engaging personality and the wise things he has to say, and partly through his ability to illustrate his comments by playing his trumpet. There are also a few interviews with some major jazz figures, though tragically there were far fewer great surviving figures for the filming of this series than when Burns did his baseball series. The only figure from the thirties was Artie Shaw, but as always he provides such intelligent testimony that his contribution was especially desirable. Dave Brubeck contributed, as did Herbie Hancock, but few of their ilk were able to contribute. 
<br />
<br />It really doesn't matter if you like jazz or not. If you are a patriot in the best and not the worse sense of the word, you will want to see this in order to appreciate better one of the things that makes this nation a great one. I hope that Burns has a few more like JAZZ, BASEBALL, and THE CIVIL war up his sleeve. No one tells the American story better than he does. Here's hoping he is able to tell it for a very long time indeed. </span>

<br />
<br />I knew nothing about jazz.
<br />Zero. Zip. Nada. 
<br />I had heard the word "jazz", of course; and, when my parents forced me to play the electric organ, I (with great difficulty) had to play "In the Mood" for a music exam. In the back of the music book was a piece called "Watermelon Man" by this guy called Hancock; there was something by someone called Duke, I can't remember what it was.
<br />
<br />When this series came on, I, as a history student, was aware of Ken Burns' "The Civil War", which had moved me powerfully (probably, again, because I knew almost nothing about that particular war at the time). I therefore tried watching an episode or two.
<br />
<br />What I remember most about this series is that it is a drama. That's all there is to it. It is not an attempt to summarise the music. It is as subtly crafted a drama as "The Civil War" was. It is possible to make any subject seem dull - even jazz and the American Civil War. But to make it seem interesting - nay, interesting enough that it remains in the mind as a supreme moviegoing experience - now that is difficult.
<br />
<br />One thing I remember from the series is, in one episode, this guy saying that he had bought a Louis Armstrong disc when he was a kid, and listened just to one side over and over for six months straight. Then he turned the disc over - and the first thing on the other side was West End Blues. Which was a masterpiece beyond anything else on the disc, which he didnt know then. (Immediately the viewer is made interested). Then he describes taking it to a music professor, I can't remember where, and he says he played West End Blues for him. The professor said to play it again. He played it again. Then there was a long silence; and the professor says "I think that was the most perfect three minutes of music I ever heard". (By now the audience is gawking: wow!) 
<br />BUT - the ingenious thing is: Cut to an image of an old 78 player. What is this? Cut to a closer image of it. Can it be? And YES - we can read the label: WEST END BLUES. Holy Cow!!! Then a hand looms into the frame...the disc begins to spin...a stylus is lowered...
<br />And the entire three minutes of West End Blues is played!!!
<br />
<br />Yes indeed - this is truly dramatic bliss. Ken Burns builds up to this point over the preceding couple of shots, in order to bring the viewer almost to a fever pitch. 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is another moment, a little more personal here. I had watched about five episodes of the series, with very little interest in the music, frankly - even in Louis Armstrong - and by the time the swing era came I was drifting - I wasn't paying attention...
<br />
<br />Then in the last scene of the last swing episode...an image of an atom bomb (Nagasaki, I think) comes up on the screen...And over the top of this horrible image is a sound I've never heard before - a sound that immediately caught my attention after hour after hour of corny swing tunes. I had never heard anything like this. Images begin to come up on the screen of small nightclubs and saxophone players. The name Charlie Parker is mentioned - never heard the name. A guy called Dizzy looks like a beatnik. The narrator describes in awed tones a great *revolution* happening in jazz. The audience is leaning forward. The sounds grow weirder - hard to define for someone untutored in music - the rhythms are all weird, and harmonies are all over the place. The sound of a saxophone is almost overwhelmingly fast and witty. What is this??!! 
<br />And the episode ends. To be continued.
<br />
<br />The following week, I waited feverishly for the next episode. A word is mentioned; Bebop. Never even heard of it. But this is the episode that turned me on to jazz. The way it is made, the way the drama is created, and the newness of the sounds - new to ME, too, after hearing bland dance music for the preceding episodes - was stunning. I was in exactly the same position as the people in the 40s. All the jazz I had ever heard was contained in the preceding episodes. It was astoundingly powerful - I could *hear* the revolution, myself, in my lounge room. 
<br />I found a new obsession.
<br />
<br />To people who already know about jazz, this series is filled with flaws - perhaps even fatal flaws. But to an untutored Australian, who knew zero about the music, it seemed like a pretty darned dramatic experience. In fact, I would be prepared to call it powerful. Maybe even great. I have rarely been so interested in a historical documentary, or so eager to see the next episode. I was humming St Thomas by Sonny Rollins for two weeks straight; I am now obsessively listening to Coltranes "My Favourite Things"; I am now a certifiable jazz fan.
<br />
<br />Jazz is such a bitchy and divisive art form nowadays, that any documentary like this is bound to offend 75% of fans. Admittedly, too, I haven't seen the last episode, which supposedly dismisses everything anyone has done since 1967 including Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis' later works. That's a bit off. 
<br />But from all that I have seen of the series, I'd like to recommend this series to anyone who knows nothing about jazz; particularly the bebop episodes.</span>

                    <span>I think the addition of that one word would solve a lot of contreversy. If you look at the series that way, then it's pretty good, hence the 4 stars. Burns would have been wiser to have added that word, then the omition of fusion, avant-garde, electronic jazz et al could be forgiven. Of course, it's not quite as snappy and "epic" sounding, which is the aim of this series, bombarding you with so much detail of so many seemingly insignificant events and the glorification to deity status of some very excellent musicians (Armstrong, Ellington, Parker) that you think you are witnessing the birth of civilization itself. 
<br />
<br />So to all the people that mourned the abscence of guitar players, keep in mind that the guitar as a solo instrument did really come to the for in Jazz until the 50's, with the widespread use of amplifiers, which is near the tail end of traditional jazz.
<br />
<br />The choice of Marsalis has been criticized, but it's understandable because he is the one contemporary jazz musician that most people have heard of, and yes he is an accomplished player, he's also a good speaker and pleasant to look at, which is more important for a documentary, albeit the accuracy may have been somewhat sacrificed.
<br />
<br />It would be nice to see a "Ken Burns Jazz: part II" with all the missing elements from this series, but that probably won't happen. I liked the fact that he did include a pretty balanced view of many movements, and the contreversies that were happening at the time, too many times you read history as "first there this movement, then came this movement" thinking that it's very block like and orderly. It's good that he mentions that a lot of people didn't like the direction that be-bop took Jazz, that it turned jazz into music for musicians, that you couldn't dance to it anymore or even understand it. I found this interesting since it's a very similar to the way the classical music evolved into intelectual constructs that were lost on the average listener. I think that's what so fascinating about the swing era, is that the music was both technically complex and fun to listen to. That to me is the best music can achieve. Other conflicts are mentioned, such as the beat poets naive and simplistic view of Jazz music, that in the words of Ginsburg "anyone can pick up an axe and let it out". Uh yeah, have you tried Mr. Ginsburg? It aint that easy, trust me.
<br />
<br />The series does get bogged down after a while, and if you're not a horn player (i'm a pianist and guitarist) you will soon get barraged with a seemingly endless string of rapid fire sax/trumpet solos, which to me, I'm ashamed to say, all the sound the same. The glossing over of avant-guarde is a shame, but is expected, after all, the majority of the viewers that Burns is targeting probably don't have a taste for this music and he knows it. I am musician and I actually agree with Branford Marsalis' view that it's "self-indulgent bullsh*t", cause it is. And yes, I've done it, and frankly the whole experience is empty and devoid of musicality. Same with jazz fusion, much of it is pretentious indulgent garbage, and no it's not because I don't understand it, or because I'm a snob, I DO understand it and that's what makes it all the worse.
<br />
<br />Anyway, to sum up, take the series for what it is, if you are interested in traditional acoustic jazz and don't know much about it, you might find it worth while. If you are a fusionist, avant guardist or whatever, I would give it a pass, see if you can find a documentary that suits your interests, I'm sure there a bunch out there. For the rest of us, enjoy the old photos and a glimpse into an organic musical form that is worth much praise.

                    <span>Pretty to say this is one of my favorite documentaries I have seen on PBS. I first watch this since they did stories on Duke, Coltrane, Miles (who is my inspiration), Count, Herbie, Billie, Satchmo, Dizzy, Bird, Ornette, Wynton and on and on which told by the narration of himself, Mr. the actor Keith David. Keith David was a good speaker when he narrated the history and culture that going besides jazz. I appreciate on what he accomplished and look forward of him doin' more of this on other documentaries in the future. Yeah Keith will live on my heart for now on 'cause he good with that baritone kinda voice.
<br />
<br />Anyway, as I was saying this a good documentary whether you love it or hate it, I think it's talking about what jazz became popular in the United States. Artists like Satchmo aka Louie Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald became the first to create that generation. Same with others like Dizzy, Bird, Coltrane, Davis, Count, Billie, Ornette, Blakey, Wynton, Freddie, Herbie Hancock, Clifford, and many others who created that sound of jazz.
<br />
<br />Like to say I'm a huge jazz fan and I'll always gonna live around it until the day I die. I'm especially a trumpet player so I know the details about it. One of the things I worried is that a lot of people are missing out some information about it. Simple, they don't read books about it or else pick up some albums from them that made it. I think the matter of it is we should learn to appreciate how we put into our music today like in R&B, hip-hop, rock, gospel and all kinds of music that are playing right now all have a feature on where we left off back in those days.
<br />
<br />This is definitely a must-have who wants to read or learn more about it. I recommend this documentary in addition to "Higher Ground: Voices of Contemporary Gospel Music", "Say Amen, Somebody", "John Coltrane: The Coltrane Legacy", "The Miles Davis Story", "Tupac: Resurrection", "The Diary of Alicia Keys", "Grover Washington Jr. in Concert", "Ray Charles in Concert", "Gil Evans and His Orchestra", "Royal Ellington: Royal Fesitival Hall Concert", "Kind of Blue: The Making of the Miles Davis Masterpiece" by Ashley Kahn, and so on and on.
<br />
<br />I appreciate Ken Burns 4 putting out a documentary that is so blessed and thankful.</span>
