                    <span>I received Zero to One Million a few days ago - it was awesome. I spent the better part of the night (when I was supposed to be sleeping) reading it. I was doing the old flashlight under the covers trick since I had to be up at 6:00 the next morning for school, and mom would have sent me to bed had she known. No matter - I felt it was good preparation (after reading your 'day in the life of an entrepreneur) for me becoming an entrepreneur. I really wanted to thank you for that book and let you know that you have made a difference in one life. All books I had read previously (Kiyosaki, Robert G Allen) while containing good information had left me still a little confused as to where I was going. After reading your book, there was no doubt in my mind. I am going to be an entrepreneur - and a successful one. I really liked your book's down-to-earth style with practical examples. Thanks a million (pun intended).</span>

                    <span>Love the book - not like... LOVE!<BR>Haven't put it down since it arrived. Mission accomplished - you've inspired me!<BR>My goals, mission and creed are framed and on the wall.<BR>Love the MAR Model (for evaluating business ideas). You manage to get all this stuff that I've known about for years and somehow get me to act on it, be excited about it, and get results! Thank you!<P>I haven't been intending to promote this book, but I just keep raving about it to people. I most often say, "One of the references on the book says 'Ryan in the next Robert Kiyosaki,' and they're absolutely right." It's not that I'm putting Ryan on a pedestal or anything, it's just that his writing gets me into action. It tooks me a few weeks (instead of a day) to read the book because I kept DOING what he was talking about. I came away from each chapter not only having my thoughts cleared, but with an action plan and an elevated spirit, fire in my heart, wind at my heels, ready to get on with it.</span>

                    <span>Zero To One Million is a very informative book that any future entrepreneur or anyone planning to start a business of their own should read and benefit from. The 100 steps to building a company to $1 million in sales is worth the cost of the book alone. I found the information easy to read and follow and, more importantly, easy to put into practice. Mr. Allis was able to provide me with a step by step guide on how to not only get started with a business, but also how to maintain and grow it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone just starting out with a business of their own or any small business owners looking for an extra "edge" to stimulate growth. The web marketing ideas and information on search engine optimization were of immense value to me in my job. Zero To One Million is definitely a must buy!</span>

                    <span>After reading "Zero to One Million" and implementing the strategies and techniques in Mr. Allis's book, my business revenue has almost tripled in a short 4-months time. I am the CEO of a neutraceutical corporation and interact with CEO'S from companies in the USA and Internationally. I can honestly say I have tried multiple methods and hired multiple marketing and management teams in the past, spending 100'S of thousands of dollars with little to no results. I have also read multiple books on subjects of personal and business development including Stephen Covey, Richard Gerber, Anthoney Robbins, Louise Hay, Dale Carnegie and more. "Zero to One Million" covers the beginner to advanced stages it takes to become successful and financially secure. I would recommend this book to all entrepreneurs and successful business men and women.</span>
