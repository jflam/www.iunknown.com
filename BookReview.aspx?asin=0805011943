                <span id="Label1"><I>The Copywriter's Handbook</I> is somewhat out of date. There are no references to Web sites or the Internet, and author Robert W. Bly advises that a freelance copywriter have a good typewriter. No matter. Bly has compiled an incredibly useful resource for budding, and even experienced, copywriters. Bly calls his book "a step-by-step guide to writing copy that sells." And that it is: Bly covers the writing of print ads, direct mail, brochures, catalogues, public-relations material, trade-journal articles, speeches, newsletters, commercials, and more. But equally informative is the substantial amount of space that he devotes to the copywriting business, in which he offers guidance in setting up a freelance copywriting business, getting hired by an ad agency, and hiring and working with copywriters (this section also includes a chapter on graphic design for copywriters). This is a terrific book. If you don't take my word for it, take David Ogilvy's: "I don't know a single copywriter whose work would not be improved by reading this book," he says. "And that includes me." <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>All the nuts and bolts you need to start writing like an expert copywriter. Without a doubt, The Copywriter's Handbook is the Bible of the copywriting industry -- and has been for quite some time.When I began my career as a freelance copywriter back in the '80s, I called several gurus and asked for advice. They all referred me to Bob Bly's material. When it comes to teaching the trade and explaining how to break into it, they said, he is king. And I agree.In this single guide, Bly takes you by the hand. He starts with the basics, explaining the purpose of advertising and copywriting in its many forms. He shows how to write winning headlines and body copy for ads, brochures, letters. He gives practical tips on writing for magazines, newspapers, TV, radio, commercial and non-profit groups. He includes tips for designing sales/promotional literature and offers good advice on using art. He gives numerous check lists for improving your copy. He also uses great examples from different industries to illustrate his points.The book is so rich and relevant in content I refer to it all the time. In fact, I have worned out several copies and often buy extras to give to colleagues and clients.One thing readers will appreciate about Bly and his work is his honesty. He's very objective and fair in his assessment of the copywriting business. He offers no hype. And his work is not filled with self-promotional rubbish. Instead, he comes across as a true professional, a real expert and simply a sincere man who actually cares about his readers. No wonder the book keeps getting raved reviews. It was also praised by the lengendary David Ogilvy and other great advertising giants.Another thing readers should note about Bly is that he writes from experience as well as research. Unlike many so-called experts who make their millions from seminars --with little or no experience in actually doing what they teach -- Bly is a working writer. In addition to being a prolific author (with over 50 books published), he makes his living writing winning copy for the top businesses in the country.If you want to learn and master the fundamentals of copywriting, don't waste your money on a $2,000 seminar/program given by a self-proclaimed guru. Instead, spend a few pennies and get this book. It's all you'll need.</span>

                    <span>Independent writing consultant Robert Bly cuts through all the hype surrounding promotional copywriting and `creativity', with a no-nonsense guide that covers everything.<P>I too am a copywriter and, for the first time, empathised almost entirely with what a fellow writer was saying.<P>You see, the subject matter is steeped in misunderstanding. What the aspiring writer needs to know is that almost all copywriting is about selling.<P>Robert Bly understands this, and communicates it well. He knows it's not about clever headlines; it's not about puns; it's not about abstract concepts. Yes, the copywriter is a salesperson - one who is paid by his clients to sell their products.<P>This book recognises this with a relish. It urges us to identify the USP (that which makes a product different and saleable) and to put it right up-front, to deliver simple messages that everyone can understand, and to write precisely for the intended audience.<P>Bly's comprehensive guide covers pr! ints ads, brochures, radio and TV commercials, direct mail and PR material. There are also chapters on getting a great job in an agency, and going freelance.<P>The only element with which I would take issue is Bly's somewhat dismissive attitude towards graphic design. I can think of many designers and art directors who would be hopping mad over Bly's comments about `fancy visuals' that don't add to the selling process, and about the limited value of white space. Surely someone who has worked so much with designers knows about their contribution to the `pickupability' of advertising material? A minor quibble, but a valid one.</span>

                    <span>Robert Bly is almost universally accepted as the master copywriter, particularly in the area of freelancing. For anyone starting out, and even for professionals, this book is a necessity andmay save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on needless seminars.<P>It is filled with no-nonsense advice and instruction on the craft of copywriting. It probably truly is the Bible for copywriting. If you are starting out on a path to a career in copywriting, just ask nearly any seasoned pro and they will refer you to Bly's work. <P>In this volume, Bly explains advertising and copywriting and the many forms they take shape in. He explains how copywriting applies to all manner of promotions and advertising, e.g., headlines and body copy for ads, brochures, letters, article writing, TV, radio, and both commercial and non-profit promotional materials. It is both a definitive how-to and an idea book.<P>Whether you are starting from scratch and completely clueless or a professional seeking new ideas and approaches, this is a must have book.</span>

                    <span>As Bob explains, the goal of advertising is to make sales, not to entertain. Bob exposes this common error and offers many other copywriting techniques and tips in the book. He also gives some helpful information about freelancing.<P>I'm a technical writer (not a copywriter), but felt that this book had good things to offer. I think it also helped define my own style of writing.<P>If you are into freelancing and consulting, I'd also highly recommend his 'Six Figure Consultant' book. He gives a lot of good practical advice and seems to have a lot of experience.</span>
