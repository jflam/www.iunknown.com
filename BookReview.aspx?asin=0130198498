                    <span>I will preface this review with the fact that I have about 3 years experience with Openview, mostly basic install and use. I have attended the one week HP course as well. This book provides the beginner with a great amount of knowledge not included in the manuals, but you still seem to need a good network management consultant to get into the real gravy of Openview.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Blommers book should be required reading for anyone deploying HP's Network Node Manager. While reading a book is not a substitute for real-world experience, this book CAN help anyone deploying NNM from making common (and often costly) mistakes. I have been deploying NNM since version 3.31, and I have seen most (but not quite all) of the issues that Mr. Blommers raises. However, I wish there had been a book like this one to help me avoid some of the pitfalls that I didn't anticipate. With only ONE exception, I wholeheartedly recommend taking all of Mr. Blommers' suggestions/recommendations. The sole exception is regarding using "public" as your SNMP "Read" community string. This is a grave security blunder and should be avoided at all costs. You should be CONSISTENT with your SNMP community strings, as Blommers recommends, but do NOT use "public". Otherwise, read this book cover to cover and do everything it recommends.<P>Note: this book best serves people who have experience with NNM AND who have read HP's (free) manuals. Blommers assumes that you have the necessary experience/training and states that in his forward. If this book leaves you behind, it is probably because you don't have the necessary prerequisites. Also, I do not know and have never met Mr. Blommers.<P>My credentials: I have the following HP certifications (although I do NOT and have never worked for HP):<P>(1) HP OpenView Certified Consultant in UNIX Server and Application Management (IT/O 5.x)<P>(2) HP OpenView Certified Consultant in UNIX Server and Application Management (IT/O 5.x) Level 2<P>(3) HP OpenView Certified Consultant in Network Management (NNM 6.x on UNIX and NT)<P>(4) HP OpenView Certified Consultant in Network Management (NNM 6.x on UNIX and NT) Level 2<P>(5) HP OpenView Certified Integration Expert in Application and System Management (track 2)<P>(6) HP OpenView Certified Integration Expert in Network Management</span>

                    <span>This book provides a very good framework for "planning, implementing, and maintaining NNM" (quoted from the preface). The preface admits it is not a training manual, and the author himself recommends attending a training class before using this book. Therefore, the book was not really what I was looking for. It provides an excellent overview of how one would go about setting things up, but does not provide very many specific examples of how to do this. It's aim is more at the Network Manager instead of the ones actually doing the implementation. Since I have more of a development mindset, I found the lack of specific examples frustrating. There were many stories about how NNM had been set up in the author's extensive experience with the product, but not very many step by step procedures of how he did this. If you're looking for a technical manual, you might be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>I have been maintaining NNM for about 4 years now and I found this book to lack any real substance that could be applied to a real world environment inside a company of the enterprise or carrier class. It was more his personal experience with very little detail on how he accomplished his feats. It read more as an overview of what should be done with no real influence towards how it would be done. Anyone seriously deploying NNM on a network with greater then 1000 network devices would need a book that gave real world examples of how to accomplish certain things (HSRP problems, incorrect dns names, invalid snmp community strings etc.) not just a guide for what to expect.</span>

                    <span>I have participated in depolying the HP Openview Network Node Manager (NNM) less than a month and I am waiting for someone to share his experience in deploying the NNM on Enterprise Environment. I think the author's experience is worth for me because NNM is not as easy as Microsoft Windows NT. It involves long time site preparation, pilot team, and implementation procedure. <P>Certainly, the content is some out-of-date, for example the IT Operation has been changed to Vantage Point Operation ...<P>Surely , thank you for John Blommers!</span>
