<br />"but most naturally it will be C# developers over the next couple of years at least who will most likely be involved in the kinds of programming projects and architectures that Lhotka discusses. This book will benefit you! Therefore, while the VB.NET book proves its punch, the new C# version will find a more natural audience than the VB version"
<br />
<br />I can't believe that Dan Appleman's company would print such an over the top and unsubstantiated statement after all the research and details that Mr. Appleman has done about there being no fundamental "Type of Business Power" differences between C# and VB.Net.  
<br />
<br />I've been with the Rocky Method since VB5 and was happy to read the update for 6 and for 7 and happier to meet with the man while he was writing the VB7 edition and discuss some of the changes in his thinking on implmentation for .Net.  But knowing that the Corporate VB development community still dwarfs the C# community and that the Corporate VB community is still expected to design and release more Enterprise solutions than the C# community, that book description is just a slap in the face of the core APress customers and Lhotka readers.
<br />
<br />This has nothing specifically to do with the author's book (a port of the VB.Net version) ... If you are more comfy with C# than buy it, you will gain a lot and see why so many Enterprise solutions have been done with variations of Lhotka's CSLA in the past three versions of Visual Basic.  But it has a lot to do with truth vs myth, and I trust computer programming books a lot more when I see truth starting right on the cover.</span>

                    <span>I entered the world of OO programming by struggling through Lhotka's Visual Basic 6.0 Business Objects. It was eye opening to work with a full application framework that was clearly over my head. By working through his application time and again, I truly learned an immense amount, above and beyond what I would have learned otherwise. So, I enthusiastically purchased this book, expecting no less. Lhotka does not disappoint. I have learned a great deal more than I knew about C# while implementing the framework. Beyond that, the framework itself sovles multiple production level problems. This book is fantastic.</span>

                    <span>This is a huge book that covers a large swatch of business object material for .NET. It's unusual because I would expect to see this type of material for Java. It starts with a technology overview of the web and related technologies. It then goes into Object Oriented Analysis and Design. And finishes off with the implementation of these architectural concepts on the .NET platform. About a third of the book is spent in each area.
<br />
<br />I found the overall content wasn't particularly tight and focused, which adds to the books size, which is large for an architectural book. That being said there are a lot of good ideas and the content is well organized. If you are an architect looking to migrate to the .NET platform you should have a look at this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is an in-depth explanation of Lhotka's CSLA .NET framework.  It starts out by showing you how the framework was built.  Then it shows you how to use it.  A beginner should not read this book.  It's very technical.  I'm not a beginner but I'm also not an expert and there were points where I just gave up on understanding how he built the framework.  As I gain more .NET experience, I plan to go back and read the first part of the book again.
<br />
<br />I've been desperately look for a C# book that discussed a 3-tier architecture and how it should be applied in .NET.  This book does show you how it can be done but it's very complicated.  
<br />
<br />In reading this book, I've gained a good understanding of what can be accomplished by using a well thought out framework.  Am I using it?  No.  I got too confused trying to implement it.  That doesn't mean I don't want to use it.  It just means that my experience level at the moment is holding me back.

                    <span>For large programming projects, an object oriented approach is now widely acknowledged as superior to an earlier procedural methodology. On a separate front, for reasons like scalability and fault tolerance, a project might be implemented across different machines, in a distributed computing layout.
<br />
<br />As Lhotka explains, there are often times when it would be desirable to combine the two approaches. He lays out a multitier logical structure for a web application. Data is passed back and forth across the layers. A common problem is to validate the data according to some business logic. Traditionally, this might have been done at several layers, leading to code duplication and maintenance problems. Or, if it was implemented in only one layer, feedback about invalid data might be slow. An OO person would say, obviously, that you should wrap the data in an object that implements the business rules. 
<br />
<br />But passing this object between layers on different machines is not simple, to put it mildly. Lhotka offers us a framework that sits atop .NET to make this possible. He had an earlier version running under COM. But he shows how .NET is a far more powerful environment in which to redo the framework.
<br />
<br />He gives us an elegant approach to mixing object oriented and distributed computing under .NET. So much so that you might wonder why Microsoft did not already build this out.</span>
