                <span id="Label1">Give Powerful Speeches to Audiences of Five or Five Hundred  <P>There are several universal truths about public speaking. Most people hate doing it, and most don&#146;t do it well. And not surprisingly, most audiences retain just a fraction of a typical speech&#146;s content. Given these obstacles, why&#151;in an age of telecommunications tools such as videoconferencing and e-mail&#151;do we continue with "live" presentations at all?  <P>Communications expert Nick Morgan says we do so because speeches remain the most powerful way of connecting with audiences since ancient Greek times. But as television has ushered us toward a more informal, conversational mode of public speaking, we have forgotten much of what the Greeks taught us about the importance of form and structure in speech giving. Even more crucial, we&#146;ve lost the physical connection with an audience that does more than grab attention; it impels action.  <P>Morgan says this "kinesthetic connection" comes from listening to your audience with your whole body, through everything from eye contact to facial expressions to gestures. In Working the Room, he draws from nearly twenty years of experience as a speech coach and consultant to offer a new, audience-centered approach to public speaking that combines the best of ancient Greek oratory with modern communications research.   <P>Through entertaining and insightful examples, Morgan illustrates a practical, three-part process&#151;focusing on content development, rehearsal, and delivery&#151;geared toward engaging an audience on every level: emotional, intellectual, and physical. Presenters from novices to seasoned orators will learn how to:  <P>&#149; Craft an "elevator speech" that concisely nails the key message. <BR>&#149; Prepare a compelling "story line." <BR>&#149; Rehearse effectively. <BR>&#149; Involve the audience.  <BR>&#149; Choreograph body language to reinforce the core idea. <BR>&#149; Channel nervousness into positive energy and passion. <BR>&#149; Master the technical details of voice, posture, gesture, and motion during delivery.  <P>Whether speaking to a handful of employees or a keynote audience of hundreds, anyone can use these principles to give speeches that challenge minds, impassion hearts, and empower audiences to change the world, one idea at a time.  </span>

                    <span>The author introduces the idea of developing a kinesthetic connection with the audience by using opportunities for making intellectual, emotional, and even physical contact. The book provides specific strategies to help presenters prepare, rehearse, and master the art of giving speeches that challenge thinking and spark action.

                    <span>Finally, a truly great book concerning the art/craft of public speaking. If you heard advice like "picture the audience in their underwear", then you owe it to yourself to read "Working the Room". In this insightful and eminently useful text, Nick Morgan explodes the myths of bad speech-making and crafts a better mousetrap.<P>Morgan's central theme is that the the only reason to give a speeach is to "change the world". According to the author, a speech is not a collection of information rather it is a forum to showcase the unique passion of the speaker to sway hearts and minds in the audience. Morgan takes the reader through a thorough process of crafting a speech, rehearsing it, and rendering it to an audience in an entirely new and effective way. I guarantee that you will never think of giving a presentation the same way again. Hint: It has nothing to do with the quality of your PowerPoint.<P>Morgan's style is first rate. Filled with useful insights and stories, the book is lazer precise, witty, and absolutely right on time. No fuzzy thinking here. Just solid advice from a unique perspective. It's also an excellent length. It isn't too short and at the end, like many great reads, it leaves you wanting more!<P>If you are a person who presents on a regular basis or even if you are a neophyte looking to hone your speaking skills, there is only one book to buy and that's "Working the Room."</span>

Otherwise, stay away.</span>
