                <span id="Label1"> Practical and  down-to-earth in approach, this bestseller explores  the art of designing object-oriented software. It  offers basic design principles and a specific  design process that can be applied to any software  programming effort -- even those not using  object-oriented programming languages or  environments.  Covers the  concepts of object-oriented technology, presents a  process to apply those concepts, the tools to use  throughout the process, and examples to put it all  together.  For developers of  object-oriented software.</span>

                    <span>When I started learning Object Oriented Design, I was a C programmer with some COBOL experience. I was having a hard time making the paradigm shift to object orientation. This book was the best of several that I read. It was while reading this book that "the light came on". Since then, I've been recommending this book to anyone who is trying to make that paradigm shift themselves.<P>The book is language neutral - just as design should be. So you won't get hung up on examples in a language that you don't have. <P>Wirfs-Brock takes you through the design process, from the requirements to finished design, helping you understand how to discover your objects and assign responsibilities to them (Responsibility Driven Design (RDD)). She uses Class/Responsibility cards (similar to if not the same as CRC cards) to illustrate the documentation of information. Though there are more modern tools (UML) to capture some of this information, I still use these cards early in a design process because of the ease of changing/correcting them.</span>

                    <span>When the book is more than 10 years old and still a required literature in the area, that really tells you a lot. Especially if the area is software engineering where things tend to change quickly. After more than 10 years this book is still a fundamental reading from OO design. Even IBM recommends this book for it's Object Oriented Programming exam. First several chapters are really classic - everything is there: why OOP?, objects, classes, responsibilities, collaborations, hierarchies. If you read this first and then go for any C++/Java/put_your_favorite_oop_language_here book, everything is going to be much much easier and more clear even if you have a decent OO design background. There are even couple of presentations of complete implementations of fair software projects using the terminology and techniques described in the book (last two chapters). If you are beginner in OO design or you have to read just one "theoretical" book from OO design or don't know where to start concerning OO design, I recommend this one. The only drawback is that book is still pretty expensive, but I am sure that you will not regret...</span>

                    <span>This book is great because it makes sense. Its simply well thought out, consistent in its approach, and extremely insightful. Even if you dont use CRC cards or dont use the term "Responsibility Driven" in your work, you will find this text and the concepts it presents fit in nicely with the newer UML notation and "way of being." Although you won't find "Use Case" in the index, the stability of the common sense put into this book will map easily to whatever modeling doctrines you use. The fact that Amazon.com is shipping a software design book that is almost 10yrs old in 24hours should also tell you something about its credibility. Simply, a great book.</span>
