                    <span>Condi is an objective biography of Dr. Rice, beginning with her childhood experiences in Alabama, and continuing on with her rise to the White House.  The most interesting part of the book is the history of her family, and how they shaped her into the ambitious and intelligent woman she now is.  </span>

                    <span>I picked up this book to learn more about the woman who is our new Secretary of State and I'm glad I did. It seems she's been on the track to get where she is almost from the time she was born.
<br />
<br />Although born in segregated Birmingham, her parents tried to shield her from those realities and instead focused her upbringing on scholastic achievement and church. Her parents, very accomplished and community involved people, made sure Dr. Rice had every opportunity growing up. 
<br />
<br />The fact that Dr. Rice initially studied to become a concert pianist, until she realized she didn't have what it takes to be a success didn't surprise me. Neither did the fact that she was bright enough to skip two grades and was very young when she graduated college. I was suprised to learn that Dr. Rice initially registered as a Democrat and voted for Jimmy Carter. It was that administrations Soviet polices (and her belief in small government) that turned her into a Republican.  
<br />
<br />This book details the public face/life of Dr. Rice (the schooling, jobs, etc). Her private life is barely mentioned (no gossip here). For example, the fact that she's dated several football players is mentioned (briefly) but not discussed in any depth (the gentlemen's names aren't even included). What finally emerges is a portrait of an extremely bright, accomplished woman who loves her job, her friends and family and football. </span>

                    <span>   You don't have to agree with her views to be in awe of what this woman has accomplished. I for one am not a huge fan of the administration for which she belongs, but I figured since Condoleeza Rice is about to step into an historical position (the highest government position appointed to a black woman- Secetary of State), I better educate myself on the woman and her journey.
<br />  Condi-The Condoleeza Rice Story gives its readers an overview of this intriguing woman's life, but no more. I was pleased to find out more about her family background which is filled with scholars. Knowing more about her family history gives me a better understanding of why she is the way she is. The book goes on to detail every accomplishment Condi has made whether it be the University of Denver's "Senior Woman of the Year," Standford's provost, or National Security Advisor. I must admit that I was very disturbed and stunned to read of her connection to oil (served on Chevron's board,etc.) That definitely made me a little weary.
<br />  While this biography was very informative, it failed to shed light on Condi's personality. I would like to know more about the Condi that enjoys football and hanging out with her firends. </span>

                    <span>Condoleezza Rice was the object of intense curiousity earlier this year during the controversial 9/11 hearings. Although she revealed nothing except the standard public relations talking points, Rice maintained her poise in the onslaught of intense scrutiny. So it's no wonder the Bush administration has increasingly leaned on her to argue their position about the war in Iraq.<p>Antonia Felix's biography of Rice reads like an elongated resume of her subject and not much more. It's very much a public relations work as she dutifully cites Rice's accomplishments. However, anyone who has paid scant attention to Rice has heard it all before. Sure we learn of Rice's childhood in Birmingham during the height of the civil rights struggle, her love of football and classical music but we get no sense of what really makes her tick. <p>Is she an icy, cold blooded schoolmarm as many have suggested or is there in fact a personality behind the image she presents? Does she wholeheartedly believe in the policies she argues for on behalf of her employer or does she entertain any doubts? Rice is obviously an intelligent woman and I strongly suspect she's a more complex individual than her press, good or bad, lets us believe. I'm sure many would love to know how she reconciles her personal views  and beliefs as a preacher's daughter and African American with some of the  stands and policies of the people and institutions she has served as a spokesperson for. <p>Read this book if you want a recitation of Rice's career accomplishments but if you're looking for more you'll have to wait for another biography.</span>

                    <span>Condi: The Condoleezza Rice Story by biographer Antonia Felix paints a picture of a life divine. This is the story of how a little black girl from the segregated south rose to prominence to become one of the most powerful women in political history. A woman whose impact may affect America forever. Hers however is not a story of a poor little girl scuffling from the ravages of poverty to a top level Presidential appointment. Not a rags to riches story here. No, Rice was raised in the comfort of the educated middle class, a privileged daughter of the south, the quintessential BAP, (Black American Princess). <p>Born to a third generation college-educated family in Birmingham, Alabama, Rice knew well the family history of her paternal grandfather's journey from sharecropper to college graduate and she knew the legacy she inherited was not to be taken lightly. Both the Rices and The Rays (maternal line) were proud, educated folk. Her mother, Angelena Ray Rice, was an accomplished musician and school teacher when she met John Rice, a young Presbyterian minister. By the time Rice was three years old she was learning French and the piano. Though she was in the midst of the most heated time of the civil rights movement-- her hometown was known as Bombingham--, the coping methods of the black middle class was one that shielded their children from the insanity and horrors of Jim Crow. Rice's parents' response to her concerns about segregated facilities was that it was not her problem. When the amusement park opened one day of the year for blacks, they did not patronize it. Summers were spent at college campuses where her parents took graduate courses, one being the University of Denver. They eventually moved there when John took a position as professor and administrator. Rice excelled in music and ice skating though she was informed that she did not have the aptitude for college. Of course her parents dismissed the notion and Rice proved them wrong by excelling in her studies at private schools.<p>After entering the University of Denver at age fifteen, where she challenged a professor on the intelligence of blacks, Rice realized that while she was a good pianist, she was not great and therefore shifted her interests elsewhere. She took a class in Russian Studies and there she found her passion. She went on for advanced degrees and eventually ended up at Stanford University as a professor and then a provost. It was there she came to the attention of President George Bush. But it is under the present President George W. Bush's regime that she has flourished and received world wide attention as the National Security Advisor.<p>The book, in tedious detail, chronicles Rice's academic and political career, however, nothing was really revealed that could have been culled from articles and other media outlets. This reviewer anticipated reading this book to get a real picture of the Condoleezza Rice that the public is not privy to and have my knowledge expanded about this hard-to-read woman. I wanted to get into the head of this woman with the plastered smile and perfect demeanor. I wanted to know the real woman. But maybe the façade is just what it is.<p>Dera Williams<br>APOOO BookClub</span>
