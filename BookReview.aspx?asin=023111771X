                <span id="Label1">This classic work on nationalism, originally published thirty years ago and now reissued with a new preface by the author, provides excellent historical and political background to the profusion of recent nationalist movements in Eastern Europe. Miroslav Hroch develops and demonstrates empirically the concept of a three-stage process of nationalist mobilization: (1) heightened cultural awareness of national distinctiveness among intellectuals and literati, (2) a concept of nationalism as a political program, and (3) mass mobilization on behalf of this doctrine. Hroch shows how the character of a state&#180;s nationalism is shaped by the timing of each of these phases in relation to other social transformations, especially economic changes. <BR> Amid all the speculation and theorizing about the nationalist currents in contemporary Eastern Europe (as well as in other regions), Hroch&#180;s empirically based study helps counter the impulse toward easy and spectacular generalizations and provides sound footing for an informed approach to the topic.</span>

                    <span>Hroch's text has long been a standard text for serious scholars of nationalism, and it is very academic, not meant for nor very accessible to the general reader. In this book, Hroch deals with a very specific aspect of the development of nationalism, the so-called "national awakening" period (which he refers to as "Phase B"), in a specific place, northern Europe. His research focuses specifically on the cases of Norway, Bohemia (the Czechs), Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) and the Schleswig region (its Danish minority), and he looks for the social underpinning of nationalism by looking at the occupations and backgrounds of those who initially promoted the national idea, whom he calls "patriots." Hroch conducted very extensive and meticulous research, and his results are quite revealing. However, the section of the book in which he details the fruits of his labors makes for excruciatingly tedious reading, even for those very interested in the subject matter. The problem with this book is that the author seems to have a difficult time integrating its exclusive focus into the broader historical phenomenon that nationalism represents. One key problem, which has been noted by other reviewers, is that he fails to explain with sufficient clarity the transitions between phases (i.e. A, B and C) in his three-level theory of the initial development of nations. Also, there seems to be moments when the author extrapolates the results of his research into "patriots" onto the wider society without sufficient explanation, so readers may find themselves asking a number of questions afterwards. To his credit, Hroch admits the limited scope of his work several times in the course of the book, but this hardly makes up for its shortcomings. Nonetheless, this book is an althogether commendable and valuable contribution to the study of nationalism, albeit one with limited appeal.</span>
