                    <span>I couldn't help but address the comments of the reader that gave this work 1 star. It's interesting that he cites the territories annexed by Russia as Chinese / Japanese / etc. Where do you think Japan / China / etc. got those territories? Did he ever stop to think that at one point in time Japan, China, and any other country didn't have statehood, and the latter is always achieved through a painful process of unification by both doplomatic and military means? If same logic of denying a country its legitimacy based on forceful means of expansion is used consistently, then our great country of the USA should also be considered an illegitimate occupant of native American lands. Please let us adhere to commonly accepted methods of historical research and exposition, instead of expressing one's ill attitude toward a country using flawed reasoning.<P>The book at hand does indeed present a comprehensive coverage of Russian history, albeit in a somewhat dry fashion. Do not expect to finish this book and be left with crisp and colorful images of Russia's history. But what you can expect is a comprehensive coverage of every period of Russian history, complete with dates, names, and places. After a once-over, this book can be used as a reference, or a refresher on a particular timeframe in the history of the country. I am still looking for a more captivating work on Russian history, so anyone knows of any - please recommend.</span>

                    <span>I just read a "one star review" of this book, and it galled me. So I write this.<BR>This book is a STANDARD history of Russia, used by many, including my, college courses on the subject. It is generally considered a classic.<BR>If you want, or profess, to understand Russian history, this book is a must. Absolutely. First rate. NO, not without the author's personal imput. <BR>But what book is without that imput? NONE.<BR>Buy it, read it, and try to understand. Yes, read others, but read this first. <BR>THIS IS THE STANDARD TEXT.<BR>Take care and God bless your endeavors.</span>

                    <span>Do not expect gripping dramatic prose from this detailed history. This is an adequate text and reference but not likely suited for the information-seeking, recreational reader. Despite studying international relations for several years, my knowledge of Russian history exhibited glaring weaknesses. Riasanovsky's work continued to appear as I researched texts with which to fortify my deficiencies. All indications show it to be a classic work of Russian history, used in university courses for decades, and perhaps the most detailed one-volume work suited for a general audience. I found "A History of Russia" (Sixth Edition) to be informative, detailed, and faithfully updated (now encapsulating the fall of the Soviet Union and Russia under Yeltsin). Although a solid text, it is a difficult tome to conquer cover-to-cover as it fails to capture the literary senses of the reader.<P>Riasanovsky takes the reader mechanically through the development of the Russian state. He begins with the geopolitical landscape as it existed prior to the Russians then examines in detail the flowering of Kiev, the appanage system, and the Muscovite, imperialist, revolutionary, and Soviet eras. Riasanovsky's painstaking attention to detail and thorough familiarity with other historiographies provide the reader with a comprehensive evolutionary picture. For example, his illustration of the early appanage system and the continuation of class disparities well into the 20th century shed ample light on the fertile ground into which Vladimir Lenin was able to sow the communist theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His verbal portraits of leaders such as Ivan the Terrible and Catherine the Great give meaningful context to the power struggles and political imbroglios which characterized specific reigns. The addenda which have accompanied each new edition are less detailed and necessarily superficial. They provide sufficient material to update the reader on Russia's current state of affairs but beg for additional research by the more serious student.</span>

                    <span>For those interested in Russia and its past, this is not a bad place to start. It is as comprehensive as a 600 page volume can be. I read the Fourth Edition, so am glad to hear that it has been updated at least to the Gorbochov era. Riasanovsky is particularly adroit at representing early Russian history, with vivid accounts of the numerous invasions (Mongols, Vikings, Tatars, Teutons, etc.). After reading this book, one cannot help but understand the national paranoia and xenophobia that has been so much a part of Russian policy and posture throughout so much of its history. It also becomes clearer why Russia has historically needed a central "father" or "mother" figure to guide it through its tumultuous periods. <P> As to a reader's criticism, Riasanovsky is indeed somewhat biased, but certainly no more than the typical American historian writing about US History. He gives more than equal blame, for instance, to Nicholas II for getting his country involved in the Crimean War. He certainly never acts as an apologist for any of the Russian rulers at any stage, though his admiration for Peter the Great and Catherine can't be denied.<P> Poles, Ukranians, Lithuanians, etc. are not going to be won over by this book, but it is to the author's credit that the reader understands why they wont be. But winning anyone's approval is hardly Riasnovsky's object. He's primarily trying to tell the story of a people, and he succeeds on that level, quite brilliantly. The story he tells is complex and fascinating, to say the least. So many colorful and unforgettable characters advanced across Russia's historical stage, that any other country would be hard put to come up with such a cast or a saga.</span>

                    <span>Riasanovsky's History of Russia is written from an unapologetically imperialistic and outdated perspective. It belongs to Victorian times when armies traveled overseas to take control of weaker and less well armed territories and peoples. Except that in the Russian case, no overseas risks were taken. Instead, the Russians preferred contiguous conquest of non-Russian territories which were renamed "Russia" as soon as they came under Cossack control. A prime example of this type of conquest is Siberia and "the Russian Far East" which remain the only parts of Asia presently controlled by a non-Asian military power. Even the voracious British did not call India "Britain."<P>Riasanovsky's book contains countless omissions, inaccuracies, distortions, and plain untruths which together create an image of Russia as a nation state rather than a colonial empire; a benign power that subjugated those in need of tutelage. Nowhere in this book is there a mention of the unspeakable destruction wrought on peoples and territories by the centralized Moscow government which robbed, stole, or burned whatever could not be stolen as soon as it conquered, and left behind a network of spies comparable to those of the Mongol Khans. Nowhere does Riasanovsky explain why and by what means the kingdom of Muscovy conquered territory hundreds of times its size, and then claimed bogus origins in Kiev. <P>Ask any Chinese, and he will rattle off names of territories taken away by force from their original Asian inhabitants and annexed by Moscow. Ask a Japanese what he thinks of what resembles a robbery in plain view (see Riasanovsky euphemistic description of this robbery which, he says, cost the Russians "considerable casualties, for the Japanese did resist." In her book, Kalpana Sahni tells a terrifying story of what the Russian empire did to the Central Asian and Caucasus peoples. Has anyone ever asked why the fertile territories near the Black Sea were so deprived of human settlements that Chichikov could plan to settle his "dead souls" there? Has anyone read the history of those peoples written from THEIR point of view? <BR> <BR> In our own time, the killings and torture of tens of thousands of Chechens (a small nation that still resists Russian aggression) testify to a nearly total absence in Russian culture of resistance to Russia's relentless aggression against those neighbors who are weaker, less numerous, or located in economically advantageous areas. <P>There is no reflection in Riasanovsky's book on this imperialistic past and present. The story might have been told by Father Christmas: Russia was born, then it grew, and grew, and grew. <BR>This kind of story belongs to imperialism's heyday in the nineteenth century. Only a shortage of histories of Russia written by unbiased scholars makes this extremely biased, not to say propagandistic, volume pass for a good introduction to Russian history for American students.</span>
