                <span id="Label1">Here, the man who started the "food revolution" with the million-plus-selling Diet for a New America, boldly posits that, collectively, our personal diet can save ourselves and the world. If, according to chaos theory, the beating of a butterfly's wing can cause a hurricane in another part of the world, try this out for chaotic cause and effect: monarch butterflies are dying in droves due to genetically-engineered corn growing in the Midwest. There is also a direct correlation between the Big Mac in your hand and the mile-wide river now running across the North Pole. Learn the truth about foods we are eating that are, in Robbins' words, "unsafe on any plate."</span>

                    <span>This is a book that deals with the varied issues that arguments for vegetarianism are concerned with: health, animal rights, environmental damage, and John Robbins also includes a section on genetic engineering. <P>Though he makes a lot of important points (with which I agree), I was extremely annoyed with the tone of the book. I felt like I was reading some spiritual self-help book. Though this may be the author's style and may also attract an audience, it was a little too dumbed down for comfort. <P>Still, Robbins has spent much time on his meticulous research (even if some of his sources are biased), and there are many arguments in here whether valid or not, that you might want to think about when you decide what to eat. Small actions like buying food at a grocery store or restaurant really do matter, and the possible consequences of your decisions might shock you.<P>FOOD REVOLUTION will surely make vegetarians feel good about what they do, provide them with some arguments for anti-vegetarians, and will probably change the way some readers eat. But there's really nothing new here that you can't read in other books. I think Erik Marcus' VEGAN: THE NEW ETHICS OF EATING is better at discussing the reasons why people choose to eat plant-based diets, and Virginia Messina's VEGETARIAN WAY is indispensable for understanding the nutritional aspects of vegetarian diets. And these books don't try so painfully hard to pull at your heartstrings.</span>

                    <span>The Food Revolution is a remarkable book. John Robbins was heir to the Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune, but turned it down to become a vegan activist. His earlier book Diet for a New America, published in the mid-80s, opened a lot of people's eyes to the horrible conditions animals live in on American "factory" farms. Now even many omnivorous people I've met will not eat veal, for example, and hopefully may come to see foie gras the same way.<P>When reading both of these books, I at times felt numbed by the large number of statistics, detailing the harmfulness of animal products in the diet, the destruction of the environment caused by factory farming, and the potential dangers of genetically-modified foods. In some ways this was preaching to the choir for me, as I'd been vegetarian and already trying to go vegan for years.<P>But beyond all of the statistics and doom-and-gloom predictions, there was a stronger message: of compassion. Robbins is one of the very, very few authors who has moved me to tears. I'm hardly a person who never cries, but when I do it's usually because of some petty personal reason (relationship troubles, etc.). But reading his books has showed me not only how wonderful and precious our animal friends are, but how opening up and truly listening to people you may not agree with can be transforming.<P>I hope more people read his books. Robbins really does cover pretty much all of the reasons why I am a mostly-vegan vegetarian: health, ethical, and environmental, and has plenty of footnote references for validation and further information. Yet despite what he's written, Robbins himself doesn't say that everyone should become a vegan; he states "I don't care whether you call yourself a vegan, a vegetarian, or an asparagus". He just wants to inform people of the issues involved, and hopes that if enough people are convinced, the world (America in particular) will move toward a more plant-centered diet.</span>

                    <span>Yes any vegitarian can come up with great arguments as to why we should not eat meat,this book is no different. My reply to all people who have the ability to pick their diet is, meat eaters as well, "Don't you feel great that we live in a country that has a cornicopia of food, that we even have the ability to chose what we can and cannot eat?" I have been to many places in the world twhere food is very scarce. Because of who was governing their country, nothing else, was the reason there was no food. The Leaders of the country kept the food away from the masses, this is done as a way to controle the masses. Oh yes, how come a lot of the vegeterians I know smoke (which is way worse than meat} tell people to be vegeterians. Are they vegetarians because it's cool. Smoking is also cool(sarcasm).<BR> My main point is that we in the US can pick any type of diet we want, we should be thankful for that.</span>

                    <span>I read John Robbins's "Diet For A New America" many years ago and have been passing it on to friends ever since. I had been a vegetarian for almost 10 years when I read "Diet," but it wasn't until I read Robbins's book that I understood why. I had a basic feeling that it was wrong for animals to suffer, but I had never really educated myself about what that suffering entailed. Moreover, I had very little understanding of the nitty gritty of the other arguments for vegetarianism/veganism. "Diet" absolutely shocked me when I read it, and it shocked my meat-eating boyfriend when I gave it to him to read; we both became vegan [basically] overnight. ...Fabulous though "Diet" is, it's wonderful to have an updated resource, given everything that has changed since it was published. "The Food Revolution" covers all the basics of gmo crops, mad cow disease, and the health, animal rights, environmental, and human hunger arguments for eating less meat and dairy products. I would highly reccomend this book, both for meat-eaters and committed vegetarians/vegans alike. I have taken to asking friends and family to read "Food Revolution" as their birthday or Christmas present to me. It's a fast, compelling read, with enough anecdotes to keep you going and plenty of great pull-quote type statistics. And most importantly, I really believe this is a book that can change lives. If you only read one book on vegetarianism, it should be this one! If you only give friends and family members one book on vegetarianism, it should be this one!</span>
