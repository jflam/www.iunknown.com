                    <span>Bad Boys II... A movie chockfull of flying cars, drugs, profanities a mile long, comedy, action, great shooting scenes, breif nudity, some things that might turn some stomachs... All, when mixed together and given to Director Michael Bay, come out as the perfect sequel. <P>One thing that makes me give thumbs up (so to speak, I'd never do it in real life) to sequels is if the original cast returns. Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowry (Smith) return along with the rest of cast to bring justice to the streets of LA once again. It starts out with just as much action as I expected, guns blazing, fire, the KKK getting in some BIG trouble, the usual comedy, and of course, an injury that brings even more laughs. <P>The sequel has basically the same plot with steroids. More drug dealers, but this time it's 'X' also known as Ecstacy as the drug being dealt by a Cuban kingpin. The case is already complicated, but when Marcus's sister is seen with the very people Mike and Marcus are trying to put behind bars everything is turned upside down. <P>This movie, due to the language, graphic death scenes, and breif nudity, should not be viewed by children. (Being a teenager myself I should know) So when you buy this movie, make sure to watch it when there are no impressionable young minds in the atmosphere. But, overlooking the few flaws the movie has, it is a large improvement from the first installment and anyone who loves action should buy it, no questions about it. So whatcha gonna do? Buy it.</span>

                    <span>Bad Boys II<P>Movie: 3 Stars<BR>DVD: 4.5 Stars<P>Bad Boys II is an outstanding summer flick. The key phrase is SUMMER FLICK. Hence, the three star rating for entertainment. This movie is essentially a montage of over-the-top action sequences peppered with some doses of humor from Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. If you are interested in seeing major action and eye candy with no concern for a plot, this is your movie. However, if you do not have a great capacity for suspension of disbelief, please avoid this movie. <P>With these caveats in mind, Bad Boys II is essentially about Lawrence and Smith returning as Miami renegade cops Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey chasing drug runners in the local area. Complications ensue when Marcus' sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union) is working undercover for the DEA on the same case as the dynamic duo. Mike and Sydney are also carrying a discreet relationship under Marcus' nose. These three characters do the unthinkable, escape the impossible, and achieve their objective without a problem. <P>This movie is a great starting point for music video directors because it was directed by former music video director Michael Bay. Bay is an expert of providing unique camera angles and stylistic flourishes to liven up action scenes. In essence, style without substance. The pacing of the movie is pedal-to-the-metal but the movie does some hard braking in between. The Rock (1996) represents Bay's best balance of style, substance, and pacing. Lawrence and Smith have good chemistry together, essentially to the buddy action/comedy genre, but the overabundance of action tends to drain from their scenes. It does not help when a scene with Lawrence hopped up on a designer drug seems to have been put in there for filler. Some sequences tend to have this effect, but it is a SUMMER FLICK. The first Bad Boys focused a little bit more on their relationship and character. It also was a modestly budgeted film with a better sense of pace and rhythm. This sequel obviously has a bigger budget, and Bay overindulges himself and the viewer to the max. The movie runs at almost 2.5 hours, and it definitely feels about 40 minutes overlong, but for that pure action fan, it's worth your time. The DVD is a 2-disc set. The first is the movie and the second is chock full of extras as is typical of Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer productions.</span>

                    <span>I actually liked this one better than the first! Could've done without all the language though. Even the Lethal Weapon films didn't have all that cursing but other than that.<P>Don't get me wrong, I ain't bashing that part of it. It has it place but a lot of times they were just cursing just to be doing it it seemed. Still a great film overall and a nice touch adding the incredible Gabrielle Union to the mix!</span>
