                <span id="Label1">The second edition of Peter Block's <I>Flawless Consulting</I> gracefully updates what many consider the best resource of its kind. New chapters on implementation, "whole-system" strategies, and ethics are included, but in general it simply fine-tunes Block's proven advice to match the transformations that business and society have undergone since initial publication two decades ago. "The days of long studies and expert-driven answers are passing," the author proclaims in his new preface. "The task of the consultant is increasingly to build the capacity of clients to make their own assessments and answer their own questions." He then subtly modifies his established recommendations accordingly for every step, from the initial client meeting and problem diagnosis through data collection and the execution of solutions. In the section on "Conducting a Group Feedback Meeting," for example, he advises: "Treat the group as a collection of individuals.... Ask each person what he or she wants from the meeting. This will surface differences and force the group to take responsibility for some of the difficulties that may arise."  <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>When I first start reading this book, my thought was "wow! -- this guy is making money from this?!?" 
<br />
<br />Having only couple years consulting experience, I thought I would eventually happen upon some useful information. I did not encounter one piece of information a thinking person wouldn't already know or figure out on his own. It's too general to be of use in any specific situation and it does't really promote any systematic processes. If you're naturally self-reflective and straightforward with others, you really just don't need this book. 
<br />
<br />This book could be improved if it employed case studies rather than always talking in generalities. </span>

                    <span>I cut my consulting teeth on the first edition of Block's book. Oddly enough, I came across the book when a client suggested it to me, not my own firm. 
<br />
<br />The second edition, which was years in the making, is an A to Z guide to the practice of authentic, ethical and client-focused consulting.
<br />
<br />Block starts with the principles of contracting (proposing), and easily moves through the rest of the client project cycle, including how to work with a resistant client, gathering data and implementation. 
<br />
<br />You can read this book in its entirety, or pick a  relevant chapter and dive in. Unlike some books, this is one that you'll refer back to over and over, as it has information on just about every situation a consultant will face. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 18 includes a frank discussion of what Block calls "Ethics and the Shadow Side of Consulting" where he addresses the disturbing ethical issues he sees in today's consulting industry. His discussion of ethics is a refreshing and timeless reminder of the  bright ethical lines consultants should obey as they ply their craft. 
<br />
<br />The value of the book is that it has an answer for most every consulting issue or dilemma. Few books treat this subject in such an ambitious, effective and readable manner. This isn't the typical boring tome many consultants feel compelled to write. Block's writing style is lively and engaging.

                    <span>A respected colleague recommended the first version of this book to me many years ago.  It is still on a top ten list for all books needed for anyone performing HR work (as a classic "internal consultant").  HR professionals who want to be successful and, almost as importantly, want to be happy in their work and its outcomes need to read this book and get prepared for new dimensions in understanding and service.
<br />
<br />I'm so glad Block decided to update this classic work, since so much has changed.  However, after reading the new version, it really does seem that his genius in the earlier work was so durable that its core wisdom aged amazingly well.</span>

                    <span>This has to be one of the biggest bargains I've seen on Amazon.<p>If you're the sort of person who people turn to for help, this book should be on your shelf. Before I was through the bare 200 pages, I saw how the concepts would apply directly to not only the business world but to such far-flung areas as political activism & relationship counseling.<p>Peter Block makes clear that he is addressing his ideas not only to "outside" freelancers, but to "inside consultants," company troubleshooters, as well. He's done a remarkable job.<p>The most powerful chapters are those (8 & 9) that examine the problem of resistance to change, thoroughly & precisely describing the different forms of resistance, what they mean, & how to deal with them in order to maximise productive change.<p>The book won't make you a consultant -- you still have to have some sort of expertise in a given area. However, if you're already acting in a consultative capacity, it'll very quickly raise your effectiveness.<p>And the book was fairly priced when it was published. Now that you can pick up a copy for a dollar or two, it's nothing short of a steal. Buy a few copies & share.</span>
