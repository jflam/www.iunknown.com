                    <span>Hal and Evan have produced an excellent overview of the field of reliable computer systems which is useful to system administrators, system architects and to non-technical people who need a general understanding of the field.<P>As a system architect with a programming background facing the task of designing a simple highly reliable system this provided an excellent perspective on the different issues and technologies. It left me well prepared to then delve into the product literature of specific products that addressed the issues relevant to the project.<P>I believe this would also be an excellent book for IT managers who are looking at commissioning a "high availability" system, whether from an external software integrator or an internal company IT department. In particular, it describes what is easily achievable, what is achievable only at great expense, and what is simply not doable. It also emphasises the roles and responsibilities of people involved in ongoing support of HA systems; this book clearly describes how creating such a system is not the end but the start of providing reliable services.<P>The reading will be challenging for those of non-technical background, but the book keeps its focus on why you would use each technology rather than simply how each is applied, which makes it relevant to a wide range of readers. It should also ensure that this book remains useful even as technologies change.<P>What this book does not do is provide a formula for setting up a system. It's a great first step, though.<P>In addition the writing is clear, structure and flow are good and mistakes are few. Not the lightest of reads, but then again this is a serious topic about systems worth serious money. And at 550-odd pages of dense reading material, this book is well worth investing in.</span>

                    <span>One of the most interesting things about this book is that it treats the subject of availability as more then just a technology issue. It goes into areas such aas basic good systems admin practices, Physical placement of equipment, building and facility services. Availabilty is more then just Raid disks, HA software and redundant hardware. They do a very good job explaining all aspects of HA, and giving interesting real world examples in thier short interludes. The new last chapters adds a lot of relevence, exploring sept 11th and its effect on trading. A good informative read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>as I was reading this otherwise excellent book, I noticed that there was a very important theme (to my understanding), which wasn't honored enough attention; namely, issues relating to the 'Secure Socket Layer' protocol and availability, which directly translates to money coming your or someone else's way.<P> How does it affect the HA and your web applications architecture? SSL Certificates in a HA setting? . . . etc. All diagrams would present the web farm directly facing the internet!?<P> I even stopped reading and went to the index looking for it and found that there were indeed two -very basic- blurbs on it on pages 301 and 352.<P> I know security is a theme by itself, but the relationship between security issues and HA is way too fundamental to simply skim over them. As a matter of fact I would say that number one issue affecting HA is security.<P> Also the book has a very SA oriented (am I talking about another book already? ;-)) style. I would like to read a little more about 'the Physics' of it. For example, cosmic rays' (I am not joking), like neutrinos, influence on the proper/stable functioning of computers is greater than the, comparatively speaking, very anomalous 'split brain' types of errors and more on, electric accidents, the effective use of ECC memory. Should it go in the Web servers, too, in addition to the data centers? Why?<P> Cabling and electromagnetic inductance issues are mentioned in the 'Tales from the Field', but I could see some people expecting a more rounding explanation/solution to the 'tales'. In the case in which they talk about a java web server people might have the impression that 'Java' or its use in a web server was wrong, which <BR>I could tell was most probably not the case, but the use of JSP without specifying the sessions shouldn't be automatically created, which is the default many developers forget.</span>

                    <span>Very good coverage of HA issues. Many people get a warm fuzzy having one piece of kit that is "reliable" or "redundant". To get substantial gains in availability requires a more complete systems view. This book reviews many aspects, and paths that can be taken towards increasing availability. I heartily recommended this book.</span>
