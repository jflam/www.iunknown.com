                    <span>The book is so organized that you can find a drink and mix it even while intoxicated! :) The first chapter is short and sweet, it basically tells you what a well-stocked bar should look like, what it should have, etc... Then it get's to the drinks... in alphabetical order and categorized by its main ingredient the chapters are as follows... Bourbon drinks, Brandy drinks, Gin drinks, Rum, Scotch, Tequila, Vodka, and Whiksy drinks... the last chapters list Tropical drinks, apertifs, and cordials... but wait! There's more!!... It's got Wine drinks, beer and beer concoctions, hot drinks, party punches that really pack a punch! and of course... non-alchoholic drinks for us designated drivers! A great well-organized book! You'll definitely use it around the holidays (all of them!)... Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I must say I disagree with the point made in Mona L Moloney's review. She says the book is unusable because it is organized by ingredient, rather than by drink. What she is missing is that this book is to be used at HOME, not at a bar. The point to the way the book is organized is is that many home bars will have only a subset of all the kinds of alcoholic ingredients available, so the home user probably will want to look things up by ingredient to see what they are capable of making with what's on hand. Besides, there is an index anyway, so what's the problem? Just bear in mind that this book is designed for home use and for that it is quite useful. It could use a few more drinks, though. I must admit it is missing some obvious ones.</span>

                    <span>It is not really needed but I will chime in and say it is the first drinks book I got, and the only one of the many I now have that I use. The others are OK for specialty applications but the sheer number of drinks in this one makes it an amazing experience. stellar are the introductions to each base ingredient section; how is gin made; is whiskey and whisky the same thing? Etc etc. A great buy!</span>

                    <span>Although at first I was a little disappointed with the manner in which the recipes are arranged, once I figured out how to find what I wanted I quickly realized that this is an excellent volume. Someone will always complain about a recipe that is either not included or is different than the one that they know. I feel, however, that any bartender worth his salt would have read more than one book on bartending anyway. I did also like how this book included a guide on how to set up a bar. Overall, a great buy!</span>

                    <span>I use this book fairly often and I respect the amount of work put into it. It is easy to use to find drinks and its format better allows the reader to encounter new ones. That is the great strength of organizing the book by main ingredient/type. If you know you like gin or scotch, you can find drinks that feature them. If you like tropical drinks, this is a surprising goldmine of ideas, as it has a good section for them. You don't have to flip through the entire alphabet to get an idea of the drinks you can make with the various bases. The one point of confusion I find is with some tropical drinks outside of that section. As any fool should know, many rum drinks are tropical, so looking in both sections would benefit you. But after all there's always the INDEX!<P>If you are trying to find a specific drink that you don't know how to make, why on earth wouldn't you use the alphabetically arranged index? Drinks in the index aren't listed just under their ingredients, they are also list by name. But the ingredient index is also very useful in planning the expansion of your bar. ... <P>The opening sections on how to do the things you need to do to set up your bar is useful. It's not complete by any means, but it's adequate for the beginner and intermediate home bartender. I find some of the recommendations for the stocking process odd. For example, Anisette, Pernod/Ricard, and Sambuca are all listed as items a small bar should have, yet these ingredients are hardly used in the enormous collection of drinks the Bible boasts. They also impart relatively the same flavor, and if that's what matters to you then you'd be better with one and then wait a long time to get the others. Irish Cream and other crucial ingredients don't make the "Small bar" list. <P>About drinks it doesn't have... oft-mentioned "Hurricane" is one I've seen in MANY different forms, so there is no sort of concensus on how it is made. It doesn't have many drinks that have become trendy, but it would be impractical to carry the latest drinks which rise to popularity quickly. However, I could see how a new edition could trim maybe 100 of the truly odd, obvious, or repetitive drinks to make room for some new ones. If you're trying to impress your friends by making "Flirtini"s then I suggest you scour the internet.<P>Overall, this book would put you well on your way to establishing a real home bar. The Bible has some cool introductions and stories for the sections and cocktails, which whet your appetite for more. It is the first book you should own if you wish to enter the wonderful world of cocktails, but by no means the only one... it all depends on where you want to go from here.</span>
