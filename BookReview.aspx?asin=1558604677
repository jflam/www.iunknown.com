                    <span>Nilsson's book presents all major areas of artificial intelligence from the unifying perspective of the problem of constructing an intelligent agent. Many of the important subfields of AI are introduced, including machine learning. The book is clearly written and can be understood if you have a good knowledge of computer science. (Yon certainly don't need a doctorate degree in mathematics, as claimed by anothe reviewer).</span>

                    <span>This book was frustrating in some ways. It start giving details about parts of AI, then it stops. It covers to much material, and with not enough detail. It does list the references, so you can always go there and get more detail.<P>If you have a decent background in calculus, then the mathematics in this book should not be that daunting. If you are a philosophy major trying to learn about AI, then you might find this book difficult. <P>I really don't see much difference between this book and some of the other intro to AI books on the market. They try to cover to much material and something is bound to be left uncovered or superficially covered.</span>

                    <span>The field of artificial intelligence has an interesting history, both in terms of its content and the philosophical debate it has provoked. The field could also be loosely described as divided into two camps, those who view it as a collection of highly sophisticated algorithms, and those who view it as an attempt to create machines that exhibit human-level intelligence. Ironically, in the latter camp, it is difficult to assess the progress that has been made, since criteria for measuring machine intelligence are never explicitly given. Instead, dependence has been made on the "Turing test" for intelligence, a test that is difficult to apply, and in fact can be said to be too vague for a practical, objective assessment of machine intelligence. <P>	This book is written more in the context of the latter camp, than in the former. However, in-depth discussion of the Turing test is not given, and this actually is one of the main virtues of the book, although the author clearly believes that the purpose of doing research in artificial intelligence is to achieve human-level intelligence. As he remarks in the last paragraph in the book, it was written to overview the techniques that he believes are required to achieve human-level intelligence. Although he does not explicitly give the reader tests for machine intelligence that will allow progress to be measured, he devotes a small portion of the book to various ideas on just what constitutes intelligence. <P>	The book also gives a general (and sometimes very brief) overview of the algorithms used in artificial intelligence. Search heuristics, neural networks, and genetic programming are some of the topics that are covered. The influence of the "intelligent agent" paradigm, that is now taking the AI community by storm, is very apparent throughout the book. The author though does not neglect some of the topics in "good-ole-fashioned" artificial intelligence that arose decades ago and is still applicable today, especially in the field of logic programming. These topics include resolution in both the propositional and predicate calculus, and in expert systems. By far the best discussion in the book is on knowledge-based systems and evolving knowledge bases. This topic has taken on considerable importance in recent years due to the importance of data mining and business intelligence. <P>	Readers who are considering artificial intelligence as a career choice will find good motivation by reading this book. The field also is quite different than most others in that it respects a high degree of individual creativity and ingenuity, and has a high bandwidth for new ideas. Beginning with its origins in the 1950s, the field has grown by leaps and bounds, but its applications have exploded in the last five years, fueled mainly by business and financial applications. Concerned not only with achieving human-level capabilities, but also with other forms of intelligence and how they can be useful, artificial intelligence has become one of the predominant forces in the twenty-first century. One can only be excited and optimistic about its further advances.</span>

                    <span>In general avoid this book.<BR>I purchased this book for a course, and unfortunately this is my first book. Its 95% maths, of course AI is a lot of math, but the book is so abstract and nothing related to practical stuff. Take convolution filters, it gives integrals and all that stuff, but what exactly does it do, how does it perform it on images, and where the heck are sample images, and sample matricies. <BR>I bet this author must have sent this book out to teachers so that 50 students would have to buy this over priced book with no practicle use and so hard to read/understand and extremely dense.</span>
