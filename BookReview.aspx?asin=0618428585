                    <span>Not only is this book beautifully illustrated and easy to understand, it really allows parents to involve little ones in the story.  Although the story is straightforward, the absence of written words allows one to alter the storyline in an infinite number of ways.  Little ones may make up their own stories, as well.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the best aspect of this book is the fact that the cover is red.  This allows the child to believe that they have found the red book!  In our household, the end of the story is that the red book found its way to the bookstore, where Mommy and Daddy picked it up.  Now, our little one has new friends who are probably reading about him right now, too!
<br />
<br />As an aside, I wonder whether this book has reminded anyone else of the "Take On Me" video...</span>

                    <span>It's official.  The results are in.  The year 2004 can now officially be declared the "Best Year of Wordless Picture Books" on record.  This little appreciated genre of fiction has rarely ever been given its due.  Yet now we can enjoy such marvelous stories as "The Boy, the Bear, the Baron, the Bard" by Gregory Rogers and "Home" by Jeannie Baker.  And then, to top it all off, is the frosting on the cake.  "The Red Book" by Barbara Lehman, which stretches the boundaries of picture books everywhere and spices up its story with a distinctly post-modern edge.  Some author/illustrators might find it exceedingly difficult to write a picture book, within a book, within a book, without adding so much as a gasp or sigh to dot the text.  Not Lehman.  The result is this marvelous Caldecott Honor winner that deserves your full undivided attention.
<br />	
<br />The story is a misleadingly simple one.  A girl walking through a gray winter cityscape finds the corner of a bright red book peeking out of a snowbank by the sidewalk.  She rescues the item and takes it with him to school.  A quick perusal of it shows that it is a story about a warm sunny island, where a boy walking along the sand also finds a red book, this time peeking out of a sandbank.  As the boy on the beach reads it he sees that is a story about a city... in which a girl in her classroom is reading about him.  The two kids realize what is happening and are intrigued.  So what is the natural solution to this problem?  The city girl leaves school for the day and buys as many colorful balloons as she can from a local street vendor.  The balloons carry her up... up... up above the industrial uniformity below, causing her to accidentally drop the book.  It lands on a sidewalk where we see the island boy sitting on the sand waiting.  As the wind flips the pages of the book the island boy sees the city girl coming in for a landing and they joyfully meet up with one another.  Then the red book closes and someone else picks it up and rides away on his bicycle.  Undoubtedly to participate in a whole new adventure.
<br />	
<br />Did you get all that?  It's a little difficult to summarize this tale if only because Lehman, as an author/illustrator, is so doggone adept.  And though it sounds complex, I assure you that almost every five-year-old you show it to will grasp the concept immediately.  This is the kind of story that teaches them all about breaking down the fourth wall... in a preschool kinda way.  Entirely aside from the concept, however, are Lehman's great pictures.  It's funny, but until now Lehman hasn't illustrated or written anything particularly well-known.  Her style is like that of a sophisticated Amy Schwartz (of "What James Likes Best" fame), with simple characters and distinct lines.  But where Schwartz relies on simplicity to the point of wide open spaces, Lehman has filled this particular book with beautiful geometric lines and angles.  The city girl's classroom is all angles and kids in straight rows.  And she's especially good at distance and characters' points of view.  For example, when the city girl floats above his shrinking metropolis and drops the red book you have a beautiful view through her eyes of the book falling to the street, far below her little blue boots.  Then there are the colors.  In the city, everything has that dull uniformity of a wintery city.  On the island everything is bright and sunshiny (making for a lovely contrast when the boys see one another through the book).  Finally, the city girl's method of travel, her balloons, are bright beautiful multicolored orbs that are just as noticeable in the urban sky as they are the island.
<br />	
<br />For a logical pairing to this story, consider reading "The Red Book" alongside David Wiesner's, "The Three Pigs".  Both stories present deft original deconstructions of old picture book motifs in a style that kids everywhere will wonder at and enjoy.  Admittedly, after reading this book I am a little sad that "Kitten's First Full Moon" (which I loved... don't get me wrong) won the Caldecott in 2005.  But at least this story has gotten the full attention it so richly deserves.  A lovely addition to any child's collection and a truly memorable tale.

                    <span>  The Red Book is a seemingly simple story that, in the end, proves to be pretty thought-provoking.  Parents, if you've dismissed this book as a "kiddie" book and not for your 4-8 year old, then reconsider.  
<br />
<br />A small girl donning winter clothing sees a red book on the side of the sidewalk, while walking to school.  So what does she do; she picks it up and takes it along to school.  During class, all our protagonist can think about is the book.  That's when she opens this red book, and finds a map, which shows an island, and then a boy, who sees another read book in the sand...
<br />
<br />The pictures are good enough, with bold colors and black outlining each object.  Lehman has written a book that will surely jump-start her career.

                    <span>I love this little book. Personally, I think it's one of the best picture books to come along in ages! A girl finds a red book in a snowdrift. Inside are pictures of a boy on a tropical island. The boy is also reading a red book. Curious. His red picture book shows a girl in the city who is reading a book about a boy on an island... hey, woah! Lehman's illustrations beautifully convey the unique twist of this magical story/brain teaser for the very young (and not so very young.) The story is an inspiring message about the power of books transcending time and space to bring people together. For me, the best part about The Red Book is that it's a book within a book. The reader is not simply an observer, but a participant of sorts (since they're reading The Red Book too!)  I predict The Red Book becomes a classic.</span>
