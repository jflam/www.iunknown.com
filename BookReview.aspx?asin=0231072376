                    <span>I seem to be in a minority here, but I disliked this book so much I didn't even finish it. It now resides at the bottom of my trash can. 
<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm somewhat of a "born-again Taoist." The Lao-Tzu saved my life, and between that and Thomas Merton's "The Way of Chuang-Tzu," my entire life philosophy and outlook has shifted radically.
<br />The hard part is conveying the reasons for my distaste of this book. It may be because the only real redeeming parts are those directly copied from the Lao and Chuang Tzu. It may be because, after reading Merton's explaination of the "three in the morning" analogy, I cannot agree with A.C. Graham's translation, both in feeling and in words. Far, far too literal and intellectual. Taoism is, for me, about not trying to understand things, but rather letting them be. 
<br />If you are a scholar and writing papers or such, it might be good for you. For the spiritual seeker, if you need more Taoist thought, I would recommened reading different translations of the Lao-Tzu or Chuang-Tzu. It's really all you need.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Graham has given us a very readable, enjoyable English version of a major Taoist work. Lieh Tzu followed Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu as the third major Toaist writer, at least as Western readers understand.
<br />
<br />This can't be read wholly at face value, as Graham explains. Lieh often co-opted Confucius as a spokesman for Lieh's teachings, a standard technique when reference to the old sages was required. Graham gives plenty of notes showing where that happened, and how. Lieh also took over some of Chuang's teachings, but in Lieh's own way. That was a time when many competing schools fought against each other, but none could fight against the ancient sages or the dominant Confucians - it wasn't subterfuge, but accomodation of Lieh's views to his reading audience.
<br />
<br />This is a readable, but often contradictory text. Graham starts each chapter with a bit of explanation. I do wish that he had more clearly set his commentary off from Lieh's text, though. Graham makes up for that lack of clarity by showing which parts of the text were most likely later accretions. For many reasons, these old Chinese texts are often the writing of many hands, not all of whom agreed with each other, and Graham helps us unwind which writing is which. 
<br />
<br />Through it all, Lieh's voice dominates. He is serene and practical. He often spins tales of immortals flying through clouds and living on dew, but more often describes ferrymen or shepherds. He preaches submission to The Way, but the book also describes a hedonsitic fatalsim - if destiny has already declared my future, then why should I not drink and be merry? This is where Graham's notes are most helpful, in sorting out which is the original text from and which parts were added by unknown authors.
<br />
<br />If you have already read the Chuang Tzu, I strongly recommend Lieh. Lao Tzu was a poet, Chuang Tzu was a story-teller, but Lieh Tzu was very earth-bound and practical Graham has done a good job of making the work accessible, while giving the scholar room to study Lieh more deeply.

                    <span>Again, this is a book about practical taoism. I am not saying that readers should avoid Lao Tzu, but they should also read other taoist books which better explain how to include taosim in everyday life. Do avoid Ms Wong's version though: she takes too much liberty with the text.</span>

                    <span>It is a shame that this book is not widely available, because I personally think that it is one of the greatest books of all time.  The Lieh Tzu has been categorized as Taoist (along with the Tao Te Ching and Chuang Tzu, it is one of the three Taoist classics), although in reality, it probably draws upon a variety of sources.  
<br />
<br />The Lieh Tzu contains a variety of stories, essays, and conversations that provide interesting and unique viewpoints.  There is a variety of characters in the book, including Lieh Tzu himself, Hu Tzu (Lieh Tzu's master), Lao Tzu (the supposed founder of Taoism and author of the Tao Te Ching), and Confucius.  There is also a distinct Yang Chu chapter of the book that features a character named Yang Chu, who probably had his own distinct philosophical school that later combined with Taoism.          
<br />
<br />The Lieh Tzu takes a look at topics such as life, death, human nature, science, etc, and really gives unique perspectives that take a step back and look at things in scope of the big picture.  The book is very perspective expanding.  I would say that overall it promotes a sort of recluse style of life.  The Yang Chu chapter, which is often termed hedonistic, focuses on living a genuine life based on what you like, rather than be a slave to other people's thoughts and to social standards, society, reputation, etc.
<br />
<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It will definitely change you whole life attitude.  Also be sure to check out my book A Collection of Wisdom.

                    <span>A superb book. Lieh Tzu's philosophy is much closer to Lao Tzu and the Buddhists, than the rebellious Chuang Tzu. This book has everything: discussions about the Tao, spiritual well beingness, universe, physics, robotics, acid-trips, hedonism, Chinese hippies, insanity, and Confucian downfall...all in 200BC.<p>My favorite chapter is "King Mu of Chou" which is a psychedelic mushroom trip. And what gave it away was the "echoes" and landscape and colors that the king halucinated. McKenna explained similar symptoms in his: The Invisible Landscape.<p>There is also so some weird alien link to this ancient text. Previously I had read that the Yellow Emperor might have been an alien. Lieh Tzu confirms this when he mentions the robot andriod who acted like a human, but was a working machine inside. This is weird. Remember that the time when this book was written is approx 200 BC.  <p>Another interesting character is Yang Chu, your typical hippy who finds no pleasure except in good looking women, clothing and food. Totally not agreeing with orthodox Taoist thought, but never the less every bit relevant. I love his story about the two brothers who preferred getting drunk and having orgies rather than ruling a country.<p>This book is perhaps the link between the 60s movement and Taoism.</span>
