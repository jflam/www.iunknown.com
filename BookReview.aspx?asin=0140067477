Through brilliant and witty dialogue with the beloved Pooh-bear and his companions, the author of this smash bestseller explains with ease and aplomb that rather than being a distant and mysterious concept, Taoism is as near and practical to us as our morning breakfast bowl. Romp through the enchanting world of Winnie-the-Pooh while soaking up invaluable lessons on simplicity and natural living.</span>

                    <span>This book became popular not only because of Pooh or Tao, but because of the explaination of the "3 Vinegar Tasters" scroll painting in the book.  Before this book became popular this famous painting was unknown, and because of this book, people know what it is.  
<br />
<br />(...) 
<br />
<br />That is the painting described in the book and as you can clearly see, one of the good points of this book was explaining the three main philosophies of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism in China.
<br />
<br />I recommend that readers visit the site that details the relationship between Taoism and the other philosophies and see how Tao of Pooh fits Taoism in there.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Seems like a contradiction right? So are some parts of Hoff's book.  I must note that other reviewers have pointed this out.  Hoff explains, quite clearly (thankfully) that one of the tenets of Taoism is to accept things precisely as they are...and then, as another reviewer says, he doesn't accept the other Pooh characters for what they are, instead disparaging them for not having the simplicity of Pooh.
<br />
<br />Ultimately, as one who is uninitiated into Taoist philosophy, I would suggest this book if for no other reason than to acquaint oneself with its basic philosophies, which Hoff does explain clearly.  One warning is that, sometimes his forays into conversation w/Pooh, and his story anecdotes are less than clear, and he assumes the reader immediately understood.  Sometimes I felt going off into the world of Pooh was unneeded at a certain point, though at other points it was valid and well-constructed.  Additionally, I would read this book as though walking onto a floor w/a "Careful" sign on it...this book is unnecessarily judgmental of others, and I feel that by feeling that way about others, one avoids the nothingness and simplicity Hoff says the Taoist seeks.  Judging others adds confusion to life, the very same confusion Hoff wants us to avoid by being as simple as Pooh.  So I say: read this book, and use it as a spur to further readings in Taoism if it interests you, but don't take it as a textbook of Taoist thought.  Many of Hoff's explanations are good, and the quotes from actual Taoists and other Chinese thinkers are excellent, but do not take the judgmental road implied by this book.
<br />
<br />I think it's worth noting that on the back of the book, where the genre is usually listed in small print near the ISBN, The Tao of Pooh is listed as a humor book.  So read this book w/that in mind.  It is a good intro to Taoism, but ultimately, it is not a book of Taoist philosophy, and is more like a book of metaphysics that utilizes Taoism.  It is worth mentioning that several Taoist ideas (about the harmony of the heavens and earth) are not strictly Taoist, which to me says, not that the Taoists were not unique, but that they have hit on some sort of truth.  Hoff's book can help the average person in their daily life, through the basics of Tao.  Hoff's book will not make one a true follower of Taoism, in my opinion.  However, for most, the former is enough, and the latter is unimportant, and that is fine.  This book operates both as a good pique of the imagination leading to further studies into Taoism, or as simply a book which reminds us of the beauty in the simplicity of life...all in the unassuming world of Winnie-the Pooh.  So for that, the book has merit, even if its unnecessary judgmental nature is obnoxious.

                    <span> This is just one of those books you have to read - I first read it as a long-haired, guitar strumming art student, in between fixes of Don Quixote and Luis Bunuel. I recall there were things like 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' floating around at the time. While that text features the famous disclaimer, that it offers little insight to traditional Zen practice, it will no more help you grasp the mechanics of Motorbikes. Similar points have been made by my spiritual advisors over here in Japan about this book, but what the hey?
<br />
<br /> This is one of those rare books that make you see the world in a different way (and how many of those have you read since you were nine?), if it inspires people to gain a little more insight into the Dao, the Way, then so much the better. But at the very least, it will make you treat people in a different, more thoughtful way. Should be required reading for all aspiring politicians, poets and princes.</span>

                    <span>I don't normally feel the urge to write reviews but this book has made me rethink my attitude towards life. I admit I am no Taoist expert and in fact knew nothing about it before reading this book. However, no matter how accurate this book is on Taoism, it has given me much food for thought on many life matters and I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind, or who is just looking for a different view on life in general.</span>

                    <span>In "The Tao of Pooh", Benjamin Hoff uses the personalities of the characters in A. A. Milne's tales to illustrate Taoism alongside some competing worldviews.  
<br />
<br />The characters can divided into 3 categories of personality and philosophy: Rabbit/Owl, Eeyore, and Pooh.  
<br />
<br />Rabbit quickly develops and executes clever action plans that don't capture the essence of a given situation and usually go awry.  Similar to Rabbit in terms of being too clever by half, Owl pontificates and analyzes and never actually does anything.  Eeyore is also clever in his own way, but interprets everything negatively and is bitter and ineffectual.  Whereas Pooh ambles along without the brains of the others, but with a stout heart, and muddles through to contentment.
<br />
<br />Rabbit/Owl together embody logical analysis, clever planning, and ceaseless but largely misdirected hard work. The aim of all their analysis and effort is to exert maximum control over outcomes by actively 'understanding' and intervening in every situation.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Confucianism, a very rigid and circumscribed approach to achieving harmony.  In the Western tradition, the Rabbit/Owl approach seems very familiar, as the general attempt to organize and control our physical and social environments with logical tools and techniques is integral to the Western experience.  The Rabbit/Owl approach regrets the past and worries about the future.
<br />
<br />Eeyore represents knowing resignation.  The aim of this hopelessness, and the ensuing lack of commitment and activity, is to shield oneself emotionally from the risk and reality of failure.  In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Buddhism, which counsels that our world is illusion and suffering, and the best response is to actively disengage from it all. In the Western tradition, the Eeyore approach can be construed as loosely analogous to the easy cynicism and disengagement of the many people who are alienated by the overbearing and omnipresent Rabbit/Owl aspects of society.  The Eeyore approach sees endless failure in the past and inevitable failure in the future.
<br />
<br />Pooh, on the other hand, embodies warm-hearted, inclusive, and spirited enjoyment of what's happening in the moment.  He unconsciously embodies the fact that we cannot control the infinitely complex interplay of forces and events out there, so the healthiest response to this overwhelming reality is to be true to our inner nature and in so doing, accept being part of the great flow of things.  In the Eastern tradition, Pooh's approach is Taoist.  He does not worry about the past.  He does not worry about the future.  He simply is himself, now, enthusiastically.  He is simply honest and true to his friends and to his own nature.  To Pooh, 'things are as they are', and do not need constant worry, analysis, self-doubt, and striving, unlike the flustered Confucian-Rabbits.  But at the same time, he is quite engaged in the world, unlike the fatalistic Buddhist-Eeyores.  When he wants hunny, he goes about getting it, quite tenaciously at times.  When he wants to help a drowning Roo or Eeyore, he rushes to save them with whatever's handy.  And so on.
<br />
<br />"The Tao of Pooh" is overall a charming read.  Hoff does a good job of maintaining the whimsical tone of the original Pooh tales, painlessly conveying some fairly abstruse concepts about the nature of reality and perception.  
<br />
<br />To be fair, it should be noted that there's a bit of apocalyptic sermonizing at the very end, to the effect that the Owls and Rabbits of the world will destroy everything if we don't learn a better way to be. Also some readers will construe Hoff's periodic mild teasing of the Rabbit/Owl way as irritating intolerance, hypocritically un-Taoist. Personally, I do not take his teasing that way at all;  Taoist hermits probably did not show much deference to the great Confucian bureaucrats of their day!  To me, these are minor and forgivable blemishes in a book that otherwise has a deft, light touch, though not as light as the childlike wisdom of the Way that it hopes to explain.</span>
