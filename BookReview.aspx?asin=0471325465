                <span id="Label1">Until the early '90s, project management was definitely located somewhere near the unsexy end of the business spectrum. But now, with the rise of downsizing and outsourcing, it has become one of the hot disciplines. Professional membership of the U.S.-based Project Management Institute has quadrupled in the last decade, and Microsoft claimed recently to have over 2 million users worldwide of its project-management software. The reasons for this growth are simple. Project management is about managing "projects," that is, unique pieces of work (as opposed to ongoing operations). Downsizing, outsourcing, and the accelerating pace of change have meant that, increasingly, work is carried out on an ad-hoc, one-off project basis. <I>The Fast Forward MBA in Project Management</I> is designed as an advanced textbook for businesspeople with a grasp of the basics and insufficient time (or inclination) to go back to school to learn more. Written by Eric Verzuh, president of the Versatile Company, a leading project-management consultancy, this is not a heavy academic text.<p>  Like the rest of the Fast Forward series, this book is designed to let the reader extract maximum information in minimum time. There is a strong use of graphics with tables, charts cross-heads, and bullet points. Important passages are flagged in bold and/or emblazoned with the words <i>key concept</i>. When you read it, you realize that there is nothing magical about project management, just the application of careful common sense. The book covers all the basic stuff like planning, time-tabling, quantity and price estimation, resource allocation, and scheduling. But it also acknowledges that there is inevitably a political dimension to every project, no matter how small. So it has important sections on how to ensure that all the stakeholders in the project are kept "on board" and the importance of communication.<p>  As Verzuh states in his introduction, "Every project participant from part-time team member to executive sponsor, becomes more effective once he or she understands the basics of project management." Really, this is a book about management that every manager should read, whether he or she has a project or not. <I>--Alex Benady</I></span>

                    <span>This book is a great desk reference particularly for those less experienced. There is a good balance of focus on the three main areas of PM: timeliness, quality and cost and - unlike other books on the subject - enough focus as well on the actual execution processes of a project.
<br />I've used this as a reference for a number of years (first edition) and highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>First of all, let me tell you that you will not become a Project Manager just by reading this book. Project Management is a field that requires three things in equal proportion: training, mentoring, and job experience. 
<br />
<br />What this book _will_ do for you is that it will give you an excellent overview of project management. You can use this book to read through and get an idea for the field. Then, if you are interested in pursuing further training, you ought to sign up for a series of training courses such as those offered by ESI International. Simultaneously, you would seek out a mentor, and opportunities for on-the-job experience. 
<br />
<br />I wish the author had aligned his terminology better with the PMBOK Guide 3rd edition. While the content is top-notch, the terminology used does not necessarily match the PMBOK Guide. This means that people cannot _easily_ use it as preparation material for the PMP certification exam. 
<br />
<br />With these caveats out of the way, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this as an introductory book, especially to aspiring Project Managers. The price point of this book is marvelous -- there is more relevant content here than tomes that cost 5-6 times as much.</span>

                    <span>As an Executive Coach, Management Team Builder and Leadership Development Trainer I read and studied several books on project management before selecting this one from which to create the nucleus of a Project Manager Training Program for my client. This is a complex and diverse subject and Verzuh takes his own advice to project managers by breaking it down into many bite sized, easily digestable pieces. For anyone at any level this makes Project Management do-able, while explaining its relevance to corporate culture.</span>

                    <span>I ordered two project management books - this one by Verzuh and one called "Fundamentals of Project Management: Developing Core Competencies to Help Outperform the Competition" 2nd edition by James Lewis.  <p>This one by Verzuh described core project managment procedures but lacked many real-world examples of these procedures in action, other than cursory remarks about how some process helped some company.<p>The book by Lewis was much more practical and seemed to be written from a person who had actually done lots of PM work rather than learned the theory and then wrote a book on it.</span>
