                    <span>I'd have to disagree with one of the dust jacket reviewers who compared the author with Professor Steven Jay Gould.  Sorry Steve, S.J. Gould you are not.   
<br />
<br />The author is a very accomplished mathematician yet managed to produce this book without resorting to the arcane language of his field.  How is this so?  I've been told by many engineers ( IEEE members I might add but not anyone who has written 3500 articles ) that certain concepts, relationships, and facts simply cannot be expressed in mere words.  Math is required they say-their language is required.  Of course, most of these people, unlike Steve Strogatz who has an excellent command of English , have a VERY limited command of any language other than mathematics.  Therefore, I wonder to what extent the author would agree that one can never fully comprehend the topic using such a limited language as English.  In other words what are those of us who don't speak the language of highly advanced mathematics missing?  Or...are we missing anything?
<br />
<br />The author does an exceptional job of describing his ideas in the English language and for this I thank him.  
<br />
<br />I note that, unlike the extraordinary once in a generation scientist Gould, Strogatz apparently could not remove himself from his/our immediate cultural/political setting to a sufficient degree to avoid mentioning bogus politico-science in the same sentence with actual fact.  He includes global warming right along with the origin of life and finding a cure for cancer as examples of great mysteries awaiting solution by the science of sync.  He should have included it instead in his discussion of "fads".
<br />
<br />I'd suggest if he considers global warming a proven scientific fact then his list should also include "scientific creationism".  The final chapter discusses the origin of "fads" in human societies and how/why they develop and are accepted so rapidly.  He should apply this logical analysis to the phenom of "global warming".  After reading such an excellent book as this I was disappointed when the author jumped on the bandwagon of contemporary political/scientific orthodoxy in his apparent acceptance of the pseudoscience of global warming.  
<br />
<br />He, of all people, should understand the hubris involved in believing that we can even begin to understand the complex nonlinear system of global climate well enough to predict  global warming on the basis of the very limited and tainted data that is offered as "proof" by those many scientists eager for grant funding to develop additional validation of the "theory". 
<br />
<br />Oh well, the author is only human like all of us.  For a break from his demanding job of theoretical thinking the author might read a new novel "State of Fear". He should pay particular attention to the factual footnotes and the high degree to which the author has incorporated the truths of Chaos/Complexity theory into his writing.   Steve, you have a few important things to learn from Michael.  I think the two of you are intellectual equals.  
<br />

                    <span>Sync is one of the most enthralling scientific books I've ever read. As a mathematician, I enjoyed seeing some actual science and cited references rather than just vague generalities. At the same time, the book is very easy to follow through a wide array of subjects. There are parts where you might want to just scratch your head and move on (unless you have an intuition for quantum mechanics), but it would be difficult not to find a lot to like in this book. I was especially interested to learn about the human sleep/wake cycle, others may prefer fireflies blinking in unison, maybe you're more interested in learning where "six degrees of separation" really came from, or perhaps you'd like to know why the same side of the moon always faces the earth.
<br />
<br />This book is appropriate for motivated high school students through veteran scientists.</span>

                    <span>Sync investigates the concept of universal harmony. The drive to synchronization is one of the most far-reaching phenomena in the universe, encompassing people, planets, atoms, animals and a whole lot more. But the laws of Thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite - that nature should degenerate toward entropy. This is not so, as magnificent small and large structures like galaxies and cells keep assembling themselves in perfect harmony. 
<br />
<br />Drawing on Chaos & Complexity Theory, Strogatz examines the connections linking the phenomena of the mathematics of self-organization, where trillions of interactions result in order emerging from chaos. There is a steady and insistent pulse at the heart of the cosmos that resonates from the nucleus of the cell to the largest galaxy in a chorus of synchronized cycles that pervade all of nature. 
<br />
<br />The author refers to the work of scientists from many disciplines, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Brian Josephson, Norbert Wiener, Paul Erdos, Stanley Milgram, Boris Belousov Edward Lorenz and Arthur Winfree. Part One, Living In Sync, deals with these manifestations in for example human brainwaves and the behaviour of fireflies, whilst Part Two, Discovering Sync, looks at the universe as a whole and at quantum theory. Part Three, Exploring Sync, investigates synchronization, chaos and small world networks. 
<br />
<br />There are some black and white illustrations, copious notes and an index. This book is a fascinating journey through the strange and beautiful phenomenon of synchronization, the harmonious music of the universe that builds and sustains life.

                    <span>I enjoyed the book a great deal. One interesting aspect, for a person who lives in Mexico's poorest state, is how much money and brainpower humanity devotes to warfare, satisfying its curiosity, and studying "diseases of the rich" while so many people lack food, shelter, and basic medical care.</span>

                    <span>Sync is captivating and a great read.  I especially liked the chapter on sleep, which was particularly thought provoking.  
<br />
<br />Although Dr. Strogatz is obviously a brilliant scientist, he writes in such a clear and engaging way, that I was able to understand the very complex topics he discusses.
<br />
<br />This is a great book for people interested in the mysteries of the universe and of everyday life.  Sync is the first popular science book I've read in a long time that I've totally enjoyed.
