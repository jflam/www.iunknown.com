                <span id="Label1">Threads are essential to Java programming, but learning to use them effectively is a nontrivial task. This new edition of the classic <i>Java Threads</i> shows you how to take full advantage of Java's threading facilities and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.  Java's threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.  You'll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.  <i>Java Threads</i>, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted). Developers who cannot yet deploy J2SE 5.0 can use thread utilities provided in the Appendix to achieve similar functionality with earlier versions of Java.  Topics include:<ul><li>Lock starvation and deadlock detection</li><li>Atomic classes and minimal synchronization (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Interaction of Java threads with Swing, I/O, and Collection classes</li><li>Programmatically controlled locks and condition variables (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Thread performance and security</li><li>Thread pools (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Thread groups</li><li>Platform-specific thread scheduling</li><li>Task schedulers (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Parallelizing loops for multiprocessor machines</li></ul>In short, this new edition of <i>Java Threads</i> covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation program to the most complex applications. If you plan to do any serious work in Java, you will find this book invaluable.  Scott Oaks is a senior software engineer for the Java Performance Engineering group at Sun Microsystems and the author of four books in the O'Reilly Java series.Formerly a senior systems engineer at Sun Microsystems, Henry Wong is an independent consultant working on various Java related projects. </span>

                    <span>This isn't the best O'Reilly book in the Java series, but it will provide a reasonably good overview of the subject. I wouldn't recommend this book to beginning programmers, because the topic of threading is overly complex for beginners. Look for a general Java book that gives you some simple templates for using threads, if you need them for something. I also wouldn't recommend this for advanced programmers who have special needs in the area of threading. A more advanced book would survey how real JVMs actually perform thread scheduling, comparing them and provide tips for programmers who ned really precise timing or scheduling optimization. Likewise, if you know most of the ins and outs of preventing deadlocks off the top of your head, this book isn't going to teach you very much.<P>Who this book is good for is experienced programmers who need to understand the ins and outs of making their applications threadsafe. If you don't have much (or any) background in threading or you've forgotten some things, this book will cover the topic thoroughly, and demonstrate common pitfalls. It's ideal for people who need to code up things like database connection pools, complex synchronized-access data structures, and statically-accessed resources. As others have mentioned, some of the examples are kind of synthetic and fake, but the book is still extremely usable, and it's an easy read.<P>This book is also effective at covering timed and recurring tasks in Java 1.1 and 1.2, though Java 1.3 now has new helper classes (Timer and TimedTask) that this book doesn't cover. Then again, if you understand how to do it in 1.1 and 1.2 (and really, even if you don't), understanding the new 1.3 classes is dead easy.</span>

                    <span>It not only covers the threads API, it also covers how they work and advanced tricks to using them.<P><P>The problem which most of the threading material related to Java I've read in other books has contained errors. "Java Threads" as well as Doug Lea's "Concurrent Programming in Java" are the only accurate books that I know of although their focus is very different. Another good thing about this book is that it has much otherwise hard to find information about how threads actually work in Java.<P><P>I highly recommend this book to anytone working with Java threads. I'm sure you will find information in here that you previously didn't know.</span>

                    <span>I have much respect for O'Reilly books but this is the second book from O'Reilly that I have thrown to trash can. The topic is very poorly covered - for example, the covers very briefly in chapter 2 about the difference between extending 'Thread' class vs. implementing 'Runnable' They states that this topic is 'beyond the scope of this book'. This is basic 101 on Java Thread - Runnable vs. Thread and Runnable is very prefered way. Why? Well, if you extends 'Thread', you cannot extends other classes. Also, you don't have to worry about changes into Thread class in the future.<P>After reading first two chapters, I threw away the copy. You are better off with other books.</span>

                    <span>This is a prettry decent book on threads, but I frankly found it to be a little flat. The writing doesn't exactly pop and it is a pretty small book. I think they could easily write a book about twice the size and cover the topic entirely.<BR>However, if you are new to multithreading, or at least new to Java threads, this is a great intorduction to the subject. And it is very difficult to find a lot of information on Java threads anyway, which is why I bought this book in the first place. There are some very practical code examples too, including a round robin scheduler.</span>
