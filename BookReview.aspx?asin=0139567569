                    <span>First of all, I can see where some would find this book boring- that is if the reader has no interest in American History. But this begs the questions- why would such a person pick up this book to begin with? For class maybe, but I imagine every student of history has read a difficult book or two. This one simply doesn't qualify. As far as books I've had to read for school, this was pretty easy to get through.
<br />
<br />This book is not a primary source. If you are looking for such a thing, look elsewhere. This is a well-researched account of life on the early American frontier, and the interaction between different cultures. 
<br />
<br />Someone makes the claim further down that this book makes the Europeans look really bad. I disagree. This book does a fine job of looking at this time period from multiple view points. There are moments when the Europeans will come off badly, but almost any group has it's moments throughout history where it's not going to be a shining example of how to live your life. Aside from which, as this book points out, the Europeans are not one single group and the different European groups looked at within this book (The English, Dutch, French, and Spanish) all had different relationships with the various indigenous peoples of what would become the eastern United States. This book also takes a look at slavery and the origins of that horrid institution in the Americas. It is often fascinating reading and certainly doesn't deserve the one star reviews it's received. </span>

                    <span>Like a few others on here I could not read this book.  It did help me fall asleep though, lol.  Anyone who's looking into reading this book, Id suggest checking it out of the library before you buy it.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the worst book I have ever needed to read for school ever.  When I attempted to read this book, I must've fallen asleep at least 10 times and I haven't even got past the first 2 chapters.  I have no idea what my teacher was thinking when he saw this book.  If it was a choice, I would choose negative 5 stars for this waste of paper and ink.  It is, hands down, a boring book with absolutely not point at all except to critizice the immigration of the early Europeans.  It almost seems like Nash couldn't give about the Europeans coming over here.  Well, I would be quite upset if they didn't come over here, unless it would have prevented the publishing of his redundant, afwul book.</span>

                    <span>RWB by Nash attempts to present a more accurate picture of colonial society.  However, in the end, I believe Nash fails to do any real justice to his examination of this society's underpinnings.  Essentially, Nash abandons this pursuit very quickly into the book and deals mostly with the facts of the era.  Additionally, Nash's views seem all to decidedly Neo-Progressive.  He simply will not concede a point or discuss a point, which does not fit this mindset.  Another perhaps more disturbing issue is Nash's like of primary sources throughout his work.  The majority of his sites are from other historians' works.  But before you think of moving on and passing this work up understand a few basic things about it.  First, by no means am I questioning Nash's historical ability or accuracy.  Second, this work provides a novice student of history and excellent foundation to start to build an understanding of the Colonial Period on.  Moreover, Nash's analysis though I find fault with it is still holds water in the historical community through refinements and redefinitions of his point.  I suggest that any one seeking to get a handle on the Colonial period or start a study of this era should start here.  However, do not read this work and take it as anything other then a meager beginning; instead, use it as a stepping stone to branch out into other works by Winthrop Jordan, William Cronon, Edmund Morgan, Bernard Bailyn, and Laurel Ulrich.</span>

                    <span>Gary Nash scratches beneath the surface in his analysis of the  deomographics of colonial America. He skillfuly reveals the interaction  between Europeans, native Americans, and Africans in the years preceding  the American Revolution. Nash brings an important missing element to the  mix by exploring how native American and African cultures affected European  society, offering a refreshing look race relations. For once, readers are  given a glimpse of the proud and unshakable cultures of these two exploited  peoples. <p>Red, White & Black compares race relations between several  different cultures and regions. Nash not only spouts statistics; he helps  the reader to understand why certain peoples fought and why they formed  alliances during this volatile period in our history.</span>
