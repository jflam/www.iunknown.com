                    <span>Many books out there can help you mix a drink, but Bartending For Dummies not only shows you how to make drinks, but how to stock your bar, what glasses to use and even a little trivia about some drinks. The contents are laid out in an easy to use format, and any "technical" bartending speak is explained to you. Dont get this book if you are expecting tons and tons of drink mixes, it just isnt there but it makes up for it by giving you all the practical information you need to get going!</span>

                    <span>When I built my home bar, and stocked it the brim with liquor, mixers, and various essential glassware, I knew I needed a little bit more advice and expertise to tighten up the collection and get it ready for a party. I was always a fan of the dummies books, and while they may be looked upon as lowbrow material for the martini connoisseur, or bar expert, I was neither, and I believe that for people like me, most do-it-yourselfers, the book suffices quite nicely. <P>When I throw a party, and our college parties are usually big with 65 or more people, we go all out and things get hectic behind the bar with dozens of people all clamoring for something different. Bartending for Dummies really comes in handy time after time, with many of the most popular drink recipes available at a moment's glace, in logical, alphabetized order. The look-up is fast and quick, and the instructions are quite easy to follow. This is especially useful for when you have dozens of people throughout the night who, when asked what they want, simply reply with, "I don't know," or, "Make me something that tastes good." While these responses are aggravating, and totally unproductive, this book serves as a great reference of on-the-fly drinks to make for these indecisive individuals. <BR><BR>For pre-party preparations, the front of the book is filled with information on everything from cutting limes the proper way to buying enough rum, or vodka for a predetermined number of guests. The numbers, math, and money tabulations I have found to be accurate enough to swear by, and often helpful in a myriad of party-planning adventures. The book also has a number of charts depicting types of alcoholic volumes, what some of the terminology means, and even an informative list of calories per kind of alcoholic beverage. <P>The book has a couple drawbacks, as almost everything does. For one thing, the author tends to use a few lower-quality alcohols in certain popular drinks that should never be used. Using these lower qualities, and sub-par products detract from the eminence of an otherwise first-rate beverage. A second criticism is that some of the drink recipes are not what the vast majority of the world believes them to be. Slight variations in amount, sequence of mixing, and kinds of alcohol used within these drinks I find suspect. <P>However, the information on the main categories of alcohols, their history, production methods, place of origin, and most popular nomenclature I found to be quite fascinating. The research seemed impeccable, with well-documented and respectable sources. The chapter on kinds of glassware and their uses provided a layman with tons of useful facts to help them make informed decisions on what kinds of glasses to stock your bar with and serve different drinks within. <BR><BR>While Bartending for Dummies may be considered light reading, inconsequential, and contrived to experts in the field, this demographic is hardly this book's intended audience. I, a nonprofessional and do-it-myselfer, have found the book to be a boon time and again, at party after party. Its setup is easy to follow, coherent and consistent, with humor at times, and an all-round indispensable tool for any home-bartender.</span>

                    <span>After purchasing this book from Amazon, I was quite disappointed when I received it in the mail. I did not even notice the very fine print on the cover of the book that says Miniature Edition in the green bubble or notice the dimensions in its description. If you are truly interested in learning about bartending, I would not recommend this book because of its lack of detail and depth. A majority of the book is simply different drink ingredients, but even those are very limited because of the small size of the book. I really wish I could go back and spend the extra 4 dollars on a full sized book that would be MUCH more useful for me. Buy the paperback edition of Bartending for Dummies, and not the hardcover!</span>

                    <span>There were parts of this book that were very imformative and well researched. However, as a professional bartender and author, I feel there were a lot of mistakes he made in writing his book.<BR>A lot of the recipes given were incorrect. Certain drinks like an Old-fashioned, and a Sex on the Beach should not be wrong. Also, I noticed that he had ten or fifteen drinks featuring Absolut Vodka. Absolut Vodka is a very low-rated vodka, and should never be involved in a recipe for a good drink. Crystal Palace or 5 o'clock vodka would have sufficed just fine.</span>
