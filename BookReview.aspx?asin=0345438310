                    <span>Massie's work is very readable; more like a novel than a biography. There were times I couldn't believe some of the intimate details could be real, for how would Massie know? But at the back of the book he has extensive notes indicating the sources for all the details including diaries and memoirs. I thought Massie did an excellent job illustrating the roots of World War I, especially the relationship between Nicholas and Kaiser William II. Also excellent was the way he makes the enigma of Rasputin understandable and how he reconciles the public disfavor and lack of understanding of the tsar and his wife with their noble intentions with the good of Russia in mind. In reading history it is easy to imagine that the participants were ignorant or oblivious to larger trends that would envelop them, especially in light of subsequent historical events. Massie's story brilliantly sheds light on the story of the last tsar such that the reader can genuinely understand the motivations of most of the participants. Very enlightening reading. I strongly recommend the book for anyone interested in Russian history or just looking for a readable story.</span>

                    <span>Massie certainly deserved the author of the month in the<BR>winter 2000 page on the romanov website.<BR>This book is a remarkable study of the last Tsar, his<BR>family and the Russia they ruled. It is the definite<BR>work in that it portrays Nicholas not only as Tsar of<BR>all the Russias , but as the father, the husband, and<BR>the family man.All these aspects are crucial if we are<BR>to understand the man himself and the steps he took<BR>to command his great empire. It is an extremely fair<BR>work, showing the Tsar's shortcomings as a ruler, but yet<BR>at the same time his humaness, his vulnerability from<BR>his own position.<BR>Massie has excelled himself with this book, and I highly<BR>recommend it to any reader seeking an introduction to<BR>this most fascinating period of Russian history.<BR>There have been criticisms of this book stating that Nicholas<BR>and his reign should have been studied in the context of say, other rulers of the time. This is a granted point, but one I feel<BR>Massie achieves in his commentary of the world spectrum on the<BR>whole particularly in the years 1905 through to the first World<BR>War.To isolate the "family man" from the ruler is impossible - <BR>they were part of each other.<BR>So congratulations to Robert Massie, this book is a very<BR>great achievement!</span>

                    <span>Why go for fiction when you can get a riveting true story like what happened to the Romanovs? The book starts with Nicholas' unexpected coronation as Tsar in 1894, and slowly but surely the story unfolds towards the gruesome end 25 years later. The saddening thing about this episode in history is that despite Rasputin, despite the heir Alexis with his hemophilia, despite the Empress' foilies, I left the book believing that the Tsar and his whole family got killed because he was just too kind and humble to make the tough decisions that Russia required during those turbulent times. If you consider Stalin, a cynic may argue that evil pays.</span>

                    <span>First reccomended to me by a Professor of mine, Massie's work reveals all the intimate details and crucial historical story lines that even a novice of the Russian Revolutionary history would grasp to understand the life of the last Imperial Highnesses. From the infamous Bloody Sunday to the love letters that were exchanged between Nicholas and Alexandra the book was clearly exhaustively researched and also gives a touch of real emotion which is magnafied by the authors own personal experiences with the terrible disease of hemophelia. Grandoise as this story is it might well have been fiction, tragically it is not! As sad as the historical truths presented in the pages are, Massie writes words that flow and are easy to understand. I would reccomend this book for anyone looking for a story so incredible and emotionally raw that it had to be true or to anyone who wants to make some sense out of the mysticism of this part of intriging Russian history.</span>

                    <span>"Nicholas and Alexandra" is a fantastic history book that I can thoroughly recommend to all readers. The book is truly "unputdownable" and if it were not a history book, it could almost have read as a novel.<P>The end of the Romanov dynasty is a work of tragedy. Here we have this closely bound intimate family playing out a drama against the backdrop of the First World War and the Russian Revolution. Yet tragedy almost becomes farce when the role of Rasputin is considered. The Czarina is quite spellbound by the man despite the damage that his decisions have for the family and the dynasty. <P>In "Nicholas and Alexandra", we see the unfolding of the downfall of autocracy which, in due course, would have been inevitable. The First World War simply accelerated the process. Yet while we should shed no tears for the fall of autocrats, the rise of an even more vile autocracy under Lenin heaps tragedy upon tragedy. The history of modern Russia is tragedy writ large.<P>Robert K Massie covers the events leading to the execution of the royal family in great detail but without ever deluging the reader with arcane facts that detract from the picture that he paints. The end result is a work of substance and colour.<P>I emphatically recommend this book to all readers of modern history. Robert K Massie has excelled!</span>
