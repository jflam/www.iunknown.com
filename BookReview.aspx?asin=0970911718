                    <span>As a resident of Pittsfield and a fan of baseball I fully supported building the new stadium.  Pittsfield is awash in drugs, crime and economic stagnation.  A new stadium would have brought in a new minor league franchise, a venue for concerts and other sorts of activities.  In the end a great thing for Pittsfield.  But thanks to Jim Bouton and other non residents (or part time "summer" berkshire residents) the initiative was defeated, Wahconah park was never renovated it can't attract any minor league teams because it is so far under code it is helpless.  So now it sits there unused and decaying like the rest of our once great town.
<br />
<br />Thanks alot Jim.</span>

                    <span>I couldn't put this one down and read the entire book on one long day of traveling cross country.  The book is about a lot of things.  Love for the game of baseball, if not the business of baseball.  What kind of crooked nonsense goes on in thousands of small towns across the US every day with bogus politicians defying the will of the people they are supposedly there to serve.  How companies that screw all of us somehow convince people and politicians that they are looking out for our best interests.  But most of all, this book is about the absolute need all American citizens have for a free press, and a free press that is intelligent, well-informed, willing to take risks, and willing to do its damm job.  When the press rolls over, there really is no hope of outing the kinds of crooks and morons Bouton smokes out.  It's a very compelling read and I comend Bouton for writing it (even if his originally publisher wimped out). </span>

                    <span>This book is Erin Brockovich, the Insider, It's a Wonderful Life, A Civil Action, and Field of Dreams all rolled into one awesome book. I just read this in two days. It is both fantastic and infuriating. I am so mad I want to go up to Pittsfield and shoot some of these people. The situation faced by Bouton is so frustrating; yet this kind of behavior goes on every day all over America. The book is both inspiring and discouraging. It makes me want to go full bore for a similar cause; but it also reinforces what I already know: That it's almost impossible to change anything. But this book has an unknown (at the time of publishing) happy ending. Read the book and then check out Bouton's www.foulball.com for the latest news. Anyway, this is an absolute must read for ANY AMERICAN. You don't have to be a baseball fan, or even know what a bunt is to appreciate it.</span>

                    <span>For years, I'd always intended (and still do intend) to read Bouton's classic baseball book, "Ball Four." But I hadn't even heard of his new book until I received it as a Christmas gift from my father. "Foul Ball" is not simply a great book for people who love baseball and what makes the game so wonderful (hint: it's not skyboxes or retractable roofs). It's one of those rare books that takes a relatively small story (small-town corruption and greed) and ends up revealing an awful lot about human nature (mostly bad, some good). Bouton's voice is very engaging--once you read the first few pages of the Intro, he's got you, and you're in it for the long haul. And the story is as compelling a drama as it is an unbelievable tale of the lengths some people will go to line their own pockets or grab a little bit of power--as well as the lengths the author and his partner will go to try to do the right thing.<p>I was particulary interested to read Bouton's account (in the Epilogue) of how his original publisher, Public Affairs, jerked him around at the eleventh hour. As an editor and author who has worked in book publishing for the past 10 years, I was disgusted by the behavior of his editor and publisher, whose actions were inexcusable.<p>I would highly recommend "Foul Ball" to anyone interested in baseball, the media (particulary local media in smaller markets), or the ways that big business can corrupt public affairs and discourse. It's a great read, and even though it sheds light on some dark and disturbing aspects of American society, you feel good knowing that there are people like Jim Bouton, and his friend and partner, out there fighting the good fight.</span>

                    <span>If there was any doubt before, this book proves that the multi-talented Jim Bouton really can write. He is also a terrific researcher, reporter, entrepreneur, & tilter-of-windmills. This book is about a lot more than baseball, but it is clearly a CASEY Award calibre book nevertheless.</span>
