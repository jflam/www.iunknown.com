                <span id="Label1"><I>Professional Visual Basic 6 Databases</I> provides some of the latest thinking about creating business objects using Visual Basic (VB) 6 and MTS on the Microsoft platform. This book is perfect for readers with previous VB experience who want to bring their skills up to speed with today's three-tiered architectures.<p> Besides describing how to create useful VB 6 objects that work in conjunction with MTS for transaction support, this book includes two standout sections. First, its introduction to using SQL includes not only a guide to the basics but also a thorough tour of joins, grouping options, and stored procedures. Another excellent chapter shows off the basics of data warehouses, along with the Microsoft Dimension and Cube wizards used to generate them on SQL Server 7.<p> The overall shape of this book starts with using Microsoft tools to build an older-style two-tiered VB application. Next, it's a state-of-the-art three-tiered approach where VB 6 runs objects on the middle tier using ADO, MTS, and SQL Server stored procedures on the back end. (The author also shows off some useful tips for optimizing network traffic with remote objects.) The book closes with an ASP-based example for an e-commerce shopping cart, bringing the whole book around to today's thin client, browser-based interfaces. Handy reference sections provide quick lookups for all ADO objects.<p> Overall, <I>Professional Visual Basic 6 Databases</I> delivers a solid tutorial geared toward the intermediate VB programmer. It's all you need to be productive with Microsoft's "official" three-tiered approach for building robust applications. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: ADO, ODBC, and SQL basics; two- and three-tiered architectures; SQL Server 6.5/7.0 stored procedures and triggers; Microsoft data warehousing; MOLAP, ASPs, and deployment.</span>

                    <span>This book really taught me a lot.  The only thing I would have liked was a better explanation on how to implement a desktop database (local, not on a server).  If you read between the lines you can figure it out, but it would have been better if he had outlined some specifics.  The hands-on approach of this book really helps you learn.  I wouldn't call this a be-all-end-all book of database programming for VB, but it's a great start and the appendices serve as a more in-depth reference.</span>

                    <span>This book does help resolve issues encountered when developing VB6 database apps.  While the depth in the examples sometimes leads to some hardcore trial-and-error time, at least you come out of it pointed in a productive direction.  I'm working through this book cover to cover, and learning more from it than I have from my entire VB collection.  VB-dB programming is my main interest, and this book is the very best I've seen.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent for experienced programmers looking for a "how to guide".  The examples follow a logical flow and are explained in detail.  Experienced programmers will find this an excellent guide in translating their functional understanding of another programming language into the functions available in VB6.  I especially like the way that the author offers more than one way to accomplish the same task.   Database application programmers could not ask for a better program by example guide then this book.  I have purchased several books on VB6 and have been disappointed with the layout, explanations, or scope.  This book is exactly as advertised.  This is truly a programmer to programmer book.</span>

                    <span>Well, I read both of these books and must say that Wrox's Beginnig Visual Basic Database book was more clear and more immediately helpful. It almost seemed as if much of this book was taken from the Beginning Book. While both are good, if I had to spend limited resources on a single one, it would be Connell's book. He is more lucid and anticipates my questions while this book seems to reiterate much of Connell's work but in a more opaque style.  However, they are both excellent.</span>
