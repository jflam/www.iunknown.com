                    <span>Ive been a Carleton Sheets disciple for 7 years, have appeared on his commercials, and am on his recent training videos. I own over 70 rental units including apartments, houses, duplexes, and commercial buildings. I met Mike Summey in Chicago a couple of years ago at a Carlton Sheets photo shoot. Mike and I hung out late into the nite night and talked about real estate. I read his book and definitely picked up some ideas from it. I want to learn new things all the time. I had a million dollar net worth before I was 30 and Mike's book is definitely a great book for the starter investor. Quit thinking about getting righ and GO DO IT!!!</span>

                    <span>This book was ok, some good points ok, the part I do not agree with is having a property manager so you can run out and find more deals. Really I have experence with bad property managers what a joke. This book should show you the most key important point is to make money managing your own Real Estate ok, not paying some Property Company to keep eating your profits,  how to buy and manage your own Real Estate is the true key to make you Wealthy in your spare time. This is book I thought is for the small time investor and seems written for some guy wanting to buy 100 single home units. I have a feeling there is a better book out there to explain what this book has passed bye. If someone out there can tell me please do.</span>

                    <span>I have been investing for over 21 years and started with Nothing Down by Robert Allen. My first two deals were 'nothing down'.
<br />
<br />Over the years I have done a lot of deals and different things work in different situations.
<br />
<br />The Weekend Millionaire is one of the best books for an investor who wants to learn how to invest for long term income. It is not a get rich quick book. The book assumes you have a day job, you pay your bills and have a life other then real estate.
<br />
<br />I was impressed that they take you from finding a property to inspecting it to coming up with the offer price and then what to do if the seller says 'yes' or 'no'.
<br />
<br />The book does not cover all styles on RE investing. No book could and this one clearly does not even try to cover everything. The advice given is very practical and will help the reader create real wealth if the reader implements what they learn.
<br />
<br />One generic comment. All the books, tapes, seminars and similar are worth what you pay or are completely worthless depending on if you apply the information. You can make a lot of money with real estate. You can also spend a lot of time and money getting ready and never have any success. You really need to get out there and pound the pavement. This book will be a great guide if you want to apply what you learn.

                    <span>I must have a different edition of this book than some of the other reviewers.  Yes, this book is not for the so-called "expert" real estate investors nor is it for the "know-it-alls".  The author basically tells you his story of how he got into real estate investing and what you need to do to follow in his footsteps. Is there a silver bullet to this? Absolutely not. Does the author imply that you buy low and sell high as some reviewers suggested. Well, from my reading there were many instances where the author bought properties ABOVE what it was worth and KEPT the property for renting. Hmmmm. There goes the buy low sell high theory. All-in-all nothing worth getting is going to be easy and this book should be used as a stepping stone into a lucrative longterm real estate investing career. If you are an expert or know-it-all why bother reading this book?</span>
