                    <span>Of the books I've read on same-sex marriage this is the most straight-forward and readable. Written by the editorial page editor of the Rutland Herald (where he won a Pulitzer prize for his coverage of this issue) the book reads like a novel, filled with interesting characters and dramatic moments.
<br />
<br />Moats' thesis is that the Supreme Court in Vermont chose wisely not to mandate same-sex marriage but instead to remand the issue to the legislature. It is his theory that in the end, civil union was a preferable compromise to marriage for two reasons. First, the very process of having the legislature involved, complete with extensive public hearings, allowed many citizens to feel that they were heard and involved in the process. Second, and more important, the creation of civil unions avoided the intense backlash that might have been expected (and had been seen in Hawaii and other states) from a sweeping constitutional ruling mandating marriage.
<br />
<br />While I disagree with his conclusions about the advantages of civil unions, the book is fascinating to read and very well written, if a bit dated by recent events.

                    <span>Just a short while ago, Vermont wrestled with an issue that's gripping our country in a maelstrom. The end result, as most of us know, was the formation of the controversial but important recognition of same-sex relationships called "civil unions". What most of us don't know is the inner workings of the Vermont government as it came to deal with this issue, and the ultimate political sacrifice that many people played in order to ensure equal rights for all of its citizens. David Moats, editor of the Rutland Herald, describes in detail, how that all transpired in his book "Civil Wars: A Battle for Gay Marriage".<p>Moats approaches the story from a journalistic standpoint as he describes couples who were fighting to get legal recognition of their long term relationships. With the court siding on their side, but giving the problem back to the state legislature, the storm of politics brews quickly and deeply. With the leadership of then governor Howard Dean, we see how the machinations of state government worked to churn out the only viable option at the time, civil unions. <p>While being very a straightforward book, Moats treats the subject matter fairly and with respect. His handling of the gay relationships, and the people stories, is respectful and honorable. He clearly has opinions on gay marriage, and yet, those opinions doesn't shade his view of the events in Vermont. If you don't agree with legal recognition of gay relationships, at least you can appreciate, by reading this book, the intense scrunity and thoughtfulness those Vermont legislators put into forming this landmark bill.<p>Perhaps one day, our own Congress will wrestle with the fact that its denying a group of citizens fair and legal recognition of their relationships based solely on whom they love. If that's the case, Moats' book gives us a sense of hope that fair minded people will come to the correct conclusion; that in our country, built upon espoused principals of fairness and equality, people must be afforded the same legal rights and protections offered to all of its citizens.  There simply can be no other choice.</span>

                    <span>Civil Wars is an exceedingly balanced book about the events creating the first civil union legislation for gays in the state of Vermont. Given, such a divisive subject, author David Moats does not interject his own views per se, except where his own experience adds color to the proceedings. Instead, he richly describes the history of the lawsuit that lead to the state Supreme Court decision, which placed the burden upon the legislature to remedy "the exclusion of same-sex couples from the secular benefits and protections offered married couples."<p>In setting the stage for the events that followed, Moats not only vividly portrays the settings and what transpired in public meetings and both open- and closed-door legislative sessions, but imbues us with a sense of how the majority of the senators and house representatives struggled to do the right thing, often in opposition to their prior beliefs and the constituents in their districts. Given the appalling abuse they took, this took courage.<p>One leaves this book with the impression that regardless of whether one believes that gays should or should not enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, there are considerable numbers of people out there that don't deserve to be part of the human race, given the disgusting and obscene activities they indulged in, in order to persuade legislators not to pass any kind of pro-gay legislation.</span>

                    <span>David Moats is the editorial page editor of the RUTLAND HERALD and the winner of a Pulitzer for his editorials in support of same-sex unions. This book grew out of Mr. Moats' interest in the whole gay marriage debate and the events that preceded the passage in Vermont of the historical civil union legislation. In this extremely well-written account, Mr. Moats covers all the major events that set the stage for this kind of history to be made in Vermont, that is,  the three couples being brave enough to bring suit, the ruling of the Vermont Supreme Court and the ultimate passage into law of civil unions for gay people. He discusses the Stonewall riots, the murder of Harvey Milk, the AIDS epidemic, gays in the military, the lawsuit brought in Hawaii, the increase of adoptions by gay and lesbian couples, and the Matthew Shephard murder. He says in the prologue: In my view, the Vermont story ranks, not just with the Stonewall riots and the murder of Harvey Milk as landmarks of gay history, but with Birmingham and Selma as landmarks of our growth toward a more complete democracy."<p>Governor Howard Dean showed tremendous courage in signing the civil union bill into law. He conducted himself here as he did when he later ran for the Democratic nomination for president. He was open and frank about doing the right thing. There are many other heroes here, Mr. Moates for starters, who is not gay. Certainly the three couples who brought the lawsuit, their attorneys and other gay people in Vermont were brave beyond measure. There were also many fine and decent people in both houses of state government, who were determined to do the right thing by gay people and in so doing, several of them later lost their seats in the state legislature. Two individuals stand out for me--Bill Lippert, vice chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Bob Kinsey, a 72 year-old Republican in the House, an elder in the Presbyterian Church where he and his wife had sung in the choir for fifty-two years. Initially he was opposed to any kind of gay marriage or domestic partnership bill but was persuaded to vote for the bill that eventually passed, probably in part because a teepee on his farm that he had built as a warming hut for skaters in the cold Vermont winters mysteriously burned. He believed the fire was caused by arsonists because of his stand on gay rights. "It was the human dimension of the gay marriage bill that touched him. . . He and his wife. . . had learned something about life and love and death. No one was going to instruct him about right and wrong or the disposition of his soul." Mr. Lippert, who is gay, gave an impassioned speech on the House floor that many believed brought his undecided colleagues to his side: "There's something strange about sitting in the midst of a delibertive body that is trying to decide whether I and my fellow gay and lesbian Vermonters should get our rights now. . . Don't tell me about what a committed relationship is and isn't. I've watched my gay brothers care for each other deeply and my lesbian sisters nurse and care. There is no love and no commitment any greater than what I've seen, what I know." When Mr. Lippert sat down, Robert Kinsey rose and said that he had just heard the greatest speech he had heard in his 30 years in government. There are many other instances of quiet and sometimes not so quiet heroism here. The jackals of course came out too. The infamous Phyllis Schlafly and Alan Keyes, to name two, made appearances to spread their hate as well.<p>Mr. Moats in the last chapter of the book discusses some of the other significant events for gays and lesbians, The United States Supreme Court's striking down the Texas sodomy law, the ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in favor of gay marriage as well as the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Canada upholding a lower court's ruling granting the right for gays and lesbians to marry. This book went to press too early for Mr. Moats to include the passage last week by the Georgia House-- the Senate has passed one weeks ago-- of a bill to allow the citizens of Georgia to vote in November for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage although there is already a law on the books in Georgia making gay marriage illegal. Sad to say, Georgia is not Vermont.</span>

                    <span>I moved to Vermont from Texas in August of 2000, shortly after the Vermont legislature passed the civil unions bill.  Large signs in people's yards and bright bumper stickers on cars still proclaimed, "Take back Vermont," "Take Vermont forward," and the insidious reply, "Never let Vermont be taken from behind."<p>Some people, myself included before I moved here, picture Vermont as the quintessentially liberal, hippy state where anything goes.  Not so.  Emotion ran just as high here as it does now in other places where gay marriage is discussed and performed.  David Moats' Pulitzer Prize winning editorials helped maintain civility and promote tolerance in Vermont when the confluence of fear, moral indignation, and a respectful demand for basic civil rights threatened to tear the state apart.  By respecting all sides in the discussion, Moats' balance, both in his editorials and now in this book, helps people understand each other, while never concealing his conviction that gay marriage is a basic civil rights issue.  This vital balance will be of value to anyone with a serious interest in this issue, no matter on which side of the question you may come down.  <p>And you'll enjoy the book, too!  Civil Wars : Gay Marriage in America reads like a thriller, bringing all the characters, with their many human dimensions, to life.  Moats shows the drama of people on both sides struggling with their own consciences and dealing with the often very different consciences of their neighbors.  He shows how hearing the stories of real people in real situations can bring understanding and respect, even when it may not bring agreement.<p>And, at the risk of sounding sentimental, I have to admit that I also found this book tremendously inspiring.  This is not "inspirational literature," but, like all stories which reach deep into the heart of what it means to be human and to live together in human society, like all stories which deal with people struggling to live honest lives often at great cost to themselves, this is a very touching story.  Think Profiles in Courage, think Gandhi, think James Baldwin.  This is human history in the making,<p>Moats' book has given me a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Vermont tradition of local, citizen-involved government, and the realization that the question of gay marriage is a battleground not only for civil rights, but for the definition of America.  Are we a society based on respect and liberty, or on some people's religious ideals?  The importance of this issue today cannot be underestimated, and Moats' contribution is tremendously valuable.</span>
