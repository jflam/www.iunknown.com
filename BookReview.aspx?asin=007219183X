                    <span>While this book does cover the software mentioned in its title, it spends a lot of time with the Apache 1.3 series. In fact, Apache 2.0 was still in beta when the book was published so the author seems a little apprehensive with the material.<P>It is nice as a general overview, and contains a lot of good "filler" such as an appendix on common Unix commands and Unix text editors.<P></span>

                    <span>You be better off reading the man file on apache. The author uses inserts from the configuration file of Apache and does not build on it as if the inserts are sufficient explanation for configuring the program. I am insulted. If you still want to buy this book I have mine for sale in the used section for the fraction of the original cost. This book is a waist of time and money.</span>

                    <span>A well organized, well written book that teaches you most of what you need to know to run Apache binaries on a wide range of operating systems, (but mostly on UNIX). It deals with basic and intermediate features of customization of apache. Not much advanced stuff in there. <BR>For you serious developers and system administrators looking for a book to teach you how to create a very versatile and personalized version of apache that will suite your needs, this is not the book for you. Get a book that is OS specific, like the "Linux Apache Web Server Administration" of the Craig Hunt Linux Library.<BR>For those of you who have not many demands of their Apache environment this book is more than enough and would give you a great start and introduction into the wonderful world of Apache...</span>

                    <span>It's a rare technical writer who can be conversational and engaging in her style without compromising either the quality or quanity of the technical information within the work. Wrightson has managed this balancing act, with a guide that is friendly, well organized and above all useful for a web administrator. The book's attention to Mac OS X is also welcome -- far too many Mac users have upgraded to Mac OS X and leapt into Apache but treated it like they'd treat Microsoft Personal Web Sharing. Wrightson's approach makes the power and versitility -- and challenge -- of Apache apparent without making it arcane. Brava!</span>
