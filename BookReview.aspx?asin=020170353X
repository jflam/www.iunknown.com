                <span id="Label1">If you don't have a lot of time, but still want to learn the latest in  C++, you don't have to learn C first. You might learn more by digging into  current language features and classes from the very beginning. That's the  approach that's offered by <I>Accelerated C++</I>, a text that delves into more  advanced C++ features like templates and Standard Template Library (STL)  collection classes early on. This book arguably can get a motivated beginning  programmer into C++ more quickly than other available tutorials.<p>  What separates this title from the rest of the pack is that it jumps right in  with samples that take advantage of the Standard C++ of today--from streams to  built-in container classes, such as vectors and linked lists. Early examples are  more complex than in other books, but the thoroughness and relaxed pace of the  explanations will bring the novice up to speed. (Although it ships at a slender  350 pages, <I>Accelerated C++</I> is packed with samples, tips, and example  problems; about 10 per chapter.)<p>  After a tour of basic C++, the book looks at more advanced C++ features, such as  templates, including built-in support for containers. Besides tapping the  strength of Standard C++, you also will learn to design with your own templates.  (Other tutorials would defer this material until later on.) The authors have  tested the approach in the book in their own teaching, and honed a set of  worthwhile examples that will help anyone get familiar with these powerful  language features. All examples make use of the command line and console  (without GUI programs), but the advantage is that this code should run on any of  today's operating systems and compilers. Later sections cover the basics of  class design, which include good coverage of operator overloading and  inheritance.<p>  With its innovative approach to teaching the language, <I>Accelerated C++</I>  will challenge readers in the right way. It suggests that you don't need to  learn C to be productive in C++. Written in an approachable style, it deserves a  close look from any C++ novice. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to C++ <li>Console I/O with stream  classes <li>Basic string handling <li>Loop and flow-control statements  <li>Arrays <li>Using functions and methods <li>Using Standard Template Library  (STL) containers (vectors, linked lists, and maps) <li>Iterators <li>Sorting and  generic functions <li>Basic class design <li>Pointers and arrays <li>File I/O  <li>Memory-management techniques, including statically and dynamically allocated  memory <li>Adding stream support to custom classes <li>Conversion operators  <li>Operator overloading <li>Friend functions <li>Inheritance <li>Polymorphism  and virtual functions <li>Handle idioms for classes, including reference  counting <li>Quick reference to the C++ language</ul></span>

                    <span>Since I'm reviewing both "Accelerated C++" as well as "Thinking in C++", I thought I'd post the review on both book links.
<br />
<br />There have already been excellent reviews of this book, but I would think the main reason people purchase these books is because they have an explicit purpose, which is to learn Standard C++. That being said, C++ is one of the most powerful and multi-faceted languages around, and no other language provides both high level abstractions and low level control in one programming language as C++.
<br />
<br />Because of these features, it is often opinied that C++ is too complicated, large and takes too long to master. While there are some merits to this criticism, many important real world systems are being bult with C++ and professional developers need to master the fundamentals of C++ now. With that in mind, and after spending (or wasting) much money on various books proclaiming to teach C++ from the ground up, it was not until reading Konig and Moo's "Accelerated C++" and Eckel's "Thinking in C++" and in that order, that I finally "got it".
<br />
<br />Why I emphasize "in that order" in the last paragraph, is due to the methodologies used to teach C++ by ACPP and TICPP, and due to this, its best to read ACPP first, then TICPP for the most effective learning. Here's my reasons:
<br />
<br />ACPP teaches C++ in a top down fashion. What I mean by this, is that the higher level Standard Libraries are integrated right from the start to teach programming contructs such as looping, selection and decisions making using library facilities such as <vector>, <list>, and <map>. The Standard <string> is utilized from chapter zero, and relieves much of the burden of C strings and all the low level details one would have to know to use them properly. This can be especially burdensome to the beginner.
<br />
<br />As important as the container classes are to the Standard library, are the algorithms used with them. ACPP ulitizes these as well, and from chapters 0 to 7, the student is taught to use the common algorthms such as sort(), copy(), find() and accumulate(). By teaching these features right from the beginning, the reader is able to write some non-trivial programs without having to wade through the typical and troublesome C features typically taught in other books. Thus, by the time the Reader reaches the second half of the book (chapters 8-16), s/he is ready to understand how to build their own user defined types, and other important topics such as pointers, memory management, classes, as well as object oriented and generic programming.
<br />
<br />In contrast, TICPP teaches C++ from a more traditional bottom up approach. Throughout the book, the assumption is that the Reader is comming to C++ from a C background. For example, throughout the book starting from chapter 4, Eckel demonstrates a Stash and Stack application, developed first as a "better C", then throughout the book adds features to them such as grouping data structures with the functions that act on them in the form of classes. The concepts of constructors and destructors, function overloading and default arguments, using const and static effectively, inlining, namespaces, references, copy constructors, operator overloading, using new and delete for dynamic objects, etc. are all covered. 
<br />
<br />In my opinion, the last two chapters where virtual functions, abstract classes, and an introduction to templates and iterators are covered, is where the book really shines, as these chapters allow the book to finally culminate the benefits of true object oriented programming and give a solid introduction to generic programming in the form of templates and iterators. By this point, the Stash and Stack examples are utilizing pure virtual functions and iterating through containers in an STL-like fashion that is similar to the ones in the Standard Library. 
<br />
<br />The current trend in C++ is to favor the abstractions provided by the Standard Libraries when developing professional software, and ACPP exemplifies this attitude throughout the book. The lower level C-like aspects of C++ can and have caused much trouble in the form of memory leaks, buffer overruns, etc. Nevertheless, certain class of applications require the ability to get close to the metal, and C++ allows this ability without restrictions when necessary. Also, there are many (and some could argue that most C++ based systems out there still adhere to this) legacy systems where C++ is still being used as a "better C". TICPP is the book that will teach one how to make these programs more type safe, as well as migrating it to take advantage of more modern C++ idioms. And in Volume 2 of TICPP which just came out, Eckel and Allison cover the Standard Library in depth, as well as other professional methodologies such as RTTI, Multiple Inheritence, Design Patterns and Concurrent programming.
<br />
<br />But by careful and methodical study of both books, and as is recommended by me, reading ACPP first then TICPP, one will learn C++ from the highest layer to the lower, then from the lower back up the higher and obtain a through knowledge of the basics of C++. One can then effectively study the more advanced books, such as by Meyers, Sutter, Stroupstrup, etc. and have the confidence to tackle professional C++ projects.
<br />
<br />Postscript - Though I advocate the above learning method for C++, I would like to add that the above two books presume a certain programming maturity, though one does not need to be a guru. A person with the experience typical of first year CS1 (and CS2) in a language like Java or Python (in fact, for a complete novice, I would recommend learning Python first) would be most suited to following the above presciption. Also recommened is to study a book about data stuctures and algorithms, which will provide the Reader with a solid understanding of the mechanisims that underly the STL (meaning the Standard Template Library which encompass the Containers, Iterators and Algorithms of the Standard C++ Library which was originally part of SGI's implementation).

                    <span>It is one of the excellent book I have read. Down to earth approach and very practical. Breaks the tradition of distracting new comers by providing more relavant examples with hands-on approach. Some familiarity with C++ helps to achieve best results with this book. 
<br />
<br />This book will be useful for beginners to intermediate level people. Others can write their own book.
<br />
<br />Authors set the expectation right in their preface and they maintained their claim all the way till the end. Courageous and very well-done.</span>

                    <span>I am a reasonably proficient programmer in C and Java, and I wanted to get up to speed quickly on C++. I found this book did the job admirably. It teaches "modern C++" which essentially means relegating traditional trouble areas such as arrays and pointers to much later in the book. Modern C++ is essentially that defined in the 1998 ISO standard, and it preaches the use of the Standard Library (a subset of which is the STL) which is an excellent library for common data structures and algorithms that operate on them. For example, using a vector you can store as many objects as you like without worrying about memory allocation or pointers. The book explains these concepts very well throught the ongoing development of a student grading program, going all the way up to using templates and class hierarchies. My only gripe is that this application is not particulary exciting to me, although it is a real world scenario.
<br />
<br />Don't be deceived by the relatively small number of pages, there is a lot of dense prose in this book and it will take some time to read it all. Fortunately the authors have a good writing style and they explain every new feature very clearly.
<br />
<br />I must admit this book has made me appreciate the power of "modern" C++ over the earlier pre-standard language. There is no doubt that C++ is an order of magnitude more complex than Java, but this book makes a good attempt at reducing the complexity and I think it succeeds. Once you finish it there is still a long path to tread, but I feel I can now read Stroustrup's book with a semblance of understanding!
<br />
<br />Caveat - This is not a book to give to a complete novice who has never programmed before. For example, it does not explain how to compile programs, or even what compiling means. It does not give instructions for Visual C++, gcc, or any other vendor-specific compiler. It assumes you can use these tools or have another reference for them. IMHO this is the right attitude to take, because otherwise the book would contain a lot of fluff that is not relevant to teaching ISO C++.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book on C++. But maybe a bit steep for those who have not had worked with C++ in real life scenarios. Coming from Java side of the world it was not difficult for me to pick up this book. But perhaps a bit more introductory materials may have been helpful.</span>

                    <span>most books basically teach you how c++ is different from c, which distorts the perspective.
<br />
<br />e.g. examples typically include creating a string class. as if c++ hasn't had one of those for a decade.
<br />
<br />this book is the only one i have found that approaches c++ (and its libraries) as a language in its own right.
<br />
<br />this approach allows the author to correctly prioritize the material, which ultimately will make you a more efficient and accomplished programmer.
<br />
<br />this is the only book i would recommend to beginners.</span>
