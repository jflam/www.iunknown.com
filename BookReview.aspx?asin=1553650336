                    <span>A really nice book for people who are new in sea kayaking.  Have lots of information like outfitters, transportation, maps, etc.  It's a good book to read for info. and to pick the best place to kayak in the NW if you have  only a few days in the region.</span>

                    <span>Invaluable guide.  This book does not just tell the reader where to park and where to camp, also includes history, low impact camping tips, advice on ethics and hygiene and manners.<p>The chapters on various island groups  are described by different authors, with uneven quality.  We have been to  areas covered in three chapters, The Discovery Islands, The Clayoquot  Sound, and the Gulf Islands.  The details of the two of the chapters were  precise, the hazards were as described (as we discovered when we did not  take them seriously enough - I was almost run over by a whale watching boat  in the fog off Vargus Island, a hazard that we had not taken seriously even  though it was clearly described in the chapter).<p>The chapter on the  Discovery Islands in some cases offered vague or incorrect details as to  the location of camp sites.<p>For some reason, we did not find this book on  the Amazon web site by using searches that should have found it, for  example kayaking British Columbia.  But our local Kayak store carried it.</span>
