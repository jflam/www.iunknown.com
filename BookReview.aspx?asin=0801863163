                    <span>This book brings forth the thoughts of one of the most well known and well respected broadcasters in baseball today.  This book came out in 1998 when Miller started as a Giants broadcaster.  His broadcasts on ESPN Sunday Night Baseball and radio broadcasts for the Giants bring out his personality.  He's dedicated to his job and had been interested in broadcasting since he was a child.  His passion for the game of baseball and his attentiveness to perfecting his craft only added to his skill in the descriptions of his broadcasts and brought the feel of the flow of the game while it's unfolding live in front of his eyes.  If you are familiar with Miller's broadcasts on TV or radio then you won't lose a step when reading his book because it is similar to the way he broadcasts.  Miller brings about his thoughts about some of the issues in baseball like realignment as proposed by Bud Selig, to the personalities of owners he has known and how they contributed to the rise or demise of a franchise, and stories about Cal Ripken and some insider accounts from the clubhouse about his consecutive game streak.  Miller bring a good light-hearted folksy humor that will make you smirk or guffaw with tongue in cheek.  It is interesting in the fact that it feels like he conversing with you like you were at a bar and he was telling interesting stories which would be either intriguing or funny.  This is a nice book for baseball fans who want to see things from the perspective of a broadcaster.  The book reads easily and shouldn't take too long to read at all.</span>

                    <span>I received this book along with Joe Morgan's as a Christmas present, and it was interesting to read them in tandem, as it shows why they are such a complementary broadcast team.  Miller's book is more an anecdotal memoir  than a detailed analysis of the game, but that doesn't spoil the enjoyment  of it.  His tribute to Ken Coleman, the retired Red Sox radio broadcaster,  brought back to this Red Sox fan vivid memories of Miller's all-too-brief  stay in Boston. The book, however, suffered from an editing job that  assumed that the reader had a familiarity with Miller's personal life and  career history. For example, there are several references to his first  marriage which both assume that the reader knows that Miller was married  before and why it ended. But these references are extraneous and add  nothing to this picture of Miller as broadcaster and baseball purist --  which, after all, is the book's primary focus.</span>

                    <span>More of a memoir than anything else, the book is unflaggingly interesting and funny, especially if one can imagine Miller himself reading it.  An audiocassette version of this book might well be the ultimate way to  experience it.  In any case, it just breezes by, leaving you with a warm  feeling and a greater desire to hear more Miller broadcasts afterward.</span>

                    <span>Maybe I'm being too critical here.  I mean, I like Jon Miller.  He's an excellent broadcaster.  He certainly knows his baseball.  But can he write?  The answer (even with assistance) is, disappointingly, no.  He has some  good anecdotes, and makes some good points, but as I was reading it, I  couldn't help wondering, "Where is this book going?"  The answer  is nowhere.  It's meandering and disjointed.  He makes all of his  "controversial" points in the first chapter, but then offers  nothing to back up his theses later in the book.  Still, if you want to  learn about Jon Miller, to read some interesting stories about the colorful  players and broadcasters Miller has encountered over the years, AND get a  defense in of Miller's decision to leave the broadcasting booth for the  Baltimore Orioles, then go ahead and buy the book.  But, perhaps you would  feel you're getting your money's worth if you waited for the paperback  version or maybe borrowed it from your local library.</span>
