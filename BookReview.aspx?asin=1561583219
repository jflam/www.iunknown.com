                    <span>I was looking for a well layed out reference guide that I could learn a few tricks of the trade.  This book seemed to spend way to much time setting the reader up for the first day on the job (back in the 70's and 80's mind you), then long-winded yet sparse information on actual methods of trim carpentry.
<br />
<br />If you are willing to read a book from cover to cover on this subject here's your ticket.  But if your looking for concise writting, logical up-to-date illustrations, a book that you can easily reference in a pinch, you might want to steer clear.

                    <span>Great book on trim carpentry techniques for pros or someone who wants to do a professional quality job.  Written from the practical viewpoint of an experienced pro with high standards.  A bit of overkill if you are in a hurry but I would recommend it before trimming several rooms yourself or even if you want to check your contractor's work.</span>

                    <span>Very good book for baseboard, crown, door and window moldings.  It has tons of pictures and illustrations.  On the top of the cover of the book it says: "For Pros/ By Pros".   I would agree with this assesment; but it is easy enough for a handyman type with little molding experience like me to follow also.  After looking through this book, I was tearing out old molding with abondon and the confidence that I could do a good job of getting nice new stuff back in.</span>

                    <span>I am currently in the middle of a massive remodeling project in my house.  I bought this book to learn some simple techniques for installing the molding that was so easy to rip out, but is a pain to put back in.  I read  the book from cover to cover and I found that the book lacked on  illustrations/pictures.  Most of the explanations are only given in  paragraph form, and was hard to follow for me.  This is the only do it  yourself book that I regret buying from Amazon!</span>
