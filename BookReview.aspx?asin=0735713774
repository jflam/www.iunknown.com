                <span id="Label1"><P>As a serious Web designer, you'll want to do one thing and one thing only when you lay your hands on the latest version of Flash: Start tinkering with all its new features. Problem is, that's hard to do on someone else's dime. With Flash MX 2004 Magic, you don't have to! In these pages, 10 Flash wizards draw on their own professional experience to offer 12 real-world projects that let you explore Flash MX 2004 at your leisure. With a focus on areas that can be troublesome for professional users--whether because they present thorny issues or because they draw on completely new features--each lesson provides need-to-know tips, proven techniques, and best practices. By working through the step-by-step tutorials (whose project files and code you'll find on the accompanying CD), you soon will be finding your way around all of Flash MX 2004's new features: CSS support, enhanced components, JSFL, and more. In addition to the code listings and exercise files on the CD-ROM, you'll find videos that clearly demonstrate step by step all the procedures you need to complete in order to create the projects. </P></span>

                    <span>The strength of this book is the 12 projects. They are imaginative and use many of the new features of Flash MX 2004. The projects have good graphics and text and video; and the screen shots are works of art. If what you want are ideas this is a perfect book. If you actually want to build these projects yourself, the authors have left a lot out. In particular, there is not a lot of rationale as to why you are doing certain things. That is, unless you know a lot of Flash, the instructions, while easy to follow if you just type the code, will seem bewildering. There needs to be more explanation, of what is behind the code constructs, not just the code itself.<BR>A number of the "final" versions of the project did not work well.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book, still working through some of it but every tutorial I have been through so far have enjoyed and fully understood, very well done, there are many flash books on the market, I own a fair few, but this one has been most beneficial, laid out nicley, easy to understand and you can't complain about the price, great tips and great design, especially liked the introductory lesson by Rob Hoekman, if you want to learn something new and take a step towards the next level make sure you buy this book.</span>

                    <span>I've been using Flash for years, but I can always get great information from Flash Magic. Where else do you get to see how to build projects created by some of the best developers in the business?<P>There are 12 projects in this book - all built by experienced developers that use Flash constantly to do amazing things. This book highlights a lot of the new features in Flash MX 2004 and offers people that have mastered the basics a way to step up their skill level. I started reading this series of books with Flash 5 Magic, and it's never failed me. I always learn something new and end up with a cool project.<P>Read a hundred books if you want, just make sure this is one of them.</span>
