                    <span>I tend to rely on For Dummies titles to get me out of the starting blocks with the basics upon which a foundation can be built with more advanced tomes. I couldn't believe my luck when I found this in my local library but it was a huge dissapointment. It may be that the subject matter is not suitable to be "dumbed down". Either  way this did not seem like a For Dummies book at all. It was intractable and went to suprising levels of detail on tangenital areas (eg ADO.Net). 
<br />
<br />What would have been the most useful parts of the book testing, deploying web services were marred by a complete dependence on VS .Net which I don't have.
<br />
<br />I find this book has absolutely nothing to recommend it and am glad I didn't spend any money on it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I got this book hoping it would help me figure out how to consume a web service.  I was/am new to asp.net and of course web services.  My only knowledge of web services came from searches on the internet, and as a result, I was not even able to use (consume) the simple Visual Studio example "Hello World" web service.
<br />
<br />When I got this book I skipped everything and thumbed to Chapter 9 on consuming web services where I was able to see a useful and simplified list of steps to follow in Visual Studio that finally allowed me to use the web service.
<br />
<br />Although the book describes ways to create and consume web services without using Visual Studio, I used it as a reference for use with Visual Studio.  I was specifically having trouble figuring out how to include the web service in my Visual Studio project so I could reference the web service's methods.  This book, through the simple list of steps (and helpful definitions of the steps themselves), helped me add the web reference to my project and use the web service's methods in my program.  That was what I really needed.
<br />
<br />Sadly, the rest of the book bored me and may be useful later, but isn't of much other use now than I already mentioned.  Additionally, I thought this book read a bit more technically than did ASP.NET for Dummies.
<br />
<br />If you are new to web services, the book may work for you, but it's nothing really grand.  My opinion is, buy it used, get what you can out of it, then move up to a better book.</span>

                    <span>This book offers no step by step lessons which is to say the least VERY FRUSTRATING when you are learning a new technology.  There are bits and pieces throughout this book that are nice to know but are absolutely useless when you cant apply them to a real world scenerio.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.</span>

                    <span>This book was a joy to read and presented a great holistic approach to .net web services. By that I mean it covered the subject from A to Z including such relevant topics as firewalls, SSL, RAID, UDDI, etc. It is important to have an understanding of the whole infrastructure encompassed by .net web services. <p>I have a background in programming including some web development 4 years ago (prior to .net). Yet I found the book very informative and am thankful I got over my 'a dummy book is not for me' attitude. For example, the author did a history of COM, DCOM, COM+ in nutshell that really helped explain the problems web services solved.<p>The book goes into web services development in enough detail to get you started coding. For serious development you would want a more detailed reference but this is a great starting point.<p>The author has demonstrated an excellent grasp of the web development landscape and put it all together in a cohesive fashion. If you want to find out what the .net furor is all about I highly recommend this author.</span>

                    <span>Despite the previous reviewer's assertion that this book is too advanced for the "dummies" line, I am sure that if you read this book *closely* all of your basic questions would be answered.  I actually think the author did an amazing job of incorporating and summarizing much of what seems like an insurmountable topic,.NET, XML and Web Services, in one book.<p>Kudos to the author.  I highly recommend this book for .NET overview and intro to web services.  It will even have you constructing, debugging and deploying them in no time.</span>
