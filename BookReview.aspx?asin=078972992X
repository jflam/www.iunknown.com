                    <span>What I can tell about this book ?<p>1. Do not buy it...<br>if you have little experience in Java and want to pass SCJD. This book will give you nothing. If you need to learn more about threading, Swing, etc this book is not for you. It looks like author didnt know what to write about - how to design SCJD assignment or give you some knowledge about Java programming. I can't get why there is chapter about threading there, for instance. <br>Locking code has 3 (baaaddd) errors and completely incorrect.<p>2. Buy it...<br>if you just want to know what is SCJD about. It will help you to design your program, at least it will show you HOW to write it. There is no such information on Javaranch. You may borrow something here and there for YOUR assignment (but change the code for your needs :). Having read this book you will be prepared to download assignment, you will know what to do, what you MUST do and what you MUST NOT forget to do. Although the exam has changed since the book was published (marking, some requirements, etc), it is still useful. <br>Anyway, I didnt need another Java tutorial when I bought this book; I just needed advice how to write an assignment. It helped me.</span>

                    <span>I'm so mad I wasted my gift card on this piece of crap. The discontinuous chapters, flawed locking code, incorrect threading, and awkward writing style are so frustrating as to be beyond belief. You're much better of doing your own research, using sites like Javaranch, or buying the good SCJD book. Lesson learned.</span>

                    <span>This book will help you make up your mind about how to implement your assignment for the SCJD exam. It is very straightforward.After reading Habibi's book "The Sun Certified Java Developper Exam with J2SE 1.4", you need to read this book too in order to find out about more techniques which are even simpler.<br>I highly recommend this book to whoever is serious about passing the exam.</span>
