                    <span>Rena's Promise is the beautifully told story of two remarkable young women in their early twenties who endure and survive nearly three and one half years as prisoners of the Nazis in Auschwitz and Ravensbruck. The love that Rena has for her younger sister, Danka, sustains her and helps her to endure the atrocities and indignities forced upon them on a daily basis by the Nazis. During the time they are prisoners, Rena never once forgets the promise to her mother to take care of her younger sister. There are numerous times when Rena unhesitatingly gives up her daily crust of bread in exchange for medicine or a much needed salve for Danka. And at times when Rena is able to "organize" an extra tidbit of food such as a tiny piece of potato peeling, she meticulously divides it and without exception shares it with her beloved sister. Although Rena is the stronger of the two sisters, Danka's strength emerges during the death march when Rena becomes so weak she cannot stand and walk without assistance. Danka refuses to leave her and with the help of a friend, they support Rena until she regains sufficient strength to walk. In the mist of thousands of starving prisoners when a crust of bread could mean the difference of life or death, Rena retained both dignity and honesty. She was once chosen unanimously by more than a hundred women prisoners with whom she worked to divide ten Red Cross packages of food that miraculously made their way into Rena's block. Numerous footnotes are provided by Rena's freelance co-author which helps the reader to place the events of Rena's story into the sequential order of previously documented facts of the Holocaust. Rena's Promise is a testimony of how the love for her sister gave her the will to go on and how something so simple as the offering by a Nazi of a rag to clean her beaten and bloody face was viewed as a great act compassion.</span>

                    <span>rena's promis is one of the best accounts of consintration camps i have ever read. it shows how two sisters fight together and stand together when all the odds are against them. rena never leaves her sister's side and together, they stand up to the forces against them, and bake it through the consintration camps together. this book was heart wrenching, but you always love the two girls and the people who help them through out the book. this book makes you want to just run up and give these two girls a hug; it really is one of the best accounts of the brutality of the S.S. i have ever read, and i will always remember this book.</span>

                    <span>Rena's Promise is a most moving and beautifull Holocaust book, and without all the gore, it still shows the atrocity that was hapenning during the holocaust. Rena also manages to stay un-bitter about her past in the Dark War, making this book a classic memoir to the dead. Astonishing and breath taking, you will be held captive by the past, held in this book.</span>
