                    <span>A good book, clear and easy to understand, and it is also easy to implement the algorithms mentioned in the book into a real world program. I used it as a text book in image processing class. Compared to other books in image processing, this book is a clear winner. The only drawback is the price. Other thing to remember is that this book is old enough in the ever-progressed image processing and computer graphic field.</span>

                    <span>This volume covers the waterfront of image processing from a reasonable introductory level. Refreshingly, it is much more than a cookbook. The authors pay attention to the physical principles that imaging and image manipulation are based on. With many quality images and examples, there is much for the less mathematically inclined to cut their teeth on while brushing up on their advanced math skills. The inclusion of many well chosen problems makes the book a valuable volume in a student's library. The book's associated web-site is a major bonus for the reader. I did find that some of the figure captions were challenging to interpret but the problem does not seem pervasive. Overall, I liked the book. It is a valuable addition to the image processing literature and to the image processing textbook selection.</span>

                    <span>On this site, there are already good reviews of this book.<BR>So I would like to post only a comment on the "Low Price" or "International" or "Indian" edition:<P>IT IS VERY VERY CHEAP and LOW QUALITY<P>The pages are almost transparent. While reading a face of a page, you can guess what is written on the other face. Definitely annoying.</span>

                    <span>I've been a senior researcher in Image Processing for more than 20 years, and my opinion of the book Digital Image Processing of Gonzalez and Woods, is that it is significantly superior to current books on image processing. The contents of the books are in the mainstream of work in this field, and the level of coverage is complete and written at a level that makes it an ideal textbook for seniors and first-year graduate students. The experience of the authors shows through in the way the material is presented and illustrated. The complementary web site is an outstanding teaching aid.</span>
