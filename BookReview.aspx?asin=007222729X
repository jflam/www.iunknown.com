                    <span>I received this book on Tuesday and I literally could not put it down. I consumed it like a great thriller. It contains a great deal of information that can be found no where else in print. Performance monitoring and tuning with the Oracle Wait Interface is still new to many Oracle DBAs, even seasoned ones, precisely because the details of how to gather and interpret the information have been difficult to come by - until now.<P>If you've never heard of the Oracle Wait Interface (OWI), do yourself a huge favor and read this book. You will be thanking me all the way to the bank. The Oracle DBA performance tuning community has been moving in this direction for several years; don't get left behind. Even if you're an OWI tuning expert, the authors make you privy to their experiences with some of the most heavily loaded Oracle databases on the planet as well as where the skeletons are in the OWI closet.<P>This book will help you take your tuning skills to the next level. You will learn how to identify where poorly performing sessions are spending their time, what is slowing them down, who they are competing with, and what those competitors are doing. OK great - what good is knowing all of that if you don't know what to do about it. The authors guide you through this as well with examples and explanations of why the problem occurs and why the solutions work. They point out key concepts to keep in mind when you're tackling a problem that isn't covered in the examples that will help you avoid the cookbook tuning trap.<P>In addition to arming you with the details of the wait interface itself, the authors take you under the covers to lay bare the internal workings of the Oracle kernel's memory management and concurrency control structures so that you can make sense out of what the OWI is telling you.<P>Then, in my favorite chapter, they walk you through the process of building your own OWI monitoring scripts. With these scripts watching the database, you will never again have to wonder what happened while you were asleep. Ever get paged in the middle of the night to solve a performance problem and have no earthly idea what caused it? Ever notice that most people will assume that a performance problem is in the database and it's up to you to prove that it isn't. With the OWI monitoring scripts in place, you will have an uncontestable record of what each session did and when it did it. The database will no longer be an easy target and you will become a highly respected, and yes, perhaps even feared DBA.</span>
