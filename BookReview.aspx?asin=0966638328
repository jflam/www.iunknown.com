                    <span>I teach digital media and design to grade eleven and twelve students. This is the only book on Color that my students responded to with enthusiasm. The book covers color theory very basically. However, it does an excellent job of covering the more important topics of the meaning and psychology of colors and color combinations. The author uses good examples for each section and the book can be used as a learning tool or a resource you can use again and again. My students found the many pantone color combination swatches very useful in helping setup the color schemes for their designs. My students and I recommend this book highly, You might say this review is 5 stars taken 80 times.</span>

                    <span>I really love this book. <P>What it IS: This is a lovely little book filled with colors, color combinations, moods, visuals, designs, ideas, and more color, color, color! I find it sparks reactions, starts dialogue, and fuels creativity for myself and for my clients. As a professional designer, I find this is great to use with clients to help them get VISUALLY into the their project so I can get out of them the things I need to create and produce an effective product that pleases the client AND fulfills its function. I also leave it out on the coffee table in my lounge (with my portfolio) so clients can look at it and they do. <P>What it is NOT: This is not a book about color theory or color management. Although it includes some basic text about how different colors are supposed to convery different things in the marketing and communications world, which may be somewhat useful on some ocassions, color can be so subjective to the individual, the culture, the times, that I wouldn't follow the text as absolute.<P>Recommended? Yes, if you want a fun, inspiring and useful little book that is also lovely to look at and helpful to share with your clients.</span>

                    <span>The work by the now defunct arm of Cheskin research, the Color Research Insititute is much more insightful than anything in this book. Unofrtunatley the scientific research undertaken by this insititute is not available to the General Public and is only available through Cheskin.<P>The color schemes and patterns shown in this book may have been all the rage a few years ago but they definitly do not age very well and are way too bright and gaudy.<P>The author unfortunatley does not give examples of color schemes that work well and have stood the test of time such as Coca Colas color scheme and IBM's "Big Blue" which is a type of blue which has a very powerful effect on the subconscous mind of the viewer and this color alone was shown to actually increase the sales of IBM products once it was widely implemented in their adevertising campaign.<P>This book comes across as a marketing tool for the author pitched at large corporate clients, its deliberate attempt not to give any worthwhile information to readers of this book seems to validate this.<P>Giving this book 2 stars is being generous considering the price. If you know absolutley nothing at all about color then perhaps you will find this book helpful. If you are an interior decorater dont use any of the color scemes this book recommends unless you wish to send your clients to a mental asylum. If you are a markeing manager dont waste your money on this book</span>

                    <span>This is quite a practical book on how to express, how to talk with colours. You don't find cultural or history thoughts on it. <BR>Nothing about Van Gogh, nothing about Mondrian.<BR>But you can find ways to efective use colours in marketing or web interfaces, for instance. <BR>It's more a book to look at than a book to read. It's pretty well illustrated, mainly with ads.</span>

                    <span>This book is packed with great color combinations catorgorized into color schemes by the emotional moods they generate. When I am working with clients in web design, I use this book to help them focus on the tone of their website or product. First, they choose from the many categories such as Classic, Strong, Energetic, Calm, etc., and from there they choose one or two of the perfectly matched color combinations for their basic website colors. It's a great visual tool!<BR>Also included are some basics on color theory, setting moods with color, and some useful advice in choosing appropriate colors for different projects.<BR>Well written, easy to read, and to the point, this book has become a favorite on my desk!</span>
