                    <span>I've run into some rather useful book in the series "For Dummies" but this book almost does honor to its name! And, honestly, what could you expect from Bob Nelson, the author of the "1001 Ways..." series of books? This book is not terrible, actually, but it really doesn't go into much depth. There are better titles to assist you in your pursuit of a self-employed career in consulting (just a simple search of the term "consulting" in Amazon will list a host of them), if you want to go beyond a casual reading sitting at a Barnes and Noble or Border's store, which is what I did with this title, to draw the conclusion that I now share with you. Beginning consultants of the world: consult elsewhere is my piece of advice!</span>

                    <span>As an experienced consultant, I was surprised to find the amount of useful information in this book that I did. As a "...For Dummies" book, I expected that the information would be too basic for anyone with any real experience. Certainly, the book is geared toward beginners; however, I felt that the initial client interview checklist, suggestions for creating an implemenation plan, post-implementation impact study, and information on interim and final reports were really solid (although they could/should all be addressed in more detail). My one real complaint about this book is the lack of any meaningful discussion on proposals. All professionals new to consulting should know that proposals are an important marketing tool. Sure, there are a lot of consultants who avoid writing them, but the purpose of the proposal is not only to market the current project but A CHAIN OF PROJECTS. Proposals don't have to be overly complex. In fact, 65-85% of the material can be standard boilerplate. However, when you are long gone and your presentation is all but forgotten, your proposal and final reports will likely still be around. Believe me, the proposal is a powerful marketing device (if done correctly). Unfortunately, this book provides zero insight into how to craft a winning proposal. Otherwise, this is a good little guide for new consultants.  However, two far better choices would be Alan Weiss' "Million Dollar Consulting" and/or his "Getting Started in Consulting."  Overall grade: B/B+</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I was planning on going into consulting and read many good reviews only to be disappointed. I agree with fsb102 in that it states the obvious, things that common sense will tell you. For example: be organized, referrals are key, have prepared letters, be professional. Even what to include in the letters is basic.<p>However, I do see how this can help someone completely new to business or consulting, especially someone that hasn't gone to college. It gives a basic understanding of what consulting is about.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book thinking it would be a great overview of the consulting profession and a how-to for private consulting.  What I ended up reading was bland summarizations of overly obvious facts--very few chapters in this book don't rehash past topics.  My recommendation to any would-be buyer is this: if you have a college education, especially in business, spend your money elsewhere.  (Same goes for those who possess above average logic) Otherwise, this book might be sufficient for you.</span>
