                <span id="Label1">Red Pine (a.k.a. Bill Porter) offers a new perspective on the Chinese classic Taoteching. A competent translator and interpreter of Chinese religion, he renders his work with an eye for detail and a spiritualism cultivated during years of Zen monastery living. It's odd that many read translations of Chinese classics as bare-bones texts, whereas no Chinese would tackle such obscurity in the absence of a helping hand from previous pundits. Fortunately, it is no longer necessary to rely on mystical insight in order to understand the Taoteching. Instead, we can look to the 12 or so commentators that Red Pine resurrects from Chinese history. With its clarity and scholarly range, this version of the Taoteching works as both a readable text and a valuable resource of Taoist interpretation.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>    As, of late, my spiritual focus has been shifting from Buddhism to Taoism, I've found myself, of neccessity, reading and re-reading various translations of the Tao Te Ching.  I think it was after reading the Feng/English illustrated translation that I began to come to the realization that translating this text is kind of difficult and that a definitive translation of the Tao Te Ching is pretty much impossible.  Ancient Chinese strikes me as a rather thorny language, and Lao Tzu's use of it - his terse and quite lyrical poetics - only add to the difficulty.   It's no wonder there are upwards of 70 translations of the thing, of varying quality.  
<br />
<br />    But Red Pine's effort stands, I think, near the top.  For a number of reasons.  For one, he draws on multiple variants of the original text, dancing back and forth to seek the clearest words.  More importantly, he includes commentaries from numerous sources - Taoist, Confucian, Buddhist.  Given the opacity of the ancient Chinese, it's my understanding that there are few who would undertake a reading of something in the language sans commentary - including it is a *very* helpful choice.  
<br />
<br />    And I have to say I do like the the inclusion, neatly printed, of the original Chinese.  Having just finished Alan Watts's Tao: The Watercourse Way, which begins with a lengthy monologue on the virtues of an ideographic language in general and Chinese in particular, my interest in written Chinese has been piqued.  And it's quite nice to be able to go from a line of English to a line of Chinese and get a rough feel for what's going on.
<br />
<br />    Any complaints?  Personally, being something of a linguistics geek, I would have like Red Pine to add more talk of the nuts and bolts of his translation.  As it is, he confines his comment to explaining major divergences from the commonly accepted text.  I understand why he did it - a desire to keep each verse contained on two pages - but I wish he'd perhaps thrown this sort of commentary into some end notes or something.  A last complaint would be that there seem to be times when Red Pine sacrifices lyricism for clarity.  While this is a very poetic translation, there are moments of clunkiness, where beuaty takes a back seat.  Then again, 'True words aren't beautiful, beautiful words aren't true,' so there you go.
<br />
<br />    These quibbles (and they are nothing more than that) aside, this is an excellent translation.  While you should certainly not limit yourself to it in your studies, it is an essential one that I give my highest recommendation.</span>

                    <span>   For those interested in the Tao Te Ching, the red pine translation is indispensible. Though there's little way to check the historical or translational accuracy in the provided sources to each stanza, they remain an invaluble insight to the meaning of each, significantly helping to aid your understanding, and come to a conclusion on your own.
<br />
<br />   I recommend this book to anyone I feel may benefit from it's wisdom, and plan whole heartedly on sending a copy of it as a gift to every elected president of the united states that comes along, as the book was originally intended as a commentary itself towards the ruling class.</span>

                    <span>This is the most helpful book on Taoism I have ever read. After years of reading different translations, overtly loose or too stiff interpretations, and inaccurate relativistic teachings by some Taoist "experts", I have never found a better translation and study book on the Tao concept. The commentaries are very insightful and very useful with several comments on each chapter to look through and compare. The whole book is very practical and nice to read. I'm fairly skeptical at heart (indeed, a skeptic), but there is plenty of wisdom here that is just plain obvious and helpful. If I could only choose one book on Taoism to have, THIS WOULD BE IT. I even bought a spare. I think that much of it.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the short-list finest English translations of this indispensable work of cosmic insight and practical wisdom (the two are, as Lao Tzu repeatedly points out, identical in effect). Like Jonathan Star's translation (in his wonderful verbatim text), Pine's work is the rendering of a person with a scholarly background who clearly has made a heart-connection with his subject; in short, this is the work of man who loves the Tao and refuses to hide behind a cloak of academic pretence in his translation. The only distraction to the book is its inclusion of commentary from various sources directly on the page with the poems: I much prefer having the translator's or others' commentary in the back of the text, so that the reader can fully experience the poems in the main part of the text independently, without the distraction of "expert insight." These are poems that should be read and re-read, time and again, year after year, for this is a work that always refreshes itself and its readers. In other respects, however, Pine's translation is well worth a spot on the shelf of any lover of the Tao.</span>

This is the only translation I have found that conveys the profound clarity and simplicity of the Tao.  <p>I will go one step further:  This is the greatest holy book I have read.  <p>I plan on reading every book by Red Pine/Bill Porter.</span>
