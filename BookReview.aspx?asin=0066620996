                <span id="Label1">Five years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, "Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?" In <I>Good to Great</I> Collins, the author of <I>Built to Last</I>, concludes that it is possible, but finds there are no silver bullets. Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider. Like <I>Built to Last</I>, <I>Good to Great</I> is one of those books that managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come. --<I>Harry C. Edwards</I>  </span>

                    <span>Trust Jim Collins to make a management book that is both engaging and logical. Good To Great's elegant simplicity belies the huge amounts of research and interviews that went into it.<P>The book espouses the classic "find the right people", "ready for change" and "steady wins the race" virtues for making a business empire. The book also expressed typical distaste for corporate extravagance, marketing hyperbole and superstar executives. Granted, there is nothing new or radical here.<P>Sometimes I find the management terms here grating. The "flywheel" idea and the "hedgehog and fox" concept sounds downright silly to me, although the underlying principles are insightful. Also, I am not too comfortable with Collins' use of comparison companies. According to the book, the companies that did not apply the fundamental principles are doomed to absolute failure. <P>Good book overall. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun to read.</span>

                    <span>There have been many well-thought, good reviews on this book by Jim Collins. I will try to provide one more, with a slightly different perspective. This text is all about people - how to understand them, lead them, tap into them, and in so doing- how to create an organization that flourishes for sustained periods. Collins brilliantly discusses how to select the appropriate team, what to look for in a CEO and in managers (Level 5 Leadership), how to go about making truly effective decisions, how to create a culture that encourages honesty and creativity, how momentum is both created and maintained, how to be the best at what your company does, and much more! <P>Essentially the above is a very brief summary from most of the chapters. Beyond that, this book is practical. It provides keys and real examples on how to do the principes rather than giving the reader mere theory with little real-life application. This book is a huge breath of fresh, real-world air in that it is not trendy. It is down to earth, well written, fun to read, and the author does not try to impress by coming up with some grand, new theme that sounds impressive but leaves little life application available. This is far and away the best business book I have ever read. I've read it twice and am about to begin my 3rd read. It will inspire you and open your eyes to the role of people, of management, of the organizations culture, and to refreshingly practical and proven ideas that work wonderfully from your home to your church to your Fortune 500 company. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>Collins' curiosity and clear study brings to light some of those factors that contribute to greatness. These findings are grounded within individual, teachable 'points of view' which are easily applied to large organisations and applicable to small busness as well. <BR>Collins puts his findings in clear accessable language. Including the finding that is responsible for the title... That good is the enemy of great.<BR>I highly recommend this book/CD to leaders that are enaged with designing futures and those that work with them. It is core reading for key teams. It has made a significant difference in being able to articulate powerful conversations with teams about that which is tacit and critical to success. Giving common language and principles to engage with. A great study book for learning teams.</span>

                    <span><BR>Read it - but maybe buy it used<P>This books does however ask some good questions about how to go from being good to GREAT such as:<P>1. What am I(or what is the company) intrinsically passionate about?<BR>2. What is the company\I good at? and does this "thing" come naturally?<BR>3. Finally does this area that was chosen have "GREAT" potential?<P>On the other hand, here are some questions that I felt were left unanswered:<P>Can't you be GREAT at two things at the same time?<P>According to Jack Welch's book, you should strive to be #1 OR #2.<BR>btw: Aren't there three medals awarded in the Olympics?<P>What about sales? The Mary Kay Company motto is "Nothing happens until somebody sells something." (from her book)<P>What about creating barriers to entry for competitors? (to protect market share like Carnegie or Rockefeller did)<P>Why didn't you include MORE on the failures of the Good to Great companies? Not just the failures of the competition. Guys like Edison, Lincoln had many defeats before they found ultimate success.<BR>Doesn't bouncing back from failures have something to do with going from Good to Great?<P>The author mentions getting the right people in the right seats on the bus and the wrong people off. I believe this is an oversimplification. Age, salary, tenure, unions, hierarchy etc make this a very difficult task to accomplish!!<P>Yes this book took 5 years to write and was supported by 21 staff researchers BUT I am not totally convinced of the results. (and I liked the first book - Built to Last)<BR>That's why I gave it only 3 stars</span>

It is a very pleasurable and easy read that will certainly set off light bulbs in your head. The coverage of the iterative process of buildup and breakthrough is outstanding. If you are an executive, manager, or entrepreneur, make sure you grab this book and take it to the beach or knock it out over a weekend. It certainly belongs in your library.</span>
