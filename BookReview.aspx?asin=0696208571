                    <span>I thought this would be a book on novel ways to stash your stuff.  It was... but I was looking for ideas on cool containers and other low-budget ways to fit more storage space in my one-bedroom apartment.  It instead is a book on good ideas (with great photos) if you're already tearing out a wall in your house, as in great for long term construction plans, but not so helpful for those with a more transient, non-house-owning lifestyle.  If I had my own house, I would have given 4 stars.  Apartment dwellers, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>As an Australian Home Renovator I'm always a little concerned about how relevant an American book will be to me.  This book gave me no such concern.  I initially brought the book for some general storage ideas.  What impressed me were the fantastic photo's of solutions that not only help control clutter but also add great design features to my home.  I especially like the transformation of an old built in wardrobe (or closet) into a tiny library.  A fantastic, attractive solution for my book storing dilemma!  Also easily achieved in the small space of a 2 bedroom apartment where some rooms have duel duties.</span>

                    <span>Like most of the BH&G decorating books, I've found this one to be an exceptional value. Every page has full color photos and interresting ideas for making the most out of a small amount of space. The book centers around  a "new traditional" or "eclectic" style, but most ideas  could probably be adapted to fit any decorating style. Includes a page  titled, "Style and Your Television" - I don't know anybody that  couldn't use some help there! This book would probably be most helpful for  those either considering remodeling or construction, or those with some  carpentry skills, but there are some great ideas for construction-free  storage also. Worth the money!</span>

                    <span>This title by Better Homes and Gardens editors really helped me in planning two built in storage projects.  <p>The book is organized by type of rooms with sections on: Living & Dining Rms; Kitchens, Bed &  Bath Rms; Home Office.<p>The book is not a how-to so it really just gives  you ideas but there are plenty of ideas and some practical helpful  tips.<p>I've read 3-4 of the Storage Idea books and think this is the best  of the ones I've seen because it has an excellent variety of types and  styles.  Also the photography is better than most.</span>
