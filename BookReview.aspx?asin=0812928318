                    <span>Tony Kornheiser is one of those insanely talented columnists who doesn't get half the press he deserves. With the warped worldview and hilarious self-deprecation of a Jewish Dave Barry, Kornheiser skewers the absurdities of everyday life -- and a few items that aren't so everyday. ("Nudes on Ice" being an example of the latter)<P>Tony offers his commentary on presidential golf ("Republicans hit players, Democrats hit on them"); Chinese food and why it will kill you, and what this means for the Jewish community; men's behinds and the revelation that women look at them; bringing food into movie theaters; gyms and how awful it is to work out -- especially if you are already fat; the truth behind the NC-17 rating; Barbie dolls; the differences between the sexes ("I busted Jason's nose"); various names from around the world ("I am grateful to my parents for naming me Anthony Irwin Kornheiser because it gives me license to say anything I want about other people's names"); yuppie catalogs with designer birdfeed and "Soap on a Rope"; and many, many more.<P>Tony has a wonderfully open mind -- he makes fun of pretty much everybody, regardless of race, gender, politics, class, and just about anything else. He frequently gets embarrassed and befuddled by the events in this book. And like his friend Dave Barry (who provides him with an incredibly funny cover quote) Tony says things in such a way that they make a great deal of absurd sense.<P>"Pumping Irony" is the antidote to boredom. Open this puppy up and laugh yourself silly from cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>Full disclosure: I am a HUGE Tony Kornheiser fan. I listen to his daily radio sports talk show religiously and have always enjoyed his sports columns in The Washington Post. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed by "Pumping Irony." The book is a collection of columns Tony wrote for The Post's Sunday Style section, none of which have anything to do with sports. As Tony demonstrates on his radio show, he is capable of being quite funny when discussing topics other than sports. He is much funnier, however, when he is being spontaneous on his show. When he labors over the material and reduces it to the printed page, it just doesn't come off as well. As a result, the book reads like one of the many recent books by various stand up comedians. Without their comic delivery and timing, the jokes just don't have the same effect. <P>Overall, "Pumping Irony" is not the best place to enjoy the engaging wit of Tony Kornheiser.</span>
