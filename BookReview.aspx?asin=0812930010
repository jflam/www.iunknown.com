                <span id="Label1">Everyone knows that a good canon debate doesn't get interesting until you reach the realm of the top 100. But by listing the top 1,000 movies, as the editors of <I>The New York Times</I> have done with this fat, readable collection of reviews, you get to skip all that huffing and puffing about quality and head straight for the fun. With a little elbow room, there's space for ineffable stuff like <I>Mr. Hulot's Holiday</I> and <I>The Match Factory Girl</I>. Room, too, for the nuance-free <I>Mrs. Doubtfire</I> and the free-falling <I>Die Hard</I> (which makes it, yep, right next to <I>Diner</I>). <I>Pillow Talk</I> squeezes in just one down from <I>The Piano</I>. What's really new about this book, though, is that the reviews have been culled from the <I>Times</I>'s archive--reaching back to 1931. So you can read Vincent Canby reacting to <I>Taxi Driver</I> in 1976, just days after first seeing it: "The steam billowing up around the manhole cover in the street is a dead giveaway. Manhattan is a thin cement lid over the entrance to hell, and the lid is full of cracks." Not bad for a guy on deadline. Bosley Crowther, who preceded Canby, fares less well, waving off <I>Rear Window</I> as Hitchcock's "new melodrama, " and <I>Psycho</I> with, "It does seem slowly paced." By contrast, Janet Maslin's more recent reviews hum and gush, unraveling the merits of <I>Pulp Fiction</I> and <I>Lone Star</I>. At collected-Shakespeare size (999 pages), the title is probably too vast for schlepping around, but go ahead, try reading just one. With plenty of international selections, including usual suspects from France (Truffaut), Italy (Fellini), and Japan (Itami), as well as some unusual ones from Brazil, Mexico, India, and Czechoslovakia, there's enough canon fodder here for at least five "Top 100" books. <I>--Lyall Bush</I></span>

                    <span>If you have any film buffs on your Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa shopping list, buy them this book and wait for the gratitude. Of course no one's going to agree on every movie included, and everyone's going to be angered by some omissions... But that's what makes this book so much fun. Film buffs (like me) love getting all riled up over these kinds of things.<P>But the reason this book is really essential is that, rather than explaining why each included film is great or "important", the editors chose to include the original reviews printed in the Times when the films were released. Seeing how some of these classics were reviewed in their own time is a real kick. Some, like "Casablanca", were rightfully praised. But check out the scathing review of "Dr. Strangelove", which was clearly ahead of its time.<P>Of course there will never be a definitive list of 1,000 best movies, but a book like this is really more of a jumping off point for discussion. Personally, I admire a list that's willing to put well-made genre flicks like "Nightmare on Elm Street" alongside classy Hollywood landmarks like "Sunset Boulevard". Not everyone will agree. But they'll definitely enjoy the debate.</span>

                    <span>The book is really a compilation of reviews by NY Times film critics of what they feel are the 1000 best movies ever made. The films inclusions were based on not only quality, but on inventiveness and influence. The films are not ranked, but merely presented in alphabetical order. The real interest of the book is that the reviews are reprints from their actual newspaper appearances. You get the first impressions of the reviewers and they are not diluted by the hindsight that you get in other film review compilations. Vincent Canby practically invented the role of the film critic and to read his reviews are a real treat. Even with 1000 movies, there are some omissions like Jaws, but overall, the book is an interesting read for anyone who is a film buff.</span>

                    <span>The The New York Times Guide to the Best 1000 Movies Ever Made, is not only a lengthy book to go through, but also seems like a list of good movies from a college student who thinks he will be heir to criticism fame, once Ebert dies... <P>The first mistake of the book is by only including films that were reviewed by the New York Times, which leaves out excellent films such as "Pandora's Box", "Metropolis", various Chaplin classics, "Intolerance", "Birth of a Nation", and on a subtler note, "Nanook of the North"... Now, I understand that the primary reason for exlcuding these films is the fact that the Times did not have reviews to go along with them, since the book's secondary purpose seems to be learning what it was like to see these films at the time of release... Yet, they could have easily listed these pre-Times films in the back of the book (they seemed to have no trouble at all putting films like "Closely Watched Trains" over there with no review)...<P>Next are the curious picks for the "best" 1000 films of all time... Does anyone REALLY think that films such as "10", "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song", and "Heavy Traffic" belong in this book with no mention of "Terminator 2", "Dances with Wolves", or the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy? Surely the Times has some critics that can say that the first two LOTR films were better than "A.I." or "About Schmidt"... Now, I thought the latter two films were excellent, but a book that is clearly saying that the 1000 best films of all time are in this book, they would have to save themselves from a mass disagreement from the public (all 3 LOTR films are in the top 10 on the IMDb, where mostly ordinary people rate films)... <P>However, this book does bring to light classics and foreign films that are otherwise never published in books like this... I would have never been granted to joy of seeing "L' Atalante", "Close-Up" or "Heimat", had they not been included in this book... <P>Another reviewer complained about the fact that some films are not in print on VHS or DVD, but this is a stupid thing to whine about... The Criterion Collection does a good job of releasing films that are in this situation... And some films are in fact, available on VHS, but many believe they do not exist if amazon.com does not list them... One of the films in this book, "L' Age d'Or" is available on VHS through the New York Film Annex (NYFA), and can be ordered through the movies unlimited website at www.moviesunlimited.com... You can probably find more films in this book at that site as well...<P>Overall, this book is helpful in finding films that are excellent, but are usually kept as low-profile, and hidden away from film buffs, but film buffs will all the same, be scratching their heads at the listing of "Beetlejuice" in this book...</span>

                    <span>Other reviewers have pointed out the problem of this volume being biased toward more recent films and the omission of genre and lower budgeted classics and some have (wrongly, in my opinion) protested that it is just a collection of reviews written at the time of the films' release (surely that was the intention and not an unworthy one as the reactions of past reviewers build a bit of historical-cultural perspective into the readings.)<P>The main offense of this volume (again probably by design, but in no reasonable way defensible) is the exclusion of the entire silent film era and thus the best films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin to select only two of the most obvious. While interest in silent film seems to be a bit on the upswing, with a great many titles available on DVD and pretty regular exposure on Turner Classic Movies, more needs to be done to spread the word that there was great stuff to see out there before the coming of sound.<P>Let's hope the next edition of this book doesn't limit itself only to films made in color, or the version after that only to films made in color and widescreen. While excluding silent film is easier, more or less by date, it is an exclusion no more logical or justifiable than the two at the beginning of this paragraph.</span>

                    <span>This is going to be the shortest review I've ever written. I checked out this book from the library and photocopied the "by genre" list in the back. I checked off the ones I had seen (suprisingly few considering how long I've been an avid film fan.) Anyway, as I was going through the list I found the 1950's version of "Death of a Salesman" listed. Now, everyone who has ever looked for that film will tell you it's not available on home video. So, why include it? Anyone who dared to try and tackle watching even a fraction of the movies listed here would have to use another guide such as Leonard Maltin's just to ascertain wheather or not the film is available. I am thinking of looking into "The best Films to Rent you've never heard of" Its actually an achievable goal and at the very least you know the films are available.</span>
