                <span id="Label1">Being your own boss, as anyone who's tried it can attest, is not as easy as it looks. The rewards can be great, but hurdles abound--and many fledgling entrepreneurs never manage to get beyond the latter in order to enjoy the former. Well-known experts Sarah and Paul Edwards believe it can be done, though, and present solid tips for thriving as well as surviving in <b>Secrets of Self-Employment</b>, an expanded version of one of their popular early works.  </span>

                    <span>I am working from home with my third business,its very sucessful by my standards, and I have its growth firmly under control.I picked up a copy of this at the library, wish I had read it two businesses ago.
<br />If you have a small business, or want to start one, please read this first, its the best small business book you can read. Its honest, no hype or promo work, I now have a copy and use it it to keep on track wit hsome of my details. 
<br />Many of the lessons in the book I learned the hard way over the last ten years, by reading this you can avoid a lot of Pain!</span>

                    <span>People who look to this book for a how-to manual on financing, marketing, incorporating, etc. will be disappointed. And that's OK, because it offers something much more precious - peace of mind. That's not to say there isn't general advice about some of these issues and even some real targeted suggestions to solve certain problems, but the focus is more on the mindset of being your own boss, at start-up and beyond. A step-by-step, "put Tab A in Slot B" book almost seems like putting the cart before the horse after reading this. If the mind isn't ready or is struggling, everything that comes after will be a struggle too despite the best instruction manual. <p>I am in the process of opening my own business after being "downsized" for the last time. Some days have been up and some days have been down. Some days I thought I should throw in the towel and go live in a hut somewhere far, far away. This book has shown me that all of this is normal and has shown me how to use the up moments and push past the down ones to get what I want. It's amazing the way the authors almost seem to step inside your head. They are supportive, clear and offer real, usable advice to keep on track mentally, exult in your victories and deal with the difficulties as they arise. The format is conversational, friendly, uplifting and confidence-building.<p>This book will be part of my "business bible" collection - those books I will refer to again and again as I grow my business.</span>

                    <span>I am intending to start my own little business but have no idea how to, and bought this book.  to my dissappointment, this book is so general and not touching the point. it tells me how great it is to start your own business...etc which i knew already, and left me unchanged about how to start my business and wondering where the hell the secrets are?!! <br>If I want to know how to build a house, I don't need to know how great it is having my own house.. instead, I need to know that first i need to find the perfect land and other important steps.  The book can save much  paper in cutting off all the repetition of unnecessary sentences.</span>

                    <span>My daughter bought this book for me and it made me tenfold over the price of the book within one week by using one of the tips. The Edwards' format is easy to read and they go through all the possible setbacks of self-employment and how to avoid them. I've been a freelance writer for two years, but anyone - whether starting to work on their own or in the business for 10 years - can learn from this book. It's well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>I am 21 years old, and would love to be a part time real estate investor and be an independent personal trainer!  I am in college, and have had low paying minimum wage jobs(working for someone else) and my LONG TERM goal is  to be my own boss.  Why spend your whole life working under 1 person's  clock, with only one set paycheck(a lousy one at that) when you are capable  of so much more?   To me having your paycheck dependent upon only one  person is much riskier than getting the same amount if not more from lots  of other people.  All of the males in my father's side of the family worked  for themselves.  Here is what my great-great grandfather once told my own  father, "It is best to get $1 from 100 people, then to get $100 from  only one person".</span>
