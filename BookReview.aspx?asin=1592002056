                    <span>As I went through this book, I thought that it was very similar to the "[programming language X] for Absolute Beginners" series. It turns out that the author did, in fact, also write "Python for Absolute Beginners", so there you go.
<br />
<br />The code snippet that is supposed to prevent the console from automatically closing upon program completion doesn't always work as intended. I wrote a method that handled this better, so no biggie.
<br />
<br />Other than that, I think this is a good introduction for someone new to C/C++ and to programming in general.
<br />
<br />It might be disappointing for people who want to program graphics, DirectX, OpenGL, and the like --- the programs here are strictly console. You have to start somewhere, though, and if you want to program games in C/C++, you first have to understand C/C++. This book teaches the basics of C/C++ well.
<br />
<br />If you want to make pretty pictures and don't care what language you're doing it in, though, then Michael Dawson's "Python for Absolute Beginners" will give you more satisfaction because Python is both a serious language (several commercially successful games like "Freedom Force" have been written in Python), and easier to learn and deal with than C/C++.
<br />
<br />It's your choice: if you want to start learning C/C++, this is a good introduction; if you want to learn game programming with graphics, start with "Python for Absolute Beginners" and then go on to a book like "Game Programming with Python".</span>

                    <span>This is a reasonable introduction to C++ and lays a lot of ground work for moving into more complicated aspects of game programming. What it doesn't do is teach you anything about displaying graphics: all of the programing is text only DOS-type games. You will need to learn win32 API or some other image display stuff before writhing even simple graphic programs. 
<br />
<br />That said, I found the game-oriented presentation to be helpful. It makes the various functions a lot easier to understand when they are presented in a familiar context (gaming), with practical uses. A failing of many other programming books is that they take a rather abstract approach, leaving you unsure what you would ever use something for.</span>

                    <span>This has to be the best book I have so far.  Very easily to understand. He is in-depth about every line of code (you will never say "what does that code do?" All of the code on the disk works 100%. I recommend this to anyone wanting to learn C++, even if you have never used it.  And a very big plus, if you need questions you can contact the author and he will help you out.</span>

                    <span>all in all, i thought this book presented everything a clear manner easy-to-do manner.  i highly recommend this book for anyone who knows NOTHING about c++.  the book was fun and quick, at no point was there a period of "so... bored....".  the only reason i gave it four stars is because it doesn't get into the use of any other stream other than , and trust me, there ARE others you'll want to know, i suggest that you get this book coupled with a c++ primer, read this book first then you can breeze through the parts in the primer that are covered in this book and focus on the newer subjects, besides all authors explain things differently, if there was something you didn't quite grasp the primer might do a better job at explaining it (unlikely though, because like i said this book was VERY easy to follow).</span>

                    <span>I've been a programmer (vb, asp, perl) for years and have always wanted to get into the higher leveled language of C++ but could never find a book that I enjoyed that could teach me the basics. This book was my savior and the perfect intro to C++, better than any other book I've been able to find. 
<br />The title is misleading because it's gaming aspect is just for reference. Each program is given a background in a game environment just so the problem at hand makes sense.
<br />This book teaches good practice, preplanning and it's code examples and explanations are excellent and thorough without getting too involved in everything. Read a chapter, go back and do the examples and it all starts to make sense, I'd recommend this book as a great starting point to anyone that wants to learn C++.</span>
