                    <span>This book came in handy many times while setting up, optimizing, administrating, and fixing Exchange Server 5.5. This is a great reference tool to keep by yourside at all times. All the important topics are covered and it was nice to get a quick lesson on ASP at the end of the book. Truth be told, this book got me started on programming in ASP.</span>

                    <span>For an introduction (and a very solid one at that..) to the workings of Exchange Server 5.5 - then look no further. This book has it all. Exchange 5.5 is legendary for the amount of configuration that can be done (the volume of property sheets in this product can be staggering) - this book guides you through the quagmire and leaves you feeling all the more confident about managing an exchange 5.5 environment. Indeed - after spending some time with this book and 5.5 managing exchange 2000 is a breeze...</span>

                    <span>This is a great administrator's book, it walks you through every step of Exchange Server. I can literally start from the beginning and set up an Exchange environment. I would, however, not recommend it to those unfamiliar with NT or networking.</span>

                    <span>When I took over as the Network Manager I was given the responsibility of all the applications, and with little experience working with Exchange Server I was in a position of not knowing enough to support the end users.<P> <P>As the Network Manager I am the person the end-users turn to to fix whatever is broken and with Exchange there is so many things and options you have to worry about I had to find a book that would help me. Since this is a Microsoft Application I turned to the source for the answers and I am very glad I did.<P> <P>Within the 950 page manual I found information on the planning, installation, managing, administration and using public folders. I found answers to protocols questions, how to setup and work with security and answers to my questions about client and client software.<P> <P>There is also information about OWA and outlook, backups, recovery, troubleshooting, using forms and active server. The book is filled with diagrams, tables, figures and screen shots to make sure you have a look at what happens before you start the process.<P> <P>Included in this book is a cd-rom with utilities for Exchange, overall this is by far on the most important books I have obtained so far and I am using it regularly in my everyday work.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book if you are starting to learn about Exchange 5.5. It starts with a great overview of how exchange server works and how it integrates with NT Server. It is very easy to read and by the end you are ready to buy Jim McBee's 24 Hour series book on Exchange 5.5</span>
