                    <span>This is a great book to have and easy to understand. I used his basic strategy for online gambling. I used a combination of "Lose Press" and "Win Press" betting which I learned from this book. Of course you can't count cards online but I didn't need to.<p>The 1st time I gambled online I doubled my money from $1,000.00 to $2,000.00. The 2nd time I played I started with a thousand dollars and was up to $1,700.00. Then I got to confident and lost the money with a total of only $700.00. I lost $300.00 of my own money. But I didn't panic and I made it up again. I went from $700 back to a thousand, which is what I started with. I took out my money and now I'm studing this book like a College Mid-Term book. <p>My only only complaint is that the Basic Strategy is changed slightly at different locations. Atlantic City, Reno, Vegas Downtown, and the Vegas Strip are each slighly different. This book only covers the Basic Strategy for the Strip.<p>True I did lose my money, but I made it back up and didn't lose a dime playing in the long run. This is a very powerful book and I can't wait to learn the card counting chapters.</span>

                    <span>When a person walks into a casino they are looking for one of two things.  To win money or have a good time and the latter is always a good thing.  So the question is this:  Is there a way a person can win in a casino?  The answer is: maybe...... <p>How can someone do it?  It is not easy but a book has emerged on the market that has made it a lot easier to accomplish.  "Beginner to Pro" by Stephen Mead. <p>This is a no-nonsense book about the game "21" written in a clear concise manner.  It begins with a bit of history on the game but does not get to intricate details.  What it does emphasize is the teaching of Basic Strategy techniques.  Again it does not delve into the mathematics of why it works but provides the lessons and practice charts in order to help a person advance themselves.  It is broken down for each individual decision and they are illustrated in a manner which makes learning easy and, more importantly, fun.<p>Beginner To Pro also gives information about strategies for the advanced player.  This includes Card-Counting, Shuffle-Tracking and Money Management as well as giving lessons and self-tests with which to practice before a person actually uses his simple and easy to learn techniques in the real world.  He includes both an accurate and a casual system to make counting less like work so you can more enjoy your time at the casino.<p>Also included in the book are several sections that will keep the reader interested.  An F.A.Q. section answers questions most guests have about the casino industry and how it works.  Casino Etiquette gets into what a guest should expect and be expected of while visiting a casino.  A section on complimentaries is also included to give the player the basics of how they can best utilize the comp system.  A section on cheating in the casino is also found in the book on how both a casino and a patron can pull off a fast one.  Although not really necessary this section does make for interesting reading.<p>Can this book make you a winner in a casino?  Well, as a Pit Manager I can say this.  I have read a lot of "Beat the House" type of books and this one is a little different than most.  It tells you right up front about the game reminding you that you may not beat the house every time but patience, dedication, practice, and common sense can make you a winner. <p> I recommend this book for any casual player looking to gain a little edge on the house.</span>

                    <span>As someone who usually does not play table games at the casinos and was sick and tired of being robbed by the one armed bandit [slot machine], I decided it was time to learn a few new tricks. <p>And thus I worked to understand Black Jack aka 21. This was one of several books I purchased on the topic and I have poured over 100s of internet articles on card counting, cheating and other issues related to the game.<p>While I have always known how to play Blackjack informally, I know that only a fool sits down at a table in a Casino and starts placing bets without knowing every nook and cranny of the rules. I knew that the object of the game was to get as close to 21 without going over. I was also aware of splits and other such maneuvers. <p>Mead's book taught me what I needed to know - filled in the blanks. I would have always thought that one should split two face cards and take the chance that one would get an ACE on one hand and another face or high card on the other. But Mead explains why statistically this is a newbie mistake.<p>Loaded with invaluable insider information, Beginner to Pro taught me what I needed to know without confusing me with loads of useless facts, figures, charts, statistics and rhetoric. The title takes a very straight-forward, no-bull approach and wastes no time getting to the point.<p>Putting Mead's advice into action, my first night was very successful and I was quite pleased with the swelling of my bank account as a direct result</span>
