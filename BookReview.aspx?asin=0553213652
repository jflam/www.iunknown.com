                    <span>I am currently studying the gita in English translation.  I am using six versions and commentaries: Miller, Nikhilananda, Aurobindo, Gandhi, Yogananda, and Gambhirananda (with commentary by Sankara).  As someone without knowledge of Sanskrit, I am constantly going back and forth between more poetic translations like Miller's and more literal ones.  Miller's claim is to render the Gita in a rhythm similar to the original.  While I cannot comment on the original Sanskrit, I can say that Miller's translation is absolutely invaluable for the Gita beginner.  With prose translations I often find it exceedingly easy to get bogged down, turned around and thrown in loops by the gradually developing and often subtle philosophical progression of the poem.  With a verse translation, however, ideas are organized into short bursts and thus make for much easier mental organization.  The overall feel of Miller's translation is also much less awkward than many more literal translations.  I read Miller, then check other translations to confirm that I am understanding the terminology correctly, take a mental note of the content of the stanza and its place within the overall structural/philosophical progression of the work, then read it for the overall rhythm and feeling.</span>

                    <span>The Bhagavad Gita is an aquired taste.  It's philosophy runs counter enough to the Christianity upon which much of Western thought is built to cause a certain amount of dissonance if read carefully.  Or more likely, the Western reader will simply dismiss it as easily as a telemarketer.
<br />
<br />So the question rises, "How does one aquire enough of a taste to wrestle with the ideas presented in the work?"
<br />
<br />In the beginning the Hindu epics were adventure tales that caught public attention better than the Vedas and their Upanishads.  We might say they were the "comic book" versions of the great Hindu holy books.  Many translators make the epics too difficult.  
<br />
<br />This small text takes the Gita back to its "user friendly" beginnings.  The translation may sacrifice some of the nuances of other translations, but it offers the novice an easy glimpse into the soul of Hindu thought.
<br />
<br />This inexpensive, easy to read, book is to be recommended for the casual reader who has little understanding, but a growing curiosity, about Hinduism.  Save the more complicated (and expensive) translations and commentaries for later.

                    <span>This book is more in the spirit of an adaptation rather than a translation. Stoller-Miller seems to add or subtract phrases from the original just for "poetic" effect. She also seems to have made very convoluted and unnecessary translations at many a place. This seems to stem from a desire to contribute something new to the already huge literature on the Gita.<p>That said, she does try to retain the spirit of the original (very unsuccessfully in my opinion but others who know the language could justly differ). If you do wish to have a version which is poetic and can be read without intimidating terms in between, this is a good book. However, do pick up another translation and read it along with this one. Would give you a better idea about what the original says</span>

                    <span>If you are unfamiliar with Indian philosophical terms, I recommend this translation of the Gita. Miller was kind enough to substitute numerous terms so as to simplify the language while retaining the quintessential message the Gita attempts to convey. Her poetic rendition of the Gita into English is well-done and a pleasure to read. Reading another translation which preserves all the original terms and the multitude of names for Krishna and Arjun can be frustrating, especially if you do not know how to pronounce long, intimidating Sanskrit words.<p>In addition, it is also an inexpensive translation, all the more reason to buy it.</span>
