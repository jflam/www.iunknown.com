                    <span>One evening recently my ol'lady and I were at a freinds house and the subject of the club came up. As I was sharing one of my stories growing up in Oakland's Fruitvale area riding around and partying with some of my freindly club members. My buddies wife handed me this fairly large book and said I must read it. I did and just couldn't put it down untill my alarm went off the next morning. This would even make as great movie like Easy Rider.

                    <span>Unlike Yves Levigne, who denegrates the Hells Angels in every book he writes, yet makes a ton of money doing it without having the cajones to live it, George was an OG in the Hells Angels. I remember reading in the papers when he jammed pencils in his eyes in penitance for his turning state's evidence. But, whether you agree with his actions(turning states evidence) or disagree(because you don't rat out your friends), the fact remains George lived it, which only an Angel can do. There are some pro's and con's considering everyone wants to put their best foot forward. But, it is fairly written in that he doesn't try to hide too much about his actions or the club's. A very interesting read for those who would like to know more about the early days of the Hells Angels.</span>

                    <span>I got as far into this as "about the author"...turned states evidence...hiding...All I can say is any sh(*&^%d who would turn states better pray to god some old school,biker-Jolly Rogers/new millinium-techo hackers don't decide to defend the code and do justice. As it is the HA's are in a state of disarray as the old school, 1%er's are dying off, doing time or settling into {oh my god!) grandparenthood and the new millinium-techno-hackers are triffling over who will be the next to step up in ranks. The ol' schooler's want tradition & The code of biker ethics  with responsible {or at least less tracable} activities, and maybe even a little salvation through charitable acts like sponsoring Boys/girls clubs and such. The millinium bud generation want the power, prestige, and respect that their predecessor's "mafia style" reputation, has afforded them. but sadly the old guys paid their dues, and unfortunately, like billy the kid and jesse james, they've become legendary outlaws immortized as bad guy heros. Now the up-starts are finding the they can't pull rank on these generals yet without "prooving their salt". And so begins the revolution. Some want presevation of the old rebel outlaw way, others to save the code, some power, and still others want the "Legendary Lifesyle/image". Any one of which has equal and perfectly logical reasons to kill a rat-fink snitch.... the one star rating i give it, goerge better wish upon for forgiveness.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book and it portrays the "boys" as they really were in the early days! Hey, a guys got to do what a guys got to do to make a living in the world! Of course, there are people out there that don't understand what it's like to be or feel like an outcast and then be accepted by others without question!... and they're most likely the ones who will criticize this book! 
<br />Some of these guys came from poorer areas and some not so poor but still felt unaccepted by mainstream society. A lot were rejected for their participation in the Vietnam War and others for their views of the world. Where else were they to go? Maybe your house in the "burbs" for the weekend?
<br />George Wethern expressed his views of the everyday life in the Club of the 1960's. It appears that some of the acitivities done during this time peroid were done out of the necessity of building and estabilishing the structure of the club including the way opposition was dealt with. It's the same for all businesses who are trying to estabilish themselves. Hey, how many bodies have other big businesses buried in their growing years and haven't been discovered as of yet?</span>

                    <span>This book reveals the secrets and lifestyles of the notorious Hells Angels that for so long have been shrouded in scandal, mystery and fear.  Written by an ex Hells Angel himself, Wethern recounts his lifestyle with the  Angels from the first beginnings of the gangs operation in California, his  friendship with well known gang president Sonny, orgies, criminal activity  and the rapid decline of the gang and Wethern himself as drugs became the  way of life and huge source of power and income.  Wethern, now hidden  somewhere in the states with new identity for him and his family in fear of  his life as a result of co-operating with police and officials and giving  informatiuon and indeed writing this book that blows the lid on the  activities of a gang that is unmerciless in it's punishment of offenders,  it's disregard for police, women and just about anything, but that is  fiercely loyal to the brotherhood of gang members and loyalty to the  president at all costs.  In what would seem an act of clearing his  conscience Wethern tells his tale in a way that exposes the reader to not  only the innner workings of this secret gang, but also the brokenness,  regret and fear that comes from living the life of a wayward angel.</span>
