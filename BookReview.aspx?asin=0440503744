                    <span>There are dozens of popular cleaning books on the market, many of which are touted on TV or tied to a particular cleaning maven's approach... and web site!<P>What I've found in most of those books--and I am a full time bookseller, so I see a lot of them--is a long list of recipes for multitudes of all purpose cleaners, or tricks for particular stains. This is the BEST, most SPECIFIC book I've seen yet for describing how a person should begin cleaning their entire home. It takes one step-by-step through every room.<P>Though some reviewers complain about so many references to the Clean Team web site, the book explicitely describes alternate solutions and products in chapter 13. They use their own product names simply because they are writing an INTRODUCTORY how to book for those who are stumped as to how to clean their own homes! Some (many?) of those people will probably breathe a sigh of relief to have a single source for exactly the right tools for the job.<P>The "recommended instead of" and "recommended in addition to" right now are both for the excellent housekeeping manual, "Home Comforts." I agree wholeheartedly that everyone should own that book, but this one does serve a different purpose. "Home Comforts" is an ideal housewarming or wedding gift, but it is HUGE and covers lots of other territory. "Speed Cleaning" is a quick--dare I say speedy--overview that can get a person working toward a clean, healthy home after an hour's reading.<P>I must also add that I believe the emphasis on scrubbing over soaking is based upon the author's own habit of keeping an environment constantly essentially clean. A person who follows these steps on a frequent schedule and does daily cleaning religiously will find these methods cover every need. The expectation is that one will maintain using every step in the book, and therefore rarely need stronger methods.<P>Buy this book if you want instructions as to how to quickly do a basic weekly cleaning of your home. Look elsewhere for:<BR>* specific homemade cleaning product recipes<BR>* clutter control<BR>* heavy-duty spring cleaning tips</span>

                    <span>I was a clueless housecleaner, absentmindedly pushing a sponge or rag, without much thought as to where to start, which cleaning tools to use, when to use powders vs. liquids, how to economize motion, etc. I knew there had someone who figured all this stuff out, so I picked up Jeff Campbell's "Speed Cleaning" book. Jeff runs a cleaning service and is an efficiency expert, who has cleaning down to an economy-of-motion science. His book is an easy, entertaining read, with well-explained instructions and many helpful diagrams. He makes a good case for his methods, although he does come across with the attitude that his is the only and right way to clean. <P>I decided I would give his system a try, so I bought the cleaning apron, cleaning cloths, small cleaning tools, and Jeff's own brand of non-toxic, cleaning agents (free of animal products and not tested on animals) available on his website. Then I put on my cleaning apron and followed the book nearly to the letter. I'm delighted to report that his system absolutely works! My bathrooms and kitchen especially are cleaner than before, and his system is much faster and easier than what I was doing. It is not necessary to use a cleaning apron or Jeff's cleaning agents to improve one's results, but I do find the apron convenient, and the two cleaning agent bottles that hang from it are the 16 ounce size, so they're not heavy even when full. <P>I have several issues with the book that prevent me from giving it 5 stars: <BR>1) He often tells to reader to only clean what is dirty--not to clean phantom dust nor wipe surfaces where you don't see dirt. However, not all dirt is visible, such as germs and dust (complete with dustmites) that builds up before it's visible to the naked eye. So it's actually a good idea to wipe and where appropriate disinfect surfaces that don't look dirty. Why not be proactive and prevent visible dust?<P>2) Jeff encourages people to dust with an ostrich feather duster, which only moves dust around. He reasons that you move the dust to a lower level & vacuum it later. I disagree that this is the most effective system for removing dust. Also ostrich farming is a very cruel industry where the feathers are removed with pliers or electric shears from the birds *before* they are slaughtered, to protect the commercial value of the hide, which makes expensive leather. <P>3) Twenty pages of the book (10%) is a Spanish summary. Like many non-Spanish-speaking readers, this part of the book is useless to me. Why not publish a Spanish-speaking version of the book or sell the summary separately as a booklet?<P>Overall however, I'm very happy with this book and cleaning system, and have a cleaner home and more time on my hands to show for it. :-)</span>

                    <span>I am not June Cleaver and neither is Jeff Campbell. While working at our Library's Book Sale, I discovered Jeff's cute little book. Hey! For 25 cents, I'll give it a whirl! I am glad I did.<BR> I read the book. I ordered the video and some Stuff from Jeff's thecleanteam website like the Cleaning Bib (comparable to a carpenter's apron only modified for the missions at hand,) various cleaning products and carryall. My house is happier, I'm happier, and I did it all without having to borrow June's pearls.<P>*Speed Cleaning* is a great guide to weekly cleaning. Jeff also has a book about daily clutter control, conveniently called *Clutter Control,* so that one's junque is out of way when one does one's weekly *Speed Cleaning.* He also has a book about the bigger chores done less frequently, say, like, in the Spring. Guess what that book is called?<P>Unless one is June or her clone, this book lives up to its attribution: For those who would rather be doing practically anything other than cleaning! Try it, you still may not love cleaning, but you'll get done a lot quicker and get on with your life. s/ TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer</span>

                    <span>I clean my house every week and am constantly looking for new products, tools and techniques to do a better job easier and faster. Unfortunately, the author's tool and supplies which he recommends are outdated. (E.g. canister vacuum cleaners, the Sh-Mop doesn't work well, a one-pint plastic container to rinse the shower stall, Comet powdered cleanser to clean the tub, cleaning cloths made of cloth which have to be laundered) There are much better products and tools out on the market today. In addition, the techniques he advocates are nothing new. As a result, I suggest you don't buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This had been on my wishlist for a while, I finally broke down and bought it for myself. I am giving it a 4 star rating only because I have yet to read the entire book. But what I have read has helped me housekeep faster, easierand most importantly, better. Some of the 'hints' Jeff gives you are common sense, others arethe type tht make you think, "How did I not know this?" S far I love this ook.</span>
