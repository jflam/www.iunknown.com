      <title>"Our other boy" by John Lam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We're using a Logitech notebook mouse as well. The full-sized mice are just too large right now. We also remapped the right button to the left. Interestingly enough, he uses his thumb to click the mouse. I guess he's training himself for SMS text messaging already!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Our other boy" by Anson Tsao</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find the Microsoft Wireless notebook mouse just about the right size for little hands, and using AutoHotKey to map right to left mouse button really helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Ruby in the real world" by John Lam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been working on the bridge on and off all week. I have constructor overloading, method overloading, and indexer support baked in. Next up is wrapping up properties, fields and events. That should make for a usable release. If I have enough cycles - that should ship towards end of next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Ruby in the real world" by Justin</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the .NET-CLR bridge, any updates available? I imagine you are busy with the new addition to the family so I'm not too hopeful - but I'm still excited about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, could you provide a DLL with the download? I don't have VS2005 and  thus can't compile the DLL for myself ...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Ruby in the real world" by John Lam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't go so far as to claim that web sites are trivial. I personally feel that web applications are among the most complicated applications that developers have to tackle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And besides, why all the buzz about Rails if you could just as easily use CGI and C? Are all of those Java developers smoking crack?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Ruby in the real world" by Sam Gentile</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for responding John. I am not interested in searching Google for Ruby on Rails for just web sites. Thats easy stuff as CGI and C could be used. Web sites are trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am more interested in "real world" apps like the one you mentioned for your customer. Thats what my question was about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
