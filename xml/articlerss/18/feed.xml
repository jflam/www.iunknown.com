      <title>"Synergy!": comment by John Lam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nope &amp;#8211; no problems at all bringing my Powerbook in and out of suspend. I find that with my Toshiba and my Powerbook, if I use them away from my network and bring them back that everything &amp;#8220;just works&amp;#8221; provided that I keep the synergy client software running while away from my network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phooey on you! Ya, I&amp;#8217;m loving Synergy, I use it to talk to my Mac Mini.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Have you had trouble with them losing connection when the Mac falls asleep? This has kept me from running the Mac headless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#8217;ve had no problems whatsoever with Synergy. Perhaps you&amp;#8217;re using an older build? I regularly detach my PowerBook and my Tablet PC from this configuration and when they come back, everything continues to work just fine. I&amp;#8217;ll be on the lookout for problems, though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Synergy!": comment by Dan Dunham</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of Synergy, and when it worked it was great (I have a dual-monitor main machine, one secondary machine, and a laptop using it at work).  However, roughly once a day I have to kill all of them when it gets completely hosed and messes up the state of Shift, Alt, or Windows-key on one of the workstations (typing quickly becomes un-fun). It&amp;#8217;s paticularly bad about handling when some of the desktops go into locked mode, or losing the mouse cursor completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Synergy!" by jlam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While looking for other people who have actually used &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOAP&lt;/span&gt; to access the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"&gt;Flickr &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered &lt;a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/index.html"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;My life&amp;#8217;s dream is complete: I have actually discovered a useful utility before &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt;!  Marvel at how I can use the same keyboard and mouse on the &lt;strong&gt;same virtual desktop&lt;/strong&gt; across three computers, one of which is my Powerbook!&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;All I have to do is roll the mouse to the desired screen, and the keyboard &amp;#8220;focus&amp;#8221; follows my mouse. Absolutely fantastic utility.&lt;/p&gt;
