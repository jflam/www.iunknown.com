      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you looked at what they have at kx.com?  (Caveat:  I haven&amp;#8217;t used it, but they seem to have been working on the &amp;#8220;updateable in-memory database&amp;#8221; for quite a while, with clients that had both hard requirements and success.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Udi, bingo! Use the right tool for the job. The real point of this blog was to demonstrate a case where a &amp;#8220;slow&amp;#8221; language like Ruby can really help you think better. And when you think better, you can choose better algorithms &amp;#8211; hence you can get the benefits of a much smaller code base &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; much higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Do Databases Rot the Mind?": comment by Udi Dahan - The Software Simplist</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I agree that databases are too quickly pulled out, I think that your example of &amp;#8220;read-only&amp;#8221; access isn&amp;#8217;t representative of many apps. However, I agree that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t necessarily continue solving todays problems with yesterdays solutions, especially without re-examining those solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; IMDB  didn&amp;#8217;t work because of 2 issues: a)  SQL  Server was faster and b) it did not support cache coherency.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Believe me, we tuned the hell out of that schema and query set. Even Bob Beauchemin and Dan Sullivan gave me some sage advice. But that wasn&amp;#8217;t anywhere near enough.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;And I assert that my deploying a Ruby script is a lot easier than your deploying a sproc :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember from a few years ago, that a upcoming  COM + release had a new feature called &lt;del&gt;&amp;gt; In Memory Database &lt;/del&gt;&amp;gt;  IMDB . 
It was in the beta but never made it into the final release.

	&lt;p&gt;The link above does give some insight as to why it did not make it in, but really in the end I think it was: Why duplicate the functionality of Sql Server? Unfortunately in many applications, bad database design is present (also possibly bad T-SQL, if using Sql server), and it is difficult or impossible to create a more normalized or efficient relational structure to replace the old one. While pulling the data into some custom code can do the trick, I have found that the following often increases the performance of Sql Queries:
a) Use of temp tables to act as driver tables with less rows, and to cut down your large query into a series of queries with less than five tables in the joins 
b) Using narrower primary keys 
c) Changing isolation levels 
d) etc.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I am sure that all the above was tried, but also from a deployment standpoint, it is much easiar to deploy a stored procedure, than a piece of code. I am not a big advocate of placing business logic in Sql , but to just do the  CRUD  operations in a fast and efficient manner, my choice is always T-SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>"Do Databases Rot the Mind?" by jlam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do databases rot the mind? Charles Petzold&amp;#8217;s recent &lt;a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html"&gt;post about Visual
Studio&lt;/a&gt;
triggered this thought in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;All too often when confronted with a &amp;#8220;business&amp;#8221; problem I, like many
other people I know, wind up reaching for my trusty database. Or, in a
more common scenario, someone hands you an existing schema and says
&amp;#8220;solve my problem&amp;#8221; using it. The reality, however, is that
relational databases are a lousy solution to many problems that we
commonly run across. In a recent e-commerce platform that I created
there was a 7-way join that had to be executed just to retrieve a list
of products to display to a customer. We did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOTS&lt;/span&gt; of performance
tuning of that database and our queries to make it go about as fast as
it could reasonably be expected to go under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL &lt;/span&gt;Server.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Just this week, I decided to do an experiment. I reimplemented the
core of our e-commerce platform by loading the entire database into a
custom in-memory data structure. It took me about 1 hour to write the
code to load the core tables into my custom data structure, and about
an additional 15 hours to tune the data structure and refactor the
code to my liking. Oh yeah, I wrote it using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;My app was 201 lines of Ruby code (including liberal use of blank
lines to enhance readability). For sake of comparison, just one of the
dynamically generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; queries that it replaced was in the order of
150+ lines of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. And that, of course, doesn&amp;#8217;t count all of the lines
of C# code required to generate, execute, and parse the results of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; query.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;One more thing: it also ran &lt;strong&gt;100x&lt;/strong&gt; faster.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;A bit of history: the original application that I inherited was on
the order of 20,000 lines of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL &lt;/span&gt;+ C#. This was largely due to an
enormous amount of duplication of code due to the (ab)use of stored
procedures to handle queries. My rewrite of that application trimmed
it down to 4000 lines of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL &lt;/span&gt;+ C#. My Ruby application, while not at
feature parity with the existing application, solved essentially all
of the &amp;#8220;hard&amp;#8221; problems. I would estimate that it duplicates &gt;80%
of the functionality of the real application.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The first version of the code was about 5x faster than the original
application. I then spent some time looking for optimizations. When
you only have about 100 lines of code to look through, optimizations
become pretty obvious. I was able to cache the results of a
(relatively) expensive O(M+N) algorithm that sat on the
rate-determining-step of the computation. This netted me a 20x
speedup. This optimization is simply not possible using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL &lt;/span&gt;Server,
but is dead-simple when you get to implement your own query engine.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the symmetry of my results: 1/100th the code and 100x the performance. It&amp;#8217;s also much easier to maintain 200 lines of code than 20,000 lines of code. Testing was also much more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Now the code that I rewrote was tailor-made for this kind of
rewrite. It was a read-only database that was relatively (&lt; 1GB) small in
size. If you have such an application lying around &amp;#8211; try rewriting it
using in-memory data structures. If you&amp;#8217;re a bit more adventurous, try
using a dynamically typed language to do this (might I suggest
Ruby?). You just might be surprised by the outcome and come away with
a new technique in your toolbox by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
