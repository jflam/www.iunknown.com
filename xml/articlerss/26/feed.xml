      <title>"Ruby and WinFX in Kitchener": comment by John Lam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep &amp;#8211; that was my  D70 , but at  ISO 1000 + (can&amp;#8217;t remember and I don&amp;#8217;t have the original image handy here).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crazy, those lights on the walls almost look rendered.  Still using the  DSLR ?   D70  was it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	&lt;p&gt;It was a fun time at the &lt;a href="http://www.cttdnug.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=104"&gt;CTTDNUG&lt;/a&gt; user group meeting in Kitchener on Wednesday. I&amp;#8217;d like to thank &lt;a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dtotzke/"&gt;Dave Totzke&lt;/a&gt; for inviting me out to speak, and everyone attending for taking some time out of their evening to learn a bit more about an obscure little language called Ruby (and a not-so-obscure set of frameworks called WinFX).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ve inspired some of you to think a little differently about programming languages and how they can influence the way you think about solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;
