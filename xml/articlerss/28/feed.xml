      <title>"Beyond Java" by jlam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596100949/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0596100949.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Bruce Tate&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596100949/ref=nosim/iunknowncom-20"&gt;Beyond Java&lt;/a&gt; today. Yes, this book does read a lot like a &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/11/10/16416.aspx"&gt;Ruby brochure&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you&amp;#8217;re coming from a statically typed background, you will definitely learn a lot about what makes dynamically typed languages powerful.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Bruce spends quite a lot of time trying to capture &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; dynamically typed languages are more productive than statically typed languages. It&amp;#8217;s very difficult to explain this to other developers, and I feel this is the real value of his book. He gives reasonable explanations (everything is an object model simplfies APIs, and rapid feedback loops improve productivity), and includes lots of anecdotal evidence written by prominent members of the Java community.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s well worth your time and dollar investment to read this book. Yes, it is light on technical details, but that&amp;#8217;s also a feature; you can give it to your manager to read :)&lt;/p&gt;
