      <title>"Best Talk Of All Time" by jlam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year at &lt;a href="http://www.oopsla.org"&gt;OOPSLA&lt;/a&gt;, a group took a look at the last 20 years of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOPSLA&lt;/span&gt;. When a man asked the group &amp;#8220;what was the best talk of all time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOPSLA&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;#8221;, they &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; said Guy Steele&amp;#8217;s talk from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOPSLA 1998&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;They showed a film of his talk in the hall of books. I thought that I had seen great talks in my life, but I can&amp;#8217;t think of one that tops this. If you can, watch the film (I think you will need to buy it from the &lt;a href="http://www.acm.org"&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;). You may &lt;a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/steele-oopsla98.pdf"&gt;read the talk on the web&lt;/a&gt;, but if you do read it &lt;strong&gt;out loud&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes &amp;#8211; this may seem like a strange thing to do, but you may miss the best part of this talk if you do not.&lt;/p&gt;
