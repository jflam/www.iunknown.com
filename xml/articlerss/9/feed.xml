      <title>"My Ruby Dev Environment" by jlam</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.biasecurities.com/blogs/jim/"&gt;Jim Geurts&lt;/a&gt; emailed me to ask about my dev environment for Ruby. So I
created this blog entry to talk about what my setup is.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I use both a Mac and a PC to do Ruby development. When I&amp;#8217;m doing Rails
development, I often use my PowerBook. I spent a bunch of time preparing for
a cross-platform lifestyle by learning the emacs keybindings this
summer. So far it&amp;#8217;s paid off since I&amp;#8217;m quite comfortable in that
editor in both environments. I even hacked emacs to re-enable
ClearType support so that Consolas looks the way it was intended to
look.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;That said, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of buzz around &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; as a dev
environment for Rails. It&amp;#8217;s certainly all the rage with the rails-core
members. I&amp;#8217;m going to consider spending some time in the near future
working with it as I rebuild our corporate web site using Rails.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I&amp;#8217;m building my Ruby &lt;-&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt; bridge using
Windows. I&amp;#8217;m still running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS 2005 &lt;/span&gt;Beta 2 since a lot of my
applications have a dependency on WinFX which doesn&amp;#8217;t yet work with
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTM&lt;/span&gt; version of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS 2005&lt;/span&gt;. As soon as there&amp;#8217;s a solid WinFX build
that lives on top of the Whidbey &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTM&lt;/span&gt; bits I&amp;#8217;m going to switch.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a Windows dev and want to get Ruby and Rails up and running
as quickly as possible, I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/"&gt;Curt Hibbs&lt;/a&gt; most excellent
&lt;a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/instantrails/"&gt;Instant Rails&lt;/a&gt; package. This package includes a preconfigured Apache,
Ruby, Rails, and MySQL configuration that lives in a single directory
tree.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t care about Rails and only want to do Ruby work, then get
Curt&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl"&gt;One Click Ruby Installer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need some documentation as well &amp;#8211; Curt bundles a .CHM file of
the first edition of the excellent Programming Ruby book (aka &amp;#8220;The
PickAxe&amp;#8221;) by Dave Thomas. I find that this is all that I need for my
day-to-day work in Ruby, even though I own a dead-trees version of the
2nd Edition of the PickAxe book. I would recommend getting the &lt;a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html"&gt;PDF
version&lt;/a&gt; of the book if you live a mobile laptop lifestyle like I do.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore Rails, then I would highly recommend Dave
Thomas and David Hansson&amp;#8217;s excellent &lt;a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html"&gt;Agile Web Development With
Rails&lt;/a&gt; book. I purchased the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; version so that I don&amp;#8217;t have to lug
the book around with me.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;If Apple lives up to its commitment to not prevent Windows from
running on their next-generation Powerbooks, I&amp;#8217;m going to switch to
Apple hardware full-time for both Windows and Ruby development. It
should be awesome to have a dual-core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; laptop than can dual boot
both Vista and Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS X&lt;/span&gt; by middle of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
