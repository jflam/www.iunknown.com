    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow. It&amp;#8217;s over. Finally. And now I can reflect back on my first week as a member of the collective. Here&amp;#8217;s some photos of the campus back when there was snow:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Mt. Rainier towering over Building 42:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the mountains behind 156 Ave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implant didn&amp;#8217;t hurt all that much.&amp;nbsp;My first couple of days at Microsoft involved signing up for various things like benefits, payroll, and parking. It also involved going through New Employe Orientation, where you get to find out some more things about the history, size, and &amp;#8216;diversity&amp;#8217; at the company, as well as things that you can and cannot (well more about the cannot part) do as a Microsoft employee &amp;#8211; essentially your responsibilities as a corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a photo of Building 122:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/16/new-employee-orientation"&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt; was in my orientation class, and he had a great observation about just how confusing the benefits presentation was, and how it can be improved using social networking technology. The idea is to hook up people with similar life circumstances with each other so that they can discuss these things. For example&amp;nbsp;a benefit&amp;nbsp;like the flexible spending account is important to me since Matthew&amp;#8217;s in preschool, but that same benefit would be unimportant to the new college hires that were in my orientation class because of their differing life situation.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I believe that some of this stuff can be answered using some of the internal mailing lists at Microsoft. As a new hire, I&amp;#8217;m wary about drowning in email, so I&amp;#8217;ve avoided (so far) signing up for those distribution lists. Instead, I&amp;#8217;m relying on the &amp;#8216;hallway advisors&amp;#8217; to help me out. There are a remarkable number of folks that I have met / know that have been out on paternity leave over the past year or so, so there&amp;#8217;s no shortage of people in similar &amp;#8216;family situations&amp;#8217; to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I managed to accidentally score a window office as my team is in the middle of an office move. I&amp;#8217;ll enjoy it while it lasts &amp;#8211; I suspect my new office will be next to the boiler room in the basement :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One example of the sheer size of Microsoft involved getting my alias setup. The seven letters of my name (John Lam) are not unique enough to generate me an alias that would not be ambiguous or just outright silly (and I didn&amp;#8217;t get an ambiguous alias). Thanks to some lobbying on the part of my manager&amp;#8217;s manager, we fought the IT policy &amp;#8230; and won!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I attended my first few team meetings as well, experienced the joys of observing a re-org that I wasn&amp;#8217;t a part of (or frankly could really understand), as well as getting the experience of being the dumbest guy in the room. There&amp;#8217;s an enormous amount of information overload as you walk into a world that, while somewhat familiar from the outside, is very different since everyone here is focused on what the outside world would call a &amp;#8216;future release&amp;#8217;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also spending time figuring out what it means to be a &amp;#8216;Program Manager&amp;#8217;. I suspect that will take the longest amount of time to figure out. But as far as I can tell, it involves an awful lot of meetings :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jeff - as a PM my primary responsibility will not be writing code that ships in my product. That doesn't mean that I won't be writing code though ... (does that make sense?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new alias as MSFT will be &lt;em&gt;jflam&lt;/em&gt;. However, due to some kind of config problem that alias is bouncing external mail right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm ramping up to hack on RubyCLR this week. More on this stuff later.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    &lt;p&gt;The seven letters of my name (John Lam) are not unique enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they've served you all of your adult life. Strange 'eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did they want you to do, add a three letter suffix? :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
