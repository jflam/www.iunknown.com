The hallway and lunch conversations are excellent &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s great to be around so many smart folks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just the other day I went to the equivalent of a departmental colloquium. One of the devs on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt; team gave an excellent description of how the debugging interfaces of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt; work. In all of my time outside of the company, I&amp;#8217;d never heard such a concise description of managed debugging, nor did I truly appreciate the challenges involved in implementing first class debugging support on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also &lt;strong&gt;vast&lt;/strong&gt; intranet. You can spend months just reading interesting papers. Now that I&amp;#8217;ve got &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAS&lt;/span&gt; access to corpnet, I&amp;#8217;m spending some time each evening just reading. The opportunities for personal growth here are remarkable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I definitely underestimated the logistical challenges involved in moving to Redmond, I&amp;#8217;m not regretting it one bit.&amp;nbsp;Slowly but surely things&amp;nbsp;are coming together &amp;#8211; our house closed in Toronto today, and we&amp;#8217;re putting together an offer for our new house in Redmond tomorrow.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mike Stall was the dev who gave the talk - there's a lot of good stuff on his blog: &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core debugging interfaces are also now doc'd: &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/ms230588.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/ms230588.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm in 42. There's a big difference in pay between Microsoft and grad school, but you know, once you factor in the house and family I might have had more disposable income in grad school! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RE Lang.Net 2007, there should be - look for an announcement here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Congrats - sounds like you're having lots o' fun in Building...well, what building ARE you in? 42? 122?. I remember the days of grad school - getting paid to study was a blast, even if the pay wasn't that much :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW any idea if there's going to be a Lang.NET 2007?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
