    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last week or so of silence was due to a nasty virus that swept across the Lam household, and we&amp;#8217;re finally pulling out of it now. I didn&amp;#8217;t really get it, but everyone else did, which meant that I had take care of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I managed to get away yesterday to give my keynote on &lt;a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/toronto/keynotes.aspx"&gt;The Future of Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt; at VS Live! in Toronto. It was a fun time, and my first Lessig/Takahashi-style talk. Hopefully the attendees had as much fun as I had delivering it. It was also my first experience giving a talk with &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/"&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt;, and I was very happy with both the authoring and the presentation experience.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href="http://www.iunknown.com/images/vslive_keynote.pdf"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; of the slides from my talk&lt;/a&gt;. As a Lessig/Takahashi-style talk, it&amp;#8217;s not all that useful if you didn&amp;#8217;t see the talk, but it&amp;#8217;s worth a look if you&amp;#8217;re interested in seeing one approach for motivating Ruby to a statically typed language audience.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sajee - I didn't record it while I was giving the talk at the conference (I don't think the conference organizers did either). I'll try and figure out a way to record the talk the next time I give it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
