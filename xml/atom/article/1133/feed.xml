    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There will be lots of exciting things happening at &lt;a href="http://www.rubyconf.org"&gt;RubyConf&lt;/a&gt; this week. A few folks who are working on alternate Ruby implementations (JRuby, Ruby.NET, Sydney) will be at the conference, so we&amp;#8217;ll have a chance to get together to swap some notes.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still figuring out the story that I&amp;#8217;ll be telling in my &lt;a href="http://rubyconf.org/agenda_detail.html#you"&gt;You got your Ruby in my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/a&gt; talk. Right now the story focuses on how to get things done, both from my perspective as the implementor of RubyCLR, as well as from the perspective of developers who are using RubyCLR. I think that&amp;#8217;s a good spine for the story &amp;#8211; it lets me hang a lot of interesting ideas off of it.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re wondering why all of the radio silence, I&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; busy at a new consulting gig here in Toronto, which involves a long 2 hour commute. That barely leaves me enough time to answer email these days when I get back from the office. Hopefully things will ease up soon so that I can start putting some cycles back into RubyCLR.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll be there - looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in love with Ruby (&amp;amp; Rails) but do strictly C# at work. Any way to bring those together will be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
