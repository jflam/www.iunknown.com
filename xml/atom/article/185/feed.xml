    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just tried out &lt;a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom"&gt;WriteRoom&lt;/a&gt;, which is a full-screen text editor. There was something incredibly therapeutic about  the experience. There were no distractions at all, and I could make-believe that this was the only application that my computer could run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised that ESC didn't get me out of fullscreen.  But then I moved my mouse to the top and got the expected menu bar with the option and shortcut keys to get back out of fullscreen mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;God forbid you install it and immediate click the + icon. There's no obvious way to get out of the full-screenness. Luckily , I know about Apple-Q.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
