    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;January 10 was my first day in Redmond. We (my dog Kobe and I) left home at around 3:30am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EST&lt;/span&gt; and arrived tired but happy at Sea-Tac airport at 1:30pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PST&lt;/span&gt;. The poor dog was locked inside of his kennel the entire time, but he bounced back fast &amp;#8211; he&amp;#8217;s a Black Lab, and he&amp;#8217;s a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; resiliant and good dog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once we got to our temporary housing in Sammamish, we promptly got snowed in! This was not what we expected our first night in the Seattle area to be :) We had no food except for the little welcome package that our corporate housing company left for us. Fortunately for us, Dominos was delivering in the snow that night, so Kobe got a lot of human food that night!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next morning, this is the scene that greeted us outside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this area that we&amp;#8217;re living in (the Timberline region of Sammamish). However, as I discovered later this week, just getting down the hill from here (less than a mile) takes on average 15 minutes in traffic!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total time into Microsoft averages 40 minutes in the morning. We&amp;#8217;ll have to look for another area to live, as picturesque as this area is.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, John, nice house you have, even if it's temprary. You have a great location, far from civilization. So, you have a pure air for you and your children. The trees are helping you in this medical ambience too. Nice location, try to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The problem, Bill, is that the view is a moot point if you're not around to enjoy it. Commute time is pure overhead - nothing really valuable comes from spending time behind the wheel. What's crazy about the traffic around here are the distances - I live, what 6 miles or so from campus? But it takes me 40 minutes to get there? If it weren't for the hills (and my being in crappy shape) I'd get there faster by &lt;em&gt;running&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old friend of mine said that 'there are problems that money can solve'. If those are the only problems that you have then you're doing pretty well. In the case of housing around here, the stuff close to campus can be really pretty as well - every bit as nice as the stuff you see where I live - it just costs more money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; different from Toronto where the 'living in the woods' feel is restricted to the few houses that back onto ravines. There's just not that much greenspace in Toronto so that tends to constrain both commute times and prices much more so than around here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John, is it really that temporary? I mean in T.O. your commute was what, an hour on the Don Vally Parking lot? 40 minutes is nothing as it's a light drive (or at least I would think so). When I moved to Calgary from Toronto, I thought an hour would be horrible (my T.O. commute was 1.5 hours). However light traffic (with a few heavy spots) is nothing compared to the steady slowdown from Ontario. I'm sure the Redmond trip would be the same and the view you have now looks awesome. Personally I wouldn't give that up for being closer to campus as Life 1.0 is much more important than C# 4.0&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our temporary housing was in Sammamish too. I can't say I regret the commute... Now I can walk from campus to my house in 30 minutes, bike in 15 and drive in 5. This is about an hour of your life every day that you get back, which is worth a lot. And the neighborhood is far from ugly...
Well, welcome in the area!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
