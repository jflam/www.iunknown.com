    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things that you get from putting up with the giant hassle of moving is an opportunity to simplify your life. I just finished packing up all of my &amp;#8216;non-essential&amp;#8217; computer gear. It&amp;#8217;s remarkable how cathartic the experience was. I have a single computer running in the house right now (my MacBook Pro).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had a couple of servers running downstairs with a ridiculously complex networking setup involving multiple wireless access points, switches and firewalls. I&amp;#8217;m down to a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WRT&lt;/span&gt;-54G access point running my wireless network, and I&amp;#8217;m typing this thing on my Mac. I brought my Samsung ML-2150 laser printer up from the basement where it has lived for the past 2.5 years and will plug it into my Mac whenever I need to print (lots of last minute scanning / printing / emailing to do before we go). When I get to Seattle, I doubt that I&amp;#8217;ll miss those servers one bit, as they&amp;#8217;re going into storage while we figure out where we&amp;#8217;re going to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll be moving into furnished&amp;nbsp;temporary housing when we get to Seattle. All of the rest of our stuff will go into storage, only to re-emerge when we figure out where we&amp;#8217;re going to live. So we&amp;#8217;ll live for several months with nothing more than what we bring with us on the plane, and a couple of boxes of stuff that we&amp;#8217;re going to ship to ourselves via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a great opportunity to see how little of our stuff we really need to live &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; the technology stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;"So we’ll live for several months with nothing more than what we bring with us on the plane, and a couple of boxes of stuff that we’re going to ship to ourselves via UPS. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I thought that too when I first moved here. Then you discover that Fry's Electronics is about a 20 minute drive from Seattle. Not to mention the Macy's/Nordstroms/Rainer Square shopping extravaganza downtown. And that's not even counting the amazing discount at the MS Store you are entitled to. You'll be amazed at how much you accumulate in a few months. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
