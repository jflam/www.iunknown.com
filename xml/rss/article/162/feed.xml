      <title>Repaving my MacBook Pro</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I somehow managed to pooch my install of Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS X&lt;/span&gt; on my MacBook Pro today. I was seeing unusually high kernel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; usage (&amp;gt; 50% on both cores) so I started uninstalling various things. At some point during this process Mac OS refused to boot.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;No problem, I booted into Safe Boot mode copied my Parallels image to an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive, popped in my recovery DVDs and reinstalled the OS in about an hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;But the coolest thing is that it saved all of my application settings, and my apps came across as well &amp;#8211; Virtue, QuickSilver, Adium, you name it &amp;#8211; it just worked.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m waiting for the OS to patch itself via Software Update and I&amp;#8217;m going to copy my Parallels image back and I&amp;#8217;m back in business.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Repaving Windows was never this easy (believe me I have lots of experience here :).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything is working perfectly now. And boy does it run a lot cooler now that the CPUs aren&amp;#8217;t burning cycles in kernel mode anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
