      <title>Building bridges</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been building a bridge from Ruby to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt; in my spare
time. It&amp;#8217;s a complicated piece of software, and I plan on explaining
how I created it in a series of posts on this blog. At the time of
this writing, I can consume &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLR&lt;/span&gt; objects from Ruby scripts &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
implement event handlers in Ruby scripts. The Ruby language can make
it possible for people to create applications that would be more
difficult and take more time using C# or VB.NET. The Ruby language has
certainly changed the way I think while writing code; I hope to bring
that power to people writing .NET code today. Here&amp;#8217;s a teaser:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
require   'RubyShim'
reference 'System.Windows.Forms'

include System::Drawing
include System::Windows::Forms

f               = Form.new
f.Text          = 'My Form'
f.AllowDrop     = true 
f.SuspendLayout

label1          = Label.new
label1.Location = Point.new(40, 32)
label1.Width    = 200
label1.Text     = 'My Label'

button1          = Button.new
button1.Name     = "MyButton" 
button1.Location = Point.new(40, 57)
button1.Text     = 'Click me'

button1.Click do |sender, args|
  p = sender.Location
  label1.Text = "clicked on #{sender.Name} at #{p.X}, #{p.Y}" 
end

f.Controls.Add(label1)
f.Controls.Add(button1)
f.ResumeLayout

Application.Run(f)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This will be an open-source project, and will be redistributed under
an &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;-style license&lt;/a&gt;. I have not yet released the source code since it is largely proof-of-concept code at this time. If anyone
really wants to take a look at it right now, just send me &lt;a href="jlam@iunknown.com"&gt;an
email&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#8217;l be more than happy to share.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I believe that I have solved most of the hard problems. I have Windows
Forms and Avalon applications written in Ruby and running on my
computer today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
