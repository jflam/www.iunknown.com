      <title>Where would you like to work?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway wrote some of his books on the second floor of a carriage house on his wife&amp;#8217;s estate in Key West. Here&amp;#8217;s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=91940624&amp;#38;size=m"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/91940624_6c3fb85abd.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Kathy Sierra does her writing from an amazingly cool &lt;a href="http://www.airstream.com/product_line/travel_trailers/intccd_home.html"&gt;Airstream trailer&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s parked next to her house:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/10/more_cool_works.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/int_01_1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The thing that makes both of these spaces so attractive for a home office is the physical separation from the house. The small amount of friction that&amp;#8217;s involved in walking out of your house to go into another &amp;#8216;dwelling&amp;#8217; greatly reduces the amount of interruptions in your day (I work in a public library when not at a client site).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The Airstream has the additional feature of being &lt;em&gt;portable&lt;/em&gt;. Hmmm &amp;#8230; I wonder if I can swing one of these in the next household budget :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's true, John, that I've always been primarily an 'outside' rather than 'inside' person in business. I still found that when I did (not infrequent) stretches of up to 72 hours in one spot in order to maintain intense concentration, the back out to everywhere invigorated and inspired my senses in a way that was highly conducive to creativity for me. That may be specific to a business m.o. that concetrates as much on relationships as on independent thinking and planning, when the activities include things such as negotiation and networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is also my development background, or simply my endless curiosity and thirsty aesthetic, that keeps all my sensory channels wide open. Regardless of where I go, I find things of interest in any and every physical place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've a few artist friends whose personal work spaces touch my soul for their intensely peaceful and almost sacred ambience. It seems as much about them and the space as a particular design or style. Your photo  looks as though Hemingway's space might have that feel, amazingly captured on film. A place where the muses are actively invited. Intensely creative work does require much solitude. Even an artist, though, can be nourished by changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a very personal thing, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, but Vera you were a commercial real estate star - quite unlike a developer or writer who needs to spend long stretches of time by themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the everywhere thing for quite a while - working out of coffee shops etc., but I found that the overhead of getting into and out of those places was a bit too high for sustained concentration. The public library is OK, but I'd rather have an even shorter commute than that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kathy's new trailer office looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate response to the title of this post was, "Everywhere!".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it, that is to some extent what I did for most of my business life. I always had a normal office, a specific home office (max 10 min drive), spent 15-20% of my time in each one, and the rest of my time in restaurants ranging from five star luxury to donut shops, other people's boardrooms of course, hotel suites in foreign cities, outdoor cafes... meetings outside cottages or on beaches...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend everywhere. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vera&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled over Kathy Sierra's Home Office place and was amazed: what a great idea.
I know that I can't afford one right now, but that's how my home office should look like ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I couldn't agree more with you saying that the distance is the most important thing for a home office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
