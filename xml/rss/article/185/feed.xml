      <title>I want to go full screen</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just tried out &lt;a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom"&gt;WriteRoom&lt;/a&gt;, which is a full-screen text editor. There was something incredibly therapeutic about  the experience. There were no distractions at all, and I could make-believe that this was the only application that my computer could run.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/files/website_images/writeroom/main-screen.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Now if only I could go full-screen with emacs and do away with the status bar&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised that ESC didn't get me out of fullscreen.  But then I moved my mouse to the top and got the expected menu bar with the option and shortcut keys to get back out of fullscreen mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;God forbid you install it and immediate click the + icon. There's no obvious way to get out of the full-screenness. Luckily , I know about Apple-Q.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
