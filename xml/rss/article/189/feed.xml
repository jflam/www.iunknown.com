      <title>Upgrading my MacBook Pro HDD was fun</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I upgraded my MacBook Pro &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt; to a 100GB 7200rpm disk tonight. Before tonight I was using the 80GB 5400rpm disk that shipped with my computer. I was amazed by how straightforward the experience was.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I began by using Disk Utility to create a copy of my system partition onto an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB 2&lt;/span&gt;.0 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;. This took a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time &amp;#8211; I let it run overnight. Are there better (faster) applications for creating an image of my system partition?&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I then used the most excellent &lt;a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/85.1.0.html"&gt;MacBook Pro Disassembly Guide&lt;/a&gt; to pull apart my MacBook Pro to physically replace the disk. One thing you shouldn&amp;#8217;t do, however, is disconnect the keyboard and trackpad. I just propped the keyboard against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; while replacing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I started my Mac and booted the OS from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; drive. I created a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HFS&lt;/span&gt;+ partition on my new disk and installed Mac OS onto it. When I was finished, I plugged in my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive, and used the Migration Assistant to copy over my old user settings and files. This took about 1.5 hours and I had a machine that was every bit the same as my original!&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The only app that I had to reinstall was Parallels.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; experience. And the machine definitely feels much snappier as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would ask, why is it &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hard to physically access the only component you are likely to replace on a laptop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last one I replaced (several years ago - windows laptop) had a tray for the drive. One screw released the tray. The new drive plugged into the tray, similar to an external HD enclosure. The whole thing (except backup/restore) took a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've used ditto, the unix utility, for my 160GB HDD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time trusting any GUI for massive data transfers. I guess it's from past experiences with Windows 95 utilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the recommendation, Niels! Looks like it will pay for itself right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the removing and reinstalling 20+ screws on my case, I envy your HDD upgrade experience :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey John,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my MacBook I'm using SuperDuper! (&lt;a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niels&lt;/p&gt;</description>
