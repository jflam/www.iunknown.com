                    <span>I found this book to be very good. Its reading level is 9th grade or so but that didnt stop this 41 year old from enjoying it. The book talks about 9 great moments in baseball and shares a few interesting perspectives on the game. Every fan should know of these charming and touching moments. If you love the game check it out.</span>

                    <span>Matt Christopher's "Great Moments in Baseball History" is an interesting collection of nine stories stretching from Bill Wambsganss unassisted triple-play in the 1920 World Series to Jim Abbott's no-hitter in 1993.  In between young readers will learn of the day Babe Ruth hit his final three homeruns, Joe Nuxhall making his major league debut four days after D-Day at the age of 15, the catch Willie Mays made off of Vic Wertz in the 1954 World Series, Ted Williams hitting a home run in his final at bat, Reggie Jackson's three home runs on three swings in the 1977 World Series, Dave Drevecky coming back from bone cancer to pitch again in the majors, and Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit home run in the 1988 World Series.  <p> <p>This is a rather diverse collection of great moments, four of them coming in the Fall Classic and three representing the final great moment of a player's career (as Dravecky's ironically turned out to be; there is an additional irony given the epilogue to Dravecky's story and the fact the final story here is about Jim Abbott).  Certainly young readers will want to identify with being a big league picture while still basically a kid when they read about Joe Nuxhall.  If there is any sort of theme to these nine stories it would be that, as a general rule, then tend towards the inspirational, with several of the players overcoming physical limitations such as being old (Ruth and Williams), having bad legs (Gibson), having a bad arm (Dravecky), or having only one hand (Abbott).  <p> <p>These are certainly baseball stories that young fans should know about, because they are part of the game's lore, which is one of baseball's greatest aspects.  If young fans have never heard of Bill Wambsganss or Joe Nuxhall, or do not remember Dave Dravecky or Kirk Gibson, then this book will fill in the gaps in their baseball education.  For me the best stories in the book are those that focus on a specific play, such as when Christopher explains everything Wambsganss was thinking before he made his unassisted triple play, everything pretty much everybody in the Polo Grounds was doing when Mays started running after that ball, or the details of Gibson's one time at bat in the 1988 World Series.  After all, we know the bare facts of what each player accomplished, but it is the details that make the story come alive.   <p> <p>Finally, I want to note something interesting about the front cover of this book, which has Glenn Harrington's illustrations of the nine baseball players whose stories are related in this book.  Both Reggie Jackson and Jim Abbott are depicted as California Angels although both of their great moments are from when they were playing for the New York Yankees.  Meanwhile, Babe Ruth is shown as a Yankee although he hit his last three home runs for the Boston Braves.  I am also pretty sure that Dave Dravecky is shown with an "SD" on his hat for San Diego instead of "SF" for the team he was playing with at the end of his career, the San Francisco Giants, but I could be wrong.  I certainly have been before.</span>

                    <span>My boys (9 and 14) have read many of Matt Christopher's books.  All are good, some are great treats.  I gave a copy of "The Kid Who Only Hit Homers" to each boy on my baseball team last year.  They loved it!   This year I am giving each player a copy of Christopher's "Great  Moments."  I read this collection of great moments (an unassisted  triple play in the World Series for example) to my boys and enjoyed every  page.  We re-read some of the stories they were so much fun.  This is a  must read for all young/new baseball fans.</span>
