                    <span>Say your Aunt Linda and Uncle Mike are traditionalists, sentimentalists.  They first met at a romantic seside, cliff-overlook restaurant and vowed to dine there on every one-month anniversary for the rest of their lives.  They do so the first two months, then mysteriously stop. You're surprised--but you KNOW that on their first one-YEAR anniversary, now that they're married, they will go back.  It arrives. Nothing happens.  Again, you're surprised. You chalk it off.  Then, the following month they start fulfilling their monthly vow, and do so, regularly, thereafter.  At this point you say, nothing surprises me anymore.  That's broken cadence.  That's life.  (This is a pattern--life-like "broken cadence"--that I tried to adhere closely to in my own novel, Six Hours Past Thursday.)   ##### It's this hugely challenging problem that is the ONLY major missing puzzle-piece to Beginnings, Middles, and Ends.  Otherwise, this book is a stunningly sound blueprint for logical story development.  ##### But, until you can figure a way to successfully overlay an Aunt Linda / Uncle Mike-type time-sequence, "fit" onto the principles this book sets forth, I think you are always going to have a plot-development, pacing problem.       </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is intended for writers who struggle with story structure. It is much more systematic and objective than Stephen King's `On Writing' in the sense that Nancy Kress gives a lot of practical advice. The book is divided into three major parts, each devoted to one of the story parts in the title. Kress highlights common problems and suggests solutions, providing exercises at the end of each chapter. These are aimed at developing more conscious thought over the manner in which established writers conduct their `beginnings, middles & ends'.  I think that writers like Stephen King would repudiate this as being too artificial. 
<br />
<br />I found it particularly helpful when Kress wrote about the `implicit promise' delivered by the author at the beginning of each story. Delivering an implicit promise at the beginning and fulfilling it at the end is a great formula for writing a successful story. However, it must be noted that this is a formula that works for the `traditional plotted story', exemplified by the stuff that you can read in most fiction magazines. A much wilder, less-framed genre is what Kress calls the `contemporary literary short story', exemplified by Hemingway's `A Clean, Well-Lighted Place', which I would translate into `the kind of story that, by the time you finish reading it, you're surprised it's already over.' If you're into writing that kind of story, this book is not for you. 
<br />
<br />In this review I've focused on short stories because that's what interests me, but actually most of the book is devoted to novel-writing. One more word of caution: Throughout the book, Kress sticks to examples about a story featuring Jane, Martha and Sam, a troublesome family of characters, and their antics. By the `Endings' part, I was bored to death by the trio and had to struggle against my will to toss the book aside whenever they appeared.

                    <span>This is a great book due to the fact that it allows a novice (or experienced) writer an insight into the mechanics of storytelling.  There are exercises at the end of each chapter to enhance your novel or short story - which is very helpful in allowing a writer to look objectively at what he or she has written, to make the story well-written.<br>Recommendation: Buy it...</span>
