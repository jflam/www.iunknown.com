                    <span>Having read all of Burl Barer's work, I made certain to pick up his most recent, "Broken Doll", and was not dissapointed. Barer has an amazing ability to relate what would be a gruesome story with compassion and respect. True Crime is not my favorite genre, but Barer brings so much humanity to each of his books that I can get past the "16 pages of shocking photos" and focus on the tale itself. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>With incredible insight and journalistic flair Barer once again proves his abilities as one of the top investigative crime writers. In this tragic story of aborted childhoods and destroyed dreams, your heart will break for the family of seven-year-old victim Roxanne Doll, and also for that of her killer, Richard Clark, who's own sense of self and human bonding was forever stilled at an early age. Broken Doll is undoubtedly Barer's best true crime book to date, and the best of the genre this year. I strongly urge every reader of true crime to order BROKEN DOLL.</span>

                    <span>True Crime legend Burl Barer returns with another hard hitting masterpiece of investigative crime writing. This time, its the shocking story of 7-year-old Roxanne Doll being kidnapped from her bed in the middle of the night by a trusted "family friend."<BR>Barer continues the standard for which he is famed by taking this story beyond the mere reporting of events and details -- he strips away the "law and order" facade of American justice to reveal the tragic interplay of hope and dissapointment, expectation and devastation, that plagued the lives of child killer Richard M. Clark and the parents of his innocent victim.<BR>Less frenetic than Barer's excellent yet episodic BODY COUNT, nor as legal-heavy as his outstanding HEAD SHOT, BROKEN DOLL equals his MURDER IN THE FAMILY in setting the standard for contemporary true-crime writing. Five stars, indeed -- Barer's best yet!</span>
