                    <span>If you have children and are considering redecorating their rooms, you MUST HAVE this book!  The details and suggestions are wonderful.  There are even lots of helpful hints and project ideas which are practical and easy to do.  I have rarely found so many unique ideas on decorating children'ts room all in one place.  Especially appealing is the use of "real" children using their thoughts, ideas and actual rooms.  A book well-worth referring to over and over again!</span>
