                <span id="Label1">Aimed at Web developers with some previous Java experience, <I>Java Servlet Programming, Second Edition</I>, offers a solid introduction to the world of Java development with Servlets and related technologies. Thoroughly revised and newly updated with over a half-dozen new chapters, this title brings an already useful text up to speed with some leading-edge material. It excels particularly in explaining how to program dynamic Web content using Java Servlets, with a fine introduction to all the APIs, programming techniques, and tips you will need to be successful with this standard.<p>  Besides a useful guide to APIs, the book looks at a variety of techniques for saving session state, as well as showing how Servlets can work together to power Web sites. You will learn performance tips and ways to get Servlets to work together (like forwarding and redirection), plus the basics of database programming with JDBC, to build content with "live" data. A later chapter examines what's next for Servlets with the emerging Servlet 2.3 API standard. Importantly, the authors go over deploying and configuring Web applications by editing XML files, a must-have for successfully running Servlets in real applications.<p>  Since the first edition of this title, the choices for Java Web developers have grown much richer. Many of the new chapters in this edition look at options beyond Servlets. Short sections on application frameworks such as Tea, WebMacro, the Element Construction Set (ECS), XMLC, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) let you explore what's out there for Java developers today with a survey of some current tools that can speed up creating new Web applications.<p>  The text closes with reference sections on Servlet APIs (and other material) that will be useful for any working developer. Although Servlets are not the only game in town, they are still important tools for successful Web development. This updated edition shows you just how to do it with plenty of basic and advanced tips for taking full advantage of this powerful Java standard. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Overview and history of Java Servlets <li>Fundamentals of HTTP <li>Web applications (including deployment and configuration using XML files) <li>The Servlet lifecycle (initializing, processing requests, cleanup, and caching) <li>Multimedia content (images and compressed content) <li>WAP and WML for wireless content <li>Servlet session tracking techniques (hidden form fields, cookies, and URL rewriting) <li>Security issues with Servlets (including certificates and SSL) <li>Tutorial for JDBC and Java database programming <li>Using applets and Servlets together <li>Servlet collaboration <li>Quick introduction to Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) <li>Internationalization issues <li>Survey of third-party Servlet application frameworks and tools: Tea, WebMacro, the Element Contruction Set (ECS), XMLC, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) <li>Miscellaneous tips for Servlets (including sending e-mail and using regular expressions) <li>Description of the new Servlet 2.3 API spec <li>Servlet API quick reference</ul> </span>

                    <span>So many people have specific expectations especially for APIs that support a wide range of application and design. I wouldn't understand why anybody exclusively interested in JSP or code samples would buy a book meant to provide a basic understanding of servlet programming, but I guess it happens. Therefore, I would like to speak on behalf of what this book represents in terms of it's scope and intent. I haven't actully met Mr. Hunter, but I have attended his JDOM session at the XML DevCon, 2000; and, I can tell that he is quite knowledgeable in both his field and in his craft. Even the first edition of JAVA Servlet Programming was worth buying for it's basic overview of servlet implementation and a series of case studies covering common web application. If you're the type of person to invest in solid fundamentals, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>Unlike most of the reviews here, I actually started using this book with only a couple of weeks of Java experience. I found the book easily readable. I use servlets on the job and any real-life problem or question I've faced has been dealt with in this book. The general introduction to servlets chapters were great for comparing the technology to CGI, and they helped convince my management that my choice of servlets was a wise one. Also, the oreilly Java servlet classes that come with the book were helpful too, and I have relied on them for real business use. Servlets touch on many other Java APIs in the course of use and it was not the authors intention of putting in everything you need to know, but just about everything you need to know about servlets. For example, the chapter on JDBC doesn't exhaust JDBC, but it will give you a taste so you can figure out how it affects servlets. The author's website which complents the book is quite helpful as well. I would suggest that this computer book covers its scope better than any other computer book I've read. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I wouldn't say this is an excellent book, but it's not bad. The book covers good fundamentals in its first 8 chapters for those beginning Servlets. The book also covers some useful information on JDBC and Java Server Pages. There's also some additional coverage on Applet-Servlet communication, Internationalization and Tea & WebMacro application frameworks. However some topics like JavaBeans, SSL, Filters, deployment descriptors and XML were too brief and should have been given some depth. Another dissappointment is that all examples are based on API 2.2 but not 2.3!!. The Appendix just touches on new features of API 2.3 with also a separate listing of API 2.3.<BR> It's been 8 mths since I purchased this book. I'd suggest that starters either wait for the next edition or get something that is based on Servlet API 2.3.</span>

                    <span>Review<BR>If you are starting to work in the Java world of coding, you'll quickly run into the subject of servlets. So what's a servlet? A servlet is a Java agent running on a web server that is handling requests from clients such as browsers and wireless devices. This is the most common way that you'll serve up dynamic interactive web content in applications. The browser makes a request to a web server and specifies the URL of a servlet. The servlet takes that request, does whatever is needed (such as reading a back-end data source), and then formats a response back to the browser consisting of HTML.<P>This book will take you from the conceptual ideas of how HTTP works and how it communicates with a servlet running on the web server. You'll then learn how a servlet works and why it's such a wonderful choice for building scalable and efficient web applications. Following chapters build upon that basic framework and leads you through building a number of servlets that will show off some of the capabilities of the technology. The examples are clear and well-documented, and you will come away with the skills needed to start using servlets in your web apps. The book does not assume any particular web server, so you are free to use whatever vendor's server you want to work through the material. If you don't already have a J2EE server available to you, you can download the free Tomcat package from http://www.apache.org in order to start practicing.<P>And why do you need this if you're a Notes/Domino developer? For the normal Notes application, this technology doesn't apply. But IBM and Lotus are pushing enhancements in the Notes/Domino framework that will allow the use of Lotus components within a J2EE framework, and that means that you will be coding servlets to generate the dynamic web content that Domino can deliver. Furthermore, if you start working with Websphere Portal (which is being pushed hard by IBM), 90% of what you code will be based on the servlet classes. This is definitely material you will need to know.<P>Conclusion<BR>The conclusion for this book is the same as my conclusion for the JavaServer Pages book by O'Reilly... If you want to keep moving along in the IBM/Lotus world, servlet and JSP technologies are in your future. While you may not need it right now, you WILL need it. I highly recommend this book in addition to the JavaServer Pages book. The combination of these two books will give you all you need to know in order to work in the NextGen world of IBM/Lotus.</span>
