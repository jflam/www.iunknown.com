                <span id="Label1">One of the most important recent developments in software engineering is the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard for documenting software designs. Written by UML's inventors (the so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), <I>The Unified Modeling Language User Guide</I> provides a very appealing guide to all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a basic tour of the essential concepts and modeling diagrams used in UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, and basic modeling principles. The authors pay close attention to modeling classes (and documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a system). This book mixes in a little software-engineering theory, too, but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to illustrate key concepts.<p> Later in the book, the authors discuss more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and activity diagrams, which can be used to model behavior in a system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you'll no doubt appreciate the author's clear explanations of basic (and advanced) modeling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of today's powerful UML. With its combination of expert modeling advice and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for real-world software design. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Though authored by the authority and inventors of the subject, UML user guide lacks the literary elegance and simplicity that professional technical authors are able to bring in their work. The user guide is very comprehensive in its treatment of topics in UML - but the style does not aid novice with understanding the concepts. For example, examples used are very trivial and does not reflect the practical application of the concept. The book looks more like an attempt to make the technical specification sound more casual, but is not lucid, illustrative and easy. "UML distilled" by Martin Fowler scores high above this book. A PDF chapter from the "UML Distilled" on the sequence diagram is available on the net and it can be used to grasp the writing style of Mr. Fowler to aid in the pre-purchase decision.</span>

                    <span>I have read both the User's Guide and the Reference Manual, which are generally intended to be bought as a pair.  The Reference Manual is better organized, and is an invaluable resource for anyone who does a lot of UML modeling.<p>This book, however, is just a dump of UML information, fairly ecletic but not always in sufficient depth.  It is good information, but the poor organization makes it useless after the initial reading.<p>If you are looking to learn UML, it IS possible to get a good feel for it from this book.  However, something like "UML for Dummies" will also give you a good introduction, at a better price.  If you will be modeling a lot, and want a deep understanding of UML, then it would be wiser to buy the Reference Manual instead.</span>

                    <span>The guys who essentially invented UML wrote this book-the infamous `Three Amigos'.  You would think that given that their book is about design they would have taken the time to make it visually appealing.  Needless to say I should have judged this book by its cover.  It sucked.<p>To start with each chapter begins with an analogy on how building a house is like software design.  When I started the book the analogy seemed appropriate, by chapter 31 I wanted to break someone's nose.<p>Outside of the horrible cover design and redundant analogies the book is poorly organized.  The book constantly refers to terms that it doesn't expound upon or for that matter define anywhere.  For example, the authors refer over and over again to CRC Cards, but they're not defined anywhere in the book.  What's worse, however, are the partially defined lists.  For example the authors go to the trouble of informing you that there are four kinds of events in UML, but only bother to discuss three of them.  Maddening!<p>The chapters don't really follow a logical flow.  The Three Amigos constantly skip backwards and forward throughout the book.  In the side margins, almost as an afterthought they have included chapter references in blue type.   If you follow the chapter references you're reading all over the place.  Moreover, and perhaps most annoying of all is when they keep referring to concepts that they cover later in the book.  I was paranoid that I day dreamed my way over the whole concept of the state machine until I discovered it nested away in chapter 21.<p>Last but not least, the book is poorly written.  Seriously, if you have to read this piece of crap you better brew a big pot of coffee.  Technical literature can be a bit dry at times, but this is an exceptionally horrid piece of work.<p>Death to the Three Amigos and a pox on Rational for hiring them!<p>Don't buy this book.</span>

                    <span>I didn't know much about UML when I started reading this book and feel that it's given me some good grounding.  But I suspect that there are probably books on the subject that are specifically aimed at introducing it to beginners and do a more effective job of that.<p>This is more of a reference book.  It's well-cross referenced and I find it much more helpful for looking up individual terms, diagram types, etc. than when I read it front-to-back.<p>What I was hoping to gain from the book is a better sense of when, where, and why you would be creating the different diagrams and how it all fits into a development life-cycle.  Evidently, this kind of information is left to other "Three Amigos" books. <p>I'm inclined to agree with other reviewers who feel that this book is "wordier" than it really needs to be.  They repeatedly use an analogy to building a house that gets nearly as tiresome as it is obvious.  But if you find UML to be useful, necessary, or just intersting, this would be a good book to have in your library.</span>
