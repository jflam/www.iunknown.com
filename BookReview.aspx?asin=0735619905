                    <span>A few years ago (I'm told) Bill Gates called all of the developers together and told them that the big thing it was necessary for Microsoft to do was to implement strong security systems in their mainstream products. I don't know if this is true, but the biggest changes in their 2003 series of products is greatly increased security emphasis. 
<br />
<br />Exchange Server is no exception. This book is oriented around how to get the most out of Exchange Server while protecting the security of the messaging system. It is written by a network security expert who worked closely with the Exchange Server development team. Published by Microsoft Press, this can be viewed as the definitive book on the subject.

                    <span>In today's environment of spam, virus, and bad things in general, knowing how to protect yourself is a very valuable commodity. <br>Paul has managed to condense everything you need down to a nutshell, okay, maybe more like an acorn tree. But it's all in there. <br>Chapter 20 should be a must-read for anyone in messaging. It goes over some of the legal aspects of you and your messaging system. Most administrators don't realize the possible litigation that they can get themselves into. And sure, your company will protect you. When it comes to a 10 million dollar lawsuit or an employee, who's going to get the shaft?!<br>Ever worry about what permissions have been set on something? Take a look at Appendix B for an in-depth guide.</span>

                    <span>If you're going to pick up a book on Microsoft Exchange Server security, this is *the* book for you.  Great and comprehensive coverage on everything to do with Microsoft Exchange Server from one of the foremost Exchange Security experts in the industry.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in understanding what's entailed in Exchange-related security, including some ground-breaking content on compliance (Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPPA, SEC, etc.) and legislation pertaining to e-mail ... which alone is well worth the price of the book!  Highly recommended!!</span>

                    <span>I admit to a certain degree of bias, being that I'm the author and all, but this really *is* the only book that takes a comprehensive approach to every aspect of Exchange security. The book covers physical and operational security, patch management, end-to-end transport security using IPsec and TLS, client-to-client security with S/MIME, and even security issues related to mobile devices like BlackBerrys and Windows Mobile smartphones. Sample chapters are available from a variety of places, including the book's companion website at e2ksecurity.com.</span>

                    <span>Good book! I'm not an Exchange admin, but I need to understand what the issues are in Exchange and Outlook security. I found the book very helpful in a couple of ways:<br>* covers 5.5. and 2K, even though the title says 2003<br>* covers life cycle issues like archiving and compliance<br>* covers Active Directory and Certificate issues<br>I was impressed that the book managed to combine enough detail to be valuable to technical users, with clear enough descriptions of the issues to make sense to non-techies.</span>
