                <span id="Label1">JavaServer Pages (JSP) has built a huge following since the release of JSP 1.0 in 1999, providing Enterprise Java developers with a flexible tool for development of dynamic web sites and web applications. While point releases over the years, along with the introduction of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), have incrementally improved the rough areas of the first version of the JSP specification, JSP 2.0 takes this technology to new heights.   <P>JavaServer Pages, Third Edition, is completely revised and updated to cover the JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 specifications. It includes detailed coverage of the Expression Language (EL) incorporated into JSP 2.0, the JSTL 1.1 tag libraries and the new function library, the new tag file format that enables custom tag library development without Java code, the simplified Java tag library API, improvements in the JSP XML syntax, and more. Further, it details setup of the Apache Tomcat server, JSP and JSTL syntax and features, error handling and debugging, authentication and personalization, database access, XML processing, and internationalization.   <P>This book recognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals who want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP elements in web pages and programmers concerned with learning the JSP API and using JSP effectively as a part of an enterprise application. If you're in the first group, you learn from the practical web application examples in the second part of the book. If you re in the latter group, you appreciate the detailed coverage of advanced topics in the third part, such as integrating servlets and JavaBeans components with JSP using the popular Apache Struts MVC framework, and how to develop custom tag libraries using the JSP API, with realistic examples you can use as a springboard for your own libraries.</span>

                    <span>I started reading "JavaServer Pages, 3rd Edition" hoping to get a good grasp of JSP.<BR>After 3 days I was wondering why I was still confused about JSP.<BR>Then I started reading the JSP chapter in "Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition by Jason Hunter" and suddenly everything made sense. I am *much* more comfortable with the coverage of JSP in "Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition". The JSP chapter in "Java Servlet Programming, 2nd Edition" is much more logically organized, and easy to follow.<BR>"JavaServer Pages, 3rd Edition" may have all the correct information, but I found the organization of the book to be confusing.</span>

                    <span>I purchased the book based upon the O'Reilly reputation but I was very disappointed in this product. I don't feel the examples progress in complexity in a way that is conducive to learning. Often, the author refers to examples in previous chapters as he builds code relevant to the current chapter. Why should the reader have to go 4 chapters back to see the code that will allow you to navigate to the page under discussion? He also has an over reliance on code snippets instead of sacrificing the page real-estate to show the entire example for the sake of clarity. I also was surprised that the focus of the book is entirely on the JSTL with very little discussion of the core Java language.</span>

                    <span>Now in an updated third edition covering JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1, JavaServer Pages is an extremely practical guidebook especially recommended for server-side Java Developers, uses explicit instruction, examples, and sample codes to instruct the reader in JSP application basics, development, and applying JSP in J2EE and JSP component development. A technical user's manual that goes into express detail, offering explicit syntax and step-by-step discussion of technical applications. No professional level Java reference collection can be considered complete or up to date without the inclusion of Hans Bergsten's JavaServer Pages.</span>

                    <span>Contents<BR>This book covers JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology and standards. The chapters are as follows: <BR>Part 1 - JSP Application Basics - Introducing JavaServer Pages; HTTP and Servlet Basics; JSP Overview; Setting Up The JSP Environment;<BR>Part 2 - JSP Application Development - Generating Dynamic Content; Using JavaBeans Components In JSP Pages; Using Custom Tag Libraries And The JSP Standard Tag Library; Processing Input And Output; Error Handling And Debugging; Sharing Data Between JSP Pages, Requests, and Users; Developing Custom Tag Libraries As Tag Files; Accessing A Database; Authentication And Personalization; Internationalization; Working With XML Data; Using Scripting Elements; Bits And Pieces;<BR>Part 3 - JSP In J2EE And JSP Component Developments - Web Application Models; Combining JSP And Servlets; Developing JavaBeans Components For JSP; Developing Custom Tag Libraries Using Java; Advanced Custom Tag Library Features; Integrating Custom Code With JSTL; Data Access Strategies;<BR>Part 4 - Appendixes - JSP Elements References; JSTL Actions And API Reference; JSP Expression Language Reference; JSP API Reference; Book Example Custom Actions And API Reference; Web Application Structure And Deployment Descriptor Reference;<P>Review<BR>So, you're surfing a web site and hit a web page that ends with the extension .jsp. Looks like a regular web page to you, and if you view the source, it still looks like regular HTML. So what is a .jsp page, anyway? This book will tell you everything you need to know, both as to what they are, how they work, and how you can start using the technology in your development projects. Provided you have a basic understanding of Java, this book will work well for you.<P>The book starts off with an explanation of what JSPs are and why you would use them. Basically, it provides a way to generate dynamic web pages using snippets of Java code. Logically, it's much like ActiveServer Pages (ASP) code as provided by Microsoft, only using Java instead of Visual Basic. It then goes into the benefits of generating content in this fashion, and how it's a superior method to other technologies such as CGI and ASP coding. The rest of the book then goes into great detail (with a large number of examples) on the specifics of JSP syntax. The author does an excellent job of meshing the approach of a tutorial with actual detail that can be referenced after you start developing applications.<P>The author assumes the use of the Tomcat J2EE server package to learn JSP technology. Tomcat is a free download from www.apache.org, and it's easy to load and configure. But don't despair if you are using a different web server. The examples are very generic and portable, and with very little effort you can adapt the information to whatever platform you use. In my case, I was using the Websphere platform and had no problems using that server to work my way through the book.<P>By getting the 3rd edition of the book, you'll learn about the latest versions of the JSP 2.0 specification, as well as the JSTL specification (version 1.1). These were both released in late 2003, so you are getting the latest and greatest as far as the information goes. Since the author was involved in developing the JSTL standards, he has replaced many of his custom examples with the new standard components that are now part of the language. This is extremely important in that you will be learning core language features as you work your way through the book, instead of how the author had to work around deficiencies in the spec.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you want to keep moving along in the Java-based IBM/Lotus world, servlet and JSP technologies are in your future. While you may not need it right now, you WILL need it. I highly recommend this book as a great starter text on the subject that will grow with you as you learn and work with JSPs.</span>
