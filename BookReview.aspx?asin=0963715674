                    <span>I love this book. I had already read several books on the subject by other authors, but none of the other books gave the level of detail I was seeking. This book provided far more information than the others, and was concise and well-organized as well. I wish I had found this book first! By the way, this isn't just for people with MCS--everyone who values good health should read it.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Bower's book is a must own reference manual for anyone concerned with making their personal environment healthier. Her comprehensive list of alternatives for common household chemicals, furnishings and textiles, lifestyle products (i.e. exercise equipment, cell phones, clothing, skin care, etc.) is fascinating because she also gives a brief history of most items while she offers safer alternatives. <P>This book has an extensive, easy to use, index so you can quickly look up topics and has a resource list with phone numbers and web sites that make quick work of finding places to purchase products or for further research. Bower's book is the most comprehensive tool, dealing with Indoor Air Quality (I.A.Q.) issues that our agency has come across. We use this book frequently to find solutions for I.A.Q. problems with our clients. We loan this book and have donated copies to some of the remote branch libraries in our area. Creating a Healthy Household has become an indispensable reference book for our program..."An I.A.Q. Resource Bible" as one of our clients stated.</span>

                    <span>Lists a vast number of resources. The introductions to the sections give good orientations to the issues involved in choosing products and processes. Would prefer a more thorough index, although in-depth table of contents serves as a type of index as well. Well worth the price.</span>
