                    <span>Published in 1989, the New Zealand Prayer Book, He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa represented a significant development in Anglican liturgy, not only for the province of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, but for liturgical development around the world.  While it remained true to the spirit of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (a book whose language and beauty is renowned, but also less applicable in the modern world, even in English-speaking societies), it represented in many ways a paradigm shift by incorporating the texts of the Maori side-by-side with the English liturgies in many instances, and paying a great deal of respect for the language and culture of the indigenous peoples without sacrificing the integrity of the historical English liturgical forms.  (There are also sections in Fijian and Tongan, reflecting even more diversity in the province.)<p>Many of the Anglican provinces around the world that remained in colonial and commonwealth settings retained as their primary source the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, put together by the English in response to the liturgical, spiritual and political influences of the their time and place.  The New Zealand Prayer Book reflects these same developmental features - scholars of the province took care to craft a liturgy sourcebook that is responsive to their particular Pacific setting and cultures.  <p>The Prayer Book Commission was at work for well over 20 years on this text, a period of radical change in the New Zealand society.  This period saw the adoption of Maori as an official language of the nation of New Zealand, realignments economic and political, and major shifts in the church (the province has ordained women since 1977, two years before the official acceptance of women's ordination by the Anglican province in the United States, the Episcopal church).  The book is much more open and user-friendly, and incorporates much more of the laity in the conduct of the service, recognising the ministry of all the faithful as the primary ministry of God.<p>There were experimental and supplemental liturgies, to be sure (all provinces have these to greater or lesser degrees), and the production of prayer book pieces in stages meant that there wasn't a huge problem of introducing the new book.  Indeed, the acceptance of this book as a supplemental text in other provinces and by other denominations has helped prove its worthiness. <p>The book has the basic sections expected in the Book of Common Prayer:  the Church Calendar and Year, revised for the New Zealand context (nonetheless sharing major portions with greater Christendom); Liturgies of the Word for Morning and Evening Prayer, as well as other prayers and devotions; Liturgies of Baptism and Confirmation/Renewal; Eucharistic Liturgies; Pastoral Liturgies (healing, penitence, thanksgiving for children, blessing a home); several Marriage Liturgies and various Funeral Liturgies (it is perhaps with these forms that the local influences are the greatest at shaping the liturgy); Ordination Liturgies (deacon, priest, bishop), and various indexes. <p>In nearly a thousand pages, this book is in a small-size format, easily held, and easily used on a routine basis by tens of thousands of worshippers.  For any Anglican, and any person interested in liturgy and worship, this is a necessity.</span>

                    <span>The New Zealand Prayer Book is one of the easiest to use prayer books in my library. It has marks of creativity that open up prayer. Out of the 3 or 4 prayer books I have, this one is the most flexible and useful. I combine it with daily scripture reading from The Chalice Hymnal and the Revised Common Lectionary. This prayer book keeps me balanced and regular - more so than others I have.</span>

                    <span>If you're an Anglican who loves liturgy (or even if you're not Anglican), this is a must for your library. It's the standard prayer book with all the services you know and love, but with a wonderful new twist of language. In the translation for today's church, the feeling has come back to all the words we say without thinking. For example, in the Lord's prayer "our Father" becomes "Eternal Spirit, Earth-maker, Pain-bearer, Life-giver, Source of all that is and thiat shall be, Father and Mother of us all..." What could more inclusively capture a glimpse of the Living God?</span>

                    <span>A New Zealand Prayer Book beautifully combines the lofty Anglican tradition with a directness and simplicity that reflects native culture.  Many of the prayers are almost childlike in their simplicity, but directly  speak to the heart and soul.  I find myself coming back to certain prayers,  especially an evening medititation that reminds, "What has been done  has been done; what has not been done has not been done; let it be."  Accessible and reflecting the complexity, and simplicity, of the soul.</span>

                    <span>Even though this book was written for corporate, rather than private worship... even though this book was written for the Church in New Zealand, and I am an American... my copy of this book is well thumbed, and I find  myself turning to it several times a week for my personal prayer. The  language is so direct, so clean, it is sometimes striking. For instance,  instead of a rambling 18th century groveling absolution, this book offers:  "God forgives you. Forgive others. Forgive yourself." The  richness of the Anglican tradition remains intact, but through the  enlightened use of language, most of the unhelpful baggage of Anglicanism  has been cast aside. Instead of an imperialistic God, here you find  evidence of a loving God. Here I found the prayer I wanted to pray, the  words for that which was wordless within me. Here I found the powerful,  direct language that sets me free to connect to the Holy One. I recommend  this book as a valuable resource, not only for all Anglicans, but for  anyone who loves being in relationship with God.</span>
