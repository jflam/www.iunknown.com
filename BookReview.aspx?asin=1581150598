                    <span>Beginner,amateur or professional; "Photography-Focus on Profit" by Tom Zimberoff is a must have for all photographers. Tom provides a written road map that is invaluable to not just the individual, but to photographers as a whole. He guides you from the basics of starting out; continues through the do's and dont's on up to maintaining profitability in this tight market.<P>That's not all. He also includes the "PhotoByte" program. This amazing software keeps track of all assignments from birth to conception. It guides you step by step. <P>Want to know how much profit you have made from a particular image? It does it! It keeps track of all profits in general and by individual photographs (it even displays the photo). Want to know which customers still owe money, which one's pay on time and how much profit (or loss) from a particular customer? It does that as well.<P>Don't want customers seeing the markup on your services? Enter the item(s) and Photobyte shows it on the screen and calculates everything for you... automatically. It even add's the sales tax for you! Keeps track of equipment (with serial numbers), customers, jobs...<P>This program is heaven sent which means Tom is an angel. If you need direction then this book will give it to you. The program is just icing on the cake.<P>As a former photographer for the military in Hawaii; I moved to Puert Rico to start anew due to the economic slowdown caused by the 9/11 tragedy. I've worked for many people but never on my own (photography). I had the practical photo experience. But the business side was a stretch and I could only go by "general" business practices.<P>Tom's book showed me that "general" does not apply to photography. "Focus on Profit" is exactly that. "Focused".<P>Thanks Tom. This is the best Photography business book I have ever read. It stays on my desk at all times.</span>

Focus On Profit is a sensible, easy read with a wealth of information about running a successful business. <BR>The computer software "Photobyte" that is included with it has streamlined my business more than I can say. <BR>I highly recommend this book.</span>
