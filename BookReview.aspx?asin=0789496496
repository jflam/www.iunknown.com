                <span id="Label1">From Abba to ZZ Top, from the birth of rock and roll in the 50's to the hybrid music of the present day, Rock & Roll Year By Year is the definitive guide to the music that influenced generations and helped shaped history. Meticulously written to cover key stories of every year in every decade with insights into the seminal artists and music of the times, this is the only full-color guide that details all the major events in the first fifty years of rock and roll.  Co-founders of Original Media and www.musicinformationdatabase.com, creators/executive producers of CNN's global music series, "World Beat" and "The Music Room", Luke Crampton and Dafydd Rees have written more than 20 books about popular music, including DK's Encyclopedia of Rock Stars.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the best book of its type to date. But it is not without it's problems. The first is that both of its authors are British. Hence it skews to the right of the Atlantic. Not that I don't feel myself, that British Rock has produced some of the best acts of all time, but for instance there are more entries on and photos of Gary Glitter than Alice Cooper. Gary Glitter? This is just one example. Some one in a review here mentioned the happy inclusion of Yes. If you look through the entries for that band you'll find at least Two mistakes saying that Fragile was their third album, (it was the fourth) and that Owner of a Lonely Heart is from Big Generator (it wasn't). This may seem like nitpicking but these are just the equivalent of what might be found on one page. It makes one wonder how many more of the presented "facts" are not trustworthy? You expect more from music critics on the voting board of the Rock & roll Hall of Fame. In the end though it's a valiant effort they undertook, and I'm glad I bought the book. It could/should have been a five star book though.</span>

                    <span>This book is a "wow"! I've never seen such a huge volume of information categorized year by year in such detail. What is impressive about this book is how it is able to bridge the gaps between the generations and make them seemingly come togther (Beatles reference!) to make Rock 'n Roll seem like a continuing saga. I dislike most 90s music (and 00s music), seeing it as crass, rude, commerical, lacking heart, overly vulgar and shocking. I hate the fact that Eminem has to share a spot with other great artists from the past, but maybe that's the whole point of rock 'n roll. Our parents didn't like our music and THEIR parents didn't like their music and so on. You can see the controversy brewing in rock from the time it began. But rock is more than just controversy. Artists and genres of all stripes get the billing here. Some see rock as chart oriented, so there's a chronological listing of each #1 for the US and the UK charts, but also gives ample coverage to artists who mainly stayed off the charts but were nonetheless hugely influential. Rock is inherently chaotic but what I love about this book is it brings order out of chaos. From todays preteens and teens to 20somethings and 30something GenXers to Baby Boomers and even graying 60-something beat generationers will all want to spent hours leafing through this fun and informative book. Rock on!</span>

                    <span>ANY ROCK & ROLL HISTORY IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART THAT REFERENCES "YES", PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. LISTEN TO THE VIRTUOSO MUSICIANSHIP AND CREATIVITY ON THEIR "TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS" FROM 1974 OR "CLOSE THE THE EDGE" FROM 1972. HOW THESE ALBUMS WERE OVERLOOKED IN ROLLING STONE'S (MAGAZINE) RECENT ISSUE LISTING THEIR TOP 500 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME IS BEYOND ME. ALSO, BE CAREFUL READING THIS BOOK IN BED....IF YOU BEGIN TO FALL ASLEEP, THE BOOK WILL KNOCK YOU OUT IF IT HITS YOU IN THE HEAD. THIS GIVES LITERAL MEANING TO THE TERM "HEAVY READING". ANYWAY, PLEASE ENJOY.</span>

Just look up the year/month/day. Truly an amazing feat of research.</span>
