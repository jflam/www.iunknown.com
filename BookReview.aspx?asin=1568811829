                    <span>This book replaces the "old school" stand-by Foley-Van Damn as the "bible" of computer graphics. It is a survey of computer graphics principles, focusing on real-time rendering, as indicated by the title.<P>Each subject is touched on in just enough detail to give the reasonably educated reader an understanding of the most important concepts, although sometimes tricky implementation details are left out. The style is academic and authoritative.<P>Some of the highlights of this book are:<P>- an excellent overview of the graphics pipeline<BR>- general optimization techniques based on maximizing usage of all the processor(s) involved in rendering<BR>- an excellent discussion of the standard lighting equation<BR>- survey of special effects "tricks"<BR>- many geometric tests such as intesection and culling<BR>- large list of references<P>This book is not for beginners. A firm understanding of linear algebra, and a prior understanding of elementary graphics concepts such as triangle meshes and texture mapping, are both highly recommended before reading this book.<P>Definately one to have on the shelf. Currently, the best survey of graphics techniques available.</span>

                    <span>Although not a programming how-to book, this book delivers something much more valuable, an understanding of the underlying principles involved in writing real-time, 3D programs. Too many books just give the author's own personal graphics engine to cut and paste into your own, but you never really learn anything about writing your own code. This book was a much needed breath of fresh air in a market seriously lacking a book on the hard-core principles. This book doesn't teach programming, but read and understand this book and you'll be able to come up with the code yourself. And it will be YOUR code!</span>

                    <span>I recently came across a copy of this book that my friend bought. I own a copy of the 1st edition, which was in itself a classic and definately recommended reading.<P>I was so surprised to find this 2nd addition such a worthy purchase to someone already familiar with the first. The topic updates are fabulous and very essential.<P>This book covers everything, introducing real-time rendering very well in an easy to read manner. I very much enjoy the numerous algorithms described in simple terms or even psuedo code.<P>This book is great for budding game graphics programmers. A must buy!</span>

                    <span>This book is a great resource and collection of algorithms used in 3D graphics programming. It does make use of an academic style, both in mathematics and in style of writing - but that is something you will appreciate if you have some computer science or engineering background. Plenty of references to further literature and articles are given in order to facilitate in-depth research on particular topics of interest.<P>The second edition is up to date regarding available graphics technology. It covers the latest additions to current hardware regarding Pixel and Vertex Shaders. It also provides a technical summary of the latest graphics hardware, using the X-Box GPU and the KYRO II architecture as examples.<P>The book covers a variety of useful algorithms at a level of abstraction that will require some additional work in order to implement in software. So it is definitely not a basic "howto" guide for beginners who just want some sample code to get going.<P>The color plates in this book are well chosen and illustrate the state of the art in DirectX 8.1 pixel and vertex shaders. One illustration even shows the latest technology demo of NVidia's new NV30 chip which has just been officially introduced at Comdex in November 2002. It is the realtime rendering of a scene from Final Fantasy, the motion picture.</span>
