                <span id="Label1">Spanning almost thirty years and settings that range from big cities to small towns and farmsteads of rural Canada, this magnificent collection brings together twenty-eight stories by a writer of unparalleled wit, generosity, and emotional power. In her <b>Selected Stories</b>, Alice Munro makes lives that seem small unfold until they are revealed to be as spacious as prairies and locates the moments of love and betrayal, desire and forgiveness, that change those lives forever. To read these stories--about a traveling salesman and his children on an impromptu journey; an abandoned woman choosing between seduction and solitude--is to succumb to the spell of a writer who enchants her readers utterly even as she restores them to their truest selves.</span>

                    <span>Alice Munro gives us a quick and sometimes fleeting glimpse into the inner workings of the stories' characters and lives. This is one of the most literary short-story collections I've ever read. All of the stories in this collection are powerful and intense. Munro has the ability to add tremendous depth in a short story. It isn't easy to have precise characterization and story development in short stories, but Munro does a brilliant work in creating memorable characters and compelling tale in just a few pages. I can't recommend this wonderful collection enough.</span>

                    <span>Munro is one of the greatest writers of short stories of our time--perhaps of all time. There's not a dud in the collection. I have read some of the strories--Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You, The Beggar Maid, The Albanian Virgin--several times and find something new each time. I cannot reccommend this book enough</span>

                    <span>Alice Munro is rightfully considered to be one of the greatest short-story writers in the English-speaking world. Certainly a story like "The Progress of Love," in this volume--a rich, poignantly ironic delineation of the selectivity of memory--is proof enough that Munro is as great as her reputation would have it, and that she is one of the few living writers who deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Chekhov. Nevertheless, plowing through her Selected Stories is like gorging on a box of chocolates; you'd be a lot better off savoring just one or two at a time. The maiin problem is that Munro's subject range is narrow. How many stories can you read in one sitting about women from impoverished small-town Ontario, who are misunderstood and often brutalized by their families, boyfriends and husbands? (The reviewers who called Munro's women weak are misreading the stories severely; these women could have hauled the wounded Titanic to port, 2,000 passengers and all, single-handedly. They have the clemency of the very strong, which unfortunately means that weaker, more spiteful souls can walk all over them.) Yet within each story, Munro's elegant, lucid prose style and encyclopedic knowledge of the human mind and heart make themselves felt. I will reread stories such as "Material," "Chaddeleys and Flemings," "Dulse," "The Turkey Season" and "The Beggar Maid" with joy and admiration for their perfect artistry. But I'll have to wait to reread stories such as "Labor Day Dinner," which after an unrelieved diet of Munro stories can almost seem like a parody of the author. Do yourself a favor; buy this wonderful book, but savor its delights sparingly, as you would a box of Godivas.</span>

                    <span>The short stories that were written in this book were very detailed and had excellent style and really kept the reader entranced. The only problem was that each story seemed to be about the same weak female characters.. it was just a different setting for each story. I definitely like how Alice Munro writes about women though, and I'm going to read some of her other works to compare them, and maybe see exactly where she is coming from.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Although I did enjoy the first two stories in this collection, that enjoyment dramaticially decreased as I read through the rest of the book. Munro's almost constant use of WEAK female characters is infuriating, and I personally am offended by it. Munro also aims to be realisitc, but after a certain point, all of the stories seem to have the exact same conflict but with different character names. While I read the first story in the collection "Walker Brother Cowboys," I had high expectaions; unfortunately, after the first 8 or 10 stories, I was very disappointed.</span>
