                    <span>This is nice reading but if you are interested in learning some strategies for you poker game against you buddies on Friday night, this isn't for you.

                    <span>I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus, interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's "Texas Hold'em Odds" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book.

                    <span>Doyle Brunson's Super System has become the main entry point into the world of serious poker.  Almost everyone who plays poker for money - either at home games, card parlors or casinos - is familiar with this book.  Since television coverage has focused on Hold'em Poker, its popularity has exploded and a herd of new players have rushed to the tables.  Now everyone knows who Doyle Brunson is, and nearly everyone has read his books; this one and Super System II. 
<br />
<br />Some of the newer players have been successful and, with the aid of books like Super System, have become serious threats to the old guard.  However, most people don't realize just how complex a game poker really is.  Some poker pros have spent months or even years setting up their marks, letting them win at first and then gutting then like fish.  There is a lot more to poker than at first meets the eye. 
<br />
<br />One can only wonder how much of Doyle Brunson's publications and public pronouncements are well laid foundations for new conquests.  Those who point out that Dolly hasn't won a major tournament in a long time need to appreciate that finishing in the money consistently can bring home a lot more bacon over the long haul than will an isolated win or two.  
<br />
<br />As to the content of Super System:  it is filled with good information.  It is more a series of essays than a textbook or primer.  Its sheer popularity makes it an essential read.  However, Super System (and Super System II) need to be supplemented with solid background materials.  Not just books like Sklansky's "Theory of Poker" or "Caro's Book of Poker Tells" but also some serious math material like Epstein's "The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic" and Thorp's "The Mathematics of Gambling" and even some lighter material like "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken".  
<br />
<br />Other gambling materials are also relevant to poker, even though they are not about poker per se.  Books that contain poker stories, both fiction and nonfiction, often contain valuable lessons.  Doyle will be the first to tell you that the truth is often stranger than fiction.</span>

                    <span>Simply known as the "bible" of texas hold'em poker, this book must've been read by all of the professional poker players that you see on tv nowadays. The basics that it covers is fundamentally sound and the added nuance and commentary provided by legendary poker player Doyle Brunson may seem trivial but once you play the game regularly and encounter those situations, you will have a new appreciation of the finer points of this great book.<p>As most of you all know, the game of poker has become exceedingly popular over the last few years with the national coverage on ESPN fueling the demand for more insight into this complicated and addictive game. The strategies outlined in this book was written in another era where poker was played in back allies and smoky rooms. With the influx of players of all nationalities comes the high variance in style of play and "skill level". Like Brunson says, there is no concrete way to way for there is much intuition and instinct involved in this game that only comes with experience. The more aggressive and high risk players have hampered the effectiveness of some of the strategies mentioned in the book.<p>However, with all that said, this is still a must read because it contains much more than technical information and statistics. It gives you a feel of the game from a person who's been playing it and playing it WELL for all of his life.</span>
