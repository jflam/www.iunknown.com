                    <span>Some of the topics in this book are just common-sense, some have been widely covered elsewhere and at much greater length (e.g. Cialdini's books on Influence), but all in all this is a lovely selection of the principles of persuasion and some case stories are very entertaining to read.  
<br />
<br />This book is information-rich, but there is still more you may want to learn to enhance your persuasive skills, such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hypnotic Language Patterns.</span>

                    <span>Wow! I'm impressed!  This is one of the best-researched, most thorough books on persuasion that I've had the pleasure of reading. Best of all - it's not just theory. The author, Roger Dawson adds tons of practical examples and applications for each technique.  That means you can use this stuff immediately. By far one the best business books I've read in some time.</span>

                    <span>Great book. Extremely insightful. This book brings together lessons from many other disciplines and supplies new perspectives that are easy to apply. The book is easy to read and a diversified literary and historical background allow you to appreciate the subtle points that really demonstrate expertise in persuasion.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. I just got into sales and it has been invaluable to me. It's easy to read and full of fun stories. My sales have doubled since I read it because now I know what I have to do to persuade people.</span>

                    <span>As a school teacher, I don't read many business books but this one was so helpful to me. There was so much about persuasion that I didn't understand until I read this book. Now it's helping me in every area of my life. Perhaps this sounds trite, but I feel so much more powerful now that I understand the secrets in this book.</span>
