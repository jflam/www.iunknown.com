                    <span>I'm 50 years old today and am more excited than I've ever been! This book is FANTABULOUS! It is by far the best I've EVER seen because it encompasses the whole picture: what's a protein, what's a carbohydrate (etc), which exercises to do (all of which are very basic), how to get you motivated (and stay that way) and even offers a support group (who are ALWAYS willing to help out).<P>The 8 minutes of exercise daily are very effective and simple to do! Jorge also helps you stay accountable every step of the way! In 6 1/2 weeks I've lost 20 pounds and can't believe my energy level. Soon there will be several folks in my office who will be starting this program as well.<P>This isn't a bunch of hype! You can eat "normal" food. Jorge hellps you change not only internally but externally as well. Everything you need to know is contained in the book (including a weight maintenance program).<P>Even if you've tried EVERYTHING else, you NEED to buy this book and start on his program. You'll not regret it! <P>In a few more months I'll be at my target weight and KNOW that I will be able to stay there because of Jorge Cruise and "8 Minutes In The Morning". Thanks Jorge!</span>

                    <span>Jorge Cruise fully delivers in this phenomenal book of practical and EASY weight-loss guidelines! The book is written in a very "down-to-earth" format which makes it extremely easy to read and understand. (This is an important feature, because the simpler the layout, the more likely that people will actually follow the program.) And the program is easy! All you need is some dumbbells, a towel, a mat, and a chair - along with a real desire to change your body - and Jorge has provided everything else to ensure your success! <P> I really like how Jorge "breaks everything down" for the reader. He has included very clear pictures of each exercise, along with the written instructions; he has also provided a wealth of information that explains what types of fat are NEEDED in the body and how to get them; and the beginning of his book contains some very personal information on his family which inspired him to investigate in the weight-loss process.<P>Need more incentive to purchase this book? Well, I personally received my copy a little over a week ago and immediately began to implement Jorge's program and - already - I have lost a total of 7 pounds! Needless to say, I am very excited by my progress. So, If you are serious about losing the weight and improving the shape of your body, then I STRONGLY recommend that you buy Jorge Cruise's "8MM" book...you'll be glad you did!</span>

                    <span>Easy to follow, sensible way to lose weight. I'm not totally sold on the 8 minutes of exercise contributing that much to weight loss, but the diet plan is rock solid. Really like the diet cards too. Other self-help books I like include "The Multifidus Back Pain Solution."</span>

                    <span>I started jorge's eating plan and exercises last year in january hoping to lose 10 stubborn post partum pounds. by april I had lost a total of 20 lbs! the plan and exercises are easy. the only thing I added was a supplement called CLA. Of course it was hard at first and it took some discipline but that's the only way one can lose weight. the only undesirable side effect I had from looking good after following jorge's plan was another pregnancy, but hey, at least now I know how to get back in shape!</span>

                    <span>Well, here's the long and the short of it. This book presents a great, comprehensive meal plan. However, by doing 8 minutes worth of strength training exercises each day of your life, you will not improve your muscle strength substantially. If you do a complete, 20-minute strength training program 3 times a week, combined with 3 days of 30-minute cardiovascular exercise AND follow a well-balanced diet, then AND ONLY THEN will you experience weight loss, improved health, and increased muscle tone and strength. 'Nuff said.</span>
