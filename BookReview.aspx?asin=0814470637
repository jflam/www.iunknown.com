                <span id="Label1">Fresh insights and practical guidelines peel away the mystery behind the elusive art of persuasion.  <P>There's really nothing mysterious about getting people to change their minds. No special, inborn gifts. No subliminal tricks. Instead, the best persuaders--advertisers, salespeople, politicians, spin doctors--depend on the fact that everyone responds to messages in just two ways: thoughtfully or mindlessly. And they know how to manipulate these two persuasion routes to make even the most doubtful say "yes."  <P>Jam-packed with fascinating case studies and surprising examples, this comprehensive, entertaining how-to guide puts the powerful tool of persuasion at anyone's disposal. It explains: * How the master persuaders--the Churchills, Lincolns, and Roosevelts--create powerful, memorable messages that convince people of their arguments' logic and rightness * How successful persuaders exploit the psychological triggers that cause people to subconsciously move from "no" to "yes."</span>

                    <span>Artful Persuasion is hard to put down. Highly instructive and most engaging, it distills the key thinking on the art and science of persuasion - including the conscious and unconscious factors people base their decision making on. Everyone can learn something from it. <P>Even for those who don't often need to sell to or negotiate with others, there's lots to learn about how others try to persuade YOU.<BR> <BR>Each chapter concludes with a handy bullet list of key lessons. Mills draws upon a rich and eclectic trove of witty, sometimes salty, real-world examples from business, politics, history, and elsewhere. To his credit, he reminds the reader throughout about the unethical uses of persuasion; there's a handy section on how people and organizations (like the media) mislead through graphics. <P>This is a book that will be on my desk, within reach - as long as I have clients. (And a husband. And a family. And neighbors. You get the point.)<P>Since rating scales are relative, and I'm not familiar with all the leading books on the subject, I can't rightly give the book 5 stars. So consider my 4 stars an absolute rating of "terrific."</span>

                    <span>There are dozens of excellent books on the subject of persuasion. This is one of the best. Mills explains "how to command attention, change minds, and influence people." His writing style is crisp, his material is very well organized, he includes an abundance of examples to illustrate his key points, and he concludes the book with an analysis of "the most influential persuaders of the twentieth century", Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. The book consists of four Parts: <P>How Persuasion Works (eg four patterns of influence) Thoughtful Persuasion (eg how to build trust and sell your expertise, how to give words added impact)<P>Mindless Influence (eg the seven "persuasion triggers" of automatic influence)<P>Persuasion at Its Best (ie Roosevelt and Churchill)<P>One of Mills's most effective devices is the checklist. Throughout the book, it enables him to summarize key points in appropriate clusters. This is especially helpful for future reference, after the book has been read and functions as a reference source.<P>This book will be invaluable to you if you want to strengthen your ability to "command attention, change minds, and influence people." It will also be invaluable to you when interacting with others who have also read Mills's book and are applying what the learned.</span>

                    <span>There is a common misconception that "knowledge is power".<P>It isn't.<P>Just 'having' knowledge merely qualifies you to play Trivial Pursuit.<BR>Knowledge only translates into power, or in this case "persuasion", IF you know how to USE that knowledge effectively.<P>This book leans heavily on the "knowledge=power" misconception for it's appeal.<BR>It is a typical example of what I call "sweeper" writing. That is to say, though it claims to be offering to tell you "how" to do something (in this case, "How to command attention, change minds, and influence people") it actually only tells you "what" to do. It covers the gap with a stream of brief stories of the "Wow, I never knew that!" variety, "swept up" from a whole slew of books on more or less the same subject.<P>It is my perception that *anybody* who has read the same set of source books, and has a reasonable grasp of written English, could have produced this book, regardless of whether they had any prior knowledge or experience of the subject.<P>For beginners (in any subject), especially those who set more store by what they "know" rather than by what they can actually "do", this "canned knowledge" approach can be very attractive. Indeed, it may well lead them to assume that the book itself is of some value.<P>For the more discerning reader - one who wishes to be able to put their knowledge to work - this favourable impression lasts just about as long as it takes them to find a more pragmatically-oriented text.<P>If you *really* want to be well-informed about "the new psychology of influence" I'd recommend Robert Cialdini's classic "Influence", and for an introductory handbook on the effective and responsible use of influence/persuasion, Andrew Bradbury's "Develop Your NLP Skills".<P>Both books are well-written (that is, easy to read) yet contain far more *practical* information than "Artful Persuasion".</span>
