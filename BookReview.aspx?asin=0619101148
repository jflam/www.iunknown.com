                    <span>This is a practical self study book. The author" Patrick Carey"<BR>takes you step by step to learn the proper HTML syntax. Each chapter is full of hands on examples. The first 6 chapters are <BR>designated to HTML, and 1 chapter about Cascade style sheet, which covers almost all CSS1 and CSS2. The author teaches you the basics, and then moves you to more advance topics. There are also 2 chapters geared to Java script. The book is a solid gold book, I recommend it to any one that has no knowledge of HTML and wants to learn it 1 step at a time, you'll also learn CSS which will take your web site into a higher stage. You'll learn some Javascript as well to make your web site Dynamic. I wanted to put 10 stars for the book, but there were only 5 available!</span>

                    <span>I had the pleasure of using this book in a upper-level web page design class. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. The following are a few comments on the glitch side of things:<BR>1) On 2.24 there is a serious error. I think the authors switched "rock" and "links".<BR>2) RGB triplets in decimal were introduced without sufficient background on p. 3.49.<BR>3) Case 3 in Tutorial 4 was more of a chore than I think was useful. More on this later.<BR>4) I'm left unclear about how the underlining occurs bottom p. 6.48-top p. 6.49. Presumably this has to be done by the HTML coder.<BR>5) The expression "background-image:repeat-x" is wrong.<BR>6) I think it might have been better to have initialized XDay's day and month the same way that its year was initialized, i.e., using "setDate()" and "setMonth()". Or the student could be encouraged to find an alternative to what was proposed in the text. <BR>7) The dense array technique for population an array seems easier to grasp than the one offered on p. 8.36, although I am not objecting to the authors' way of populating that array. Again, the existence of alternatives could be underlined.<BR>8) I didn't see any use made of the javascript roll-over, which seems a pity.<P>General observations:<BR>1) The authors should have been more generous with their bibliographical material. There are some wonderful online tutorials which could have enriched the textbook. <BR>There are also some wonderful historical materials about the internet to which students could have been refered.<BR>2) The problems were imaginative, but too spoon-fed. I guess it's really up to the instructor to ask the students to put in their own text, etc. For the instructor, this makes checking to what extent a student did his own work well-nigh impossible.<P>I plan to use this book next time I teach this class, but will have learned how to work around some of its weaknesses. It is, however, far and away the best book I have seen for a classroom situation. Patrick Carey et al. are to be congratulated.</span>

                    <span>Unless you are wanting to be completely confused and write poor HTML, don't buy this book. I have used the 2nd edition (same author) and a friend's 3rd edition. They have so many typo's in the code that some of it doesn't work. E.g., It doesn't always "quote" the attribute values in HTML coding tags as you are supposed to. <P>3rd edition, Tutorial-4, Case-1, gives step-by-step instructions to create the example web page, but with code that does Not exist! What is this code: < td width="200" bgcolor="back4.jpg" > ?? Is it for the background color or an image? Which is it!? It can't be both!<P>So in closing, this book is extremely poor and confusing. Please ask your school to quit buying this series of programming books. <P>If you want to learn competant HTML quickly and learn it well, use the free online tutorials from www . w3schools . com. Because this group of people created HTML and there are sure to be no errors.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for a college-level course on HTML Programming. The text is fairly easy to follow and provides clear examples and "modules" to learn from. I didn't really need to take the class to learn. This book taught me more than my teacher did. If you read the text and attempt to do the activities as the book explains them, you learn quickly. Drawbacks...the book isn't as organized as some of the others in this series (New Perspectives) It's a little harder to look up a specific function. Advantages...like the other books in the series, it does a good job of preparing you to take the MOUS certification exams, or just to give yourself a basic knowledge of the subject. I would recommend this and the other books in the series.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for an HTML class I was taking and I've really enjoyed it. This book is great for beginner to moderate level HTML. It's easy to understand and has lots of graphics and helpful links for further reference. It has a handy 'tag reference' in the back that lists each tag, what it's used for, and how to use it. And it has a great index for finding exactly what you need quickly. Even after the class was over, I still use this book frequently when working on my personal web page.</span>
