                <span id="Label1">Mark Seliger's book is filled with a riveting cast of characters culled from the celebrity subjects he shoots as the chief photographer for both <I>Rolling Stone</I> and <I>US</I> magazines. A particularly stirring image is a 1987 <I>Rolling Stone</I> shot of Perry Farrell watering a sunflower garden. It is a powerful photograph, made all the more so by the fact that it is the image that essentially launched Seliger's career as one of today's leading music photographers. In the book's introduction, Eric Bogosian discusses the public's infatuation with celebrity, and how it is the photographer's job to capture that fleeting moment, that millisecond that encompasses the subject's spirit. And the artists that Seliger has caught in these moments are wildly diverse. His portraits of musicians range from seldom-photographed country stars like Loretta Lynn and Kitty Wells to Marilyn Manson, Tom Petty, Curtis Mayfield, and Courtney Love. His portraits of Drew Barrymore are among the best of her to date: the playfulness of Barrymore's personality shines through his depictions of her as Alice in Wonderland, a sumo wrestler, a boxer, and the only female boy scout at the mercy of her troop. Seliger displays a keen sense of color, and these photos jump off the page shouting for attention. His black-and-white portraits seem to try for a greater intimacy, and even though they still convey Seliger's sense of play, they are less theatrical than his flamboyant color work. There are, though, beautiful black-and-white portraits here of Sean Penn, Kurt Cobain, Joni Mitchell, and John Lee Hooker, to name a few. Seliger writes: "One of the challenges and benefits of working for <I>Rolling Stone</I> and <I>US</I> is having the opportunity to capture artists just as they're breaking through." This collection includes some very early photos of celebrities readers have come to know well over the years--and it is a fascinating to see how much of their personality he's captured on film. <I>--Amra Brooks</I>  </span>

                    <span>Mark Seliger presents us with a beautiful collection of photographs of well-know individuals and groups. This "picture-only" coffee table book is full of imaginative portraits that truly capture the subject at his/her/their finest! This book would be a bargain at twice the price!</span>

                    <span>Physiognomy is "discovering temperment and character from outward appearance." Mark Seliger in the epilogue talks about how he sees his role as a photographer as to "deliver the essence." These portraits of celebrities magnificently fulfill that mission.<P>Before going further, let me note that this book contains much discrete male and female nudity, some violent images, and one impolite gesture. If this book were a movie, it would probably receive an "R" rating. <P>Mark Seliger is one of the very best of the current celebrity phtographers, a talent that has won him the role of chief photographer for both Rolling Stone and Us. You will enjoy both Mr. Seliger's epilogue, where he describes the development of his career, and Eric Bogosian's introductory commentary on the book's contents. Both explore the notion of finding the reality of the person's character.<P>Mr. Seliger has a particularly playful side that is wonderfully displayed in the book. For example, his portrait of Keith Richard makes him look like a jealous wife flirting with the image of a brooding Mick Jagger. In another case, the energy of Ringo Starr's drumming is captured by displaying him with four arms, hands, and drum sticks! One of the most humorous is an opening sequence of a bare Ben Stiller, first as an ape-man, then as a human. <P>The facing pages are brilliant. In most situations, they mirror each other by either portraying the same image, but with a different style, or having the two images interact as though they were one image.<P>One of Mr. Seliger's strengths is that he has a wide range of talent. His color photographs are powerfully effective in ways that most photographers can only accomplish in black-and-white. He can also do simple face shots, or complex compositions. I can think of no other currently popular photographer with nearly this range of effective style. One of my favorite examples of this range is that he has a beautiful shot of Jennifer Aniston in the buff, discretely displayed. At first you are inclined to think of it as a "beauty" shot, and then suddenly you realize that it's really a play on all of those photographs that parents take of their young children lying bare on a rug.<P>Mr. Seliger is equally adept at the dark side. Sean Penn's volatile personality is nicely captured in a brooding photograph of him pulling on a cigarette. Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg show up looking like they are relaxing during a rumble looking for trouble. "Don't mess with me" is written all over their faces and bodies. <P>Here are some of my other favorites:<P>Fiona Apple, Los Angeles, 1997<P>Bob Dylan, Los Angeles, 1998<P>Michael J. Fox, Burlington, Vermont, 1993<P>Merle Haggard, Lake Shasta, California, 1994<P>Billy Bob Thornton, Toronto, 1997<P>Bob Dylan, New York City, 1995<P>Pat Conroy, Charleston, South Carolina, 1995<P>Charlize Theron, New York City, 1997<P>Jerry Seinfeld, Los Angeles, 1998<P>Will Smith, Los Angeles, 1997<P>Winona Ryder, New York City, 1997<P>Jerry Seinfeld, Los Angeles, 1994<P>Drew Barrymore, Bell, California, 1994<P>There is another way to think about Physiognomy. People who have studied Neuro-Linguistic Programming argue the opposite way, that physiology becomes psychology. Repeated psychology becomes a habit, and the build-up of habits becomes a character. Spend some time thinking about how you hold your body. Test out how those positions and facial expressions affect you mentally, and how that influences your behavior. <P>Pose for best advantage . . . to others and to the development of your own character!</span>

                    <span>You may be like me and wondering which of the Seliger books to buy? He has this one, a couple of US MAGAZINE books with Drew Barrymore on the covers, but let me tell you now - THIS IS THE BOOK YOU BUY! It has the US MAGAZINE pictures and more.<P>It''s huge in dimensions and page count! The quality is great, but if you know who Mark Seliger is then you know that already. The paper is mid-weight and the colour reproduction is excellent. <P>My only gripe is that after a year I've torn the dust cover because the book is so huge it's easy for the cover to slip off a bit and get caught on something. So if you want the cover in good condition forever maybe you should take it off when looking at the book.<P>Want a look at some of the photos in the book?

                    <span>This book is goregeous to look at: the photographs are amazing (and printed HUGE so you can get a good look at the detail), and Seliger's ideas are phenomenal -- who would've thought to dress the cast of Seinfeld up as the characters from Wizard of Oz? Genius!<P>Whenever I have friends over to my home, people inevitably end up flipping through this book and being fascinated by the photography inside. Every time I look at it, I notice something new, or another photograph catches my eye, no matter how many times I've seen it before. This is a book you will look through many times, and whether you're a fan of the musicians and actors (and other famous folks) that Seliger photographed or you're a shutterbug yourself, you'll find something to take away from these amazing pieces of art.<P>My only complaint is that the book is a little odd-sized and probably won't fit on a standard size bookshelf (luckily, Amazon gives you the dimensions here, so that's a help).</span>

                    <span>This is the only book I know of that will give me goose bumps every single time I look thru it. Mark Seliger captures something brillant in every photograph in this book. What an amazing gift he has. If you or anyone you knows is a fan of photography or of music this book is a M-U-S-T!!!! You just CAN NOT go wrong with this book.</span>
