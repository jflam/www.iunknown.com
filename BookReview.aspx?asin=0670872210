                <span id="Label1">Frederick Crews became a well-known critic of Freud with his previous book <I>The Memory Wars</I>. It was a brilliant piece of work: Crews not only knows his stuff, he's a very angry man with a mind like a serrated razorblade. No compromise position here: Freud is totally dishonest, according to Crews, and his theories are a worthless sham--but the really bad news (as set forth in Crews's analysis of the "recovered memory movement") is that to this day Freud's legacy continues to inform a "therapeutic" tradition that destroys people's lives.<p>  Crews's own contributions to <I>Unauthorized Freud</I>, a collection of essays and book excerpts, are a comedown: there is something hectoring and almost desperate in his tone this time around. But he has assembled impressive materials by heavyweight contributors such as philosopher of science Adolf Gr&uuml;nbaum and famed MIT psychologist Frank Sulloway. Some relatively new material is exposed here in a suitably unforgiving light, including both Freud's appalling behavior in the "Dora" case and the full implications of the long-suppressed Freud-Fliess correspondence. Not to be missed is Italian philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro's polite slaughtering of the concept of a Freudian slip.<p>  Both Crews' titles are a must-read for anyone who thinks it's obvious that Freud is one of the great men of the 20th century. It would be interesting to see a Freudian offer a full response to this new book, but Crews dispatched his earlier critics with such savagery (see his final essay in <I>The Memory Wars</I>) that it's doubtful anyone will raise their egos above the parapet. <I>--Richard Farr</I></span>

                    <span>The current status of Freud and his legacy is hotly contested.  The struggle over <br>Freud is intense, because you tend to find the true believers on one side, and everyone <br>else on the other side - that is, Freudianism resembles a beleaguered religion <br>more than a science in trouble.  The struggle is further clouded by the fact <br>that many of the true believers have a direct financial interest in the <br>status of Freud - that is, they make handsome incomes from peddling Freudian psychotherapy to <br>their clients.<p>I myself dismissed Freud as a scientist long ago, when it became clear to <br>me that Freud and his followers were never going to assume the discipline demanded by <br>the scientific method - to construct clear theories and hypotheses, and to subject them to <br>the standard methods of science.  The contrast with Einstein is compelling; Einstein went <br>so far as to describe experiments which would prove him wrong, while nothing, <br>apparently, can ever prove that a Freudian is wrong.  (The contrast with <br>Darwin is also highly compelling.)<p>In this excellent anthology, you can find all the little troublesome facts that <br>your Freudian analyst does not want you to know. Among other things, <br>Freud was an early cocaine enthusiast, prescribing the drug widely for his <br>patients, and he also spent many long years in close collaboration with a man <br>who believed that all psychological problems were seated in the nose.<p>That is not a typo.  Wilhelm Fliess, a man whose ideas Freud "borrowed" <br>regularly, was convinced that the human nose was the seat of all emotional problems.  <br>In one memorable incident, these two quacks went so far as to operate on some poor <br>woman's nose, and almost killed her with their incredible bungling!<p>If this looks like science to you, well...  I know a man who has a <br>bridge he is trying to sell...<p>An excellent book!  Highest recommendation!!</span>

                    <span>If you make a large number of predictions, and if you word them loosely enough, you will make a large number of correct predictions.  You will then be regarded by many as a "seer," and you will attract a large number of innocents called followers.  If you make a large number of statements or claimed observations, and if you word them with enough vagarious terms, you will make a large number of statements that will be accepted as true.  You will then be regarded by many as imperious,  a true intellectual.  These and similar deceptive postures rely on the mathematical fact that a small percentage of a large number is a large number.  This very simple mathematical principle underlies the successes of religions and of other dogma, including of course many of the dogmata of many so-called intellectual professions -  fields such as sociology, economics, psychology, and especially psychiatry, where little by way of scientific approaches are ever practiced.  Also, in these fields, one too often finds the error of regarding an implication as being equivalent to its converse; example: most alcoholic children have alcoholic parents, so most alcoholic parents will have alcoholic children.  Result for psychiatry: look "deeply" into the patient's childhood (or even pre-birth) for explanations of almost any behavior.<p>This book is the brainchild of Frederick Crews, who clearly doesn't suffer fooleries lightly and is a longtime critic of Freud and his followers.  He assembled this compendium, a full score of essays by a wide range of authors who are scholars of Freud and his influences, and the essays are grouped and framed with overviews by the incredibly erudite Crews.  The list of these contributors is impressive.  They include professors of literature, independent Freud scholars, philosophers, a research scholar in cognition, psychiatrists, a mathematician, an American studies professor, and independent authors. <p>To attempt a review of the entire book would necessitate some attention to each and every essay, which would be impossible, given the restraints on Amazon reviewers.  But if you want to peer into troublesome Freudian landscapes or waters, just choose a number at random from among the numbers 3 to 276, open the book to that page, and read for a short while.  Of course, a better recipe is to read the whole book.  You will find disturbing Freudian conclusions, terribly inept Freudian procedures, questionable Freudian actions, the misanthropic Freud, the egomaniacal Freud, and other such repulsions, all adding up to a fraudulent Freud.  Indeed, one of the professional reviewers of this book describes Freud as, " . . . a Viennese quack distinguished only by a certain low cunning and a cigar."<p>It's a handy book that you can pick up and read for snippets of time.  The 20 essays and four overviews comprise 274 pages, an average of only about 11 pages per snippet.<p>Try it.  You'll like it.<p>P. S. The cover art on this book is delicious.  The only thing it omits is Freud having his socks knocked off.</span>

                    <span>I am definitely not a professional in this field, and I highly suspect that most people who engage in a professional practice of some kind have some secrets.  For lawyers, certain privileges prevent the disclosure of  confidential information, and certain corporations are run by executives  who feel that any information pertaining to their business deserves the  same hidden status.<p>This book, mainly about a field in which what is  secret is mostly what everybody knows, is a very knowledgeable attempt to  show how the use of the idea, "Know yourself" by experts in  pursuit of some cure for the problems which individuals encounter in life  may wreak havoc when combined with the ambitions of those who seek  professional advancement.  Exposing Freud's secrets is a theme that is so  close to the practice of psychoanalysis itself that the approach taken by  this book should be obvious to anyone who has taken time to reflect, which  his opponents have definitely done here, and have had plenty of time to  sharpen their arguments against Freud's theories, in fuller appreciation of  the mental catastrophies which have been produced by Freud's own  applications of his principles.  The examples which strike me most sharply  involve a divorce advised by Freud for Horace Frink, the brightest star in  the New York Psychoanalytic Association, to allow him to marry heiress  Angelika Bijur.  According to page 270 of this book, Freud wrote to Frink  in November 1921 that "Your complaint that you cannot grasp your  homosexuality implies that you are not yet aware of your phantasy of making  me a rich man.  If matters turn out all right let us change this imaginary  gift into a real contribution to the Psychoanalytic Funds."<p>The Emma  Eckstein case, which involved the removal of the middle left concha in her  nose by Wilhelm Fliess, who had a theory about a "nasal reflex  neurosis," (p. 55) has been explained more fully elsewhere by Max  Schur and Robert Wilcocks, duly mentioned by Crews.  This might relate more  to the generally clueless nature of medical experiments than to Freud's  practice if Freud hadn't try to absolve Fliess for a botched, superfluous  operation.  I would just like to add that if anyone wants to be friends, or  maybe just colleagues, with people like this, get used to this kind of  thing.</span>

                    <span>Unlike the terrible and undeserved attack on that extremely reasonable, open-minded and brilliant thinker Carl Jung, which this will undoubtedly be compared to ("The Jung Cult" by Richard Noll), this is extremely  well-researched, and mostly right. The only problem with this work is that  people might use it to create an argument of this logic:<p>1) Freud = depth  psychology (i.e. psychology of the unconscious, Jung, Adler, Franz, Hillman  etc.) 2) Freud = rubbish 3) ergo, depth psychology = rubbish<p>The truth is  1) Freud = bandwagon jumper (and ruiner) 2) Depth psychology = most  important psychological development of all time (NOT a  "pseudoscience") 3) ergo, let's start erasing Freud's name and  work from the records and start a new history of depth psychology based on  Jung, Binswanger and others</span>
