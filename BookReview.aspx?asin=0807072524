                    <span>I first read Danielle's writing in a Best American Essays book. It was such a wonderful essay that I immediately went out and bought the book in hardcover because I knew it would be a keeper. I was not disappointed. Her writing stands out because not only are the stories riveting but she has true talent as a writer as well. Each story teaches you something; sometimes a new medical fact, but more often you learn something about the human experience. Danielle is now at the top of my (very short) list of authors to buy in hardcover because I know I'll read them again and again. </span>

                    <span>Not that medicine isn't intense, but it seems as though Ofri is writing more to appeal to expectations of medical training that one gets while watching hospital dramas on television.  While I can appreciate her approach and intent -- to show human relationships in the objective world of medicine -- I think that her overt attempts make the book fall short of what it could be.  Her anecdotes are sometimes entrancing, sometimes engulfing, but in many cases are not entirely believable.  She overstates the ineptitude of those in training while playing to expectations of doctors' callousness and scientific mindsets.  Having read this book soon after another in the same genre that was, quite honestly, much better (Atul Gawande's Complications) I was slightly disappointed with this book.  </span>

                    <span>What a joy to read!  Ofri's book pulls the reader into the fascinating world of medical training. One is able to see what really happens on the wards of a busy hospital from her unique perspective.  More interestingly, though, is the bird's eye view the reader will get of the life of a physician-in-training.  Things you never thought possible will come into light, and Ofri will drag you through them as if they were commonplace occurrences.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of learning medicine and putting it down on paper where even a non-medically oriented reader will not be able to put the book down.  </span>

                    <span>Danielle Ofri expressed clarity and beauty in her writing while conveying experiences from her clinical training.  The book, Singular Intimacies, takes us into the emotional and intellectual training of a physician during her transition from medical student, to intern, to resident at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.  
<br />Ofri describes some of the hard lessons she was faced with while transitioning one year to the next, including how to treat all her patients with compassion, even those who are difficult or are hard to get along with.  I particularly enjoyed the sense of wonder she details while gaining clinical confidence and expertise.
<br />Ofri portrays great insight into medical training which could be useful for those interested in entering a medical profession.  Currently in medical school, I felt that this book would appeal to health care workers, students, physicians, and the general public.</span>

                    <span>This is not a book to take lightly. This is a book about real people, with real problems. This is a book written by a doctor who takes nothing about what she does lightly. <br>   Dr. Ofri takes the sacred--a person and his/her life--and offers us a glimpse into the patient's world and the doctor's world in a poetic, gorgeous book that offers us both rare insight about ourselves and insight about human beings in general.<br>   Each essay describes a moment in time, a look at Dr. Ofri's residency at Bellevue Hospital, a glimpse of one or more of her patients, and a glance toward the human condition and how it can be both transformational and devasting.<br>   Dr. Ofri takes the mundane--an alcoholic arriving in the ER from too much imbibing--and transforms the story into one that will stay with you for the rest of your life.<br>   I am not a doctor, I am not a scientist. I am an ordinary person who will never again look ordinarily at any person whether I see them in a hospital bed or posted as a missing person on a flyer.<br>   Perhaps what sets Dr. Ofri apart is that she is a doctor, a wife, a mother. But I hope not. I hope that every doctor could aspire to having access to both sides of his/her brain, to show emotion and to offer solace in a way that Dr. Ofri has.<br>   This is a must read for anyone in the medical field and a must read for anyone who aspires to have a deeper connection in any relationship with any person.</span>
