                <span id="Label1">George Soros Ends the Speculation    <p>"The outcome [of this book] is a summing up of my life's work. . . As I finish the book, I feel I have succeeded."&mdash;George Soros from the Preface    <p>Critical praise for Soros on Soros    <p>"If you have ever wanted to sit down for a candid conversation with a phenomenal financial success, George Soros's book provides the opportunity. You will meet a complex man and a first-rate mind."&mdash;Henry A. Kissinger    <p>"The best expert on Soros is undoubtedly George Soros! After all, who is better equipped to tell us what he really thinks and how he thinks, a matter of some importance given the fact that he has translated a remarkable personal financial success into a truly generous and historically significant effort to promote postcommunist democracy." &mdash;Zbigniew Brzezinski    <p>"The best X-ray of the mind of the master yet." &mdash;Barton M. Biggs    <p>"George Soros brings a lot more to the world of finance than the intuition and nerve of a born trader&mdash;and in Soros on Soros he's no longer bashful about telling us about it. A philosopher at heart, George attributes his success at investing to a theory of the interaction of reality and human perception. What really drives the man now, with a personal fortune beyond all personal need, is a different kind of strategic investing&mdash;investment to build in Eastern Europe the kind of open societies he came to value in his own life." &mdash;Paul A. Volcker    <p>Financial guru George Soros is one of the most colorful and intriguing figures in the financial world today. Now in Soros on Soros, readers are given their most intimate and revealing look yet into the life and mind of the one BusinessWeek dubbed, "The Man Who Moves Markets."    <p>Soros on Soros interweaves financial theory and personal reminiscence, political analysis and moral reflection to offer a compelling portrait of the world (and its markets) according to Soros. In an interview-style narrative with Byron Wien, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, and with German journalist Krisztina Koenen, Soros vividly describes the genesis of his brilliant financial career and shares his views on investing and global finance, politics and the emerging world order, and the responsibility of power.    <p>Speaking with remarkable candor, he traces his progress from Holocaust survivor to philosophy student, unsuccessful tobacco salesman to the world's most powerful and profitable trader and introduces us to the people and events that helped shape his character and his often controversial views.    <p>In describing the investment theories and financial strategies that have made him "a superstar among money managers" (The New York Times), Soros tells the fascinating story of the phenomenally successful Soros Fund Management and its $12 billion flagship, Quantum Fund. He also offers fresh insights into some of his most sensational wins and losses, including a firsthand account of the $1 billion he made going up against the British pound and the fortune he lost speculating on the yen. Plus: Soros's take on the devaluation of the peso and currency fluctuations internationally.    <p>He tells of the personal and professional crises that more than once threatened to destroy him and of the personal resources he drew upon to turn defeat into resounding victory. And he explains his motivations for establishing the Soros Foundation and the Open Society Institute through which he worked to build open societies in postcommunist countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.    <p>Finally, turning his attention to international politics, Soros offers keen insights into the current state of affairs in Russia and the former communist bloc countries and analyzes the reasons behind and likely consequences of the West's failure to properly integrate them into the free world. He also explores the crisis of the ERM and analyzes the pros and cons of investing in a number of emerging markets.    <p>Find out what makes one of the greatest financial wizards of this or any age tick. Soros on Soros is a must read for anyone interested in world finance and international policy.    </span>

                    <span>Like a 21st century physicist, George Soros is looking for the universal theory, the theory of everything. In Soros on Soros, he tries to express his vision of that theory, that one formula that will link his insights into markets, group dynamics and the historic and political evolution of mankind. While he never succeeds, you'll get a full education in Soros-think as you watch him lurch through a series of anecdotes, observations and philosophic lunges. Soros is an investor and self-proclaimed failed-philosopher, not a wordsmith. The power of this book lies in its ideas, not its art. He has learned from his role as the world's most powerful investor that mere thoughts - whether correct or incorrect - can move markets, motivate people to action and alter the course of history. For that reason, we [...] recommend this book to all investors, executives and students. After a series of financial defeats since 1998, Soros might not be what Soros was, but his ideas and beliefs still sway markets and shade international policy in a manner that few people on the planet can match.<br></span>

                    <span>This book covers many facets of George Soros's life- his investment philosophy, family history, quantum fund, his own theories of investing, philanthropy, diplomacy, and some of his selected writings. Mr. Soros talks about macroinvesting and how leverage has given the quantum fund greater flexibility than a two dimensional portfolio. He surprisingly admits that he is a very critical person who looks for defects in him as well as others- calls himself an insecurity analyst. Mr. Soros also talks about the tension between his parents and how the Nazi invasion of Hungary influenced him. I would suggest that one read his book, The Alchemy of Finance to learn more about his approach to investing. Classical economic theory assumes market participants act on the basis of perfect knowledge, his philosophy is based on imperfect understanding. The Alchemy of Finance talks in detail about the general theory of reflexivity and boom/ bust theory. Using the sterling crisis, Mr. Soros emphasizes the need for Euro. Karl Popper at LSE influenced him greatly and Mr. Soros invested millions on promoting an open society in Eastern Europe. His foundations have failed in China and Russia. He does not want anything but the Central European University to outlive him. Mr. Soros talks extensively how the west failed the Soviet Union and states that it would have been better had it not collapsed like Yugoslavia It is a must read for anybody interested in philosophy, diplomacy ,and business.</span>

                    <span>George Soros was convicted of inside trading in December 2002. He engaged in inside trading of Societe General stock. <P>"Mr Soros and three other defendants, the court found, bought Societe Generale stock when it was cheap, and cashed in their investment when the price rose after the bid became public. <P>Two other businessmen implicated in the scandal - Edmond Safra and Robert Maxwell - have since died."<P>Maxwell killed himself after his billion dollar scam/business was exposed. He dove off his huge yacht off the coast of France. He left behind billions in debts and thousands of British workers lost their pensions. Soros is known by the people he associates with. <P>It is not to hard to "stay ahead of the curve" when you trade with inside information. <P>For more details - go to the BBC news web site and search for Soros insider trading or Google and type Soros BBC insider trading.</span>

                    <span>Soros on Soros interweaves financial theory and personal reminiscence, political analysis and moral reflection to offer a compelling portrait of the world (and its markets) according to Soros. In an interview-style narrative with Byron Wien, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, and with German journalist Krisztina Koenen, Soros vividly describes the genesis of his brilliant financial career and shares his views on investing and global finance, politics and the emerging world order, and the responsibility of power." "Speaking with remarkable candor, he traces his progress from Holocaust survivor to philosophy student, unsuccessful tobacco salesman to the world's most powerful and profitable trader and introduces us to the people and events that helped shape his character and his often controversial views." "Finally, turning his attention to international politics, Soros offers keen insights into the current state of affairs in Russia and the former communist bloc countries and analyzes the reasons behind and likely consequences of the West's failure to properly integrate them into the free world. He also explores the crisis of the ERM and analyzes the pros and cons of investing in a number of emerging markets</span>

                    <span>This is a commissioned book. Basically, a self-indulgent pseudo-autobiography written in an interview style. "my own estimation of myself is more important to me than other people's" (P249)<P>The interview style makes this work more accesable to the average reader by overcoming the intense, convoluted style of Soros' other writings. It also allows more topics to be covered in less technical detail.<P>If you want to learn a little about Soros, this is an interesting book with fascinating pearls of wisdom. But don't think of it as an autobiography; rather a rumination on various aspects of his character.</span>
