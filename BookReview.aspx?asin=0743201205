Giving full coverage to all aspects of the rock scene, it tells the story of rock & roll in a clear and easy reference format, including complete discographies, personnel changes for every band, and backstage information like date and place of birth, from Elvis Presley to Eminem. <P> Since the last edition, the music scene has exploded in every area, from boy-bands to hip-hop, electronica to indie rock. Here, the <I>Encyclopedia</I> explores them all -- 'NSync, Notorious B.I.G., Ricky Martin, Radiohead, Britney Spears, Blink-182, Sean "Puffy" Combs, Portishead, Fatboy Slim, Fiona Apple, Lil' Kim, Limp Bizkit, Oasis, Outkast, Yo La Tengo, TLC, and many, many more. <I>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, Third Edition</I> includes all the facts, phenomena, and flukes that make up the history of rock. Accompanying the biographical and discographical information on the nearly 2,000 artists included in this edition are incisive essays that reveal the performers' musical influences, first breaks, and critical and commercial hits and misses, as well as evaluations of their place in rock history. Filled with hundreds of historical photos, <I>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia</I> is more than just a reference book, it is the bible of rock & roll.</span>

                    <span>Usually I have a problem with Rolling Stone because many of the critics they have are notoriously biased towards or against certain genres of music, like Dave Marsh. But this book is nothing like that at all. It's as unbiased as they come. Bands and artists are alphabetically categorized, so if you're looking for AC/DC, look in the front, if you're looking for Frank Zappa or ZZ Top, look in the back. A complete discography (well, as complete as they were able to get with the information they had at the time), with year of release and label of albums included. Members of the bands are mentioned (including even their birthdate and where they were born), when they left, and when new members came in. A description of the band or artist is included, the bigger names, obviously getting more print. The book seems to avoid criticisms of certain albums, which is great, so not to scare people off when they show interest in a certain band/artist, although they would point out how the critics scorned Jethro Tull's A Passion Play, there's no opinion themselves that this is a bad album or not (in in my opinion, it's a great album, but then I like prog rock). Big names like the Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, The Rolling Stones, are all naturally included, to '50s pioneers like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, etc. Even the prog rock scene like Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull, etc. gets a fair shake (something you can't say of their magazine, particularly when albums like Tarkus, A Passion Play, and Tales From Topographic Oceans are concerned), and even lesser known prog rock bands like Soft Machine, Gentle Giant, Can, Amon Düül II, Gong, and Van der Graaf Generator get mentioned here. Big time folkies like Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, etc. are included, while Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, Nick Drake, The Pentangle, etc. are also covered. Plus there are some jazz, country, traditional pop, electronic, etc. that also have an importance to the rock music in general, be it directly or indirectly. This book, being from 1983, even covers rap music way before it became popular by anyone except maybe a small portion of fans on the streets of New York. I love this book, it's very useful. Yes, it's outdated, it's from 1983, so if you're looking for Metallica, Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, or the latest rap star, you'll be disappointed (it's been revised since, however). But for those trying to build up your record collection, this is a great book to try.</span>

                    <span>...When I first discovered a Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll in our old bookshelf,I got interested & started to read it.From Abba to ZZ Top,the book was cool. But I could not find any of my favorite bands,like a-ha.I mean, it was from the 80's! Anyway,the book started to deform.So I got the third edition,and I can finally find a-ha and other bands that I like, for example,N*Sync.A great book,especially if you need to find info about your favorite group or singer,or all their hits,albums,and other info about their life. A rare chance to include this amazing book to your library.</span>

                    <span>There are two reasons why I had to get this book. Firstly, my 1995 copy crumbled into an oblivion of dry glue, a spine torn in half and a cover too flabby to endure. I did turn to the book often for information, but from the looks of it, you'd think I shot it out of a canon once a week as well. The book is just as cheaply constructed as other reviewers contend, while the Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia is much friendlier to the reader both aesthetically and physically. Secondly, Rolling Stone's web site used to contain all the information found in this book. Recently, though, the disappointing decision was made to scrap those lengthier and more informative biographies for the infuriatingly cursory headnotes they recently replaced them with.<P>Some of the omissions noted by other reviewers here are remarkable not necessarily because of the bands omitted, but because of the "artists" Rolling Stone replaced them with. I mean, come on, the guys in Great White aren't exactly pioneers, and why anyone thinks the exclusion of Wierd Al Yankovic is at all noteworthy mystifies me. But to leave them out for Britney Spears? Ricky Martin? What a blow! Couldn't we just scrap Milli Vanilli, for the love of God? It isn't as though Tiffany, who is included in this book, will be remembered any more than Britney 30 years from now; nonetheless I don't consider either pop star worthy of inclusion at the expense of decently talented blues bands such as Great White who at least know what a "chord" is. The real crime with regard to the debate over who's in and who's out is the exclusion of various Native American songwriters such as Jim Boyd or Bill Miller. The former in particular continues to make unbelievable folk rock (some of which was featured on the "Smoke Signals" Soundtrack). The work Boyd has done with Sherman Alexie (songs like the incomparable "Million Miles Away") especially warrants recognition here. <P>Those objections aside, this really is a nearly inexhaustible resource for fans of any of the 1,900+ bands the book takes a look at. I think that the distant tone with which the entries are written will infuriate more passionate fans who think their heroes aren't getting the accolades they deserve. But as an Encyclopedia's duty is to provide the essential information, this book at least succeeds more often than it fails. My own relationship with its past and current editions is going on about 8 years now. Along with the "Rough Guide to Rock" or the "Encyclopedia of Record Producers," it continues to be one of the few resources I run to for answers to questions or quick tutorials on bands whose work I am yet to be familiar with. I think it should also be noted that people ought not to be mislead by the "Rock 'N Roll" title, as the book includes many bluegrass, country, and folk artists who may not immediately be associated with Rock 'N Roll per say, but who influenced the genre to such an extent that their exclusion from this book would have been egregious. I mean people like Dave Van Ronk, Bill Monroe or Townes Van Zandt.</span>

And you know what? They left in bands like Destiny's Child, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, N*Sync, and tons of other pointless people who had NO impact on ROCK & ROLL! Sorry, but in my opinion, an encyclopedia should be a place of fact and reference when you would like to find more information on a subject fitting inside a SET topic, not a collection of bedtime stories. <P>I bought this to read about STRICTLY Rock and Roll (hence the TITLE), but sadly got a collection of pop, country, punk, and fake punk. <P>A BIG Disappointment as far as material. Almost an insult to Rock and Roll itself with its cuts/leave-ins.</span>

There is way, WAY too much vital stuff missing.</span>
