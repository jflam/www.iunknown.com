                <span id="Label1">A comprehensive and practical text and the perfect starting point for this subject ... 'Is this system secure?' seems, on the face of it, a straightforward question. Yet how one arrives at an answer is a process which poses a wide range of more complex questions which require a basic understanding of security mechanisms. Questions, such as: * Should protection focus on data, operations or users? * Whilst taking cast iron measures to build in security at one level, what does one do to prevent attackers gaining entry from a lower level?<br>   <br>   Starting with basic definitions and concepts, the first section of the book goes on to outline the mechanisms located at the heart of the computer system, mechanisms which provide the basis for techniques used in all other branches of the system. The second section examines the security features found in operating systems such as UNIX and Windows NT, catalogues security breaches, and introduces the topic of security evaluation. A third section is devoted to issues associated with distributed systems, such as network - and Web - security and considers cryptography as an essential technique for such environments. The final section of the book is constructed around database security, discussing problems in multi-level security, and examining security problems in specific settings.<br>   <br>   Written for self-study and course use, this book will suit a variety of introductory and more advanced security programmes for students of computer science, engineering and related disciplines. It meets a real need for a comprehensive textbook on the subject. Technical and project managers will also find that the broad coverage offers a great starting point for discovering underlying issues and provides a means of orientation in a world populated by a bewildering array of competing security systems.</span>

                    <span>My university has an undergraduate CS major in Computer Security and this is the book we use for our introductory subject. Some reviews here have stated that this book does not deal much about the practical aspects of computer security...true, it doesn't, but I don't think it was supposed to anyway. Our major branches out to more practical areas after this subject including applied cryptography and network security. I haven't finished doing this subject as of this writing but I can see how this book will help anyone who intend on doing serious computer security studies in the future. This isn't a "build a firewall in 24 hours" type of book. It's an academic book for those who want an introductory theoretical approach to computer security. If you cannot appreciate the abstract side of computer science then you're probably in the wrong field, buddy.<P>This book is for people who want to get a good foundation on security before getting their hands dirty. If you're a university student/graduate and serious about further studies in computer security then this book is a must buy.<P>This book is not for people who need a step-by-step tutorial to build a firewall (as I have mentioned). If you're more concerned about which set of applications to use in a particular operating system then look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>This book begins with a poem in an unidentified language that is never translated. Take this as a clue to what you're in for throughout the book. Chock full of abbreviations, acronyms, waffles and other items of geekspeak grammar, this book is possibly good reference for super technicians already familiar with the topic. For a user who is taking his first course to become familiar with the basics of computer security, however, this book might as well be in another language. After reading two bad books on this subject, I am beginning to doubt that anyone really knows much about computer security. By the way, I could make the effort to find out what language the poem is in and what it says, but as with the more technical items in this book, isn't that what I paid the author to tell me? This book is a poor value for your money.</span>

                    <span>The reason why I like this book is that its first chapter is *not* on cryptography and *not* on network security. Most other books focus on those issues (or on viruses) and do not deal with various security models in detail. Obviously, this is a theory biased textbook and not a book on 'how to make surfing with browser x version y.z more secure'. :-)</span>

                    <span>Dieter Gollmann's "Computer Security" provides an excellent survey of the fundamental science relating to the book's title. As stated in the Editorial Review, it is intended as a graduate Computer Science textbook. While this may be true, it is also valuable for anyone tasked with designing security into an application or distributed system.<P>The book provides a macro-level introduction to the primary subject areas involved in securing operating, network, and database systems, with varying levels of exposure to theoretical foundations, architectural tradeoffs, and practical implementations. These "varying levels" are perhaps the one difficulty I have with the book, because the treatment of some topic left me with an uneven understanding with respect to other important topics. For example:<P>In PART 1 FUNDAMENTALS, Chapter 3 (Access Control) lays thorough conceptual groundwork for understanding Chapter 4 (Security Models) which covers the theoretical development (Set Theory and Partial Order Relations) of formal Access Control Models. <P>These subjects are "bread and butter" to operating/database system securdesigners and receive very robust treatment given the overall dimensions of the book. However, other primary security topics (e.g. Cryptography) do not get enough fundamental explanation to leave an uninitiated reader with a sense of understanding. Perhaps, this dilemma is endemic to computer security itself - a paradigm that requires deep multi-disciplinary subject understanding to master. However, "Computer Security" does mitigate this apparent deficiency by providing a comprehensive Bibliography complete with 163 separate entries.</span>
