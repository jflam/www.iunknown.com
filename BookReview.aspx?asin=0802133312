                    <span>Burroughs is basically a love-him-or-leave-him writer. Using a slightly more lucid version of his "cut-up" style, The Wild Boys is a book about a group of, well, wild boys rising up in the face of a very oppressive society. Yes, there is lots of sex, most of it homosexual, but once past that Burroughs shows some interesting sociological insight. Burroughs is a satirist at heart, and in this case he is clearly on the Boys' side as he tries to "expose" the bedroom lives of the Moral Majority. However, Wild Boys brings more with a clear message to rebel against these oppressive forces and enjoy life. 
<br />
<br />We begin the book with glimpses of the corruption of the oppressing classes in a fantastical estate resembling a strange Neverland ranch. Rich people are invited to a long stay by the host where they eat, hangglide, and have sex. The starving masses are locked outside and taunted by the estate staff.
<br />
<br />Then, we move on to the Boys' who also have their own bizzare society, but Burroughs tries hard to write it in a much more positive light. Ritualistic and spiritual, the Boys band together and fight back for their freedom. 
<br />
<br />Burroughs adds some interesting styles to the mix. Color plays a huge role and are often used to describe characters and places. Many times whole pages are nothing more than the same passage in slightly different variations written repeatedly. Sometimes these experimentations are interesting, other times they are tiresome. The plot, such as it is, starts and stops throughout the book. Some of the chapters are quite lucid and describe the war between the millitary and the Wild Boy tribes; other chapters, and the basic theme in these repeats, deal only with a few characters as they throw caution to the wind and succumb to their homosexual desires. 
<br />
<br />While this may not be the best Burroughs novel I've read, it's certainly memorable. There is a lot to discover here, but some may not be willing to wade through the uneven style or sex to find it.</span>

                    <span>This novel reminds me of Kevin Esser's Dance of the Warriors and of the Venezuelan movie Sicario.  They all deal with worlds in which gangs of teenagers are engaged in violence and sex.  This is the best of the three.  It is disturbing and is not for the conventional, and certainly not for the bleeding-heart types who want the United Nations to abolish the use of boys in war.  Only Burroughs could have written it.  The style is as unconventional as the theme.  This is a world in which morality does not exist.</span>

                    <span>A square - a story inside other stories - the interaction of ghosts with the living - and the living with being reborn.<p>This was the first Burroughs I'd read.  It read like a series of short stories connected like a poem.  Burroughs language flows then stutters and then squares back on itself.  The way he experiments with the sound and repetition of words - was exciting and something I find I do in my own writing.<p>I found myself keeping track of themes - St. Louis, and green (Greenbaum, Green Inn, Green Nun, Greenfield, Green Hat), and a constant reference to 1920.  I haven't read much biography on Burroughs; that should come next.<p>Burroughs exploration of a future that becomes more primitive even as it advances, his unabashed and open erotic descriptions as a consequence of his future rather than as an expected sidetrip, and his clean and no holds barred language require that I read more of his work.</span>

                    <span>Quite simply this was the most tastless and ignorant piece of literature I have ever read. It seemed as if the book felt like convoluting any actual storyline with scenes of gratuitous and repetive sex. Is it just me or does everyone in this damned book seem to carry a tin of vaseline? I thought there were some interesting parts but, call me a prude or an ignorant little ... but I think this book was riding on the current of the Naked Lunch which has been the wave on which Burroughs had carried his wrinkly disgusting body upon. This book is pretty much like a David Lynch film. No one gets it, they just talk about it and pretend that they do so they look intelligent but quite simply they are just beatnik sheep ready for slaughter by the corporate identity you have tried so hard to avoid with your lies and propaganda of free intellectual thought, which is disguising your true ignorance and gullibility</span>

                    <span>This futuristic tale of a band of guerrilla boys fighting against the repressive police and government agents is told through Burroughs's imaginative style, which is more about creating atmosphere and using the language itself as part of the narrative web than about creating a sharply linear story. It's like an abstract painting through images and words, so it's difficult to elaborate on plot. Interspersed are pornographic scenes of gay sex between characters, which give the story a hallucinatory sensuality. The language rhythms become more accessible as the reader travels deeper into the story and enters the world Burroughs is creating, which isn't such a bad place to visit after all.</span>
