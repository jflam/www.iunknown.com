                    <span>I am from germany so dont get confused with my (bad) english.<br>Since i read my first fact book in 1987 it haven?t changed.<br>If you have one, you have them all.<br>But because i am interested in nfl-records, i buy this book, but since few records are broken during ONE season, it?s enough to buy the book every 3 or 4 years.<br>ther?s to less information beyond the stats you can read in the every-day newspapers during the nfl-season.<br>for example: if you want to know how many Yards the Broncos gained vs. the rams in Week one you?ll NOT find.<br>on the positive: there are no errors in the stats, it?s very easy to to survey and it has some (but very less) good stats behind the one?s in the daily newspapers. i like for example the section of the starting records of active QB`s.<br>in all: for average (stats-) fans it?s great, but don?t try to look for deep inside the numbers, you?ll not find it here.</span>
