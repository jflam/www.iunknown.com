                    <span>This is the book to have if you need to implement group policy in your organization or even if you just want to find out how group policy really works. There is nothing out there like it.
<br />
<br />I can't tell you how many hours I have spent pouring over Microsoft Technet documents and other technical publications - reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there, in order to produce just a piece of a solution using group policy. This book has everything you need written in a fresh and interesting style. It is the first technical book I have read cover to cover -and I have been in the business for over 15 years!</span>

                    <span>I know that Mark Minasi didn't write this book, but I've found that pretty much anything that has his name on it is very good. However, THIS book has exceeded my expectations. It has already solved/answered many problems/questions I've had about GP and AD. It is a one-stop problem solver. Given all the 5 stars I saw in the reviews before I bought the book, I thought maybe the publisher had padded the reviews. Not so. This is a must have. It covers the basics and more advanced topics of GP, which is something I needed. An example problem I had: We use Roaming Profiles. We have three remote offices and sometimes printers wouldn't install when a user went from a remote office to our home office. We also needed a way to automatically reset the default printer when a user Roamed to a machine in another office. Page 132-133 of this book tells how to do that with a 5-line script.</span>

                    <span>This book uses any Group Policy knowledge you may think you already have and expands it by 1000% (technically impossible I know but you get my drift!). It's a pleasure to read and the author's knowledge and devotion to the subject come shining through. If you need to design or support Group Policies then you must buy this book.</span>

                    <span>I also agree with the other reviewers that this book is an absolute MUST for any Windows administrator. It's easy to read & reference no matter what your level of expertise with GPOs. It's helped me out on more than a few occasions. What more can be said that hasn't yet? If you work with GPOs you MUST have this book! Thanks for a great book Jeremy!

                    <span>As is obvious to us 'real-world' AD Forest Rangers, Group Policy is very powerful and can be very dangerous.  Used properly, you can reach new heights along the road to a 'well managed environment' but if you aren't very careful, you can hose EVERY W2k and newer system in your domain (and possibly forest) with just a few clicks.  This author has focused on a very complex topic and due to his diligence and thoroughness, readers of this book come out the other side in glorious enlightenment.  This book is a TREMENDOUS resource that covers almost every detail of GP that I've ever needed.  Plus, the extra 'Web chapters' at www.gpoanswers.com are a great resource, too.   </span>
