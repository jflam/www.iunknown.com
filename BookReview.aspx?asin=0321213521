                <span id="Label1"><P>If you're ready to go from Photoshop competent to Photoshop enlightened, this is the place to turn. In these pages, revered Photoshop instructor <B>Ben Willmore</B> explains the whys behind the how's so that you can unleash Photoshop CS' full creative potential. In a friendly, easy-going style that's long on information and short on techno-babble, <B>Ben</B> explains the concepts, features, and techniques that promise to make a real difference in the way you use Photoshop CS. Complex concepts like curves and channels are made crystal clear, and features new to Photoshop CS--like the very cool PhotoMerge function for creating panoramic composite images, support for nested layers, and more--are covered in the depth they deserve. After a quick grounding in the tools, palettes, layers, and masks at the program's core, Ben gets into the real-world production techniques that make up the heart of this volume: sharpening scans, correcting and optimizing images, and more.</P></span>

                    <span>Well, I bought this book because of the great reviews it had received, and I gotta say it deserves them. It's so good I read the first 240pp in about 3 days. The first chapter alone will show you how to streamline your workspace to get the most out of Photoshop. By the time you read through to chapter eight, you will have a very solid understanding of some tools that will allow you fix photographs you thought were messed up beyond repair.<P>Willmore's conversational style makes it easy to understand everything he's explaining, and the images (all in color, unless they're grayscales) clarify whatever confusions may arise. Just be sure to work along with him (using the images in the CD) so you get a feel of the tools he's teaching you how to use.<P>I have not yet gotten to the part where he teaches you specific "tricks," but I looked ahead and am very eager to get there. I find that highlighting certain parts of the text and rereading them before moving on to the next chapter helps me remember what I just read. This book will definitely turn any beginner/novice into an advanced Photoshopper.</span>

                    <span>No one could deny that really learning Photoshop is a bit of work. Now that I have my certificate I can tell you that for a fact. <P> Ben Willmore's book takes what appears to be the sometimes scary commands, tools and features of Photoshop and not only what they are - but when to use them. He explains them in a way that makes it appear simple, and then gives you an example.<P> The book is easy to follow and one of the textbooks books that should be read from front to back. And consantly used for a reference. I will not be selling this one on Amazon Mktplace!<P> For you dollar this book is a bargain. I used this book constantly though my last semester advanced photoshop class and it gets the most credit for getting me an A (398 out of 420 possible points) in my class. <P> I hope he writes an equally excellent book on Imageready.<P> I highly reccomend this book.</span>

                    <span>I've purchased over a dozen PS books over the last few years. This one is excellent, ranking up there with the Katrin Eismann and Dan Margulis books. Unlike the over-rated Scott Kelby stuff, Ben teaches you how to create beautiful things without resorting to clichés. He presents tons of great info in a very readable, concise way. As I go through it, I'm finding myself getting more done simply because I'm not wasting as much time through trial and error. Tools I use all the time, I now understand better. Tools I ingored before, I find myself relying on. I've had it a month and it's already becoming dog-eared. It's that good. <BR>Regarding the absense of Web content, at 720 pages, personally I'm glad it's gone. If this book was much larger and heavier, I'd have to think twice about throwing it in my backpack and I probably wouldn't have learned as much.</span>

                    <span>The author removed an important section from this, the CS edition, that was present in the previous books. <BR>Specifically, Mr. Willmore didn't include the Web chapter. To his credit he does state this in the intro section, citing the number of improvements to ImageReady (the web graphic creation part of Photoshop) is huge and that the associated chapter would dominate the book. He also said that web designers are not forgotten, that the book is still very web-friendly, he just didn't include a specific chapter or section that covered the web tools. <BR>Well, something must have happened between his writing of that and the actual printing of the book, because I can't find anything that deals with items such as animation, slices, GIF's, or even ImageReady itself. I do need to say that I haven't read the book cover to cover, and that just because there are no entries in the index for these items it doesn't mean they aren't discussed, somewhere, in the pages that I've not read (although if they are, then the book deserves another ding because the index is incomplete).<BR>What is covered is done very well and very completely. Mr. Willmore knows his subject, and it shows in the thourough way he discusses the program. He provides great primers on channels, masks, color correction, scanning, curves, levels<BR>layers, and other features. He takes the more complex tools and breaks them down in ways any user, no matter how much or little experience he or she may have, can understand and apply. Each chapter has a mini-glossary titled "Ben's Techno-Babble Decoder Ring", each entry further explaining terms introduced in the chapter in a no-nonsence manner. <BR>I will say this is an indespenseable book to go along with with the too-thin User Guide. I'm just disappointed that readers of the previous editions must now purchase yet another book if they want to learn about the web graphic features.</span>
