                <span id="Label1"><P> <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. <P> Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.  <P> <I>My Sister's Keeper</I> examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person.  Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in <I>My Sister's Keeper,</I> Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.</span>

                    <span>One cannot read this book and not wonder, "What would I do in this situation." And herein lies the book's greatness. Picoult is no stranger to off the beaten path topics (euthanasia, suicide, etc) but what she has created here, with MY SISTER'S KEEPER, is like no other work of hers, for simply by writing such a powerful story, she has allowed us to put ourselves in her place; to think about what we might do when dealing with illness. Do you shape the family and your life around this sickness, or do you try and control the direction your life, as well as the family member who is ill, will take? None of this is easy stuff, nor should it be. A word of warning: Don't read this book at night--you simply won't be able to get to sleep--there's just too much here in this jam packed page turner. And I don't mean page turner in the DA VINCI CODE or BARK OF THE DOGWOOD sense. No, this is a psychologically complex book that will cause you to think, probably more than you'd like to. It's my contention that when you look up "Food for Thought" in the dictionary, you'll see "See MY SISTER'S KEEPER." It's just that good.</span>

                    <span>Jodi Picoult has been my favorite author since I read "Plain Truth," shortly after it was first published. I've read everything she's written; she just has such a knack for gripping me around the heart and wringing it dry. Usually, however, I love the book, despite (or possibly because of) the emotional trip.<P>I have a way of reading her books, though--I read the first 50 pages or so to establish the plotline and the characters, and then I read the end. I do this to determine if I can read the middle. It's as though if I read the whole book, the characters become truly real. Sometimes, their pain is just too much, even though it's not happening to me and the characters are not, in fact, real. (This is a sign of a tremendous author). I couldn't read "The Pact" the whole way through for this reason. <P>I spent hours with "My Sister's Keeper" last night and I can't read this one either. There is just too much anguish. A rating of "3" for Jodi Picoult is light years ahead of a "3" most other authors. This book is amazing, without question. But it doesn't rate a "4" or a "5" unless I can read the whole book.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this thought-provoking book. In fact, I started it around 4 p.m. and finished it at 10 p.m. - (I made supper with one hand and one eye!!) <P>Picoult writes a very engaging story - one that could be true, in today's society. Because it could be (and probably is) a true story, I think this books would make a great book for a discussion group. Reading this book caused me to consider my own ethical and moral feelings about the subject of genetic engineering. <P>I was disappointed by the ending. Shocked, yes. And part of me was happy that there was a "good" ending to the story. But, mostly, I was disappointed that Picoult took the easy way out - the moral dilemma was solved. Life is not always like that. We often need to make moral decisions and I was disappointed that Picoult's characters didn't have to make THE decision or answer THE question that the book was based on. I would have preferred Picoult to have made her characters make a decision, so that I could have reacted to their choices.</span>

                    <span>If you loved The Lovely Bones -- pick this up immediately!<P>This is an emotionally wrenching yet uplifting story of a 13 y/o girl (Anna) who is conceived after her sister Kate is diagnosed with a deadly form of leukemia. <P>Anna is genetically designed to be a perfect match for her sister. She's born to be a donor, starting with stem cells from her umbilical cord. The family's life revolves around Kate's illness, leaving the oldest Jesse, to move into an apartment over the garage and live the life every teen dreams of - smoking, drinking and basically ignored by his parents.<P>The story begins when Anna sues her parents for medical emancipation as Kate is suffering from kidney failure and needs a transplant. Anna finds a lawyer, with plenty of issues of his own, to represent her. The Judge assigns her a "guardian ad litem, who will be Anna's advocate. The story is told in alternating chapters from each of the characters' point of view.<P>The range of emotions the various characters demonstrate from self-pity to terror to rage, from loneliness to fear to love are realistic and heartbreaking. The twist at the end will leave you breathless.<P>This book is going on my top 10 list. Absolutely wonderful. I've never read Jodi Picoult before, I'm going to try her back catalog immediately.</span>
