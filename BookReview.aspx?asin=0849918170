                    <span>I appreciate the reader above who said this book represents a mind at work, not a mind made up. It's quite obvious here that Campolo writes with that mindset. We shouldn't read Tony's work with the intention of dividing up what we agree and disagree with. We should read it more casually, keeping in mind that his opinions are based upon seeing and experiencing things most of us don't get the opportunity to. He's been around many of the world's cultures, met with foreign leaders, and has been arrested for protest. The guy is not a run of the mill, feel good evangelical. If that's what you're looking for, then look elsewhere.
<br />
<br />What saddens me is how people try and filter voices like Tony's through their own agenda. They criticize him for being heretical, when all he desires to do is share what's on his mind. Let us not tar and feather him if his views don't all fit within our cultural understanding of scripture. I will not agree with everything he says, but I will at least attempt to appreciate a man who is tired of the stagnancy that is endangering the growth and relevance of the church.
<br />
<br />This is a good book. Not great. I've enjoyed getting to peer into this man's mind a little, but don't expect to have your faith revolutionized. If nothing else, it stands as a small window into several of the issues in evangelicalism that deserve our attention.</span>

                    <span>According to Tony Campolo, in his book Speaking My Mind, he has several suggestions for Christians - the bottom line is 
<br />he believes we need to "redefine ourselves,"... "recast our opinions," and "entertain the possibility that we might be in error" about particular issues. He says we need to stop being so stubborn about these issues. What are those issues he speaks of? They are everything from mysticism to homosexuality and an array of other changes we need to make in our attitudes,       behaviors and ideas. With regard to mysticism (contemplative prayer)he believes, "mysticism provides some hope for common ground between Christianity and Islam." He asks and then later answers the question, "Could they (Islamic Sufis) have encountered the same God we do in our Christian mysticism?" While he appears to beat around the bush in answering this question, eventually he lets his readers know that his answer is yes! Sound like Thomas Merton? It should. Campolo emulates Merton,  Schuller and a host of other New Age mystical leaders all rolled into one. And as far as he is concerned, the real problem for the whole world lies with "rigid" Christians who believe in the possibility of Jesus' soon return. According to Campolo, they are to blame for wars, and a host of other evils in the world. I am reminded, as I read his book, of Alice Bailey and Barbara Marx Hubbard,whose clear and obvious hostility towards believers shouted out from the pages of their writings. The most alarming thing about this book is that Brian  McLaren's name is on the back cover, telling us the book is a "great bargain" and that Campolo's voice is one that "needs to be heard." Brian McLaren, named recently by Time magazine as one of 25 most influential evangelicals, is also considered the statesman and leader for the fast growing emerging church movement which is just a disguised Trojan horse for contemplative prayer with a close connection to Richard Foster, Rick Warren and other leaders who are promoting contemplative prayer.

                    <span>I appreciate Tony's voice as brave and needed now more than ever.  I appreciate the worship that this book is, worship of Christ not of country, politics, church or any other idol.  I believe that honesty is more important than dogmatism and that anything that conquers the fear of not conforming will bring life to the church.  
<br />
<br />Thank you Tony.  Great book.</span>

                    <span>Tony Campolo is unfuriating, combustable, outrageous, and once again on target. In Speaking My Mind he again tackles more hot potatoes of faith, this time with a less-sure and thus even more credible effect. Dogmatic, he ain't. 
<br />Oh, that the world knew the Jesus of whom Campolo writes so eloquently and honestly. I would take a small step out into the world of speculation to imagine God reading Tony Campolo and saying, "Man, this guy is confused but finally, somebody's coming close to getting it right."</span>

                    <span>Finally, with Tony Campolo we find a voice for Christians who do not feel comfortable with the way many evangelicals have blindly aligned themselves with the political right promoting war, militarism, materialism, patriotism and other "values," which are contrary to Christ's message. Campolo calls for repentence, revival and renewal in the evangelical Christian community.  This book provides hope for those Christians who feel outcast in their churches because they rely on the words of Jesus to guide them rather than a political party!  An answer to prayer! </span>
