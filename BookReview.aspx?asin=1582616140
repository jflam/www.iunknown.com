                <span id="Label1">There are probably as many stories from the Green Bay Packers sidelines as there are fans of one of the country's most storied sports franchises. That's what Tales from the Packers Sidelines is all about. Since the earliest days of professional football, the Packers have been as much a part of the game as the ball itself, from Curly Lambeau to Johnny "Blood" McNally; from Bart Starr to Ray Nitschke; from the Ice Bowl to Vince Lombardi to Mike Holmgren and Brett Favre. Some of the stories will feel as familiar and comfortable as tailgating at Lambeau Field on a gorgeous October morning. Others will be new to even the most avid Packers fan. But, hopefully, all will bring back special memories and reveal a part of what makes the Green Bay Packers more than just a football team. This is a franchise that has grown up with the country, and everyone has a favorite Packers story. From odd pre-game rituals to controversial coaching decisions to strange players to the details behind what made a great game a truly great game, the stories are there to be told and Tales from the Packers Sidelines does just that.</span>

                    <span>Any true Packer fan, critic or historian would know that it was Barry Sanders (#3 overall) that the Packers chose Mandarich over in '89, but that doesn't change the story. It just serves more as a speedbump. Great book with lots of insight.</span>

                    <span>This book would have been granted a much higher rating if not for the errors, and this book has plenty of them. <BR>Many of the errors are numbers-related and don't have a significant impact on the particular story (the Packers started playing in Milwaukee in 1933, not 1932 as stated in the story 'Good Times and Bad Times'), or a draft position (Ezra Johnson was a first-round pick, not a second according to the story 'Ezra'). But some of the errors do significantly alter the story: In 'Terrible Tony' the story implies that the Packers were "obsessive" about drafting Tony Mandarich rather than "taking a flier" on Troy Aikman. Aikman was the first pick in the draft, selected by Dallas, before the Packers ever had a chance. He was not bypassed by the Packers, and any team that was in the Packer's position (second pick in the draft) probably would have taken Mandarich, too.<BR>Along with the errors are inconsistencies: According to 'The Man in Charge,' "Bob Harlan announces in 1995 that the Packers would no longer play in Milwaukee," while 'An Era Ends' correctly states that 1994 was the last year. Harlan made the announcement in 1994, before the regular season had ended. <BR>The short stories, nonetheless, are entertaining, and Packer fans - even the most knowledgeable - are sure to have their memories jarred about a long-forgotten item or two about their beloved team. But that same knowledgeable fan - and there are many - is sure to be distracted by the many mistakes that plague this book. Yes, the book is entertaining, but you certainly wouldn't use it for reference.</span>
