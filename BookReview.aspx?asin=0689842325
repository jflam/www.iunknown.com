                <span id="Label1"><P><BR> <I><B>"Are you willing to do anything to help your slimy pledge brothers become Distinguished Gentlemen?" Sharp demanded. <P> "Anything, sir," Jericho said. He just wanted it to be over. <P> "Then suck my big toe." <P> "Sir?" Jericho wasn't sure if he had heard correctly....</B></I> <P><BR> When Jericho is invited to pledge for the Warriors of Distinction, he thinks his life can't get any better. As the most exclusive club in school, the Warriors give the best parties, go out with the hottest girls, and sail through their classes. And when Arielle, one of the finest girls in his class, starts coming on to him once the pledge announcements are made, Jericho is determined to do anything to become a member.... <P> But as the initiation week becomes progressively harrowing, Jericho is forced to make choices he's not entirely comfortable with. And one member seems to have it in for the sole female pledge in the group...a pledge who will stop at nothing to show she can handle the pressure. But when is she being pushed too far, and when should Jericho and his friends step in and risk losing their places in the pledging process? As Jericho becomes increasingly uneasy, his cousin Joshua breezes through the initiation, never thinking of the consequences, even when the fine line between fun and games, and life and death is crossed. <P> Sharon M. Draper proves once again that she knows just how real kids think, act, and feel in this haunting story of peer pressure, popularity, and hazing.</span>

                    <span>Winner of a Coretta Scott King Honor Award<P>Jericho's school has a great club that all boys long to be a part of: The Warriors of Distinction. It's been around for years (Jericho's uncle was even a part of it), and it's known for it's good deeds and the closeness of the members. Every year new members are inducted into the group, and this year Jericho has been invited to join. Before they can be called Warriors, though, they must go through an initiation process, which lasts a week. At first the tasks seem harmless and only a little demeaning, but as the week progresses, the things the initiates (called Pledge Slime) are asked to do border on hazing. Jericho struggles with staying in the group--if he drops out, then all the initiates suffer. He also would lose the girl he loves, and any confidence the group would provide for him. But he does wonder about lowering himself for this, and he also has a conflict with a musical contest--should he continue with the initiation or go to the contest, where he could win a full scholarship to Julliard?<P>This book is gripping, and the reader finds himself/herself caught up in all the action, wondering where the plot will go. Draper skillfully takes twists and turns, carefully developing the tension to keep interest high. Her characters are likeable, and readers will sympathize with Jericho. I also liked that though the main characters in the story are African American, you weren't blinded by their race--it could have been anyone wanting to join the Warriors. And the topic of school clubs and hazing is a good angle for a novel--pair this with The Chocolate War.<P>Where this book fell flat for me was in dialogue and underdeveloped plot threads. Draper wasn't consistent with her dialects and slang, and much of the language felt forced out of the characters. A major plot line that I felt got shoved under the carpet was Jericho's trumpet playing--it was a very big deal at the beginning of the book, but I didn't feel the tension by the end, when he needed to make the decision about continuing with the Warriors or going to the contest. Another plot line that felt stunted and stereotypical was Kofi's (another Pledge Slime) home life. Here is the typical teen character who's parents don't care, but Kofi felt a little forced on the issue, and that whole situation worked out a little too neatly in the end.<P>Overall it's a fast read (because you really want to know what happens), and a good topic, but it's not the best written book I've encountered.</span>
