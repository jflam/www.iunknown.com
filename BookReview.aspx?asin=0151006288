                <span id="Label1"><I>October Men</I> reads like a night spent in the dugout with a veteran manager during a lopsided game. Roger Kahn sits beside you occasionally narrating the events of each inning as it unfolds while frequently digressing into anecdotes from his lifetime as a baseball writer. The digressions--everything from Yankees's VP Al Rosen's connections to the Las Vegas boxing scene to a brief history of the 1903 New York Highlanders (the "Pleistocene Yankees")--are all interesting, but one frequently loses track of the main reason for being there.<p>  In this case, the main story is the tumultuous 1978 Yankees's season. What makes this particular season an interesting subject for a book is that it is not the story of a group of young heroes who rallied together to make a team that was somehow larger than its parts. Rather, the 1978 Yankees was a team patched together with aging stars (Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage, Catfish Hunter) from other teams, held fast by George Steinbrenner's money, and piloted by the tempestuous Billy Martin. This was a team expected to win a world championship. The story Kahn tries to tell is how this boatload of talent nearly ran aground because of bickering, paranoia, and racism.  <p>  Kahn's breadth of knowledge is impressive, and the many insider tales he relates are entertaining; but <I>October Men</I> does not flow effortlessly as a narrative of the 1978 team. If one can excuse the digressions and occasional disjointed transitions, though, there is much pleasure to be had from this prime spectator's seat. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>Roger Kahn writes a book about the 1976-1978 Yankee Baseball seasons. The book is  a mixture of parallel biographies of Billy Martin,George Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson. Kanj gives a good primer and sets up te story well. For the  non New York baseball fan he explains well the Brooklyn Dodger, New York Giant legacy and shows the New York Yankee rivarly with them.
<br />
<br />The book might have been better of the entire focus was on the dyanmics of Billy, George and Reggie. Those characters had everything and reflected the currents of the 1970's. There was racism,big business, high salaries,large ego's .Instead Kahn detracts from the bio anf=gle by digressing about New York Giant managers of 1905 !
<br />
<br />Kahn does not appear to be a Yankee fan at least in terms of his writing . He gives an objective look of the Yankees. In terms of dealing with the Red Sox swoon this book was written before last years' Yankee debacle . Kanh does not mercifully (and luckily in view of last years result) beat up the Red Sox. Kahn is  a bit of a Billy basher and he does not mention once the Howie Spira -Dave Winfield scandal at all.This led to george's expulsion but Kahn does not find the room to mention this fact. In fact he praises the modern George Steinbreener.
<br />
<br />kahn appears to be the most objective about Reggie . He praises the feats but shows the ego of the man. If you are a baseball fan you will probably enjoy this book. If you are a Met fan you should read this book.But if you are a Billy Martin guy you may think the writing is somewhat biased.
<br />
<br />Since 25 years have past this reviewer wished Kahn was a little more objective about Billy Martin and George.</span>

                    <span>Yes, Kahn gets off topic; yes, it takes neraly 200 pages to get to the 1978 New York Yankees; and yes, the final 150 pages of the book are peppered with Kahn's customary "Look who I knew..." But, altogether, I found this book quite a page turner and surprisingly quick read. As promised, Martin, Steinbrenner and Jackson provide fireworks throughout the text, but so do, for example, the pitching trio of Sparky, Goose and Catfish. There are fact errors (like Kahn's 'Doc Ellis' and 'Dock Ellis'), and the author does interject with his own boasting a bit too often, but I found it read similar to Jeff Pearlman's "The Bad Guys Won" - the story of the '86 Mets, which is perhaps THE MOST underrated baseball book in print.</span>

                    <span>The book itself is a great read but the problem is this topic was already done better in Sparky Lyle's Bronx Zoo and Graig Nettles' Balls (one of the most underrated baseball books ever). Plus from the subtitle I thought it would only be about that crazy 1978 season but it takes 190 pages to get the reader there. 
<br />
<br />Was the stuff on the origins of the Yankees really necessary to get to 1978? 
<br />
<br />I did like the profiles of George (learned he's into poetry...who knew?), Billy Martin (came from a broken home...now there's a surprise...NOT!) and Reggie Jackson (never remarried after his divorce).
<br />
<br />Anyway, somehow given the fact that two excellent books on the '70s NYY came out around the same time, I don't get why a third is necessary over 25 years later. Personally, I'm now more interested in that Buster Olney book on the Torre dynasty Yankees and what made them tick. </span>

                    <span>I've read a lot of Roger Kahn, but by no means all of his work.  However, when some wag columnist on ESPN.com rated this book a "0" last year, I knew I would have to step up and defend it.  The "0" rating didn't seem to be so much a reflection on the quality of the book, but rather a shot across the bow at an older style of baseball writing.  Well, I've read the new postscript to Michael Lewis' "Moneyball".  What is the man so annoyed about?  He wrote the bestselling baseball book of 2003, and he spends 20 pages in the new edition sniping at (and naming) his critics.  When that's on the menu, let me read the dinosaur instead.<p>That said, "October Men" is not a "10" either.  The back cover blurb promises "the first in-depth look" at the '78 Yankees.  Let's amend that to "the tenth in-depth look".  A lot has been written about the Steinbrenner/Martin Yankees -- Kahn even lists all the other books, and rates them.  Most of the anecdotes in "October Men" have been told before.<p>Still, the whole book manages to be rather charming.  Kahn spends the first few chapters describing his favorite baseball moments going back to 1903.  He writes a lot about the early years of the key players in the saga (Martin, Steinbrenner, Jackson), and spends a few chapters on the 1977 Yankees as well.  Editorially, this book could have been tighter.  Kahn twice refers to the same W.P. Kinsella story, twice describes Lou Piniella as "the best slow outfielder in baseball", and twice has Yankees VP Al Rosen scowling at Roy Cohn on October 2, 1978.  He also can't decide whether that date was Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.<p>Kahn's writing style manages to be persuasive.  Unlike the newer breed of baseball writers, he is more apt to drop literary allusions and verses from poetry.  No surprise; Kahn's mother was an English teacher -- in fact, was my father's English teacher -- so all this is familiar.  It's not enough for Kahn to say that the media is the Fourth Estate; he gives us the origin of the line, too.  He also expounds on what it means to "cross the Rubicon", thus making Julius Caesar, for the first time ever, a central player in a baseball narrative.  In the end, Kahn's goal is to transform what's now known as "The Bucky Dent Game" into a sweeping look at all of the currents in 1978 leading to that moment.<p>The problem is, Kahn has done better before.  His reconstruction of the 1920s for his Jack Dempsey biography (speaking of which, Dempsey is referred to about eleven times in "October Men") gives an overview of everything else about the 1920s, as if he was there.  He's less concerned with talking about the "real" 1978, apart from a few stray Jimmy Carter references.  This is not the paean to Ronald Reagan that was "Miracle", infusing a year (1980) with political overtones that weren't recognized at the time.  Nor is this a sociological portrait of the end of an era, as was Michael Shapiro's "The Last Good Season" about Brooklyn in 1956.  This is just a look at what it was like to read New York City newspapers in 1978.  Kahn even takes his own Michael Lewis-style potshots at the other writers of the day, including the villainous Dick Young, and makes himself a central player in a few key scenes in the book (as a confidante of Jackson, Martin, and Al Rosen).<p>Bottom line: can you learn more about the '78 Yankees from this book than you can from watching the Bucky Dent game on ESPN Classic or the YES Network?  Yes, you can (although you should watch the game, too).  Is "October Men" the kind of book that will no longer be written in ten years time?  Yes, it is.  Is it worth reading now?  Yes, it is.</span>

                    <span>Your ability to enjoy "October Men," Roger Kahn's look at the miraculous finish of the New York Yankees in 1978, will be dependent mainly on how much you enjoy digressions (and parenthetical comments).  Those who expect a chronological look at what happened during the 1978 season will not really find it until chapter nine, because the first half of this book is devoted to setting the stage for what happened that year.  Kahn is inspired to touch upon a wide range of topics to bring us to the pivotal moment in the history of the universe when Buck Dent hit a baseball into the netting atop the Green Monster in Fenway Park.  Where was I at that moment?  Driving down Coors Road on my way to a late afternoon class at the University of New Mexico, screaming "Bucky!  Bucky!  Bucky!" while pounding on the dashboard (but I, too, digress).<p>Once I finished this book I went back and reconsidered its structure.  Kahn's prologue sets up the idea that the Yankee championship teams of 1977 and 1978 were the greatest number of clashing egos on a single ball club in baseball history, and sets up Bobby Thomson's famous 1951 homerun that gave the New York Giants the pennant over the Brooklyn Dodgers as the moment and season against which the 1978 season would be judged.  Kahn actually has a thesis for this book, which is that: "Remarkably and uniquely, 1978 comes down to us as the year in which Yankee news management failed completely, and a very rugged Yankee baseball team did not" (17).  Keep that in mind and you will understand why he talks as much about Al Rosen as he does Ron Guidry.<p>The first eight chapters of "October Men" sets the stage for the season, with the first chapter specifically focusing on what was happening the day of the playoff game before the first pitch.  The second chapter talks about the "New York Red Sox" to show how the sale of Babe Ruth and other deals created a link between the Yankees and Boston in not only the 1920s but throughout the rest of the century.  Kahn then devotes chapters to "Steinbrenner Unbound," Catfish Hunter and free agency, Billy Martin as "The Dark Prince," Reggie Jackson, and the Yankee team that won the 1977 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Reggie hitting three home runs on three swings against three different pitchers in the final game at Yankee Stadium.<p>The rest of the book is devoted to the 1978 season, beginning with the bickering in spring training.  This part is also divided in half, first building to the firing of Billy Martin, and then detailing how the Yankees came from ten-and-a-half games behind the Red Sox (on July 25 when Bob Lemon took over as manager) to force a playoff and make Bucky Dent's middle name a curse word throughout New England.  However, throughout the book Kahn writes about a lot of other topics, such as female reporters in the lockeroom, Jimmy Carter's decision not to authorize the construction of American neutron bombs, and having to memorize the Latin phrase "Alea iacta est" ("the die is cast") when he was a schoolboy.<p>I am not sure if Kahn is correct in his assessment that by rising above their turmoil the 1978 Yankees became an inspiration for the country, but he certainly chronicles that turmoil.  Ultimately Kahn talks much more about what happened off the playing field, where alcoholism, broken homes, and racism all came into play.  Repeatedly he tries to explain the enigma that was Billy Martin, and in comparison turns Al Rosen into something of a baseball saint  Throughout the book there are lots of interesting baseball stories (e.g., Joe DiMaggio's thoughts on Jackie Robinson, Joe Gordon decking a fan for anti-Semetic remarks) and a fair share of insights into the game (e.g., if you take into account all the times they swing and miss or hit a foul ball, a great hitter actually succeeds less than 10% of the time).  I enjoyed "October Men" because I do not mind being all over the place to tell a story (I have a weakness for parenthetical commentary myself), but I understand Kahn's writing style will drive some to distraction.  The chief attraction here will be for Yankee fans who, inspired by Aaron "bleeping" Boone's series clinching homerun last Fall, will want to take a walk down this particular memory lane.</span>
