                    <span>Now that Donald Rumsfeld has admitted that he has never seen any strong evidence linking Saddam Hussein with Al Qa'ida, perhaps Midge Decter will acknowledge that it was always a lie. If there was never a link, did Rumsfeld tell Bush that there was? Then he was lying to the President, and lying the USA into an unnecessary war. Did he tell Bush that here was no such link? If he did, why did Bush say that there was, and take the USA into a war with no basis? 
<br />Anyway, why would a secular ruler like Saddam trust Al Qa'ida, who see him as a traitor to Islam? Why would Saddam risk everything, to give WMD (which he hadn't got) to his mortal enemies? Al Qa'ida attacked the USA; Saddam never did. So the right US response was to counter-attack against Al Qa'ida. They should have put ground troops into the areas of Afghanistan where bin Laden and his cronies were hiding, surrounded them and killed them. Instead of which, fool Bush attacked Iraq, where bin Laden wasn't! Doh. All the warmongering lies are now unravelling, and ordinary GIs and the Iraqi people are paying the price. Faith-based policies never work.

                    <span>It is so neat that all the grate presadents like Nixon, Ford and Bush had someone like Rumsfield to work for them, I have always herd that Princeton is a grate collage and that is where this man went to collage! Just like Bush who went to harvard they are both smart and they know what they are doing. Especially in a war like we have know that is what we need. Kerry says he was in the viet-nam war. BIG DEAL! who cares, he did'nt go to Harvard like Bush I bet. I am a REPUBLICAN and I was'nt in the army and none of my friends were either. It makes me so mad when they say that George Bush, DICK Chainey, Paul Wolfowits, John Ashkroff, and Carl Rove were all draftdodgers, just becuase they didn't go to viet-nam like everyone else did does'nt make them draft dodgers: I wood'nt go neither, why wood you if you could get out from it! Who ever said you had to be in the war to be a grate man anyway. Chainey pobally had a bad hart anyway so that is probalay why he culd'nt go and I herd Bush was a pilot or something and was a pow in Korea. Another thing I do'nt like is how they always show that picture of Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddom Husane! He was problay just their to tell him to stop starting wars and stuff. Tha'ts what I think because that is what they said on Rush Limball and on Handity and Holmes!!! Reed this book and it will make you change your mind if you don't like him if you do it won't and will only make it more but that do'nt matter anyway as long as you stay the same way, so it's good forevryone to reed. I reed it to my little nefew ever chanse I git. It is well worth the price of .40 sents you can by it for so you shuld! Lisen to me becalls I know who-ever thougt a man that is only 5 foot 5 could go so far.</span>

                    <span>Now that Rumsfeld's perceived integrity and reputation is in the toliet, with litte chance of ever being rescued, this fawning book is pretty much irrelevant. I didn't think this book was terribly written, but now that Rumsfeld will go down as one of the worst Secretaries of Defense in this country's history, not very balanced.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I understand this book is not an attempt to have an in-depth accounting and objective historical analysis on Rumsfeld. What it is, and it does a good job, is this book provides a somewhat personal narrative about Rumsfelds life (and brief, it is a quick read). There were many things I did not know about his life or upbringing, and this book fills in many of the blanks. For example, I did not know his father enlisted in the navy at age 38 to go fight WWII, and I did not know he came from modest means. He made lots of money in the pharmaceutical buisness, and he appears to be very loyal to whomever he serves.<p>Having said all that, those who wan some historical record would probably want more than what this book offers. But it does its job well. If you wanted to know the good things about Rumsfeld, they are in this book. If you want to know the dirt you might want to look elsewhere.<p>I conclude in saying this book made me view him as more of a human being. I have been quick to scrutinize much of what he has done under Bush, but after this read I think perhaps I have been too critical. It is a shame politics is so extremely venomous. Books like this could go a long way in restoring some faith, no.. not faith, but an understanding the other person is human just like we are.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Let me start by saying I certainly am no fan of Rumsfeld or his policies. Still, I wanted to read something about him that would give me a better understanding of who he is, what drives him and what events shaped his life.<br>Unfortunately, this book offered none of the above. From the first chapter it becomes abundantely clear that the author is a starry-eyed sycophant. Sure, it's an intimate portrait, one no doubt that's supposed to be flattering to the subject. I knew that going into it. But there is not even an attempt at objectivity anywhere in the book, and the ending about his endearing quality being "masculinity" is truly horrendous. Any controversy or criticism Rumsfeld experienced is glossed over, refuted or chalked up as some kind of liberal smear campaign. He receives credit for planning the Iraq war, yet when the author grudgingly acknowledges that the aftermath has not gone as planned, she says it's something "certain policymakers" never predicted. Uh, hello, the key "policymaker" was Rumsfeld, yet she never comes out and associates his name with underestimating the aftermath.<p>Also, the book is poorly sourced, relying on a smattering of quotes from Rumsfeld and an occasional colleague. But there are ample citations of material that ran in other publications or on TV.<br>Sorry the review is so harsh, but I'm just not sure what audience this book is trying to reach. Venturing a guess, I'd say the same pre-teen girls who read Tiger Beat.</span>
