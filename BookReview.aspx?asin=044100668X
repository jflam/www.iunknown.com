                    <span>I got this book by a suggestion from a friend. It was great. It is a story of a boy that is washed upon the shore of wales with his mother, a mysteriously beartiful woman calling herself Branwen. The boy has lost his memory, this sounds kinda overated right, wrong. From here it gets intresting. Emyers, as Branwen calls him,doesn't fit in with the other boys. One boy in particular causes a lot of trouble for Emyers, this also sounds kina borrin. However things turn for the worst, Emyers begins to grow into his powers. Thats sounds cool, a kid with supernatural powers. However Emyers powers are weilded in hate and anger, causing his magic to go horribly wrong. He ends up being blinded and Branwen takes him to live with some nuns. This suits Branwen fine but it doesn't bode to well with Emyers. The two have a fight and Emyers discovers his second sight, allowing him to see. Soon he can see well enough to get around he decides to leave, vowing never to use his powers again. Branwen gives him the Galator, a really important artifact and sends him on his way. He gets on a tiny raft he made himself and heads out to sea. He lands on Fincarya, a place between the land a sky. There he meets a Merlyn, a type of hawk, and a girl who lives in Druma Woods. The pair find a lot of Trouble (it being from two sources: the bird, named Trouble, and the blight that is killing Fincarya. The trio of friends then go on a quest, eventually defeating Rhit Gawar (i think i spelled that right) the bad guy.
<br />The story has a lot of suprise endings inculding Merlin's (he calls himself that in honor of Trouble who dies) decision to use his powers again, finding that when weilded with love and compassion his abilites can be better used. But the story isn't over, the land still needs to be healed from the blight that kills the land. New secets await our young hero in The Seven Songs of Merlin.</span>

                    <span>If you like action and magic books, this is the book for you. The excitment is almost unbearable. Its the first book in the five book series. This story is about young Merlin going on a quest looking for his real mother and his destiny. It is the best book I ever read. Ever since he washed up on the shore of Elwen with a strange woman, that specializes in the art of healing,and claims to be his mother. But ever since he lost his sight in a tragic fire,that he started,he gave up hope untill he is gifted with a second chance at sight. He ends up going on a raft out to the sea and washes up on the even stranger island of Finycara where all hhis troubles begin. What are these troubles?Thats for you to find out.

                    <span>     In The Lost years of Merlin, a boy suddenly washes up on the shore. He awakes, not being able, his name, his paresnts, his childhood, anything. As the years go on, the boy is raised by a woman who calls herself Branwen. She also says that she is his mother and that his name is Emrys. He is always struggling to find out his real life, and his purpose. Emrys is also frequently bullied by some children that think he and his mother are evil. eventually, They move to a distant land, and Emrys soon starts his adventure, even though his body bestows many hindering disabilities.
<br />     Emrys makes some new companions, Trouble, a hawk, Rhia, a girl of the forset Drummawood, and Shim, a giant who is actually very small. Together, the four of them strive to protect the isle of Fincayra. In the end, the party reaches a great castle in the sky. here is where Emrys learns the horrible truth about his past, the one that he had been searching for.
<br />     I really hope you read this book; it is a magnificent piece of writing that can introduce a whole new meaning of magic and fantasy to any reader. I really think that the book, The Lost Years of Merlin, is appropriate for all ages, but I would highly recomend it for adults and adolescents. People of younger ages might get bored a little to easy with the plot, while older people can truely enjoy a well written piece of literature. I really enjoyed the book; it was truely inspiring and very interesting. Although the plot is a little slow at first, towards the middle of the story, it gets very fast-paced and becomes very deep. I hope that you will enjoy this book, as well as the rest of the series as much as I do.</span>

                    <span>I found this book at a Barnes & Noble bookstore while looking for another. After reading the book description, I did not hesitate to buy it. I read it in a few hours and could not put it down (I did try seeing how I started reading at midnight) at daylight I finally went to sleep and dreamt I was adventuring with Emrys(Merlin), Trouble, Shim and Rhia. (great fun indeed!!)a few days later I picked up the rest of the books and loved them all, every last page was filled with magic and a feeling of good fun. The books are well written, and will capture the readers attention, even the slow parts are exciting because you are just dying to know what will happen next. I recommend these books over Harry Potter any day of the week. Do yourself a favor and read these books.</span>
