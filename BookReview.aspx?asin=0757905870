                    <span>Everything about 2Pac is good.  He was and is the best rapper and always will be and at least he didn't go out like a punk, if he even went out at all because it's real funny that after he supposedly got killed, by fat biggy's people, his next album came out and the first thing it said was "ya'll can't kill me."
<br />
<br />Elvis ain't dead either.  If you don't like it then stay away from everything 2 Pac.</span>
