                    <span>As a longtime fan of the fantastic Newton visual universe, I finally got to read this much awaited autobiography while on vacation under the unforgiving tropic sun....much like his favorite light. Unfortunately, the book left me wanting much, much more than mr. Newton chose to share. The first half or so of the Newton tale is rich in detail and held my imagination captive ( I almost forgot all about his life as a photographer). Newton's pre-vogue life was truly fascinating , filled with twists and turns, fate and chance , portrayed with great passion and humor...a juicy read indeed. <BR>However, once he starts to produce work that helps define his genius, the book became very dull and lifeless. mr. Newton rushes through a very short list of moments to highlight the vogue universe that he ruled in the seventies. I was hoping to get much more insight about the great designers (YSL, mugler,valentino, versace , chanel) , models (jerry hall, lisa taylor, vibeke, iman, the entire crew of exotic -YSL-vamps), editors (polly mellon, leon tally) and art directors that participated in 'creating' Helmut Newton. Many key names were glaringly missing (one can only imagine the reasons),after all, he is the man who brought images of glamourized death to the polished pages of vogue. ....and so the mystery continues.</span>

                    <span>I've been a fan of Helmut Newton since I was about 13 when, Woody Allenish, I miraculously happened upon his pictures of women. Unfortunately this book captures none of the excitement those pictures generate. He tells of growing up in Nazi Germany, his escape to China and his move to Australia. He also shares many (and there are many to share) of his sexual exploits. The problem I had, is if you take the pictures out of the book, it could almost be about anybody with an overactive libido (or imagination). All-in-all it is a gossipy read and amusing at that level but with very little to indicate what makes Newton's photographs some of the most recognizable around. If you're thinking about this book because you know his work, consider one of the books containing his photographs instead.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading the author's recollections, even though sometimes I wondered if they were wishful thinking (find it hard to believe that a 21 year old woman would be interested in a 14 year old boy - re: the bus story).<P>The only annoying part was having to constantly switch to the back of the book to read the photo illustrations.</span>

                    <span>There are probably very few human beings who live life, as Tennyson would say, to the lees and on their own terms. If we are to believe him in this very readable autobiography, Helmut Newton is one of them. He has always listened to his own drummer and has walked away from assignments that lesser individuals would have been afraid to leave. A lover of both beautiful women and fast cars, he names names although he does say that some of the names have been changed to protect people's privacy. <P>I'm a great admirer of Mr. Newton so I read this chatty memoir with relish. Born in Berlin of Jewish parents, he has lived in and travelled to many places in his career as a fashion photographer. Although obviously a perfectionist when it comes to his art, Mr. Newton doesn't appear to take himself too seriously, a great attribute for one so talented as he.<P>Mr. Newton's life has not always been fun and games, however. He understands the horrors of Nazi Germany from first-hand experience and spent time during World War II in an internment camp for Nazis in Australia because he was a German. Never mind that he was a despised Jew and hated Hitler as much as the Allies did.<P>The last third of the book is entitled "Part II: The Photographs." Here Newton shows and discusses many of his now easily recognizable images. There is no particular order to this section. There is one photograph that he calls "pornographic", in case you are interested. And we learn that he hates the PR people who surround famous actresses. I doubt that anyone would be suprised to learn that tidbit.<P>If you are looking for a good collection of Newton's work, you should buy any of the books that are collections of his fine photographs printed on high quality paper. (I own his book of portraits, one of my favorite photography books.) The paper here is so-so, and the photographs are not identified on the pages where they are reproduced. While this is customary in fine art books, at least the many photographs from Newton's own life that accompany the text should be captioned. I understand that this is probably the fault of the publisher and not Newton's, however.<P>If you are a fan of this great photographer, as I am, you will enjoy this book thoroughly.</span>
