<br />I sometimes wonder whether my history teachers were bad or I was too unengaged to listen to them.  Of course I knew of Roosevelt's involvement with the Panama Canal, and his role in preserving land out west, and vaguely remembered some things about anti-trust laws, but it wasn't until a few years ago that I re-discovered him through quotes that appeared in business books, women's rights discussions and international press.  I've read (and listened to) several books about TR now, and this is the best.  It is literally his years as President, from the day McKinley was assassinated to the day he left office.  TR's intellect and the way in which he yielded power are well portrayed in this book.  He used some advisors intensely while shoving others away.  The word "dynamic" may have been coined for TR.  I suspect that anyone who said "well, that's never been done before" to him was thrown out of his office....TR was nothing if not creative (probably too much so in terms of the Panama Canal - was it really worth overthrowing a country to get that land?)
<br />This book is engaging and rapidly paced.  It's also a very interesting snapshot of life 100 years ago.  I was surprised to learn how few days Congress was in session, for example, and of the time TR spent in a wheelchair. Also, I never knew of his connections with George Washington Carver, nor how much trouble TR got into by simply inviting the man to dinner.  I also developed a greater appreciation of the hold the business magnates of steel and rail had over the country.  The description of the coal strike and its resolution are worth the price of the book, but it's TR who holds the story together, and TR who will stay in your memory.</span>

                    <span>I sat through what seemed like an eternity in 10th grade history listening about everything that had to do with "TR".  Of course, it was boring as heck and I didn't learn a thing.
<br />
<br />Then, I saw this book and it peaked my interest.  I must say that this book is not boring in the least.  If offers remarkable detail and clarity about the great Teddy Roosevelt and his time in the oval office.</span>

                    <span>Theodore finally got his biographer in this book. I can not recommend this book highly enough! TR Is a very complex and heroic subject that comes forth clear as a bell. I just wish that he was around now as we need him and his type more than ever! AN OUTSTANDING JOB!</span>

                    <span>Not much to add to the landslide of previous reviews. I loved this book, as well as its companion on TR's early years. 
<br />
<br />As I was a bit puzzled by some of the previous negative reviews, I looked at those separately, and would note that many of them refer to the audio version.  Perhaps this is a book that works better on the page, than read aloud.
<br />
<br />In any case, the episodes in TR's life have become almost legendary. Morris tells the stories in a lively way, with a constant forward momentum, unslowed by his ready eye for sympathetic personal anecdotes.  Contrary to a few previous reviews, I did not find the book overly long, much less dull.  
<br />
<br />Reading these books alongside TR's Autobiography worked well for me. It helps that the books are copiously referenced. 
<br />
<br />I can't resist the urge to write "Bully" and "Deee-lighted" here myself!  I eagerly await the third volume.  </span>

                    <span>It is difficult to imagine how different the world would be now if not for Theodore Roosevelt.  He was driven by a moral certitude which may have disappeared forever from the American political landscape, and he changed the country and the world for the better.  When concensus proved impossible, he forced his will through, reforming the essense of Americanism.  See the last two pages for Edmund Morris's lengthy catalog of the achievements of Roosevelt's administration, and try to imagine how he achieved them, mostly in the face of implacable opposition.  Morris's book is scholarly, yet accessible, and every one of it's 555 pages of text is entertaining.  For instance, in the course of this history book, you will learn how the Teddy Bear came to be named.  This story of eight years in the making of America will make you proud.</span>
