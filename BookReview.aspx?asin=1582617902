                    <span>This is a great book with good info on every game with some of the best pics I have seen of the season. Good for any Patriots fan. And anybody who has dissed this book on here, if you don't like the Patriots or the best QB in the league right now (for the people who don't know I mean Tom Brady), don't say anything about the book. It has nothing to do with you. And the Rams... well they didn't beat the Panthers.</span>

                    <span>Good read - awesome team! The Pats won two of the greatest Super Bowls in recent history. Because some reviewers are sore losers, they are dis-ing the book, as well as the team. My advice to them is to relax and enjoy the ride - this Patriots team is for real and will be back in it this year! How many other teams in the history of the NFL can say they went 15-0? Note to Amazon - please crack down on these reviews by illiterate meatheads who have such a limited vocabulary they probably never read the book.</span>

                    <span>Personally, I can't stand the writing in the Globe and SI Patriots special edition books. Fortunately, this is an excellent book, I only wish that it wasn't bound, because the pictures are awesome. There is MUCH more content both visual and editorial in the Herald's book than any of the competition and no ads! Go figure! SI is such a rip-off, they come out with their bound version of their Patriots special filled with ads, I mean they actually doctor superbowl pictures to show the players throwing soda cans instead of footballs for touchdowns. Buy the Herald version, it's the only one with any integrity.</span>
