                    <span>A wonderful, specific book, that we consulted on an almost hourly basis on a recent trip to Belize. Great for both the Novice (it was my first trip) and for the experienced Belize traveller (my archaelogist friend/travel companion has dug there yearly for eight summers.) Includes chapters on nearby Tikal in Guatemala.<P>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>While planning a recent trip to Belize, I was looking for an informative guide book dealing with all aspects of vacationing there (lodging, dining, sightseeing). I came across the Belize Handbook in my local bookstore and was very pleased with what I had found. The book covers all of Belize, not just the heavily travelled 'touristy' areas (if there is such a thing). The information given was easy to find, well written and correct! Three out of three is not bad. If you are planning a trip to Belize you can't go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>Moon Handbooks Belize was the first and best guidebook to Belize for many years. The current edition is a bit out of date, but I just found out that Moon will be releasing a newly updated, rewritten, and re-organized edition of their Belize book this fall that will be right back on top. Moon Handbooks are the most thorough, thoughtful, and intelligent guidebooks out there, for Belize and beyond.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the worst guide book I have ever owned, and I own a lot of guide books. I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better. If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business. It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it. The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years). Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook.</span>

                    <span>This handbook was concise and informative. I especially used the 2 maps of San Pedro, Ambergris Caye. I couldn't have found my way around without it--especially since there were limited signs and directions in San Pedro.<P>I also found the recommendations helpful for restaurants and sites. I was the only one in my group with a book and everyone relied on me for the maps and information.<P>Overall, the size of the book fit nicely in my purse. I've carried it with me on 3 trips to Belize and my trips were better because of it!</span>
