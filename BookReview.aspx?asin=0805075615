                <span id="Label1">The advent of embedded reporters in the opening days of the 2003 US war on Iraq meant a more direct and personal point of view than battlefield coverage has historically offered. Rick Atkinson, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for <I>An Army at Dawn</I>, an account of combat in North Africa during World War II, traveled with the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from its deployment out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky through its entry into Baghdad. The result, <I>In the Company of Soldiers</I>, is a thoroughly engrossing look at the strategies, personalities, and struggles of waging modern warfare. Much of Atkinson's focus falls on the division's leader, the hugely competitive and charismatic Major General David Petraeus, who seems to guide his troops through Iraq by sheer force of will. Atkinson devotes most of his time to the senior commanders, but the loss of the G.I. perspective, while disappointing, is outweighed by Atkinson's access to the minds of the brass who must navigate an Iraq whose citizens were not nearly as happy as military planners had hoped and who offered resistance in ways other than what the Americans had prepared for. While plenty has been written about the American military effort in Iraq, Atkinson's perspective, combined with a direct, economical writing style, allows him to present sides to the war not often seen or considered: long periods of waiting punctuated with mad scrambles to apply gas masks, fretting over how to pack all necessary supplies into tiny kits, dealing with dust storms that can ground state of the art attack helicopters, and reading the irreverent yet shrewdly observant graffiti left by American soldiers. <I>In the Company of Soldiers</I> lionizes the American military officers but it neither condemns nor offers unqualified praise to the US effort in Iraq. Indeed, the disturbing omens of chaos hinted at soon after the invasion began in the spring of 2003 would come into sharper relief when the book was published a year later. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>The title of the book fooled me, instead of the grunts on the ground and in the tanks, this book follows the commander of the 101st airborne, General Petraeus. Of course, generals are "soldiers" too, but the title is deceiving. The few comments from the common soldier are overheard in the chow hall or in the toilet line.<P>Atkinson is a great writer and was given unprecedented access to key leaders. He's in the command tent, flying around in the command helicopter, and sleeping in tents with other generals on the staff. The access did not taint Atkinson's coverage, as he doesn't pull any punches in his critique of the generals.<P>The book has 3 basic phases:<BR>1. The build-up. The 101st airborne had to move from base to an airbase and across to Kuwait, and then had the agonizing wait for their equipment to arrive by sea. At times, despite Atkinson's great storytelling ability, this section drags, as he likely had lots of time to write but little of interest to write about. In every chapter, Atkinson weaves in his political perspective, which can get annoying.<BR>2. The early drive/fly in. The 101st moves quickly to its bases deep inside Iraq, and everything goes well for a while. Unfortunately, at least for the story, the 101st is left out of most of the action, due to weather/wind and a setback by another helicopter unit that gets badly shot-up. However, the book picks up the pace, as Atkinson drops the political commentary and tells it like it was, with no hindsight. The generals are concerned that the war could last for months and question the usefulness of attack helicopters.<BR>3. The attack towards Baghdad. The action picks up as the 101st is involved in clearing some towns, and there are interesting accounts of combined arms to clear streets without damaging historic monuments or injuring civilians. However, there is little explanation of how the general moved from "this could last for months" to being over in weeks. As in the first section, the political commentary appears again.<P>Overall, the book provides a fresh perspective from a few key generals without hindsight. However, the book is not up to Atkinson's lofty standard set by "An Army at Dawn". There are plenty of cliches, such as what the soldiers carried into battle. Even more annoying than the political commentary is the listing of the daily challenge/password, he must have mentioned at least 15. In the end, Atkinson's storytelling and access make the book worthwhile, but other books like "The March Up" provides a better feel for combat with the "soldiers" on the ground.</span>

                    <span>Rick Atkinson invites you to ride along as he gets to know the top brass of the 101st Airborne and watches them call the shots in Iraq. The result is a disappointment but not a total loss.<BR> <BR> Readers of his previous work will be shocked at the utter lack of depth here. Discussions of tactics and strategy are strictly superficial, and the enlisted soldiers doing the actual shooting are ignored completely. He describes listening to radio communications while companies of men manoeuver under fire , but somehow never finds the time to ask them about the experience. <P> Atkinson repeatedly allows his dislike of the Bush administration to get the best of him, which results in a few really awful cheap shots. At one point he flatly refers to Saddam's WMD as nonexistent. Not unproven, or as-yet undiscovered, or even doubtful, but nonexistent. If, as UN inspectors believe, Saddam did move chemical weapons to Syria before the war, Atkinson has seriously compromised his integrity here. He also recycles the false claim that Bush painted Iraq as "an imminent, existential danger...". Actually, the President urged action against Iraq BEFORE the threat became imminent. Where's a fact checker when you need one? Atkinson catalogues the losses suffered by American forces during the occupation of Iraq, carefully sending the message that these deaths constitute an indictment of Bush policy. He neglects to mention that many of the terrorists are non-Iraqis fighting to prevent Iraq from becoming a successful democracy. Mr. Atkinson evidently prefers to leave the reader with the impression that the general population of Iraq has rejected the American presence there. This is in keeping with the view of many in the media, but is sharply at odds with the firsthand reports of many American soldiers serving in Iraq. <P> Atkinson's writing skills are quite good, and he paints an interesting portrait of the talented, driven Major General David Petraeus. There is also a fairly good "you are there" quality as he describes his own experiences and reactions. <P> Don't pay full price for this book. If you can borrow one or find a cheap used copy it's a decent light read. Just hold your nose when he goes into BBC mode.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because I cajoled a young man into the Army prior to 9/11. He ended up in the 101st Airborne, the famous Screaming Eagles, who are the subject of this book. Instead of a chronicle of the heroics of this Division in Iraq (after their service in Afghanistan), this author confirms the liberal leanings of the media. The author cannot help himself, criticizing the Bush admininstration throughout the book, instead of building on the accomplishments of the officers and soldiers of the 101st and the US Army in their victory in Iraq.</span>

                    <span>Please, Please, PLEASE don't let any more reporters publish books! In the Company of Soldiers, a recent entry by Rick Atkinson is another half-assed, book-length diary by a celebrity wannabe in the role of war correspondent. It has been flogged on NPR and in the liberal press, many examples of which are cited by Atkinson as sources. With Michael Moore's film crockumentary, Fahrenheit 911 forming part of the celluloid leg of this left-wing stool, and NPR the broadcast appendage, continuous doubt-casting has become a subtle tool of the political left, particularly noteworthy in the current pre-election climate. Full of intended irony, In the Company of Soldiers follows a general in the 101st Airborne through the brief and highly decried Iraq war, leaving off with ominous portents of a difficult occupation, in just enough time to miss it and leave the "We told you so" implicit in the fertile minds of media-steeped readers. Though Atkinson styles himself an historian, In the Company arrives too soon and is too full of self-reference to be taken seriously as history. It may some day be an historic artifact, but none of the neutrality that is a prerequisite of serious history can be found. Instead, the book is an oversized Sunday Magazine piece, long on unnecessary detail and accusation, and short on the dangerous endeavor of deep analysis. <P>Atkinson's writing, breezy in its own way, is overly fond of inapt simile: "[Iraqi] women in their billowing black [robes] resembled walking rain clouds," while seemingly naïve in its apprehension of the military style, repeatedly mistaking sarcasm in the graffiti he finds at the latrines as a 'cry for help' of the kind so often sought by dew-eyed liberals. In one passage, the author translates FUBAR for the uninitiated, crediting Mogadishu veterans for its coinage, seemingly unaware of it as a commonplace at least in the 60's, one of whose witnesses he appears to have been. Similarly, he steps in to helpfully translate "NFS" written in the dust on vehicles from a battalion whose official motto was "No Slack." In contrast, he later uses a rather oblique expression, comparing the general visiting his men in a school building with a 'ward heeler,' at best a political organizer's insider term for someone who knocks door to door, and at worst, a misspelling (there are enough of these, other malapropisms and editorial mistakes in this hastily published tome) of ward healer, who might be a doctor making rounds. He offers no explanation. In other cases, Atkinson pretends to be down with pop culture, and refers to an Iraqi amusement park locomotive made from a tractor as "tricked up [out]" in the sense that a set of dope 20" rims on a Humvee might turn it hip-hop, also nearly quotes Led Zeppelin lyrics correctly, but fails to notice the close cognation of the town of Iskandariyah and the famed 60's hot-rod cam manufacturer, Ed Iskendarian, who was to cams what Dewey Weber was to surfboards. Withal, the author does give the impression that he spent more '60's time on Peter, Paul and Mary and Pete Seeger than on Don Garlits and Sox and Martin. <P>True to reporting culture, Atkinson accepts the goodwill of his military hosts throughout his "embedment," then snaps like a leashed chihuahua at the Defense Department in his closing chapters, arising John Kerry-like in his war diary as a prescient mind, declaring weapons of mass-destruction " [proven] nonexistent," even though purporting to have scribed this work of evenhanded reporting in January, 2004, before any one else had 'proven' the negative. Throughout, Atkinson dwells on the numerous errors that appear continuously in the military execution of this (and any) war, as if to suggest that Futility by Design is either a Bush Administration or at least an institutional mandate of the military. He seems constantly seeking a whiff of conflict between his general and the next higher (or lower) level, as if he is playing a role in a "reality TV" show, when the fact of his input might likely cause deadly results.<P>Atkinson's personal agenda is eventually fulfilled symbolically by his assigned general's offhanded gift of divisional and combat decorations as mementos of his journalistic adventure. The ghost of Ernie Pyle and others invoked in one scene by the self-absorbed Atkinson should stir uneasily upon his magic mirror fantasy. Those famed war correspondents sought the story of the war, rather than the story of themselves in it and their ideas about it, in a time when it was as much rumor as it was war. In today's diplomatically precarious-instant-gratification-media-infused war-making, the surfeit of witless commentary serves to obscure, rather than illuminate meaning. I shall place my copy of In the Company of Soldiers alongside the abominable The Greatest Generation by the pedantic Tom Brokaw, both cheap attempts at steering the reading public towards dubious social agendae through pseudo-professionalism. One should do better to read the works of Winston Churchill (The World Crisis and The Second World War) and get authentic cant from an actual player rather than drivel from an onlooker with a political agenda.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book expecting to get an account of the stories of the individual stories of soldiers who, for whatever reason, fought in the sands of Iraq...the stories of dads and sons and brothers and even sisters. What I got instead was a thinly-veiled criticism of those who led our nation into this battle. There were very few details of individual soldiers, and the little bit of information provided was decidedly negative...grunts were portrayed either as "We're gonna blow Saddam to Hell" types or those who scrawl "This places sucks" on the walls of the privys.<P>Actually, I didn't finish this book. I was shocked the first time I came across criticism of Bush, criticism that obviously was interjected into the account in the months following the war. What finally did it for me was the following quote from page 216: "To be sure, much fighting remained before Baghdad hove into view. Soldiers would still kill, and soldiers would still die. Civilians would die, too, like the ten slaughtered on Monday when a family van barreling down Highway 9 was riddled with 25mm cannon fire by skittish Marine soldiers." Are you kidding me! Atkinson has gone to length to talk about the suicide bombings already facing the military at this point...none of which he actually saw...I'll get to that later...and then he describes American soldiers as skittish slaughterers? I'd be willing to wager that if Mr. Atkinson had been manning that 25mm gun at a checkpoint, and a van was "barreling" toward his position...that he wouldn't have been thinking, "wow, I wonder if there are innocent civilians in there." I bet he'd been thinking, "holy crap, that thing's probably loaded down and gonna blow us away," right before HE opened up on it.<P>A high school student with a subscription to Newsweek, USA Today, and CNN could have written this book. Philosophical disagreements aside, I didn't like the book because the majority of it was filled with general stories and accounts of the war not personally witnessed by the author. He routinely included information about other theater actions...mostly to further criticize the military and administration.<P>This book seeks to portray the leaders of our military and nation and incompetent and inept and our most valuable weapon systems as impotent. This book is dishonest about it's aims. I know where to turn if I want read about the mistakes of the current administration, and I know where to turn if I want to read books by those who whole-heartedly support Bush. I guess I don't know where to turn to place myself in the company of soldiers.</span>
