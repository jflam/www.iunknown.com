                    <span>The simple "secrets" Dyer outlines in this short book are 10 ways to change your attitude, your outlook, and therefore, your life.
<br />
<br />This is a book you can read more than once and get something new from it each time.  Recommended!

                    <span>Dr. Wayne Dyer does a great job of summarizing a life's work of self help into 10 concrete steps that can transform one's life. Because this is such a short and easy read, it may cause the reader to miss the depths of his message. Each chapter could really be it's own book if fully explored. I would definitely recommend this book, but would add it as a companion book to one of Deepak Chopra's books or Eckhart Tolle's "The Power of Now" to help really delve into what Dr. Dyer is sharing. I'm adding this to the "short stack" by the tub!</span>

                    <span>Somehow, I missed reading Dr. Wayne Dyer's TEN SECRETS<br>FOR SUCCESS when it first came out a few years ago . . . however, I'm glad I was able to find it now because <br>it contained many powerful ideas for changing my life--and yours, too, in most likelihood) . . . though a mere 158 pages with a lot of white space, I'd still give it my highest recommendation for either personal reading or gift giving.<p>The ideas may seem pretty basic, but if you read the accompanying<br>explanation in the book, you'll see that they take on a lot more <br>significance when Dyer gives his unique spin on each one:<p>The First Secret:<br>Have a mind that is open to everything and attached to nothing.<p>The Second Secret:<br>Don't die with your music still in you.<p>The Third Secret:<br>You can't give away what you don't have.<p>The Fourth Secret:<br>Embrace silence.<p>The Fifth Secret:<br>Give up your personal history.<p>The Sixth Secret:<br>You can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it.<p>The Seventh Secret:<br>There are no justified resentments.<p>The Eighth Secret:<br>Treat yourself as if you already are what you'd like to be.<p>The Ninth Secret:<br>Treasure your divinity.<p>The Tenth Secret:<br>Wisdom is avoiding all thoughts that weaken you.<p>I also liked how Dyer used a relatively popular technique of<br>introducing each chapter with quotes . . . yet what made these<br>interesting was that I had not seen many of them reviously . . . forinstance:<p>Any path is only a path, and there is no affront to oneself <br>or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells <br>you.--Carlos Castaneda<p>Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists <br>in his error.--Cicero<p>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. Take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.--Marcus Aurelius<p>God does not command that we do great things, only little things<br>with great love.--Mother Teresa<p>Also, there were many other memorable passages in the<br>book . . . among them:<p>In all of your relationships, if you can love someone enough to allow them to be exactly what they choose to be--without any expectations or attachments from you--you'll know true peace in your lifetime. True love means you love a person for what they are, not for what you think they should be. This is an open mind-and an absence of attachment. <p>What is your passion? What stirs your soul and makes you feel like you're totally in harmony with why you showed up here in the first place? Know this for certain: Whatever it may be, you can make a living doing it and simultaneously provide a service for others. I guarantee it. <p>The willingness and ability to live fully in the now eludes many<br>people. While eating your appetizer, don't be concerned with<br>dessert. While reading a book, notice where your thoughts are.<br>While on vacation, be there instead of thinking about what should<br>have been done and what has to be done when returning home.<br>Don't let the elusive present moment get used up by thoughts<br>that aren't in the here and now.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my most favorite books. I think it is Dyer's best. It is a book of basic principles for peace and happiness - a wonderful book to keep at hand and to center your life on.</span>
