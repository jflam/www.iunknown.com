                    <span>This book has a charming cover and wonderful printing. It makes a nice gift for young people (they'll probably keep it in the bathroom?). Ms. Padwa's writing style is engaging. In the introduction she says that although this book is not thorough, it "has the facts you need to hold your head high" -- that said, I was disappointed to read a few misguided "facts" within the book. Perhaps this is because she admitted to poring over books and articles but did not mention any conversations with actual people. And, with the number of contradictory books and articles on every subject, this method would have to produce somewhat flawed results. The flaws are annoying but forgivable, and since she writes as if she is having a pleasant conversation, I still open the book to random pages and read a bit from time to time.</span>

Fewer than 1/20th of that amount are allergic to MSG (if such an allergy even exists). Sorry, but it's a medical fact. N.E.J.M.

                    <span>Statements made by author re: MSG "Our diet is made up of such a stew of additives (and those darn baby mice are so fragile) that unless you use lots of MSG on a very regular basis it would be hard to tell if it's hurting your health. To put things in perspective, salt and sugar have been proven to pose much greater health risks than MSG" I strongly disagree with both statements due to my own reactions to this TOXIC poison called MSG. The author needs to do some more research on this subject. Suggest she read: In Bad Taste, The MSG Syndrome by George R. Schwartz, M.D. and she will learn how seriously damaging MSG is for many, many sufferers.</span>
