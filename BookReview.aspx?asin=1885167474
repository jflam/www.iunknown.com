                    <span>As I talk to more and more people, it becomes obvious that most of them have a vague idea of what networking is, but really no idea how to get started or how to be effective.  This book gives a great starting place. The assessment allows the reader to take a hard look at where they are now and then using the steps, to make a plan for improving their life and career.  I would highly recommend this for people who want to get started on improving their networking skills.  </span>

                    <span>To answer one reviewers question: I've see these "5 star" reviewers in every networking title sold (see all of their reviews listed). Has Rick Frishman ever reviewed a networking book he didn't rave about? Better still, has he ever read any of the books he reviews? These "reviewers" have written their own networking books and are hawking each other's books, deceiving potential buyers. I guess this is their form of networking. A potential book buyer should disregard what they say.</span>

                    <span>If you've read at least one networking book, you most likely will find little, if anything, useful from this one.  I must admit there are some helpful hints such as: 1) Avoid the Lone Ranger mentality, 2) Give without expecting anything in return, 3) Gain value from every contact, 4) Become an active and perceptive listener, & 5) The 3 Foot Rule.
<br />
<br />These(like most of the 59 "secrets") present a somewhat hackneyed approach to networking.  Although worth a look-see, I would recommend a check out from the library for this title, rather than wasting your mula.  </span>

                    <span>Power Networking is a book every professional should have in their library. It teaches you how to expand your network, and about giving first- and then you get. Lots of great resources and strategies- even for the beginner. I recommend this book highly.  Rick Frishman  Pres.

                    <span>After exploring many networking sources, Power Networking was the book I used to premise a training I created for my company which was a complete hit! This book is a must read if you want to be successful in your business and personal life without coming across like a sales person. The concepts and techniques presented in this book coupled with the "practical" actions and activities after each chapter allowed the associates in our company to put their new skills into effect immediately and start seeing results. If you don't like the "selling" part of your job, yet want to develop referrals and contacts this is the book for you! If you want and need things in your personal life but just not sure how to access this, this is also the book for you. After reading this book I was not only able to create a dynamite training program for our company, but more importantly on a personal level, I was able to use some networking skills honed in this book to help the orphange my daughter came from and bring some relief to to many adoptive parents. </span>
