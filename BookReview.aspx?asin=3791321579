                <span id="Label1">Few cities in the world evoke for Americans the kind of mystery and exotic appeal of Havana.  Always enigmatic, and hidden for forty years behind a veil of political intrigue, it is hard to believe that few Americans have visited this city just a day's boat ride away from our own shores.  In Havana (Prestel), award-winning photographer Hans Engels applies a keen eye and ahnost two decades of experience to capture a city that mixes ebullience with decay, modemity with colonialism.  It is a city of sad and breathtaking beauty, and one whose brilliantly diverse architecture says much about its social and political history.</span>

                    <span>This is a superb book! The photos are excellent, showing Cuba as it truly is today, with whatever still stands after four decades of inattention. Anyone who has not seen Cuba in 40 years should pereuse this book. The photographer does not make a political statement of any sort -- he merely records the beauty that is there. One of the few books about Cuba that I would recommend to anyone, regardless of political sympathies.</span>

                    <span>My boss gave me this book for Christmas. Boy, did he pick the right gift. Engels' architectural photography is breathtaking. Even thought the splendid colonial buildings depicted in this book appear to be falling apart, one can't help but be mesmerized by the ghostly beauty of it all. Through these photos it appears as if Havana has been become frozen in another, more prosperous era, but has never been maintained since. What you take away from the book is a city that is eerily beautiful precisely because it seems as if it is only a skeleton of what once was. If you are, like me, a lover of architecture, these photographs will make you feel terribly sad because so much grandeur is rapidly vanishing. At the same time, there are more than enough traces of splendid architectural details seen in this book, albeit in crumbling pieces, to make any fan of architecture want to see more of Havana. I gained much from this book, especially seeing, with my sometimes too-American eyes, how a very close and small Caribbean neighbor has architecture that at times seems to rival that of European capitals. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>This books presents the beautiful and rich architecture found throughout Havana. Through his pictures Engels lets the architecture speak for itself. Beth Dunlop's 5 page introduction is concise and to the point; a great compliment. Great pictures, a treasure collection.</span>
