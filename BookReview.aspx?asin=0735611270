                <span id="Label1">A thorough working knowledge of the Microsoft(r) Component Object Model (COM) and COM+ technologies is a prerequisite for effective design and implementation in today's networked Microsoft Windows(r) operating environment. But many development teams, during the design and implementation phases of their projects, encounter generic COM+ issues that have already been worked through by other developers. COM+ SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE documents these issues and presents ways of solving them that have proven successful in past projects. This book provides practical solutions to practical problems on more than one level. Some chapters qualify as design pattern catalogues, others offer implementation best practices, and others analyze performance trade-offs between competing solutions. All offer the kind of focused COM+ technical advice and information that can help developers avoid design and implementation pitfalls by learning from those who have already been successful in the COM+ development environment.</span>

                    <span>Very good book, explains real-worlds issues one faces when developing COM components. <BR>A few first chapters are extremely useful (something I had to learn hard-way. Have I had this book, I would have saved myself many hours restructuring my projects). Basic ATL types are also explained and recommendations given are very good.<BR>Concise but very useful is explanation of BSTR, OLESTR, CComBSTR, _bstr_t types.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book. The early chapters reveal solid solutions to oft-encountered COM problems - error handling, string manipulation, smart pointers, multiple-reader single-writer locks, streaming and marshal-by-value etc. The later chapters concentrate mainly on design techniques for building scalable applications. In my (humble) opinion, chapter 13: The MTS Revolution is worth the price of the book alone. This chapter describes the evolution of technologies for building scalable systems, introduces the single-concurrent-client model and explains how to write scalable systems keeping code maintainable and in the general case, lock-free. All would-be COM+/MTS developers should read this chapter! I've read both this and Tim Ewald's Transactional COM+ - both excellent books and compliment each other very well. In my opinion, Brown's chapter 13 is far superior to Ewald's chapter 1. Both attempt to acheive the same thing, coaxing the regular developer into the COM+ mindset, but Brown's offers logical facts and reasoning as opposed to Ewald's non-real-world convoluted IPerson examples.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book; a little pricey, but worth the money if you are serious about COM+. And I mean serious! This is not a beginners book, for that I would recommend "Inside COM+ Base Services" by the same publisher. This book is a little too biased towards MS development environments. For example they compare VC++, VB, and VJ++ and casually mention there are "other capable environments". Hmm. Then again, this is a Microsoft press book, and COM+ is a Microsoft technology, so its to be expected. <P>This book picks up where introductory COM books left off. The first chapter is about error handling in your COM+ objects - not a good place to start learning COM :) <P>Particularly useful to me was the last third of the book, the design patterns. Here, the authors give us a meaty example of a "real world" COM+ enterprise solution. What other book gives you this? Answer: none. Get this book!</span>

                    <span>This book, is without a dought, the best COM book ever done. In my seven years as a working COM engineer and some say expert, I have read and bought every single book on COM. And when you come right down to it, even Don Box's book, they are all the same: explaining IUnknown over and over again, rehashes of available documentation and books with esoteric and useless ICat and IDog interfaces. None of them deal with the real COM world and the problems we really face every day. This book does. This book assumes you are a working COM developer and focuses on the hard problems: Smart Pointers, Strings, Enumeration Interfaces, Streaming and trying to deal with the world of STL. It offers real solutions and real code that can be used today to bridge to the STL world and to deal with things like enumerations. It offers code to deal with COM enumerations and collections, a topic scarcely covered. This book has become my number one resource.</span>

                    <span>This book covers the software design aspect of COM+ with very good detail explanation of the why and what are your options in COM+ system design. The book also covers in depth discussion in using STL, architecture pattern, MBV and concurrency which are very valuable to software designer. If you are going to work on a software development that uses COM+, this book definitely will save you a lot of research and experiment time and resources.</span>
