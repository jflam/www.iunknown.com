                    <span>This is an excellent book for a beginner--a beginner to MFC. It teaches you the basics( classes, pointer, ....) if you happen to have forgot them and it teaches you an undestanding of HOW MCF works and HOW to use it.
<br />
<br />Most books seem to teach you how to use it, leaving how it works for the unknown, but this book does both. The layout of the book is excellent. 1/2 a page is code and the other 1/2 explains the code, very useful so you do not have to switch pages trying to see what they are talking about.
<br />
<br />I really do not have anything to negatively say about this book. I am happy that I found a book that teaches the how and why.  Great book for the beginner, and probably a decent book for the intermediate.  
<br />
<br />Note: It would be a good help, almost a must to have some understanding of function, arrary, memory, containers, classes work before you get this book. </span>

                    <span>If you want to do some professional programming this book is almost a waste. It is very basic. VERY BASIC. Doesnt answer any of the basic questions. Okay. With MFC and SDI and MDI and all the supposedly cool and hyper smart stuff we at least hope to go beyond writing codes in SDI and MDI for saying "Hello World", and typing three stings as a document file. If that is supposed to be smartness....god save the world. No Help. With anything. Wont help you write a windows application. Unless ofcourse, you are the hello world kid. And get an ego boost once your hello world works!</span>

                    <span>About the book having been written for a previous version of MFC - The console applications in chapters 1 through 3 will run fine after you replace <br>#include <iostream.h>  <br>with<br>#include <iostream> <br>using namespace std;<p>All other 90 plus programs work fine with the exception of 3 programs that use the slider control: Ex07f-sliders, Ex08e-DialogMsgMap, Ex08f_DialogMsgMapIcon. <p>The compilation error in the function OnVScroll() can be fixed by replacing the type CWnd* with CScrollBar*.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for an "introduction", I can't say more about the workmanship of this text. This book is unique from the many other startup books that simply repackage the MSDN help. I wish he would write the next one - "intermediate level MFC...".
<br /> 
<br /> In a masterfully developed discussion, Jones uses simple console apps in Part1 to explain objects and MFC. In Part2, he goes deeper but uses handcrafted MFC apps instead of relying on the visual tools and wizard, eliminating the black magic. In Part3 he brings in the visual tools to complete the discussion and get into meatier topics. The book is rich with excellent diagrams that adeptly illustrate the subtle connections in windows architecture. The code snippets are well organized and highlighted to show the inter-relationships as well.
<br /> 
<br /> If you've been around Windows C++ programming, you know it can be both hardest and easiest programming once you know the tricks . Any book that gets you there quickly is literally worth its weight in gold.
<br /> 
<br /> Top marks to Richard M. Jones.</span>

Neither the book nor the authors web site tells you what version is required.</span>
