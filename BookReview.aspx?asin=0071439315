                    <span>This book does exactly what it says it will do, right up to chapter 11.  For some reason, the author seemed to be in a hurry and deviated from the normal "step by step" approach used in previous chapters.  
<br />
<br />I understood everything from page 1 to the bottom of page 211.  At the top of page 212 there are 5 practice questions that left me in the dark.  No explanation as to what the author wants and the answers add to the confusion.  
<br />
<br />Here is an example of how easily it is to become confused.  
<br />
<br />The author walks you through graphing lines.
<br />
<br />Page 211:
<br />Draw the graph of 2x-y=8
<br />Find the coordinates of two points on the line:
<br />Let x= 1
<br />      
<br />2x-y=8
<br />2(1)-y=8
<br />2-y=8
<br />2-2-y=8-2
<br />-y=6
<br />-y/-1 = 6/-1
<br />y=6
<br />(1,6)
<br />
<br />I understand how to do this, and the author goes on to show how to graph 2x-y=8 when x=1 and x=5
<br />
<br />Page 212:
<br />Draw the graph of each of the following:
<br />1.
<br />2.
<br />3.
<br />4. 3x-y=6.
<br />5.
<br />
<br />Up until this point the author gives you the value of x for you to solve his examples and how this looks on a graph.  Suddenly at practice time you are not given the value for x and you are suppose to graph a line.  I am just learning how to work this type of problem. Am I suppose to substitute my own value for x?  A little input would have been helpful here.  The answers that are given, if I am to give my own value for x, my lines will be different than the lines the author shows?  Is this right?   
<br />
<br />I cannot count how many times I had to go back and re-read previous pages in chapter 11 to try and read the authors mind.  
<br />
<br />I am now trying to take the chapter 11 quiz.  
<br />
<br />Question 6.  The line whose equation is 2x+3y=6 is:
<br />(a) line l
<br />(b) line m
<br />(c) line n
<br />(d) line o
<br />
<br />I have read and re-read this chapter and gone over the previous examples.  I have tried to find an answer on the internet.  Am I suppose to use my own substitute values for x?  If so, wouldn't the line be different from the authors answer?  I have no idea because I don't know what values the author used versus mine.  I don't like to reverse engineer answers. As if you could reverse engineer lines on a graph. 
<br />
<br />I take a pre-college test in 10 days.  I can only hope they do not ask me to choose the "line whose equation is x-2y=4".

                    <span>I bought this book for a relative that never learned math in high school. All his 40 years he has struggled with simple pre-algebra. He expressed how sad he was that he never learned higher math.
<br />
<br />I used some of my spare time to scope the options at a local bookstore. I bought a copy of this book, read through it and was glad I did because even I needed a refresher. 
<br />
<br />After having my own personal positive experience with this book, I knew it was right for my relative.
<br />
<br />In just over 2 weeks he blew through this book. Each night he dedicated 2 hours for study, exercises and reviewed all materials from the previous evening for reinforcement as I suggested.
<br />
<br />He know has total mastery of the subjects and needs no help. He is now going to purchase the Algebra Demystified book to continue his positive experience and move forward.
<br />
<br />The book takes you through everyhting in quick simple steps, goes over rules like the associative principle, integers, parts of a division problem like the dividend, divisor and quotient. It starts you off with Whole Numbers to Fractions to Ratio/Proportion and touches on Geometry lightly.
<br />
<br />This book is neither intimidating or exhaustive. It simply gets to the point. It gives you the rules, walks you through 2 or 3 examples and gives you plenty of practice exercises. If you have the grasp...move on and review it again later. 
<br />
<br />The only thing I would recommend is if you have trouble...maybe you will want to get a book of practice questions to continue to test yourself to reinforce what you were taught. However, if you pay attention and re-read the chapter you will probably be fine. Most of the chapters are only 20 pages of large print and plenty of white space.
<br />
<br />I truly doubt mathematics could be broken down more simply than this!
<br />
<br />Get this book and forget the overhead and confusion of books that are 500 pages of small print!</span>
