                    <span>The beautiful and complex art of Tibet accepts many stylistic influences from other countries, including India (Pala, and later even the Mughal Empire), Nepal, Kashmir, and of course, China. Iconographically, it draws on the incredibly complicated Tibetan (Vajrayana) Buddhist pantheon, in which innumerable gods, originally from Hindu India, are first recycled through the esoteric doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism, then redoubled to add their Tibet-specific divine consorts and guardians, and finally redoubled again to add all the monks, lamas, arhats, founders, and followers of each of four major monastic (teaching) orders and their many sub-lineages.<P>Fortunately, we have Fisher's book to help guide us and start to make sense of it all. The author begins with an overview of the Tibetan pantheon - Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Protectors, revered humans - and goes on to review the major forms of expression in architecture, painting, and sculpture. These are followed by a chronological survey of the art of Tibet, from the 11th to the 19th centuries. The book contains 180 illustrations, half of which are in color. Many of the black-and-white photographs depict wonderful objects which, sadly, have not survived into the present day.<P>Because there is so much detail in Tibetan painting, the small format of the illustrations (page size 6" x 8") can be a disadvantage. Another caution is that a book this size (200 pages) can't possibly answer all the questions that even a beginner might have. Within its size limitations, however, the author has done a good job of illustrating and discussing the essentials of this art; the book is a real bargain at the price. I used it as a quick "refresher" before seeing the "Himalayas" exhibit (2003, Sackler Gallery, Washington, DC), and in general I think the book would be helpful and enjoyable to just about anyone who is looking for an introduction or review of the art of Tibet.</span>

                    <span>This book abounds with solid, logically presented information, free of art-speak and subjective judgments. Every place referenced in the text is shown on the comprehensive map which is undistorted by page joinery, lying flat when the book is opened. Discussions of materials and techniques are understandable. Every artistic expression of the Tibetan culture available to collections is covered. Tibetan history is integrated easily into the text as is Buddhist thought. Buddhism is placed historically and culturally in relation to indigenous influences and neighboring cultures, past and present. Traditions and schools are presented clearly and thoughtfully. For an introduction to Tibetan art, this is THE book. It is a supporting text, a springboard to better understanding the exhibition books.</span>

                    <span>My main disappointment with this book is that "Art of Tibet" really turns out to mean "Buddhist Art of Tibet". Perhaps one page is spent addressing the art and culture of Tibet prior to the introduction of Buddhism. This is a very brief survey book good to have as a reference for the most well-known pieces but not able to stand alone if you need more detail. I would recommend it as an introductory book, and advise seeking others if the topic interests you.</span>
