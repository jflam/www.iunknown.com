                    <span>Teaching HTML for the past 5 years I have certainly found that there very few really in depth reference manuals, this book does have some really nice features, however at the same time there things that confused me about the book.<P> <P>One thing I found odd was the 4 pages covering XML/XSL, after reading this I think the author could have left this out of the book and expanded and very good section on severs and server options.<P> <P>Part III, development of pages with HTML is very good with fairly good coverage of each section. In the next edition they should bring some of the web editors more up to date. One section I found to very well written is Part IV or CSS, the authors seem to have everything covered here.<P> <P>Part VII - cross browsers, deal with DHTML and JavaScript, I found this section to be okay but certainly more, much more information should have been included. One of the most impressive sections of the book is Appendices A through G, which is by far the best breakdown of attributes, CSS syntax, color and hex conversion I have ever seen.<P> <P>The cd included is mostly made up of trial version of software and most of the software has newer version available, so this will also need fixing for the next release. Overall, since I don't need the eval software, I found that the book certainly serves a purpose and for those new to the HTML arena this book should be helpful.</span>

                    <span>This "Bible" eases new HTML-coders into the language very gently and contains a variety of info. It introduces a very specific way to learn HTML 4 in tandem with Cascading Style Sheets and eventually JavaScript, which is theoretically the best way to learn the language... however some of the positioning tricks the authors suggest are still not supported by all browsers, and alternatives are not always suggested. There are a few typos that will frustrate more than a few readers. After spending time actually coding pages, the reader will want to find a specific answer to a nitty-gritty question or problem, but will only find an ambiguous "gloss". The book is a good start for anyone who is anxious about jumping into HTML. For the serious web builder and experienced coders, it offers a different slant on HTML 4, and excellent descriptions of CSS, etc., but will eventually need to be supplemented with another reference. It's not quite a "Bible".</span>

                    <span>I was a beginner when I bought this book and figured I could get pretty much what I needed from a "bible." In fact, I found this book to be poorly organized, full of omissions and very confusing to follow. The authors are so excited about CSS that they give HTML short shrift... not good for a book on HTML. I also encountered a lot of fluff on usability that could have been left out, but I suppose bibles are supposed to be thick to justify the price. The chapter on tables totally omits any reference to page layout with tables, something I find really unbelievable. I guess the authors think that CSS makes layout with tables a thing of the past. As a reference I guess this book is okay but it suffers from poor organization. Frankly, I was upset that I spent this much money on such a marginal book.</span>

                    <span>Was this book really written by the same guy who wrote "Publish It On the Web"? I was hoping for an update with the same more great tables and an easy to digest format. Ooops! Silly me. If you got a great beginning from Mr. Pfaffenberger, as I did, and are hoping for more screen shot demos of code, you'll be as disappointed as I am. The authors probably should take their own advise on writing concisely (Page 208). The only probelm is that I am not sure what they said on Page 208 or anywhere else. Or maybe they're like my grad school professors who thought if you had to ask a question, you probably weren't a good candidate for the class. So, don't look for this book to teach, just to recap what they assume you already know.</span>

                    <span>When purchasing this book, I was expecting something along the lines of a definitive reference, with commentary and examples. What I got was something more along the lines of the New Testament - subject to interpretation and discussion as to what the authors really intended to say based on prophecy.<P>I am disappointed at spending the money on a book with typographical errors and omissions in the reference sections. If you are not already a sage in the world of programming, you may find this book completely confusing. If you already are an expert, with many languages under your belt, including HTML already, you'll find this book on the shelf more often than on your desk.<P>However, if you are a skilled programmer, but have very limited exposure to HTML, I would highly recommend this text. By trying to figure out how to make style sheets actually work for anything complex, beyond the presented examples, you will almost certainly learn a great deal. I suspect that this is the target audience for this text. If so, good job.<P>When the next edition comes out, please organize your reference section with more of an instructional design focus. Start with the highest elements, and drill down completely, with each possible option and value (or a decent cross-reference to the possible values). This comment particularly applies to the CSS section, where it is unclear which option is usable for a given HTML element. <P>On the upside, I did like the presence of the "Where to go next" portion of each chapter. As a prose-style book, this is very helpful.</span>
