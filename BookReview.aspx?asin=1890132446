                    <span>Just returned from a safari to Tanzania.  This book, along with the Audubon Field Guide to African Wildlife, made our experience that much better.  The information contained in this book embellishes the wildlife viewing experience, by providing fascinating and in-depth information about the animals seen there.  The text is organized very well and crammed full with useful information.  Highly recommended reading for before a safari, and especially while there.</span>

                    <span>This is the book my tracker had in his jeep on a trip I took to southern Africa (SA, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia). My tracker didn't need it, but I found it fantastic reading during siestas and the longer drives.  There are so many behavioural explanations missing from the standard safari guide.  What's the difference between a high-horn threat and a low-horn threat in a roan antelope?  I could see the different display postures, and this book told me a little more precisely what the display was all about.  The only problem with this book is that there is no guide to spoor, so you'll have to get one.  There are no colour photos, which is good for identification, because you don't want to get hung up on slight colour variations.  Sometimes a roan antelope is about the same colour as a sable antelope.  Look at the other identification marks.  Anyway, as soon as I found a bookshop, I bought my own copy, and I still refer back to it.</span>

                    <span>While I agree with most of the other reviewers comments,I wouldn't agree that it is the only book you need. Descriptions and explanations are exemplary but the book is black/white illustrations with no color and no photographs.</span>

                    <span>Forget the field guides - any safari guide worth his or her salt can tell you if that's a Thompson's gazelle or an impala.  But what they CAN'T tell you is: why does a warthog kneel while eating? what's up with that hyena sibling rivalry? This book is chock full of the kind of insights that make the difference between a "checklist" safari and really understanding what you're looking at.  This is the only book we used on our recent trip.  Every time we came across a new animal someone in our group would grab the book and read aloud the best parts. I left it our copy in Kenya with our guide so I'd better go order another copy!</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a book or two (as luggage weight limits were tight)to enhance my first safari experience to the national parks of Tanzania. I selected this book based on Amazon.com reader feedback. It was a real help during the safari and continues to be used while reviewing video, photos, and books on African wildlife. I also took a good field guide (Audubon)--but these were widely available on the safari 4WD as well as at the lodges. What makes the Estes book unique is it describes the MEANING of the behavior and social groups you see on the game drives. Almost daily we would see sights that struck me as unexpected--like an all male group of 40 impalas, or zebras leading a line of hundreds of wildebeest; I'd look up that species in the Estes book back at camp and he would explain the meaning of the behavior. My safari mates were all very experienced and involved in zoos in the USA. They would often ask to borrow my "Estes" for their use.<p>In my opinion, if you can only take one book other than your safari journal--take this one. If you can take two, include a good field guide (like Audubon).</span>
