                    <span>An excellent book - your start in life of photography! <P>I don't know exactly how many pictures are presented here, but I assure you that all of them deserve the highest mark (without any exceptions!) And considering the fact that all these pictures are followed with the detailed explanations on how to do this photos, this book becomes invaluable.<P>All of us know that any science, any skill we get only in the course of practice. No theory, no advises can make us a good pros; they can only help. Making photos with the instructions of Lee Frost will foster in you the professional Xperience. And don't be afraid of copying his photos; it's only for some time and then you'll just use his best techniques for your OWN ideas.<P>Overall, a really great book, with beautiful pictures, interesting ideas and the finest polygraphy. A must have for all amateurs (and may be - future pros?)</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent for the techniques and tips to better photographs. The Lighting/Exposure and Grain chapters are excellent. Reading is easy to undesrtand and photographs for illustrating the technique are very inspiring. I really recommend this book to those who are just begining to learn the art of photography.</span>

                    <span>As with all his books, Lee Frost writes in a clear and easy to understand manner. This book covers an excellent range of techniques making them very applicable to everyday photography. This is one book I have recommended several times and will continue to do so. Worth every penny.</span>

                    <span>I've read some of Lee Frost's other books, and really have enjoyed them. This book is probably best suited to the casual photographer who's wants to try a few things, but doesn't want to seriously pursue technique. At least, that's my best guess, judging from the format and subject coverage.<P>I can't say it's my favorite photography book. Other options would be Frost's excellent book on low light photography, or the National Geographic Field Guide series.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a very good book, provides very detailed instructions how to do some tricks. It has plenty of superb illustrations, so everything is great. There is just one but. A picture taking techniques part is still very valuable, but most of special effects and image manipulations now can be done much easier through digital processing. If you want to add grain to your picture it's so much easier just to scan it and use software then mess with reprints, special contrast materials and processing etc.</span>
