                    </div>
                    <span>This is the ultimate rags-to-riches story (only eclipsed by Moneymaker's own improbably run to the title).
<br />And, McManus is a fine writer.
<br />But, while everything he writes about poker is riveting, the book tries to do too much.  McManus -- ostensibly in Vegas to report on the Binion murder trial -- lucked into a better story, his own run at the title.
<br />But, in reporting the better story, he still feels compelled to inter-weave the murder trial and its background.
<br />It's an interesting conceit to try to do both, and clearly, the Binions and the World Series are inextricably linked.
<br />But, ultimately, he doesn't quite pull it off. 
<br />The book would have been stronger if the focus had remained more clearly on his run at the title.  While the murder trial is compelling, it takes away from the drama at the table.  
<br />And, while I am a fan of true-crime books, and am not diminishing the Binion murder story, there isn't quite enough dramatic arc or plot twists to write a book about just the murder case.
<br />McManus would have been better served writing a magazine article about the Binion trial, and focusing his book on his WSOP play.</span>

                    <span>Jim McManus' experiences playing in the WSP as a long-shot were riveting and would have made a wonderful magazine article. His coverage of the Binion trial, as well, would have made a good article. But instead of taking the prudent course and publishing them thus, McManus ties the two together on the premise of a number of absurd, overwritten parallels between poker and murder, interweaving pages upon pages *upon pages* of irrelevant subtext about his own life, self-destructive tendencies, family history, and wonderful, wonderful (am I sick yet of hearing about how wonderful she is?) and forbearing wife, Jennifer. 
<br />
<br />Mc Manus' editor should have been demoted for allowing the number of divergent, run-on pages (chapters, even) that detracted from the two interesting main storylines. All wrapped together as the book is, it doesn't make for good reading unless you know which 60% to skip. </span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book.  A real life personal story wrapped around a murder mystery/trial story, the every-man poker player will love Bad Jim and his assault on the WSOP.  Everyone wants to play there and everyone wants to win.  McManus came 5th and his story is compelling and truly fun reading.  Plus you learn the work BURK. What could be better than that?</span>

                    <span>As some reviewers have commented, Fifth Street, is not Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  But it's not supposed to be.  Even though both have the common premise of an author writing about himself while on a journalistic assignment to Las Vegas, their purposes and approach are very different.    Comparing McManus' book to Thompson's doesn't provide insight into either.
<br />
<br />As for Fifth Street itself, McManus is at his best when writing as a journalist, even though he seems to take some license with the facts related to Ted Binion's murder.  The juxtaposition of a No-Limit poker tournament and the death of someone who lived without limits is a terrific premise.  The book is best when it sticks to these topics.  
<br />
<br />The author's description of the poker tournament becomes fascinating as he finds himself playing at the final table with some of the world's best players.  His descriptions of the thinking process of top poker players and how they interact are insightful and very well written.  But his focus on the tournament detracts from writing about the trial and bringing the two topics together in a common theme.  The book may have been better if he'd lost in the early rounds and kept a broader perspective.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the book becomes about the author's personal life.  But given the putative premise, McManus' diversions to discuss his and his wife's family history, potty training of his children, and other extended diversions, distract from the strength of this book.</span>
