                    <span>I am finding this book helpful, except I am using Dreamweaver MX 2004 and this book is apparently for the previous version.  Enough has changed that it is frustrating trying to figure out where things have moved to.  I have to pull up the help screen to compare how the book says to do it with how you actually do it in the updated version.  Use caution when using this book for the 2004 software.  Otherwise, I personally like the pictures--being a visual learner.</span>

                    <span>On the surface, this book looks good. It is one of the many visually oriented books for dreamweaver MX/Fireworks that deals with the issue of integrating the two. I got it because it was easier to wade through than some of the 1000 page books with no visuals.<p>The biggest disapointment however is that the author has done the projects that she tells you to do, but doesn't tell you that the projects don't work!<p>I wanted to create pull down menus or at least jump gates in dreamweaver. After killing myslef and creating pull down menus in fireworks that have to be exported into dreamweaver I found that there is a flaw in dreamweaver that she doesn't mention. Dreamweaver has it where anything added to a template that involves action,  doesn't update to all the pages using the template.<p>In other words, after struggling for days, I found on the dreamweaver bulletin boards that if you do anything that is put into an already existing template, such as a navigation bar, pulldowns,  etc. they will not be updated. So now everytime I make a change, I have to cut and paste this new pull down bar into every single page of the website and it is a pain. <p>She never mentioned this. I even found her email address in the book and emailed her. No response!<p>This book would have been better it if had actually mentioned this. Buy a book from on author who actually uses the software in everyday situations, not one who is a professional software writer and only uses the software once!</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely geared towards beginners, but at the same time I found a lot of the explanations a little lacking. The book will walk you through steps but not explain "why" you're doing those steps. It seems to me the authors spent to much money on printing in color and not enough on writing a well thoughtout book.</span>
