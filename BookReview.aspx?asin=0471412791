                <span id="Label1">A one-stop source for investing in biotech-with detailed coverage of the science, the business, the players, and the strategies for one of today's most promising (and volatile) industries<br>   To invest in biotech is to invest in the future, and as such, investors need to learn the nuances of the science they're putting their money on. The core asset of biotech companies is knowledge, and sound investment decisions are impossible without an understanding of this complex science. That's where The Biotech Investor's Bible fits in. This much-needed, one-of-a-kind resource simplifies the complex science surrounding the business of biotech and clarifies subtle distinctions within the context of their financial repercussions. The book explains the basics of genetics, patents, and therapies; and teaches investors how to value biotech companies and their state-of-the art products and technology. The Biotech Investor's Bible offers an informative summary of the relatively short history of the industry and provides a comprehensive review of various industry sectors.<br>   George Wolff (St. Pete Beach, FL) is a successful consultant advising clients who are investing in biotech stocks. He has assessed well over 150 biotech companies and has issued a number of valuable white papers that have charted the success of the hottest biotech companies.</span>

                    <span>There is not good book on biotech investing.  The Biotech Investor's Bible is poorly written and badly organized.  I find the same companies provided as examples again and again.  Some of them no longer exist!  The risk of this industry was not sufficiently highlighted.<p>The author groups companies based on market capitalization; I believe that this approach is fundamentally flawed.  It runs the risk of feeding right into a mania.<p>I would like to have seen more comment on the stalwart biotech companies.<p>I did not learn much from this book.  Perhaps that is the point. This area is a challenge.</span>

                    <span>Successful investing is difficult.  Investing in biotech companies can be even more challenging.  I did not find this book up to the challenge.<br>The organization of the book was confusing: the author jumped around from topic to topic.  The discussion of the science was fine, but there was not really anything that I could not find from a five minute web search.<br>I believe if I had calibrated my expectations differently, I may have found value in this text.  The example companies are dated.  I believe one of them at least no longer exists.  Some of the companies classified as biotech companies are really baby pharmaceutical companies.<br>The tiered approach to differentiating among companies was interesting.  It did not clarify for me how I should approach an investment.<br>The writing style is good, in fact, I found the book easy to read.  I have to be blunt, the content was very disappointing.<br>I do have to remember that when it comes to biotech investing, we're at the crossroads of two difficult activities.  I did not find that this book clarified either.</span>

                    <span>This was a difficult book for me to review.  I bought it primarily because of the rave reviews on this web site.  Overall, I'm  glad I did.  However, the book fell slightly short of the reviews, hence my 4 star rating.  It contained a great deal of interesting and useful information but lacked  organization and structure.  In that sense, it was indeed a Bible, a collection of articles, rather than a text.<p>My primary complaint is that the first few chapters were practically devoid of content, offering only hype on how great biotech is.  The comparison of biotechnology with the PC industry was also a bit of meaningless hype.<p>On the positive side, after the reader wades through or skips  the first three chapters (unfortunately, I read them), there are numerous valuable bits of information and insight.  Particularly valuable are the author's idea of categorizing biotech companies by market capitalization (share price times shares outstanding).  This is a useful way of measuring how the market evaluates a company that has no current earnings.  Chapters 10 through 15 are a veritable encyclopedia of the different approaches taken by biotech companies, from anti-sense to vaccines.  The leading companies in each field are introduced and their prospects briefly reviewed. These chapters were readily useful to the investor and led me to make (so far) successful investments in PDLI and QLTI.<p>The book is now silghtly dated, having been published in 2001. However, this can be said of any two year old investment book.   The reader should certainly do some careful analysis of the current state of any candidate for investment. I actually found the slightly dated nature useful in that it allowed my to judge which companies still looked like winners two years later and which did not.<p>Advice:  Buy the book, skip the first three chapters, and read the rest.  Also buy and read Investing in Biotech by David Harper which covers much of the same material in a more orderly manner.  (More detail is available in my review of that book.)</span>

                    <span>I am a neurobiologist who is interested in biotech invest. I agree with all other reviewers about how excellent this book is. But I have to point out several disappointments. First, author's website... is not available any more. Second, most of the websites that author recommended for resources are not free anymore... Third, chapter 10 which author had tried to explain the science background of biotech industry and compared it to PC industry does not make sense to me, and some concepts are misleading and dangerously wrong, and they really bothered me. He did a fairly good job to explain what some companies are doing though. <p>It has been less than two year since this books was published, like author mentioned that biotech industry is unstable, I found that some companies even in Tier 1 sector (author's classification) do not even exist anymore. Therefore, do your homework before you invest on some companies mentioned in this book(author prewarned this).<p>Overall, I really learned a lot about biotech industry sector, and it made me to have better perspectives about what I am doing in the lab and my career development. I could come up with a list of several companies for the investment after reading this book and my own homework. I want to recommend this book to graduate students, postdocs in biomedical research field.</span>

                    <span>A way, way cool book. Just what the individual investor needs to start to get up to speed in the biotech sector. <p>Much has happened in this sector since "Biotech Bible" was published, so investors must exercise due diligence and follow up on the companies cited. The current market suggests investors need to pick fewer and better biotech companies (especially those with products in promising Phase III trial, or those with actual profits). I'm resisting George Wolff's optimism for now and conserving cash, ready to purchase breakthrough biotech companies once their long-term survival becomes likely.</span>
