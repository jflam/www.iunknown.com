                <span id="Label1">Trees are natural focal points of any landscape --- living structural elements. They inspire an appreciation of nature as well as providing food and shelter for wildlife. For all these reasons, the choice of a tree for your landscape should be carefully considered. Many common native trees are just as beautiful as cultivated exotics. Since they have evolved with local conditions and are well adapted to their climate, soil, and pests and diseases, native trees often require less maintenance than exotics and won't escape to invade a balanced ecosystem.   <P>The authors have spent their lives studying native trees and their environments. Their extensive knowledge is distilled in this comprehensive cross section of trees native to North America, from the Atlantic to the Rockies and from the treeless tundra of northern Canada to the Gulf Coast. They explain how to choose trees appropriate to a particular area, whether by planting new specimens or preserving those already on site. The main section of the book is divided into tree profiles, each describing flowers and fruit, native and adaptive range, culture, and problems. The authors also list the best seasonal features --- whether a tree has striking bark in winter, for example, or bright fruit in fall. In all, more than 650 species and varieties, and more than 500 cultivars, are discussed.   <P>Packed with stunning color photos, this fresh, inspired look at native trees is sure to be read cover to cover by gardeners and woods walkers alike.</span>

                    <span>137 billion tax dollars were spent last year alone eradicating, controlling, and managing exotic species of plants which included trees such as The Chinese Tallow, Tree Of Heaven, Autumn Olive, and Buckthorn. It is time the public be made aware that native tree alternatives are out there and they are the responsible choice. Release of a book so well written and sensitive to the complex and diverse issues posed by the existence of invasives is long over due. Kudos to Sternberg and Wilson for endeavoring to write such an informative book. Native Trees for North American Landscapes addresses these issues and many more. This is a must have book for anyone in the forestry, nursery, or landscape industry as well as the home hobbyist.</span>

                    <span>Guy and Jim have done it again! <P>I have one of Guy and Jim's other books: Landscaping with Native Trees and I am so excited to finally have their new book: Native Trees for North American Landscapes. <P>This book is well written and is written in a style that both the plant-person and the novice gardener can easily understand and appreciate. <P>Guy and Jim provide a breakdown for each of the trees listed in the book. This is a listing of the information given for each tree:<P>-Description (includes size)<BR>-Leaves<BR>-Flower and Fruit OR Cones and Seeds<BR>-Best Season<BR>-Native and Adaptive Range<BR>-Culture<BR>-Problems<BR>-Cultivars<BR>-Similar and Related Species<BR>-Comments<P>The above information makes it very easy for anyone to decide whether a particular tree is suitable for their site (and USDA growing zone) and how they want to use the tree, whether it be as a specimen, screen, etc. <P>I read Ben Johnson's review of this book and I don't quite understand his vendetta against Guy and Jim and this book. <P>Ben had (has) some problems with some of the technical words that Guy and Jim have used periodically through the text. Ben must not be able to use the glossary that is included in the back of the book because all of the words that he has a problem with are included there along with their definitions. Don't be frightened by Ben's fear of new words. If you find a word that you are not familiar with, then check the glossary in the back of the book for the definition - it's that easy. It's how we learn. <P>After reading Ben's review of this book it is clear that he is not really reviewing the book so much as trying to attack Guy's character. This is not the place for that sort of thing. <P>I, too, frequent the forums on GardenWeb and I have found Guy to be very generous with his advise and help. I read the thread on GardenWeb regarding the removal of a tree because of a problem with the birds pooping on vehicles and, again, Ben has twisted and taken words out-of-context to attack Guy. I have never met Guy in person, but I have the utmost respect for Guy because of all of the help I have received from him through the forums on GardenWeb. <P>If you want help sorting out which native trees you might want to include in your landscape or you simply want to learn more about the wonderful native trees that grow in this great country of ours, then this is the book for you! <P>Guy and Jim have written this book about native trees because of their love for our native trees and to get people to, hopefully, include some native trees in their home landscapes.<P>The photography in the book is outstanding, too.<BR>You will not be disappointed if you purchase this book. <BR>Mike</span>

                    <span>Guy Sternberg and Jim Wilson's Native Trees For North American Landscapes represents a lifetime of research and work: the authors provide an in-depth technical catalog of detail on native trees and their environments, providing tree 'profiles' which describe flowers, fruit, plant ranges, and culture. Sections outlining best seasonal features are particularly useful, telling gardeners which plants are showiest per season. Stunning photos and outlines of common cultivation problems and solutions make Native Trees For North American Landscapes a solid, invaluable reference for landscapers, libraries and home gardens alike.</span>

                    <span>I am a plant freak, and I am a gardening book freak. I have many, many books, probably too many. Literally. So many books that I've bought that looked interesting at the store have wound up sitting on the shelf, never to be opened again. This is one that will never even get to the shelf.<P>This book is so comprehensive, so informative, so beautiful to look at, and so danged readable that I find myself seeking it out whenever I've got a free moment. How many gardening books have you bought lately that poured forth all the information you could possibly want? How many have you bought lately that were a lot of fun to read? Now, how many can you name that do both at the same time? A precious few, but this one does. <P>Timber Press celebrated their 25th Anniversary this past year, and I did something I never do, I wrote the company a letter. In essence, what I said was this, "I never mind buying a Timber Press Book, often sight unseen, because I know it will be good." This book is excellent, even by Timber Press standards. <P>If you have any interest in trees or gardening, you will find this book a "must have." Informative, enjoyable, beautiful. What else could you want?</span>

                    <span>This outstanding new book will become one of the primary references for all kinds of information about native woody plants of North America. Many of the plant descriptions have far more detailed information on culture, diseases, and ornamental characteristics than the widely known reference books by Michael Dirr (the 'standards' by which all other woody plant references are judged). While the intent is to provide information and promote the ornamental characteristics of native woody plants, for home gardeners and landscape professionals, this will also prove to be a valuble reference for naturalists and others mainly interested in these plants in the native, rather than the cultivated, landscape. The photographs are outstanding, and will certainly promote interest in many little known and underutilized woody plants. I never knew there were so many native North American oaks! As a botanist and later home gardener with a life-long interest in woody plants, there are few books in the past decade which have been published with this level of detail and value.</span>
