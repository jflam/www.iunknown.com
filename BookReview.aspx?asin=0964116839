                <span id="Label1">Brazil is a complex country of Indian, Portuguese, and African descent that mixes its heritage in amazing culinary concoctions, but you need savvy to partake as fully and gloriously as you might like. From <i>abacaxi</i> (pineapple) and <i>abobrinha</i> (squash) to national favorites like <i>farofa de banana</i> (bananas fried with onion rings and manioc meal) and <i>patinho de carangueijo ao vinagrete</i> (marinated crab claws), you'll not want for good food. Joan and David Peterson do more than let you know what's out there, they give you the vocabulary to ask for it, and even include some recipes to recreate at home.</span>

                    <span>I'd like to see more of this kind of book. Written by experts in a readable style, "Eat Smart in Brazil" provides a succinct but informative overview of the country's culinary culture. It includes historical, ethnic and regional overviews, recipes, shopping tips (both for local markets and for when back home), a culinary phrase guide, and two Portuguese-to-English glossaries - one to help when ordering in restaurants and the other to clarify definitions of food names and cooking terminology. The Eat Smart series is published independently, under the Ginkgo Press imprint. Joan and David Peterson are literally eating their way around the world with Ginkgo. Besides Brazil, they've covered Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Morocco, and India. Next up, Peru. Unlike the run-of-the-mill globetrotting guidebook writer, this couple knows its stuff - which, of course, would be food. (Bill Hinchberger is the editor of the BrazilMax website.)</span>

                    <span>Just got back from the trip of a lifetime to Brazil. We visited our former exchange student and his family. We used this book to find out what we were eating (wonderful food!) at every resturant. Even though we were with native Brazilians who spoke English, they often did not know the English words for food.<BR>We used it in Campinas, Paraty, Rio, and Santa Rita (MG). Near the end of our trip we went through the book and marked which foods were our favorites. I recommend this book to anyone taking their first trip to Brazil</span>

                    <span>Brazil IS NOT made of Indian, Portuguese and African people descent. Brazil was colonized by Portuguese, African, French, Italian, German, and Duth people. Other people that were very expressive in Brazilian history were Chinese, Jewish, Arabic, Spanish..I'm sorry if I'm leaving some nations out of this equation (Brazilian people are a union of many people and cultures!!), but I've never read something SO absurd as this review.<BR>Thanks</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent guide to the cuisine of Brazil, which has a vast array of regional specialties, spices, fruits and fish. If you go to the Amazon, Bahia or Rio, for example, you're going to encounter quite different menus. "Eat Smart" is one of my key Brazil guides, along with the music book "The Brazilian Sound."</span>
