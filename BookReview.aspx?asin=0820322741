                    <span>Like the author I was stunned in 1965 when I heard of the Liuzzo murder and the trial of Collie Leroy Wilkins.  The prologue in Stanton's book was engaging and beautifully written.  However, after the prologue the book is not as compelling.  Ms. Stanton clearly suggests that Rowe was the murderer, but leaves some large questions unanswered.  Where is Leroy Moton?  If Moton testified that Wilkins was the murderer why dismiss Moton's testimony because of lie detector tests administered to Wilkins?  I wonder if Rowe committed the crime myself, but I don't see evidence in the book to support the author's perspective. Even if Rowe did commit the murder, that does not exonerate Wilkins or Murphy. Also, the book seemed unevenly documented. In some cases there were footnotes from newspapers that were either unnecessary or provided insufficient support.  In other cases claims were made without any documentation. <p>What is good about this book is Ms. Stanton's passion.  What it lacks is structure and support for some of the claims contained therein.  Still, I am glad I read the book and glad she wrote it.</span>

                    <span>The only thing I remember in 1965 about my childhood in Montgomery, Alabama was that I was six-years-old and there was the terrible murder of a white woman by the Ku Klux Klan.  I didn't know her name.  All I knew was she was killed for having a black man ride in her car with her.  That is all I have known for years. Thanks to Mary Stanton's excellent biography, I now know her name and her story. One night after reading several chapters I could not get to sleep. My thoughts were of Vi and Highway 80 out of Selma.  Remembering can be a painful thing but through the sensitivity of Stanton's writing and her personal admiration for Viola Liuzza, I came to love and admire this courageous woman. Sorry that we never met.  I appreciate Stanton sharing her struggle to research the story and write it.  That was fascinating and very rewarding to be at Stanton's side page after page hoping her contacts and leads would pan out.</span>

                    <span>This book took priority over my agenda, a page turner of the first order.  Getting the real story of Viola Liuzzo was on the back burner of my own  mind so long I didn't remember it was there until Stanton's book caught my  attention at the library. The book is in layers, with the story of getting  the story as telling of the 1990s as the unfolding of what was actually  happening in Selma and America in the 1960s.  The role of women and  political correctness 1960s style all over the U.S.A. as well as in Selma  rings true. The story of the civil rights movement in the context of the  South is absolutely girpping.</span>

                    <span>Like Mary Stanton, I was also curious about Mrs Luizzo, and she stayed in the back of my mind.  I am sorry for the loss her family and many other families suffered simply because they wanted to change something that was  completely wrong and unjust.  I also feel shame on a government who would  go so far to make those who were right and decent appear so degrading and  immoral and to even allow murder to protect the "status quo"   This book is must reading for anyone who really wants to take the blinders  off about what really happened during that horrible time. I have recently  been given the opportunity to visit parts of Alabama and while the area I  visited is very decent, mentally I can still visualize the Alabama of 1965  and understand why it is necessary to leave the Viola Luizzo marker  defaced; as the author has stated the struggle isn't over.  Thank you Mary  Stanton</span>

                    <span>I remember the murder of Viola Liuzzo very well because her son Tommy was in my class at Precious Blood School in Detroit when it happened.  We were in 8th grade.  I remember the aftermath, although being only 13, I was only  marginally aware of the magnitude of the whole event.  My mother was one,  of many, who asked "what was she doing there when she had 5 kids in  Detroit?"  Reading Mary Stanton's book took me back to a difficult  place and time.  She has done her research well and cares about her  subject.  It was painful reading for me because of what happened to the  family and in my furvent hope that I was not one of Tommy's grade school  tormentors.  A wonderful depiction of a fascinating person and a terrible  time in our country's history.</span>
