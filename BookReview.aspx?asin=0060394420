                <span id="Label1"><p>Old-world Hollywood glamour embraces modern insouciance in the signature style of internationally acclaimed interior designer Kelly Wearstler. Never one to paint a wall simply white, in her creations Wearstler uses bold colors and patterns and mixes elaborate architectural hardware with furnishings culled from a range of eras. In <i>Modern Glamour</i>, she reveals her decorating secrets and dramatic approach to design.</p> <p>From basic design principles to personal accents, this gorgeously photographed book explains how Wearstler shapes interiors and exteriors into ingeniously functional environments. A survey of many of her most stunning projects provides ideal examples of bringing what she calls "the elegance of the unexpected" to life in any setting. Whether it is juxtaposing typically masculine and feminine design notions to infuse a room with edge and energy, or using embellishments to put a thematic mark on a room. Wearstler's essentials on design will inspire professional designers and aspiring home decorators alike.</p> <p>For those who wish to discover how decorative visions can become luxuriant realities, <i>Modern Glamour</i> offers clear and enjoyable guidance on the art of creating seductively stylish spaces.</p></span>

                    <span>Let me begin by saying that I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! How refreshing to open a book that draws you into the details of the designer's mind and creative talent. This book is all about luscious, full-color saturated, delicious photos that pull you into the setting of their spaces- there are sections in the book of full-bleed pages of photos, some in close focus of particular details. It's amazing to see the contrast and combination of some of the things the designer combines within her designs- things that on their own seem odd and out of place, but juxtaposed together work to create a whole new visual treat. From the photographs and graphic layout of the book itself, to the content of the projects displayed, this book just oozes creative talent.<BR>I'm not exactly sure why having the designer's picture in the book seems to offend some of the above readers, but for me, I liked having a "face to the form." It's cool to see how the designer's own personal sensibility affects the type of work that she creates. What other interior design book out there combines fantastic architectural spaces and fashion with such aplomb! I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves interior design and/or fashion- you will not regret the purchase, I can assure you!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>For those of us that truly love and get excited by design, this book is a wonderful example of why we are fascinated by this field. Rather than giving us the same old dry verbage about visual decor and "furniture placement," this book tailors itself directly from the author's personal point of view. I loved the way Ms. Wearstler discussed her framework of reference for her own designs, but in a way that allows you to decide for yourself how they might be adjusted to work for your own sensibility. Some of her spaces shown in the book are a little too staged for my own taste, but they give one ideas of how she might approach designing spaces of her own using texture and pattern to similar ends. <BR>As a fellow professional of this field, I most certainly and highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I can only agree, this book is not about helping you out with your personal Interior Design projects.<BR>It actually fells more like it is a expensive business card for Kelly Wearstlers Design Studio.</span>

                    <span>The idea for this book is good but the book was badly done. Unexpected style is something that intrigues me, but that's not what this book actually is. The book is pretty dated in the way it is done because it's all about one unknown designer's "take" on decorating. No one today wants to be dictated to or to just copy what another person has done. So this book misses the mark by several miles. If you want a decorating book that helps you create your own style, this is not it. Don't buy this. It seems more like a book about this designer's own ego.</span>

                    <span>Someone said this is a book more about the designer herself than her work, but why not? A designer reflects her mind within her lifestyle and her background.
