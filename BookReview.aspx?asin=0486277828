                    <span>The Bhagavadgita (the Lord's Song) is the heart of the great classical Indian Epic, the Mahabharata. The hero of this epic is given the choice, just before a great war, whether to take the offer of a mighty army- or to choose a single charioteer. Of course, that charioteer is Krishna (the avatar of the god Vishnu on earth.) Krishna will not be able to intervene supernaturally in the conflict, but only offer teaching and advice. The hero, Arjuna, chooses Krishna and his advice over the mighty army, for he knows that to be in accord with God's will is all that truly matters. Besides, he also realises that Vishnu only incarnates on our plane of existence when things have deteriorated far out of control and it is time for Him to once again restore peace, justice, and harmony to the world. In other words, he KNOWS that he will be on the side of God, for God will literally be at his side.<p>This text represents the teachings that Krishna imparts to the hero, Arjuna. It is a message of how to put one's self and soul into accord, and in doing so, put one's self into mystic union with the divine. It is a message that one should do one's duty in the world without becoming too attached to one's actions or rewards (to be in the world but not of it.) It is also an assurance that the body is merely the body- to lose it is not to cease to exist. It is also a declaration that doing right for the sake of right is far more important that observing rigid rules and rituals of religious conduct.<p>This text is the excellent verse translation of Sir Edwin Arnold (1832-1904.) The Sanscrit terminology is all explained either in the forward, in footnotes, or immediately in the poetical, but highly comprehendable, text. I am not sure why this particular volume is listed as "abridged" for it is not. It is only abridged in the sense that the Bhagavadgita is an abridgment of the larger Mahabharata.<p>This is yet another marvelous selection in the highly affordable and tastefully selected Dover Thrift Editions collection.</span>

                    <span>The Bhagavadgita is one of the world's true classics of literature. Since it is not part of "western culture" it is often not included in the curriculum of school in the US, much to our loss. This translation is one of the most common, and the Dover edition is incredibly affordale. Being abridged, it is not a text for scholarly studies, but instead provides a great introduction to wisdom from the east... Highly recommended for students and casual readers.</span>

                    <span>Bhagvad Gita is a Wonderful Poem in Indian Literature (Sanskrit language).  But given the fact that this language is no longer spoken (just like Latin), the contents of the great works such as Bhagvad Gita have to be  read in translated forms.<p>Sir Arnold's translation is in poetic form,  unlike most translations, which are mainly prose.<p>It makes for a concise  reading, without really missing the the essence.<p>The Gita is my Manager,  and I have personally benefitted immensely in dealing with main daily life  sitiuations both in family and work.  It has made a profound diference to  my decision making ability qand leadership qualities.<p>I sincerely hope  that every ambitious person takes time to read this and beenfit from the  relevant parts of the text.</span>
