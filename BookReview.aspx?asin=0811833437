                <span id="Label1">An elegant hotel now serving as an elementary school...the parlor of a grand mansion transformed into a barbershop...these are Havana&#146;s most intimate spaces. Having enjoyed four years of unprecedented access to the private interiors of Cuba&#146;s capital, Andrew Moore has created an unrivaled portrait of both its legendary historic architecture and the city&#146;s inner life. These rich and elegiac images capture intimate details and sensuous moods, creating an open-ended drama that unfolds with each viewing. Painterly light lends grandeur to Havana&#146;s most unlikely landmarks. Andrew Moore&#146;s work is distinguished by its singular perspective, one that combines a documentarian&#146;s love of subject and story with an unexpected poetry.</span>

                    <span>Inside Havana is composed of a group of the most staggeringly beautiful and insightful photographs of Havana one could imagine. I loved this book. Andrew Moore has, with sumptuous color and exquisite sensitivity, captured this place which fills so many of us with such nostalgia, longing and frustration. Moore "gets" Havana in its complexity. His photograph of an old man in an undershirt sitting in what must have been the wide second story porch of a sumptuous Hacienda captures the former grandeur the decay and with perfect pitch. Moore doesn't preach but he does he delivers profound insights into the splendor that was and shows us how to see the beauty of this extraordinary place that no amount of squalor can completely hide. His sumptuous images in amazing color have an edge, they can make you feel other's nostalgia and bring you into the life of a people, of their present condition, of where they were, and of where they might be going. Anyone who wants to understand Cuba should buy this book- each picture is worth 1000 words. I went there as a child and I revisited a few years ago and can tell you Moore is as honest as he is artistic. He has an astonishing eye for the telling image, the revealing detail. Even if you are not interested in Cuba buy it- it has some of the most ravishing photographs you will ever see</span>

                    <span>I have had the opportunity to travel in Cuba on more than one occasion and am profoundly drawn to the people and the environment. Though I often times feel that photographic books do not adequately capture the essence of "real" places, I have found this book to be descriptive beyond words. The photographs tell a story of collapse and revival -- of time lost -- of hope -- of battle -- of corrosion -- of endurance.... Havana is alluring and repulsive in the same glance. Few photographers can capture such complexity in a single image. This book is amazing.</span>

                    <span>I'm purchasing this book after seeing it in a gift shop and can't wait to study it further. A photographer myself, I appreciate the work of talented photographers such as Andrew Moore. His choice of subjects and lighting make this book a joy to view. I have referred it to other photographers and I haven't even received my copy yet! Keep up the beautiful work!</span>

                    <span>Although I have never been to Cuba and would never presume to know what it must be like to have lived through the revolution, i wanted to respond to Dr. Andrew's review of this book. It is clear to me that this gentleman has very stong feelings of sorrow and anger about what has become of Havana. As a person who had no agenda when i opened this book, i wanted to say that what strikes me most here is the beauty of this city. Much like the face of an older person who has lived through much joy and much suffering, there is a kind of beauty here which is born of experience and wisdom. Havana is what it is. It is the product of history, of conflict, of a vibrant culture and an indomitable energy. All of this is apparent to me when i look at these photos. In one sense, one could say that these images reveal a Havana "frozen in time," but we all know that in truth, nothing can be frozen in time, as much as we might wish it to be so. For better or for worse, life is change. I find in these photos a mesmerizing stillness. But it's the kind of stillness one sees in a perfectly balanced spinning top, a dynamic stillness. I find no moral or political judgement behind these pictures, but simply an ability to be present to what is here, and to reflect it's inherent beauty.</span>
