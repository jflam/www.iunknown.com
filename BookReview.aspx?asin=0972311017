                    <span>This book offers some of the bare bones about search engine marketing. Some of the information inside it was incorrect before the book was even released.<p>There are a couple decent pointers in this book, but there is an equal amount of misinformation. I would advise trying some of the search engine optimization forums (or the book Search Engine Visibility) instead of reading this.<p>If the basis of your knowledge is outdated half truth, then you have no knowledge. I am extremly disatisfied with this book. I practice search engine optimization for a living and would not be able to live if I followed this book.</span>

                    <span>To me, this book was a waste of money. Not enough info here. There are much better books here to spend your money on. I felt that Shari Thurow's book was much, much, much more informative.</span>

                    <span>Sure, you can find the information scattered thorough out the Internet, but if you don't want to spend hours upon hours digging for the information you'll want this book.  It isn't for the professional search engine placement person, rather it is for someone who has a Web site and wants to promote it without spending a lot of money.  In fact, I'd suggest you read the book before you even purchase your domain name because there are several helpful tips in selecting the best name for your site.<p>Having been one of those people who have spent countless hours reading the information on the web about search engine placement it was refreshing to find a book that I could recommend to friends who wanted a short-cut to what to do.  Although, it was mentioned in another review that the information is available on the Web if you are willing to take the time to search, what that reviewer failed to mention is that the information changes over time and the older information sometimes conflicts with current practices.  I found this book to cut through the mess by providing current information.<p>Perhaps I haven't devoted as much time as others to finding the search engine placement information on the web, but there are a couple of sites that I wasn't familiar with and are quite useful.  My thinking is if there is just one thing that a book has to offer that I find useful, then the book has value.<p>If you are relatively new to search engine placement or have some knowledge and want to acquire one or two nuggets of useful information then this is a good choice.</span>

                    <span>The only group that should even bother with this book would be an absolute "newbie" to search engine promotion.  There's nothing in this book that you couldn't find out for yourself with just a little research on the internet.  You can start by reading the guidelines "straight from the horse's mouth" (for free from google, altavista, etc. . . they all post guidelines on their sites).  The book is FULL of typing and grammatical errors which causes me to question the credibility of the authors.  This information would be better off as one reviewer mentioned in a .pdf download for half the price.  Then, it MIGHT be worth it (no shipping charges this way and you don't expect as much).  Very little valuable content in this book. I wouldn't waste the money. I'm currently reading "Search Engine Visibility" which appears to have more value even if the price is higher.</span>
