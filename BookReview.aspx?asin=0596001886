                <span id="Label1">Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers have it all: an elegant language that offers object-oriented programming support, a readable, maintainable syntax, integration with C components, and an enormous collection of precoded standard library and extension modules.  Moreover, Python is  easy to learn but powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming challenges. But what Python programmers have lacked is one concise and clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance in how best to use Python's great power. Now <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> fills this need.    In the tradition of O'Reilly's "In a Nutshell" series, this book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language and its many modules.  This comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up all the most frequently needed information--not just about the Python language itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library and the most important third-party extensions.  <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> provides a solid, no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the most. This latest addition to the best-selling "In a Nutshell" series will immediately earn its place in any Python programmer's library.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I bought this book after working through Learning Python by Lutz and Ascher, and reading sections of other books.  It is now my #1 reference.  The examples are few, but well chosen to do more than just demonstrate the language.  They can show you why a particular syntax or technique is needed.  Often I waste a lot of time learning something I don't really need, like lambda functions.  By the time I have figured out that lambda functions are not some elegant new concept, just an awkward piece of syntax to do something simple, I've already spent too much time.  Alternatively, I decide that something like metaclasses are a waste, and miss something really elegant and useful.  Martelli's four pages on metaclasses capture better than anything I've read on the subject, exactly what metaclasses are good for and how they work.
<br />
<br />I think the dynamite combo for someone learning Python is both the Nutshell and the Learning book.  I would read the Nutshell chapter first ( assuming you have a little background in programming ) then work problems in Learning Python until you are comfortable.  Then re-read Nutshell, highlighting the key points you might need to re-learn in the midst of a rush project.  Python in a nutshell is the best distillation of Python wisdom I have seen anywhere.</span>

                    <span>I've made a complete switch to Python from Perl, and this book has been a very, very helpful resource in doing so.  I have owned several other O'Reilly's Nutshell books (C++, Linux, Perl, and Java) but never found them as useful as Python in a Nutshell.
<br />
<br />Sure, Python does have a rather decent online documentation, which is free, but I often find it hard to find the exact information I want even using the index.  Not the case with this Nutshell book; it covers the ground that you definitely need to know to get started early and do useful work immediately.  Writing is very lucid, too.  
<br />
<br />I only give four stars just because I didn't necessarily like the section on object-oriented coding basics.  I found Learning Python to be easier to understand in that regard.
<br />
<br />This is not the best book if you are a programming beginner, but if you are trying to add Python to your programming arsenal knowning other languages already, I highly recommend this book as your handy companion.</span>

                    <span>I expected this to be as comprehensive as the Java in a Nutshell books (i.e., to cover all standard modules/functions).  But the first time I crack the cover I can't even find 'signal' in the index.  Sure enough, there's no coverage at all of this utterly standard topic.  I had to look in Dave Beazley's book to get the info (there's a standard 'signal' module that's been in since at least python 2.0).<p>It seems like a crime for a reference book to be 600+ pages long and not get around to at least listing all the standard modules in the language.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book, without question. The question is whether it is worth the price, given the free online HTML reference documentation.<p>Pros:<br>+ Very nice typesetting. (Python Essential Reference is a bit small for eyes.)<br>+ Very good index; somewhat better than the online index.<br>+ Good explanations.<br>+ Some examples.<br>+ Much more advice than the online docs.<br>+ Most errata were corrected in the [09/03] printing. (I just received a [12/03] printing.)<p>Cons:<br>- Does not cover some of the most useful (new) modules: timeit, logging, zipimport, itertools, sets, sum, heapq.<br>- In particular, I would love to have ADVICE on how to use logging effectively.<br>- DOES cover the dead (insecure) modules rexec and Bastion.<p>So take your own decision. Personally, I would say it's not essential, but still worth the price. I go back and forth between the online index and this book.</span>

                    <span>Let me begin this review with a fair warning: this book is NOT for fresh programmers, hobbyists, system admins and other non-professional programmers out there, looking for a book that will actually help them LEARN Python language (even if the book has 4+ stars, it's still the O'Reilly Nutshell book). <br>(Btw. I know that, because I fit in all previously mentioned categories :-).<br>This book is (as title suggest) a QUICK reference of the Python language written by very competent author, I have no second thought about that, for already competent Python programmers that need good reference manual at hand.<br>I dare to say, that terse writing style, lack of examples and hard to follow explanations on some topics (without clear and simple code examples) will put off most of the new or intermediate programmers.<br>In my humble opinion this book is short for 200+ pages dedicated exclusively to code samples - I think examples in any reference book are as important as syntax and language explanations. <br>If you're already experienced programmer then you'll be more than satisfied with this book, just go ahead an click the button. If you're, on the other hand, starting to learn Python and need a good learning guide, I would recommend, that you begin with the book "Learning Python, 2 Edition" from O'Reilly.</span>
