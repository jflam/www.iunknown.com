                    <span>This book is a great book to read slowly and really digest what the author is offering.  In the middle of each chapter they have an area called "Reflection" and then there are personal stories of others and you can see what their learning has been.<p>I am currently in the process of going back and re-reading and really taking time on some great points made in the book.  Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I love a profound exploration of a topic as much as an experiential treatment. In his two books (This one co-authored with Cheryl Peppers and "The Stirring of Soul in the Workplace"), Alan gives us both. His first book delves into religious, mythological and psychological views of soul and how those help us discover our own soul when our inner self meets the outer world. This volume is filled with meditative and reflective ways to explore soul on a daily basis. The metaphor these book bring to mind is-please don't laugh-an Oreo cookie. You can eat the cream filling or the chocolate cookie. But eaten together...what a treat!<p>In his books and in his work, Alan describes how we must use the wholeness of life-the good and the bad...yin and yang-to understand the multiplicity of selves within us. Too often in organizations, we try to fractionalize ourselves and our work in ways that make exploring the wholeness difficult or impossible.<p>I highly recommend both of Alan's books.</span>

                    <span>In this book, Peppers and Briskin offer even more than insights into  enhancing our relationship with our work today, they offer guidance for  navigating our work as we will come to know it in the years ahead.<p>As  traditional, hierarchical work environments steadily give way to networked  nodes of information and action, the locus of control will shift from  outside of ourselves to inside.  By guiding us gently into our selves and  our own sources (and drains) of power, the authors provide important tools  to help us engage in a world of work in which we are inextricably linked  with one another.<p>I highly recommend this book for those who know that  the future is here.</span>
