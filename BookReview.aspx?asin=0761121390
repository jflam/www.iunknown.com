                    <span>Motivation of employees through rewards and recognition is critically important for organizational success. This topic is vital for supervisors, managers, executives, human resource professionals, business owners...the list goes on. Your power in this essential part of business is based on how much you know about what works, what doesn't work, and why. The more examples you can glean about what others are doing, the stronger you will be.<p>Nelson and Spitzer are internationally known experts in rewards and recognition. They both know their topic extremely well, and that high level of expertise comes out in this book. Readers familiar with the field will think they already have the answers if they have previous books written by these authors. Guess again!<p>This book is packed with information, insights, tips, ideas, case studies-you name it. Have you ever packed a suitcase so full that it was almost impossible to close it? That's the experience you'll have with this field book. You'll wonder how these gurus ever got this much stuff packed in between those two covers. Just a few pages of reading and you'll already be on information overload!<p>There are so many features in this publication, I'll probably not be able to name them all. (Do you hear enthusiasm in my review?) Case studies. End of chapter summaries. Good table of contents. Vignettes describing positive-and negative-experiences. Over 40 no-cost ideas. Worksheets. Resources. Training designs. Reminder cards. Comprehensive index. On and on and on. There are at least four separate books in these pages, all jammed into one tremendous resource. <p>Bob Nelson's "1001 Ways to Reward Employees" has sold over a million copies. This book is even more of a value...especially at the surprisingly modest price. There is no question that this volume will have an impact on readers and the organizations they serve. Even just modest application of the knowledge found in this tool chest will return many more times the investment of the purchase and the time to read all that the authors share.<p>Highly recommended.</span>
