                <span id="Label1">Edward Lazarus, a former Supreme Court clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun, spills the beans on an institution that values silence. Nobody is supposed to understand what happens behind the scenes of the high court--that's why the justices rarely speak to the media--but Lazarus tells all he knows from his time as a top aide to Blackmun in the Supreme Court's 1988 term. There's a lot of legal theory and history, but it's well presented and usually focuses on touchstone issues in U.S. politics; cases involving abortion, the death penalty, and racial preferences receive sustained treatment in these pages. There are gossipy bits, too, revealing unflattering details about several current justices. Sure to be one of the more controversial books of the year. <i>--John J. Miller</i></span>

                    <span>It is about time that someone brings sunlight to the inner workings of the Supreme Court.  In spite of his decidedly liberal political leanings, Lazarus provides an objective look at the inner workings of the supreme court circa 1988.  Lazarus does an excellent job of showing how the polarization of the Court has been detrimental to the pursuit of justice, just as the polarization of Congress has been detrimental to the legislative process.
<br />
<br />Although non-lawyers may find his writing a bit technical, particularly on esoteric legal issues, they will nonetheless appreciate his candid views on the justices' decisionmaking process.  
<br />
<br />And finally a challange to the critics who believe that Lazarus has betrayed his employer: Please explain why we are not entitled to know how the highest court in the land makes its decisions.   Congress has public hearings that are broadcast on CSPAN.  The President receives more media attention than any other person in the world (absent the late Princess Di) and his minions will write dozens of tell-all books after he leaves office.  Why should the Court be exempt from scrutiny?  If the justices are embarassed then maybe they should change their ways.</span>

                    <span>Given that a fairly large number of my classmates at Harvard had high aspirations of clerking on the Supreme Court, it was always surprising to me that none of them had read this book.  Reading through the (often unfair) reviews here, it is not surprising why.
<br />
<br />Several complaints of Lazarus' 'unfair' attitudes are evinced: Lazarus focuses on abortion, discrimination, and death penalty 'snapshots' from a legal historical perspective then turns to the inner workings of the court.
<br />
<br />Shallower readers more interested in Grisham or other fiction might object to Lazarus' description of the Scottsboro case: a legal reader wouldn't begin trying to understand death penalty litigation without that critical starting point.  Lazarus describes death penalty obstructionists as dueling with death penalty hawks - such as law clerks who threw parties when executions were carried out, while Marshall/Brennan clerks conducted vigils.
<br />
<br />After Woodward/Armstrong's scathing reviews of Blackmun in 'The Brethren,' one cannot fault Lazarus for striving to resuscitate Blackmun's career. After all, the man read deeply, thought profoundly, and cared tremendously about his legacy (which comes down, for better or worse, to Roe v. Wade).
<br />
<br />And this drives the large number of deprecatory reviews: people who hate Roe v. Wade will hate anything written about Blackmun with the slightest degree of fairness, deriding the author unfairly and underscoring his claims that closed, prejudiced (or at least, pre-judged) minds dominate, and only a few are willing to stand up to them.
<br />
<br />Particularly telling is the origin of the 'centrist' coalition - O'Connor, Kennedy, and temporarily, Souter - which stood against Marshall/Brennan/Stephens (the liberal wing) and Rehnquist/Scalia (the conservative wing).
<br />
<br />All of which is dull, tiresome reading for those looking for journalistic treatments of wheeling and dealing.  Those looking for such writing should turn to Woodward/Armstrong's 'The Brethren.'  Those looking for more informed history should turn to Morton Horwitz's treatises.  
<br />
<br />But for understanding the role of a clerk - the power and limits - as well as precious insights into Blackmun, an enigmatic jurist unloved by liberals or conservatives, and to read these treatments along with concise, and quite balanced legal history - this is a fine book.

                    <span>This book is noteworthy for 3 reasons: 1) There is surprisingly little written on the inner workings of the SC and this book provides a good deal of detail about it; 2) It provides stellar insights into the characters of the Justices themselves--something largely unknown even though they are arguably the most powerful people in the nation; and 3) It marks the court at a time where it was at its most volatile and subject to the greatest change with 5 Reagan-Bush appointees changing the makeup and direction of the court within a short period. <p>It does largely take a more liberal view of the issues.  I can look past that since he does the conservatives justice by elaborating on their perspective and how they perceive the issues based on their legal philosphies and the book is fair about it. Also, since he was on the side of the aged, liberal guard, it makes only sense his perspective would be skewed by his position, which he is not afraid to admit.  However, he does take a sort of middle ground approach bridging the gap between the neo-conservative justices (Scalia, Rehnquist) and the old libs of Brennan and Marshall.  <p>Its a good book.  Its not great.  But given the lack of other books on the subject with as much inside information, it definitely is one worth reading.  If you are interested in the law at all, take abortion or death penalty issues seriously, or just want to know how the SC operates, this book will not disappoint.</span>

                    <span>This book provides overwhelming evidence of how unelected, Leftists Supreme Court law clerks abuse their positions to make public policy. The author clerked for the late Justice Harry Blackmun who tried his best to incorporate Leftist values into the Constitution against the will of the vast majority of the American people. Lucky for us, Justices Scalia and Thimas have neutralized this vast left wing conspiracy. Like Carville, the author holds most Americans, including those reading this review, in utter contempt.</span>

                    <span>I agree with most of what the other reveiwers have written about this book.  It is a very well-written and accessible account of the Supreme Court and its development in recent times.  As another reviewer mentioned, Mr. Lazarus is honest about his liberal views and biases, and he is quite clear about which of his observations are accurate historical accounts and which are colored by his poilitical view. I found the book to be enjoyable and informative, and to contain some good basic explanations of how the Supreme Court works.</span>
