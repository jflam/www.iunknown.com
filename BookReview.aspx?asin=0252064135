                    <span>I was forced to read this book for my freshman university seminar on social change.  I regret every page.  My fellow classmates and I waded through the dense redundancy of this book for two weeks.  All that I learned in the 297 pages of this book could be summed up in one paragraph.  I understand this book may be excellent for sociology scholars, but undergrad music majors will not be so apreciative of all this book is attempting to say.  Professors, I beg you, please do not require this book for freshman reading.  Thank you.</span>

                    <span>An excellent source work for any serious students of lynching. This book was very helpful in my work as a graduate student and comes highly recommended by numerous professors of history in academic institutions. It helps to give insight into a part of American history at times ignored by the general public. Readers of this work may also look into writings of those as Leon Litwack for similar accounts of lynching, anti-black riots and general violence in post-Civil War to mid 20th century America. It is good academic as well as popular history.</span>

                    <span>This work by Tolnay & Beck has recieved many awards, but from reading this work I am not as impressed as others. The work begins with a strong review of the history of lynching. The reader is provided with numerous  facts and images of lynching and is provided with numerous case examples of  the poor soles who where victims of lynching.      The book quickly changes  from an adequate historical perspective to a neo-marxist critique of  American society. It holds merely one "insight", that economic  hard times led to higher rates of lynching. The book adheres to all the  necessary ingredients for being sucessful in the age of political  correctness. These include: a repressed people whose crimes were all  "alleged;" the Capitalist system as the oppressor; and an appeal  to Afrocentrism. With these influences, One is hard pressed to consider  this work as the "science" as it has been exaulted.      The book  is what the neo-marxist and the political correct community wishes to hear  which currently are the dominant force in social science as the 60s free  love scholars reach the apex of their power in American society.</span>
