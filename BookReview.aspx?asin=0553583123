                <span id="Label1">One nation taking a desperate gamble of war.<br>Another fighting for survival.<br><br>Two armies locked in a bloody cataclysm that will decide history. . .<br><br>David L. Robbins has won widespread acclaim for his powerful and splendidly researched novels of World War II. Now he casts his brilliant vision on one of the most terrifying--and most crucial--battles of the war: the Battle of Kursk, Hitler&#8217;s desperate gamble to defeat Russia, in the final German offensive on the eastern front.<br><br><b>Last Citadel<br><br></b>Spring 1943. In the west, Germany strengthens its choke hold on France. To the south, an Allied invasion looms imminent. But the greatest threat to Hitler&#8217;s dream of a Thousand Year Reich lies east, where his forces are pitted in a death match with a Russian enemy willing to pay any price to defend the motherland. Hitler rolls the dice, hurling his best SS forces and his fearsome new weapon, the Mark VI Tiger tank, in a last-ditch summer offensive, code-named Citadel.<br><br>The Red Army around Kursk is a sprawling array of infantry, armor, fighter planes, and bombers. Among them is an intrepid group of women flying antiquated biplanes; they swoop over the Germans in the dark, earning their nickname, &#8220;Night Witches.&#8221; On the ground, Private Dimitri Berko gallops his tank, the Red Army&#8217;s lithe little T-34, like a Cossack steed. In the turret above Dimitri rides his son, Valya, a Communist sergeant who issues his father orders while the war widens the gulf between them. In the skies, Dimitri&#8217;s daughter, Katya, flies with the Night Witches, until she joins a ferocious band of partisans in the forests around Kursk. Like Russia itself, the Berko family is suffering the fury and devastation of history&#8217;s most titanic tank battle while fighting to preserve what is sacred&#8211;their land, their lives, and each other&#8211;as Hitler flings against them his most potent armed force.<br><br>Inexorable and devastating, a company of Mark VI Tiger tanks is commanded by one extraordinary SS officer, a Spaniard known as la Daga, the Dagger. He&#8217;d suffered a terrible wound at the hands of the Russians: now he has returned with a cold fury to exact his revenge. And above it all, one quiet man makes his own plan to bring Citadel crashing down and reshape the fate of the world.<br><br>A remarkable story of men and arms, loyalty and betrayal, <b>Last Citadel</b> propels us into the claustrophobic confines of a tank in combat, into the tension of guerrilla tactics, and across the smoking charnel of one of history&#8217;s greatest battlefields. Panoramic, authentic, and unforgettable, it reverberates long after the last cannon sounds.</span>

                    <span>This is an extremely well written work. Like the British historian-novelist David Howarth, David Robbins is able to take an enormous yet isolated incident and wrap it around three separate stories, a Spanish officer in the German Panzer Division trying to recapture his dignity after a near fatal shooting the year before, a young Russian woman trying to find her pilot lover shot down behind enemy lines, and a father and son on both sides of Russian Communism incarcerated in tight, hellish quarters in a Russian T-34 Tank during the Battle of Kursk in July of 1943.<P>All this unfolds in the largest tank battle ever culminating with the American invasion of Sicily on July 11, 1943.<P>You don't have to be a WWII buff to be thoroughly mesmerized by this book, but as in reading an Alan Furst novel, it helps. Professor Robbins deftly paints an accurate view of Hitler's last stand in Russia after the savage defeat of the Germans at Stalingrad, rolling the dice before the Americans enter the war in Europe, thereby turning his near impossible two front war into the resulting three front war.<P>Yet Robbins does this with beautiful writing. At one point he describes a train station where a passenger train lays in wait while tracks are replaced from a bombing 12 hours earlier: "It had no roof left, just scored beams, and it's sills were marred with brows of soot." Later Katya, about whom one of the stories revolves, awakens before her night mission as some other aircraft take off. "Once they took off [she] listened to the silence return . . . serrated only by crickets and a mechanic hammering at something stubborn."<P>While telling his stories the description of the battle takes on a more vivid meaning as the reader has humans to appreciate as Churchill wrote, 'their blood, sweat and tears.'<P>An excellent novel. Rarely are we so intrigued about historical events that involve no Americans, on a plain in the Ukraine we never heard of, with the names of players for the most part we can't pronounce.<P>Kudos to David Robbins. 5 stars. Easily 6 or 7. Larry Scantlebury</span>

                    <span>David Robbins' Last Citadel is one of the most compelling, exciting and impressive novels I've read in years. I can't remember the last time I read a book like this, one I literally couldn't put down. The epic backdrop of the battle for Kursk - where Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany engaged in history's largest and bloodiest battle - serves as an unforgettable stage, meticulously researched and panoramically rendered. Amazingly, the intense conflicts of the novel's characters exist larger than the titanic clash playing out behind them. Dimitri Berko, once a Cossack, now drives a Russian tank alongside his Communist son, still trying to teach a young man who no longer thinks he needs the wisdom of his father, hoping for one final chance of communion before the two of them face almost certain death. At the same time, Dimitri's daughter, Katya, guides Russian bombers to German targets, a "Night Witch" circling overhead. The stakes couldn't be higher for this family at war. Luis De Vega, the Spanish bullfighter commanding Germany's invincible Tiger tank, rolls closer and closer to Dimitri and Valentin, seething from past wounds, more dangerous than the stabbed bulls he once drove to the ground. The complexity of Abram Breit, a Nazi SS officer turned spy for the Russians, is particularly striking - a man who sees his apocalyptic world reflected in the work of the Cubist painters of his time, broken down into key universal elements that transcend both war and politics. The last battle scene is absolutely riveting, in itself worth the price of admission. The Last Citadel is a grand-slam novel, perfect.</span>

                    <span>In a previous historical novel, THE WAR OF THE RATS, author David Robbins took us to the 1942 siege of Stalingrad on World War Two's Eastern Front, one usually paid scant attention by American readers who perhaps believe that U.S. won the European war single-handed. It didn't, you know. Now, in LAST CITADEL, Robbins returns to the Eastern Front for history's greatest tank battle.<P>It's July 1943, and Hitler throws one last roll of the dice against the USSR with a major armored offensive designed to capture the city of Kursk. America is about to invade Italy, and Germany must knock the Soviets out of the war, or at least stabilize that front, before having to withdraw some of its forces from the East to reinforce the Mediterranean theater.<P>Whereas in THE WAR OF THE RATS, the confrontation in Stalingrad's rubble was between two master snipers, one German and one Russian, the LAST CITADEL evolves into the ultimate confrontation in a field of sunflowers between two tank crews, one German in the awesome Tiger tank and one Russian in the smaller but faster T-34. <P>The Tiger is commanded by SS Captain Luis Ruiz de Vega of the 1st SS Panzergrenadiers, one of three SS armored divisions spearheading the German assault. De Vega originally came to fight for the Nazis with the Spanish Blue Division, lent to Hitler by Franco in 1941. Having lost half his stomach to a Russian sniper during the siege of Leningrad, de Vega was rewarded with a commission in the SS. Now, bitter, constantly hungry, increasingly emaciated, and emotionally dead, Luis dreams only of returning to Spain a war hero.<P>The T-34 is commanded by Sgt. Valentin Berko, but its soul is its driver, Cpl. Dimitri Berko, Valentin's father. Dimitri is an old Cossack who's fought against the Czar, Trotsky's Red Army, and now the Germans. The elder Berko loves his son dearly, but is disgusted with the latter's unquestioning dedication to Communism. But the two together make a formidable fighting team.<P>In THE WAR OF THE RATS, a five-star novel, subplots added to the overall storyline, especially as military sniping involves a lot of waiting for the perfect shot. In contrast, several subplots in LAST CITADEL only serve as unnecessary distractions. Dimitri's daughter, Katya, is a bomber pilot attached to the Night Witches, who fly biplanes so slow and flimsy that they can only operate at night. Her boyfriend, Leonid, also a pilot, but in a modern squadron, is shot down. Attempting a landing behind enemy lines to rescue him, Katya crashes, and subsequently falls in with a group of Russian partisans, which has an unidentified traitor in its midst. In the meantime, SS Colonel Abram Breit, is spying for the Soviet's Lucy network. <P>Had Robbins focused entirely on the tank engagements of the Kursk battle, his book, in my opinion, would have been leaner, meaner, and better. In any case, his description of going to war in the Tiger and T-34 makes for an absorbing and informative read.</span>

                    <span>The Last Citadel is fast-paced military fiction with its soul in the stars. The author gets the details right, but does not obsess over the grade of lead in the bullets, or the chemical composition of the propellants. Instead, he takes the swirling Battle of Kursk, millions of men and thousands of machines, and pulls it into focus as the ancient tale of a single man facing an immortal monster. <P>Leathery old Dimitri is armored with little more than his Kazak honor, and his T-34 seems like cardboard against Hitler's latest superweapon, the massive Tiger tank. This is classic stuff disguised as hot-running fiction. Author David L. Robbins is not out to take Tom Clancy's lunch, he's trying to catch Hemingway and Steinbeck. The Battle of Hill 260.8 will make you stand up and cheer, and the Award of the Order of Buttons is a most perfect recognition of battle honors. These two scenes combine into one of the most powerful passages ever written, in any language.</span>

                    <span>Before this book, I had given up on military adventure novels. Granted, they can be exciting when things go "BOOM!", but to get to that you gotta wades through chapters upon chapters of bland dialogue, blander characters, hackneyed prose and jingoistic posturings.<P>Last Citadel is welcome discovery for me. It features nuanced and interesting characters from both sides, well-written scenes of the tense preludes to battle, followed by visceral and breathless scenes of unimaginable violence.<P>Robbins successfully evoked the epic scope of the Battle of Kursk, while also let the readers experiences the titanic battles in the cramped and smoke-filled interior of tanks. The books is meticulously researched, from the technical specs of tanks to the lives of the soldiers. These details are incorporated in a mostly unobstrusive way that enrich our understanding of what it is like to be Russian/German soldiers shut in the belly of steel beast trying to kill or be killed in a battlefield of millions. This is a book written by a WWII buff for WWII buffs.</span>
