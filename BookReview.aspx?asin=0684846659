                    <span>I think that this book is high on bestsellers list just because of the author's name. Many have probably bought the book just because they had already read "The 7 Habits..." The other thing that comes to my mind is that Mr. Covey has decided that it is time to publish another book and as a result he produced "The 8th Habit" which cannot be compared with his passed performance at all. I advise to first get the original "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" (if you do not have it yet) and borrow "The 8th Habit" from the library. If you still decide that it is worth it, buy then. A book that I suggest instead is Can We Live 150 Years? by M. Tombak. </span>

                    <span>I've long been a 7 Habits fan and I enjoyed this book, as it added another important piece to the puzzle of personal excellence. I also enjoyed reading Dr. Covey's thoughts on developments since his first book came out more than 20 years ago.
<br />
<br />Another book I'd like to recommend is "The Emotional Intelligene Quick Book." Dr. Covey speaks about this concept in the 8th Habit and when I saw his endorsement on the cover of the Quick Book at the store I decided to give it a read. It's really great and a nice companion to the 8th Habit.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>     When I first picked up Covey's book, I was excited. I could tell that it was packed with lots of wisdom,and what seemed like a lot of practical advice. Though I was correct that the book contains an abundance of wisdom, it was the practical part that I had wrong.
<br />    
<br />    In Covey's first chapter, he discusses the information age, and how it is going to lead to the "age of wisdom". It seemed like a stretch to me..like he had read it somewhere and just expected the reader to take it as a fair postulate. I figured this abstract talk would make more sense after I got into the book. Unfortunatley, that's the way I felt after every chapter. 
<br />
<br />Although this book has many exteremly valuable insights, it seems to strip ideas to their bare bones, taking whole books worth of information and cramming it into each chapter. This means not clearly describing what it is he is trying to say to the reader, not giving any support for the ideas, and failing to give all of the practical advice needed to follow them up.        
<br />    
<br />Covey does make a desperate attempt to rope all of his ideas together, so that they look coherent. He plays on a subject he picked up from a fabulous book, "The power of full engagement" (Of course, he tried to cram most everything he learned from that book into one chapter). However, he takes the ideas of the "4 dimensions" of humans (mind, body, spirit and emotions) to an extreme, and suggests that every aspect of life, including organizations, have a mind, heart, body and spirit. This, apparently, was his idea of connecting all of his chapters.
<br />    
<br />This book was packed with wisdom, but it was waaay too much for anyone to handle. Not only that, but Covey's determination to make life a big puzzle that he himself had solved, sadly fails (but how i wish it were true). By trying to oversimplify everything he knows into one gigantic (yet "simple") system, he ends up not being able to expand on anything. This makes all of his admittedly good insights extremely abstract and impossible to apply. This book may be good as a business encyclopedia, but i believet that in order to get any practical use out of it, the reader must look into Covey's resources and try and hammer out just what it was he was trying to communicate.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Ok I'll admit, I didn't read the first 7 Habits but when I found the 8th at the library, I figured I'd get right to the point.  I can imagine copies of this book have logged many frequent flyer miles, with middle-upper management types studying earnestly while sitting in seat 29B, on their way to Corporate Headquarters.
<br />
<br />As I'm not in the a corporate/business world, I really lost interest in the book.  There could be one or two brilliant points per chapter that could be applied to personal life, but I don't think I'm very keen on paddling through to find them.  If you can get through the overhead projector/PowerPoint-style illustrations (very dry, very dull) then you might find parts of this book to be of use. I think Covey is banking on his name, rather than the content, to move copies.</span>
