                <span id="Label1">Many programmers can recall a moment when they first felt like a minor deity. My introduction to such hubris-laden megalomania was when I wrote a Modula-2 program to simulate the population dynamics of two competing bird species. I knew better, but it really felt like those digital birds were alive, even though they were represented simply by columns of numbers on a printout! Though now older and slightly wiser, part of me still longs to create even more complex, visual and 3D worlds in the computer, and I envy programmers whose first mythopoeic moment is in creating a VR world. <P> One of these days I'll get back to making VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) virtual worlds either for legitimate work or for the sheer euphoria of creating simulated worlds. A year ago, the obvious choice was Pesce's <B>VRML</B>; currently, I'd recommend <B> VRML Handbook</B>, written by staff members of Silicon Graphics who clearly know whereof they speak.</span>

                    <span>Well, I could have started talking about the book and how nicely written it was, but first, I believe you should ponder if learning virtual reality  technology would really add some 'plus' to your CV. <br> VRML was a good  idea that could not survive to Macromedia Flash and 3D Studio tachnical  marriage through Vecta 3D. Until 1999 when Vecta 3D, the 3d studio plugin  that exports 3D studio files to Flash animation, was created and a bunch of  other minor programs also intended to produce 3D animation for the Web  popped out, VRML seemed a good alternative to the interactivity we all  missed. I myself bought this book in 1998 and was impressed with the  quantity of sites that were using VRML. I remember Cosmo had a wonderful  page full of demo software and I had all of them, Blaxxun was and still is  one of the major exponents of that technology and I was constantly visiting  their page for plugin updates. But soon, Cosmo pages could not be reached  anymore and all that software simply disappeared into the far distant world  of SGI platforms. At that time, there was a boom of chats and virtual  worlds and each one of them seemed to be programmed in a different way with  a different language than VRML, you could settle in one of these worlds but  you could not create your own furniture, or design your garden with the  pictures of your own real life house garden. You could not add your own  touch, you had to pay to be there and you did not have a place to put what  you designed.<br>Then it came the final cut, SGI simply removed the city it  had created for the book, the case study simply disappeared. In a certain  point-of-view, it is kind of immoral that a company still sell a book they  do not back up anymore. <br>I would really appreciate to know where I can  find the great Tenochtitlan, the SGI virtual capital of VRML vanished along  with Cosmo and all other VRML paramounts.<br>If you still think you do not  want to learn Flash, to what I strongly advise Graphics, Animation and  Interactivity with Flash 4.0 by Mohler and afterwards sneak into the world  of 3D, I tell you why you should buy this book on VRML. <br> 1. It is not  based on software but hand written code.<br> 2. It is not difficult to  follow as said by a reviewer here, it is quite easy, project based and  gives you freedom to deploy your own project. If you run into something  difficult you can continue your project (mine was a temple where people  could find details of my life) using simple programming.<br> 3. You do not  need to know absolutely nothing of programming, this book deals with pure  VRML in a very simple way.<br> Unfortunately you will not find most of the  urls listed in the book, due to the fact that this language is getting more  and more rare on the web. I was tempted to send all to hell and give one  star but this book does not deserve it. I give five stars to Macromedia and  Kinetix/Discreet for the alternative to VRML (there is a lot more to be  done but we are getting there), five stars to the authors who wrote it as  one, 1 star (and that is a lot) to SGI for being incompetent in maintaining  the attention the ones who bought and are still buying the book  deserve  and being dishonest by offering a book whose links and case study are not  available anymore.</span>

                    <span>As mentioned before by other customers, the URL for the case study cannot be found.  This book has been recommended by a professor teaching computer graphics, which is why I purchased it.  Not finding this code on the web as  promised infuriates me.  Time is of the essence in classroom assignments  and wasting time searching for something that turns out not to be there is  frustrating.  SGI, Hartman and Wernecke should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book recently (although in computing book terms it is old - being published in 1996). It had some good reviews. The book is not for the complete beginner to IT. Some experience of VRML 1.0 or HTML or other  programming systems is needed. I am an experienced programmer of 30 years  with Web and other IT skills.<p>The book relies very heavily on a case  study whose URL is given in the book; And herein lies the problem with this  book - the case study is no longer available at the given URL or anywhere  else. Despite extensive searches on the web and in newsgroups (with many  helpful suggestions) the case study has disappeared. The publishers were  unable to help and stated 'political issues'.<p>The book should be bought  with extreme caution. It would take the most determined devotee to gain the  maximum benefit from the book since some of the case study is not printed  in the book. It might be wise for the publishers to either withdraw the  book or sell the book at a reduced price with a warning. All publishers  should ensure that software supporting a book should be either available at  the publisher's web site where they can have control over it, or issued on  a CD-Rom with the book.<p>The book may be a worthwhile purchase but I am  unable to say as I am not yet the 'most determined devotee'. The Star  Rating above is arbitrary. I would have preferred to have left it blank. I  shall be looking for another book to help me learn VRML.</span>

                    <span>VRML nowadays is a powerful tool to comunicate in a visual form to thowsands of web users. The way the authors wrote this book really motivates the reader to start a journey into the VRML standard. No deep CG  knowledge is needed to understand the contents.
