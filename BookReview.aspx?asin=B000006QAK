They have  revolutionized our lives and our world, making previously unthinkable tasks automatic  and linking people together around the planet. Join MODERN MARVELSTM for a  fascinating look at the history of the computer.  See Charles Babbage's Victorian  "counting machine," a mechanical computer that produced perfect results for any  mathematical problem of six figures or less.  Discover how IBM was launched with a  punch-card counting machine built to speed the 1890 census.  Trace the technological  advancements that led to the first true modern "computers" and the rapid progress that  saw computers shrink from room-sized monsters to the desktop units that are  revolutionizing life in the '90s.</span>

                    <span> Although the material on this tape chronologically ends in 1995, in terms of value, it is timeless. It starts with Charles Babbage in the 1820's, a man who was literally 100 years ahead of his time. His ideas for the difference engine were revolutionary, but still a continuation of previous work in calculators. However, the ideas used in the design of the analytical engine were not reused for 100 years. They were so advanced, that the additional material included in the descriptions written by Ada, Countess of Lovelace, is considered to be the first description of a computer program. Ada is considered to have been the first computer programmer, and her work so respected that a programming language has been named for her.
<br /> The next significant computing step that is covered is the 1890 census in the United States. Collecting and collating the data had become such a monumental task that the 1880 census was still not complete in 1887. Desperate for a solution, the census held a competition and Herman Hollerith was declared the winner. His punched card solution allowed the census bureau to complete the tabulation of the 1890 census in six weeks. The chronology then continues to describe how Hollerith eventually expands his data tabulation machines into the expanding railroad industry. As the American economy expanded, the amount of rail traffic was so great that the railroads were facing a bookkeeping bottleneck. Although he almost fell to the level of bankruptcy, Hollerith was able to persevere and demonstrate how machinery could be used in general data collection. 
<br /> The next historical point covered is the great leap in computing that occurred in World War II. The German military considered their Enigma encryption machine to be unbreakable. This blind faith turned out to be a weakness, as the Germans never took any additional precautions. However, an Enigma machine was in the hands of the British and they used their knowledge to reduce the possibilities down to a number where all could be tested. In England, the Colossus machine was built, it was a specialized computer that could test all possibilities and crack the code. 
<br /> The next historical point is also related to the war, but this time on the American side of the Atlantic. American ground forces needed tables used in the firing of artillery pieces and the human computers could not produce them fast enough. John Mauchly and Presper Eckert, two electrical engineers at the Moore School of Engineering built the Eniac, a brute of a machine that was very effective, but only during those short periods when it worked. 
<br /> John Von Neumann is responsible for the next breakthrough examined. He authored a paper arguing that the computer should be constructed to that it could run many different programs, all of which would be stored in memory. He also described a design where memory, processors and input/output devices were separate. An amusing historical note in the history of computing is when the Univac computer predicts an Eisenhower landslide in the 1952 election, but the CBS network doesn't believe the results and downplays them. They are forced into a sheepish admission when it turns out that the computer was right and the humans wrong. 
<br />Thomas Watson Jr. retells a second amusing incident when he states that an insurance customer forced IBM into the computer business. The customer told them that the punched cards describing their customer base was literally taking over their building and they needed a better way to process the data.       
<br /> The race into space between the United States and the Soviet Union was the major impetus for the tremendous strides in miniaturization that took place in the 1960's. Engineers realized very early in the space program that any trip to the moon and back would require a computer on board the spacecraft that was as powerful as those that currently took up entire rooms. Most of the major steps that drove the dramatic shrinking are covered, including the next steps that created the integrated circuit and the microprocessor. The last events covered are a short description of Xerox Parc and the creation of the Apple computer by Steven Wozniack and Steven Jobs. 
<br /> The historical record of the computer from the original ideas of Charles Babbage to the modern personal computer is one of the greatest success stories in the history of technology. While only a few of the steps on that journey are covered on this tape, they are the true high points of the story. It is a document that should be viewed by all computer science students. It will also be of interest to business students as it shows them how necessity has led to the invention of equipment necessary for business to move forward.
