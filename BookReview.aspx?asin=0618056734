                <span id="Label1">Did Newton "unweave the rainbow" by reducing it to its prismatic colors, as Keats contended? Did he, in other words, diminish beauty? Far from it, says acclaimed scientist Richard Dawkins; Newton's unweaving is the key to much of modern astronomy and to the breathtaking poetry of modern cosmology. Mysteries don't lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries. <BR>     With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a best-selling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder.<BR>     This is the book Richard Dawkins was meant to write: a brilliant assessment of what science is (and isn't), a tribute to science not because it is useful but because it is uplifting.</span>

                    <span>I applaud the scrupulous research and integrity that went into the making of this book, and the warmth and generosity (and righteous indignation when necessary) of its tone. "Unweaving the Rainbow" will become a classic, sections excerpted into anthologies to be taught as examples of clear, rational content and of powerful, persuasive, and effective prose.<P>Bravely, honestly, logically, with good humor and grace, Dawkins stands up for what he believes. And he believes that the study of science is essential for helping us to understand and appreciate ourselves and others and the world around us: why we do what we do, feel the way we feel; how the laws of nature work and what that means to the way we live our lives. If I could sum up the message of twentieth-century literature (which I have taught at the university level for nearly thirty years now) in one sentence, it would be the same poignant conclusion that Dawkins reaches in this book of science: We are able to care for each other and the world more deeply when we realize we are all we've got, and our time here is brief indeed: "The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the 	highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep 	aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can 	deliver. It is truly one of the things that makes life worth living and 	it does so, if anything, MORE effectively if it convinces us that the 	time we have for living it is finite." [caps mine]<P>Science can reveal why we do what we do, feel the way we feel. All of us in different countries, unlike in so many ways - Dawkins shows us a common ground, a way to touch each other's lives in communication, a way to live lives of exuberant celebration. Poetry tells the story of what it means to be human in this particular time and this particular place, universal connections between all the things in the world and all the people. So does this exhilarating book of science, which (like listening to Beethoven's "Ode to Joy") makes me happy to be alive.<P>As a poet and teacher of creative writing (the headline above is taken from one of my Darwin poems), I find the POETRY of Unweaving to be as good as any being written anywhere today - and better than much of it. I would give anything to have described "the thread . . . by which our existence hangs" as "wincingly tenuous" ( 2). The joy of those last two words, one sound briefly kissing the other and passing gracefully on, my favorite kind of rhyme and devilishly difficult to accomplish.<P>The diction: "A fawn's pelage is a painting of the dappled pattern of sunlight filtered through trees onto the woodland floor" (240).<P>The metaphors and similes: "[Scientists] assist the imagination back to the hot birth of time and forward to the eternal cold . . ." (16). I have given birth, and "hot" is le mot juste. How beautifully intuitive he is: how else could a male know? A perfect analogy weds the factually accurate (literal truths) with the non-factually accurate (figurative truths). And Dawkins calls always for accuracy. That's where he departs from those who insist on holding on to an [eternal]- life preserver, the supernatural faith of their childhoods, instead of taking the trouble to build, plank by thoughtful plank, a boat that will float in real water. He understands and sympathizes with their needs - most of the book is devoted to explaining how such delusions are born of our very natural "appetite for wonder." But their needs (and all the false analogies in the world) cannot turn wishful thinking into fact, cannot unwrite the laws of nature. When I was a child, I thought as a child; as an adult, I want to put away believing that childish (irrational) things are reality, while maintaining a child-like (imaginative) sense of curiosity and awe. "Unweaving the Rainbow" helps me do both.<P>The humor: how the skin of a squid behaves like an LED screen, and "the skinflicks it shows are spectacular" (7). "The total area of membranous structure inside one of us works out at more than 200 acres. That's a respectable farm" (9).<P>The eloquence of Unweaving goes on and on, every page with the teeming abundance of a Burgess Shale. BUT (I can tell you as a writer) such a work can evolve only by "gradual accumulation," many drafts ending in the trash can, many excursions down dead-end streets. No "long-jump mutations." No "top- down" inspiration. Just hard work and perspiration here on the ground.<P>A few readers might say he treads on their cherished flowers (some of these flowers being "wild" indeed); but most will thrill to the way he treads on the weeds of superstition and ignorance, plants new seeds of thought to bloom in our minds, points out new "flowers" of beauty in the natural world that we had not noticed before.<P>Thank you, Richard Dawkins, for sharing with us your extraordinary mind, your passionate quest for honesty and accuracy, your perceptive awareness of the importance of human relationships - and most of all for this splendid rendering of the natural world.</span>

                    <span>A fabulous book on a fabulous subject, in this book Richard Dawkins continues his understandable explanations of natural selection and evolution while at the same time championing the cause of science in a society obsessed with aesthetics and poetry.<P>The general scientific topics he explores I felt made the book a LITTLE less reachable than his other works. Chapters 3-5 particularly go into scientific areas one feels that Dawkins himself doesn't wholely understand and therefore you feel as if you're trusting him that he's getting the explanation right.<P>However he does his best and his best is better than most! Also he should be forgiven for delving deep into a variety of subjects considering his applaudable goal of showing without-a-doubt the poetic and aesthetic brilliance that can and SHOULD be found in science of all kinds.<P>While I feel that the book was sadly lacking in his wonderful writing on the topics of religion and theology (most of the time he touches on these topics only to make the point that statistics and mathematics are more reliable) it still accomplishes his point of showcasing the wonders of sciences often assumed to be dull and lifeless.<P>A wonderful read for anybody looking for the pizazze in science and fact that is generally believed only to be found in fairy tales and illusions.</span>

                    <span>As someone who enjoyed this book in particular, and who enjoys books on science in general, I am bewildered by some of its very negative reviews. I am however conscious of some of its limitations. One reason might be that this otherwise wonderful book covers so many different ideas, and often unevenly. I could see why it would be easy to have unmet expectations. So it is helpful first to be clear about some of the topics this book is NOT fundamentally about: a systematic exposition of the scientific method; the history of science; the mind-body debate; evolutionary biology (not particularly, even though this is the author?s specialty); and how poets and artists might do a better job in their works of representing science.<P>Even if the somewhat meandering manner of the book does not upset you, you might be upset by Dawkins? rhetorical style (I was not) . You might prefer more subtlety to his no-holds-barred approach to labeling some of the enemies of good science. The catalogue includes: ?pseudo-scientists?.populist dumbing down?hostility from academics sophisticated in fashionable disciplines?purveyors of cultural relativism?few vocal fifth columnists within science?.? He has no compunction in bemoaning a lack of either understanding or appreciation of science from many of the titans of the world of arts and poetry including Coleridge, Keats, and Ruskin, among others. <P>So, why is this a worthy read? I believe it is because Dawkins tackles a subject which is fundamental to what it means to be human. It is also a subject which few writers, scientists or non-scientists, handle well: why good science can (and should) be a pleasurable and passionate pursuit, for both scientists and non-scientists. Dawkins would like to think that enjoying science could be like enjoying music even if one does not play an instrument ? a view I find very encouraging.<P>This book is a spirited attempt to rescue us from the misplaced view that science is at odds with aesthetics. Dawkins makes no apologies for clearly distinguishing how scientists can view the world differently from poets, without losing an appreciation of beauty. QUOTE The mystic is content to bask in the wonder and revel in a mystery that we were not meant to understand. The scientist feels the same wonder but is restless, not content; recognizes the mystery as profound, then adds, ?But we?re working on it.? UNQUOTE<P>Even if poets and scientists may view mystery and beauty differently, Dawkins holds that ?the spirit of wonder which led Blake to Christian mysticism, Keats to Arcadian myth and Yeats to Fenians and fairies is the very same that moves great scientists..? I can sympathize with Dawkins? lament with the distortions of science we can find in poetry, because he demonstrates the scientists? appreciation of artistic endeavor in an ability to reconstruct poetic passages completely in scientific terms. I was moved by one stanza he quotes which I reproduce here:<P>To see a world in a grain of sand,<BR>And a heaven in a wild flower,<BR>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand.<BR>And eternity in an hour<P>When he wrote the above four lines, William Blake could not have been expected in 1803 to anticipate new concepts of space and time and discoveries of quantum physics. And cosmology in twentieth century science. Yet, we can today marvel at his stanza and cherish these lines while understanding them completely in terms of modern science, which stikes me as a remarkable product of human artistic and scientific achievement.<P>The title of the book refers to Keats' lament of Sir Issac Newton's use of prisms to decompose the components of white light, supposedly because this experiment destroyed a sense of beauty and wonder related to observing the rainbow. It is clearly emblematic of how such poetic lament is at odds with the sheer wonder that scientific discoveries such as Neton's can evoke. It was this discovery, together with those of later scientists, which have led us to understand in the twentieth century how we are part of a much larger universe than humans previously imagined, which is expanding, and which is made up of the same common material everywhere, and has revealed to us even greater mysteries that we could not have previously imagined.<P>For adults who may have acquired a distaste of science from unfortunate early school experiences, this book may restore a sense of wonder and beauty to this endeavor. Or, by offering some wonderful imagery to convey some simple but important scientific idea, this book may help adults and children dialogue about science in an accessible way. For example, the author compares the time scale of biological evolution to the span between the fingertips of left and right hands when both arms are outstretched in a gesture of open embrace. The epoch when simple celled organisms and bacteria were the only form of life forms the large bulk of this span, with dinosaurs only appearing at the point in the upper part of the right palm, and human beings appear only at the very fingertips! <P>This book reminds us of that unfortunate chasm in our culture between poetic or artistic expression and scientific endeavor. I confess that as an advocate of greater scientific literacy among the general public, I would be happy to see more of this genre.</span>

                    <span>Let's assume that Gould is right in his observation that the Burgess Shell is a testimony to an incredibly hectic period diversification, on a different time scale from what we experience now. The high rate of change in life forms (new phyla "bursting") in the period leading to the Cambrian and through its early stages surely doesn't have to mean large evolutionary "jumps", but rather a different "natural frequency" of the standard, gradual evolution process by the tried and true Darwinian mechanism. What has to be explained is the causes of the different rate. It is quite safe to postulate that this rate is determined by the feedback between different parts of the Darwinian mechanism, just as is the case for other cyclic phenomena. The cycle in this instant is the generation and elimination of life forms. It seems that the current rate is "optimize" to populate every possible ecological niche, but that does not mean it's the one and only possible rates. On the contrary. Different ecological situation surely must influence this rate. For example, in a resource-rich and under-populated environment, such as a "virgin" island, mutations that normally would be considered "unfit", will survive. This is the conventional rationalization behind the "Explosion" metaphor, if you don't take it to mean "instantaneous", just incredibly fast. So it boils down to the question the speed of the evolutionary process and what controls it.<P>We know the engine of change and mechanism of "Quality Control" by which most of the changes are rejected. Those two work as a superbly coordinated team' at least as far as the end result is concerned. Evolution might be a blind watchmaker, but also a very successful one. Creationists may even ask who created the watchmaker! In other words, how come that the parameters of the evolutionary process have the values that actually produce evolution? We surly reject the "Intelligent Design" type of answers, but that does not free us from the need to provide a satisfactory scientific answer. Which brings me to speculate, that the apparent correspondence between the different parts of the evolutionary equation is too well fine-tuned to escape the conclusion that the evolutionary mechanism itself evolved in a similar process. The blind watchmaker was fine-tuned by a blind watchmaker - and it's not a meaningless recursion. <P>We all know the essential ingredients of the formula used to tune natural evolution: <BR>1. The conservative force of genetic inheritance, operating like gravity on pendulum<BR>2. The erratic drive of mutation, generating the required perturbations from stasis, pushing the pendulum in every possible way<BR>3. The environment enhancing the successful "modes of oscillation" to be conserved, as in a resonant mechanism, and rejecting the non-resonant modes.<P>(The clockwork metaphor is intentional, but should not be take to imply one-to-one correspondence between the two mechanisms. It's just "poetics"' hopefully a good one.)<P>In the Pre-Cambrian environment, the initial survival rate of new mutant was presumably higher, but not for a long time. Soon enough, the available resources must have been fully utilized and the Darwinian competition begun. The conventional rationalization about overly abundant environment can't be justified in geological time-scale. However, the mutation rate and the conservative constrains of the genetic mechanism could be quite different than what we see now. Actually, even today we do see a great variation in mutation (successful ones too!) rate between different life forms. For example, certain microbes mutate before out eyes almost day to day. With a much higher rate of evolution than we experience today in multi-cellular life forms, it would seems that phyla were "invented" during the Pre-Cambrian in a very short geological time span, requiring large successful "jumps", while actually the great many steps required to accomplish the transition just happened very quickly. But the environment is the "negative" aspect of the Darwinian process, culling the unfit, not the "positive" force blindly experimenting in new life forms. To understand the "explosion" we must allow for a different equilibrium of checks-and-balances between the conservative and the mutating forces in the genetic mechanism itself, namely the copying of DNA.<P>Of the many "exotic" life forms populating the Pre-Cambrian world, few survived. The new environmental condition narrowed the criteria for passing the survival test, a change that was mirrored in the optimal balance between conservation and change in the selection formula for the genetic material (DNA, RNA, what have you) and its associated molecular mechanism. Gone were the days when sloppy copying was tolerated - even encouraged - by the QA department. The fast mutating life forms lost to the ones based on a very pedantic DNA copy machine. The conservatives won the day and the wild variation of gene-inheritance alternatives dwindled to one. Only phyla that adapted this mechanism survived. This mechanism is so biased towards conservatism, that no new phyla could arise since it came to dominate file. The explosion deserves its name only if you assume that the current mechanism is what always was - an idea as absurd as assuming that the species themselves are what they always were.<P>In other words, we have to apply the Darwinian adaptation mechanism to the molecular infrastructure underlying the genes, as we do to the genes themselves, in order to understand the fine-tuning of the evolutionary rate we see today. In the early stages of the evolution of multi-cellular life form, before low mutation rate was selected (frequency-locked) by natural selection, the appearance of radically new life forms took just millions of years, rather than hundreds of millions. The natural selection of gene conservation mechanism was affected, probably, by selecting the very stable and predictable DNA/RNA one over alternatives (for example "horizontal" transfer of genes, as in bacteria) and all the other parts of the fine molecular dance of the genes. You may think of this as the mirror process to the one leading to the selection of sexual strategy. The later was selected to enrich the variation after the first fixed the rate at a too low value relative to environmental changes. <P>To summarize, what I'm trying to propose is that the same logical thinking that make Classic Darwinian evolution inhabitable apply also to the evolution of the genetic mechanism underlying the Darwinian process. It couldn't be as good as we experience it now if it didn't undergo a multi-staged fine-tuning under selective forces. Once this postulate is accepted, the "Cambrian Explosion" becomes a legitimate part of evolutionary orthodoxy.</span>

                    <span>The last review by Ryan answers the question posed by the previous review by Kevin, as many times as a book is published that goes over these same grounds there will be those who fail, deliberately or otherwise, to understand the points being made.<P> To those who complain that Dawkins is reducing humans to a collection of synapses the answer if you read anything that Dawkins has ever written is that yes we are such a collection and we are also just meat and bones but what's your point? I can live, love, laugh, cry etc just as much as you can but I also have a clearer appreciation of how these thing have come to be than you with your mysticism. The evidence is all with Dawkins, the complainants never really advance anything more than wishful thinking and mere assertion, 'we are not just...' 'there has to be something more....', no there doesn't, what we have is inspiring and beautiful enough and that is what this book (all of it)is about.</span>
