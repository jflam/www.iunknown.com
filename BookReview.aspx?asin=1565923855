                <span id="Label1"><I>Cisco IOS Access Lists</I> takes a methodical approach to access lists and their capabilities, and is ideal for administrators of Cisco equipment who have configured access lists before but feel as if they're not taking full advantage of their capabilities (which, author Jeff Sedayao proves, extend well beyond security). Much of what Sedayao has written is of a "policy engineering" nature, is not strictly focused on Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and has relevance to administrators of all sorts of access control equipment. There's emphasis on traffic minimization as well as security, as a section on using access lists to keep routing updates off stub networks exemplifies.<p>  Like many books in the blue system-administration series, this one includes a lot of explanations of what each capability is for, and how each fits with other parts of the system. A lot of times, these sections include conceptual diagrams that show routes of communication and the desired access policies. Then come excerpts from real access lists (Sedayao focuses on IOS 10 and later) and, often, commentary on what the interesting lines of the lists are doing. It's a great way to teach people who have the ability and desire to experiment. Engineers, after all, typically like to learn by doing. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The capabilities and limitations of access lists under the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and other similar routing and access-control environments. Access policies (with emphasis on packet filtering), routing policies (via route filtering and route maps), and the details of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) pertaining to access lists are all covered. </span>

                    <span>I wouldn't recommend this book to novice network wizards. But for those who can see and identify errors, lets just consider this book as a tech quiz, a la "find and fix". It's been fun for me. Come on... It's impossible to know everything. Don't blame author. He has done a good work. He just didn't have a good support team. Yes, errors, yes, typos, and triple yes overall weight of all discrepancies almost ruin all other good impressions. But still, there are a lot of great and cool tips and tricks I have found. <BR>Hope there will be another edition.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book on Cisco IOS Access Lists, especially since there is only one other available in the market. Content is very good, as the author is knowledgable and has extensive experience. There are some errors, with better editing this book would have been worth 5 stars. Still worth reading since you can spot the errors once you have enough knowledge and use of access lists.</span>

                    <span>Book has good content, but unfortunately has far too many errors for me to recommend. I can understand having errors but some are far too obvious to be excused. No doubt the author is very knowledgeable, but I hope in the future his work is more carefully edited.</span>

                    <span>This just the book one would like to read to go through the basics of Cisco ACLs. The author introduces the concepts with some very simple and easily understandable examples. <P>On the other hand, book is either a little outdated or author has intetionally not included many interesting ACL features. Features like turbo acls, dynamic acls, log input, extended communities are either not discussed or discussed very little in the book. The focus of the book is mostly control plane, the data plane is somewhat neglected.<P>Overall a decent book, at best a book for a beginner. For someone new to acls this book will help save a lot of time understanding acls, route-maps, prefix-lists, communities, as paths ....</span>

                    <span>Just received the book yesterday(March 4, 2002)and I'm at page 34 in Chapter 2 ... I was surprised to understand better the basics of Cisco IOS Access Lists that i haven't gained on CCNA study guide books. I believe that after reading the entire book, I'll gain the information i need in knowing Cisco IOS Access Lists as the way it should be. I recommend this book for those networking students and professionals who wish to take Cisco Certifications.</span>
