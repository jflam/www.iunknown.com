                    <span>What makes a photo work? What are the elements that catch the viewer's eye? Bill Smith, a working photographer, has captured this information in a great book. Through examples of Smith's work, he explains what went into each of the photos, what makes them work, and how the technique can be adapted by the reader. There are a number of books on creative techniques in photography, but the fact that this work is now in its second edition indicates that it has resonated with photographers. The high quality printing adds to the value of the book.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent resource for photographic design. In these days of digital photography, people are just clicking away and often don't think about the design of their photos. If you'd like to move from taking snapshots to taking photographs, this will give you the basics of photographic design. You'll learn composition, and how to "see". In other words, you have to develop an eye for the elements of design. This book should be read by students of photography. You'll notice a great improvement iin you photographs after reading this.</span>

                    <span>I've read dozens of books on photography and this one has to be the worst one. Why? As a aspiring photographer, I wanted to improve my compositional skill. That's why I bought this book. Bill may be a professional photographer (not a great photographer though IMHO), but he's not a good instructor or writer. This book failed to be an instructional book because details are held back.<P>For example, he said he learned a great technique by shooting both B&W and color film for the same subject, but he didn't mention at all what technique he learned!!! Why mention it if he's not going to share it? All the technique he talked about in the book are so basic and vague that I get more confused after reading this book. I remembered I learned a lot from John Shaw's and Art Wolfe's books (two of the best and great nature photographers in the world). After reading this book, my mind has become confused. So, I'm going to stop reading it after finishing half of it.</span>

                    <span>Real nice advice, and easy to read. Some things are a little simple an I knew already, but that is no reason to down grade the book. I picked up plenty of tips and will continue to do so. I don't read it as a book, but I flip through it and read a short chapter on whatever, just a few pages, and think about it. Great reference material. Pictures are good to great but that is not what it is all about,they are examples. Its about learning and bring up the quality to the next level. I am learning to 'see' better and thats what matters. The book works for me!</span>

                    <span>I briefly browsed the book in local book store. I found a lot of catchy phrases and ordered one from Amazon. Now I really regret that I did. I found that most of the photographs the author used in the book didn't really bear much relationship with the concepts he was trying to convey. It is like his words and images are seperate. Instead, the author was basically trying to self critique, or rather, self appreciate his own images. Maybe I am missing something, but more often I fail to observe the important elements the author was trying to bring my attention to. I have to say, most of the images in the book are quite uninteresting and boring, just like several other reviewers have pointed out. Maybe they are perfect brochure type of images, they just didn't inspire me. When I see some nice photographs, often my reaction is, wow! how did they do it and how can I shoot something like that. I found none of that in this book. I bought quite a few books on photography, this one so far is the only one I am disappointed with.</span>
