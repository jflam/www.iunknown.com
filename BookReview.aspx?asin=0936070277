                    <span>This book is an excellent place for beginners to start. I have several running books and found this one to be written at a level that was the most practical. Galloway does a good job providing general training advice without a lot of technical jargon and detailed science. More on stretching and nutrition would raise this book to 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>I am buying another copy of this book as I've lent mine out and can't locate its whereabouts. I cannot tell you how many people have borrowed this book from me and have gone on to either run marathons or just become better runners. I received it as a birthday gift from a runner friend more than 10 years ago and went from 2-mile occasional runs to running a marathon just six months later. Galloway's love for the sport is contagious, and the book very informative in terms of how to maintain form, avoid injuries, plus fool-proof schedules for building up to a marathon.</span>

                    <span>This book is perfect for those who have just discovered running and would like a primer on how and how not to train.<P>It's main stregnth is its well-rounded nature, containing everything from historical anecdotes to nutrition and tips for older runners.<P>Galloway's voice is humane and humble. At least in this book, he practices what he preaches: an oversized ego is an obstacle and running is done for the joy it brings.<P>After reading sections of this book, I did some late-night running at the campus track and I could see where a lot of runners were going wrong. They were trying so hard to run that after a few minutes they were exhausted.<P>Galloway's book is more well suited to people who want to take the long and slow road, built on slow and long runs, to greater speed and eventual marathon competition.<P>It might also be a bizarre, yet inspired, gift to your favorite couch potato (Just make sure he or she's not the type to get pissed at such a suggestive gift).</span>

                    <span>I just turned 50 and have always been active but I'm new to running. I got this book to get a clue and have been very pleased. You can tell that the author has a world of knowledge but he presents it with plenty of common sense making it easy to read and understand. I have read it through twice and will refer to it again as I progress.</span>

                    <span>A great book with one exception. I purchased the First edition of this book and used it as a guideline for my 1st marathon. In preparation for a 2nd marathon, now several years later, I purchased the second edition as I lost the first book. I was disappointed to discover that this edition does not include a marathon Training Program.</span>
