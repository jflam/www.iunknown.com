                <span id="Label1">Newly revised to conform with the <I>Chicago Manual of Style</I>, Turabian's <I>Manual for Writers</I> provides comprehensive, detailed, superior guidance to writers of research papers. From "Parts of the Paper" (including the niceties of copyrights and dedications) to "Sample Layouts," everything to do with format is covered. Mechanics of style (abbreviations to quotations) are reviewed, there's help on tables and illustrations, and chapters on bibliographies, parenthetical references, note taking, and citations. There are suggestions for manuscript preparation, hints on word-processing software, and formatting for research papers' more complex features. When you're up to your eyebrows in research data, it's a vast relief to have quick, accessible, reliable answers to your questions of structure, scholarly propriety, and academic style. <I>--Stephanie Gold</I></span>

                    <span>Turabian's book is an absolutely essential resource for any college undergraduate or graduate student that wants to produce quality papers. There's a reason this book is a "classic" work assigned in many English and other humanities classes for many years, it covers nearly everything from the posessive of Jesus to how to cite book chapters to format footnotes and tables of contents.<BR>I do agree that the book does need to be updated to include internet resources, hopefully this will be done in a new edition soon.</span>

                    <span>A must have for all college and graduate students. Turabian answers all questions regarding proper citation, organization, and formatting. The only downside is that research has changed dramatically since this issue was published and the book is not too helpful in dealing with electronic/internet resources.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite books. Okay, yes, I admit it, I'm a nerd. But I'm a nerd that did very well on all of my college papers because I knew the proper tabulation of a footnote.<P>It is essentially an abridged version of the Chicago Manual of Style, for prose writing. Most of the CMS is pretty useless for what most people deal with, and I personally think it's hard to find anything in. Turabian, on the other hand, is a concise little paperback that offers information that no online service can compete with.<P>If you're going to buy one reference book for college, this should be it. Forget the dictionary, forget the thesaurus: they come with Microsoft and you can find perfectly good ones online. Turabian is all you'll need in life. Call it "Turabian" too, as in "I was looking through my Turabian last night, and it says to use the Oxford comma" and you'll instantly impress all of your professors, graduate with honors, and be accepted to the med school of your choice.</span>

                    <span>The Turabian manual is confusing, difficult to use and next to useless for anyone using the Internet or online sources in their research. It has not been updated to reflect the existance of the Internet. As a result, there is no uniform way of citing Internet sources. Use this guide only if forced to by your professor!</span>
