                    <span>I just read "Colors For Your Every Mood" by Leatrice Eiseman and find that it goes far beyond just another decorating book. It is full of useful and interesting color information that will enable me to make my color decisions much more easily. It has also given me some important insights that have stimulated my creative juices and taught me how to bring a sense of balance into my living and working environment. I loved it - it's fun reading.<P>Sincerely, Rel Rogers- Executive Director- ATEN (Alternative Treatments Education Network)</span>

                    <span>I was a bit dissappointed in this book, for two main reasons and several minor ones.<P>As a usability professional, I had bought it for the psychophysical effects of color on humans. This was my mistake, it does not advertise itself for this but was recommended to me for this purpose by another individual. It does have some of this, but inconsistantly. As I am interested in color both jobwise and for decorating, I read it regardless.<P>COLORS WERE OFF IN CHIPS FOR PREFERENCE CHECK: The major thing I find fault with, was the color chips it uses in its test for personal preference, were poor representatives of the colors it was meant to represent. Ironically, there is a disclaimer on the book that this may not be a true representation, but I would think a book about color preferences should go out of its way to be sure this is done well. All the color chips appeared to be washed out. As I do not like pastels, I feel this "colored" my impressions significantly. Also I feel some were quite a bit off either too much yellow or green etc. <P>INDIVIDUAL COLOR SUBTOPICS INCONSISTENT: The other major complaint I has was that under the specific color topics (there were 11), the subtopics were inconsistent. If I wanted to compare the physiological responses of Red to that of Brown for instance, I would be out of luck as the subtopics from one color to another were not consistent. Some had one type of information and another had others. I also found the information provided on each color to be more of just a memory dump of information on each color and not necessarily entirely pertinent or stuff I would really want to know.<P>COLOR COMBINATION EXAMPLES NOT NEAR DISCUSSIONS: Another thing I found particularly frustrating is that examples of color combinations showing various moods were interspersed in the book, and not near the discussion. It made is hard to compare and you were always turning pages.<P>COLOR MOOD DISCUSSIONS SHOWED NAMES INSTEAD OF COLORS: Besides having the examples not near the color mood discussions, there were names of colors used, that weren't even repeated in the examples or elsewhere in the book. I did not check all, but the several I did check this was the case. If nothing else even the RGB equivalents would have helped. Maybe these were Pantone names (it didn't indicate this), but unless you have a chart this would not help.<P>PUTTING THE COLOR MOOD EXAMPLES INTERSPERSED IN THE BOOK WAS CONFUSING TO THE AREA IT WAS PLOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF: Even when reading, since you would read the first part on color moods before that of the individual colors, it was confusing when you ran into the color mood discussions while reading about a specific color that it was not pertinent to. On top of that in order to refer back to the color mood examples, you had to find their discussion area to find their page numbers instead of being able to refer just to a specific area to go back to. I used post it note tabs to keep track, but I shouldn't have to.<P>This book could've been so much more. It suffered poor execution in the colors and bad organization.</span>

                    <span>As a web developer I spend most of my day writing code and worrying about the code working on all browsers, etc. Up until recently I had no desire to learn about color and the feelings behind it. If you are in a similar situation look no more. This book has made a permanent position on my desk and will continue to help me with the design and development of my future projects. Hats off to the authors.... <BR>I have fully recommended this book to the entire Long island Flash User's Group (LIFUG).</span>
