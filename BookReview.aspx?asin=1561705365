                <span id="Label1">Silent Power, book & CD, like its bestselling predecessor Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle, is filled with practical advice on living more fully using your "silent power."  Author Stuart Wilde claims that there is a silent power within you, an inner knowing that grows because you understand its infinity.  Silent power teaches you hour by hour; it is with you this very minute!  As you begin to trust your power, it can lead you step by step to the next person and place in your life.  <P>The enclosed CD contains a special update on the Silent Power techniques, covering new ideas and developments that have occurred since Stuart&#146;s little book of the same name was first published in 1996.  <P>Stuart Wilde is a bestselling author and lecturer whose style is humorous, controversial, poignant and transformational</span>

                    <span>Ok, I agree with about 85% of it... but what I do agree with... is IMPRESSIVE STUFF! Every man should read this book at least once in his life. What an amazing little book this is... EASY to read too. I carried it around for a week and re-read it. Even the parts I don't totally agree with were interesting.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book. Wilde discusses the tendency of people to get energy from sources other than themselves, causing them to "lean" psychologically. He gives advice for learning not to "lean" on others and protecting yourself against energy drainers. Ever been around a person and then, after only a few minutes of conversation, felt exhausted? Wilde's wit is wonderful. He is concise, making his books nice reads. Oftentimes, writers in this type of subject area have a tendency to confuse with grandiose yet vague ideas. Not so with Stuart Wilde! <BR>I would also recommend Sixth Sense by the same author.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book on tape. Well read and gets straight to the point without alot of excessive words! Easy to understand and makes alot of sense even though being silent for alot of us is a challenge. This book on tape adds to my journey in understanding Quantum Theory. You learn how to observe more in life which helps your understanding of others and in turn yourself. For those who don't have much time and don't have time to read, the tape is the easiest quickest way to get started to learning a skill that will help you learn, understand and improve relationships with yourself and others. An excellent book - I have ordered Stuart's 6 tape collection "Developing Your Sixth Sense" to learn other skills in situations that crop up in daily living....<P>Go to your video store and rent "Mind Walk" (a scientist, a politian and a poet get together and discuss Quantum Mechanics). This helped in understanding that we are all linked as one in this great big world ! Understanding brings clarity to humanity and Stuart Wilde teaches us how to take a step towards that understanding.</span>
