                    <span>This book is the second I have read in the One Minute series.  Once the reader grows accustomed to the parable presentation, the principles are much easier to grasp.  The author in this volume interestingly defines selfishness as neglect of self.<p>There are three basic concepts promoted:  take care of me, take care of others, and take care of the relationship I have with others.  Johnson asserts that a person is most loving when his own needs have been adequately addressed.  He feels that self-denial is destructive to ourselves and others, rather than helpful.<p>Jesus encourages us to "love others as we love ourselves."  Based upon this admonition, there is a biblical basis for what the author is stating.  Until we love ourselves and give attention to our own needs and desires, we are not truly free to love.  Once we have taken "one minute" to look inward and assess our own needs, then we are much better equipped to relate to the persons around us.<p>This book is an easy read -- I finished it in one sitting.  If you have been raised to think that self-denial is always good and self-indulgence is always bad, I encourage you to read this volume.  For the price, the insights gained are well worth the money spent.</span>

                    <span>Spencer Johnson's books are not profound but they can be life-changing. Sometimes people who can help the most cut through the clutter and verbiage we can get bogged down in and get to the heart of the matter.  Johnson does this in his simple, narrative books and One Minute for Yourself is no different nor no less effective.<br>Can you imagine having 365 minutes to yourself a year? Can you imagine what you can do for yourself in sixty seconds of silence and peace? Most people don't or even believe that short of a time period can make a difference...but it's true.  Johnson cuts through the garbage we pile on ourselves from self-help gurus and shows you how easy it can be.<br>Some days I take a minute for myself.  Others, I dive into my work and stay immersed there.  It's easy to look back and see my most effective days and my most overwhelming days.  Taking a minute to reflect, to dream or just to relax makes a big difference in my daily effectiveness.  As a matter of fact, I think I'll take one now...</span>

                    <span>I use the concepts of One Minute for Myself - personally every day, and also professionally as I conduct self-care workshops and presentations.  To take care of yourself FIRST so that you have the energy to care for others,  makes ultimate sense, but too few of us allow ourselves this necessity.   This parable gets through to people - One Minute seems reasonable, the  questions are powerful, the payoff is evident!  I'm so glad that Amazon  carries this book because it's hard to find in stores!</span>

                    <span>This book changed my life by helping me to no longer live dishonestly with myself. By taking a minute here and there for my "self," I met my "self" and learned just exactly what I want to do and how I want  to live. I find freedom in every decision now, by letting go of those  things I do not truly care for, and focussing only on the good. Now I am  able to find the good in everything. More importantly I know a most  important truth: I am who I am.</span>
