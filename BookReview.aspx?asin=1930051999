                <span id="Label1">ETERNAL TREBLINKA: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust, by Charles Patterson, Ph.D., describes disturbing parallels between how the Nazis treated their victims and how modern society treats animals. The title is taken from the Yiddish writer and Nobel Laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer, himself a vegetarian: "In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka."  <P>The first part of the book describes the emergence of humans as the master species and their domination of the rest of the inhabitants of the earth. The second part examines the industrialization of slaughter (of both animals and humans) that took place in modern times, while the last part of the book profiles Jewish and German animal advocates on both sides of the Holocaust.  <P>The Foreword is by Lucy Kaplan, a former attorney for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who is the daughter of Holocaust survivors.</span>

                    <span>ETERNAL TREBLINKA; OUR TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND THE HOLOCAUST<BR>By Charles Patterson<P>The title Eternal Treblinka refers to the ongoing holocaust of animals. The blindfold covering your eyes will drop while reading each chapter. Even vegans who advocate for a cruelty free lifestyle will find their eyes opening wide to the assembly line atrocities that are inflicted daily upon animals. This book is for each person who says, "Don't tell me. I don't want to know." The time to know is now. The time to act is now. The time to become the voice of the innocent and vulnerable is now.<P>The first five chapters of Eternal Treblinka give a historical background of humans and their treatment of animals. Humans have displayed a propensity to mistreat and degrade both animals and themselves. Usually the first step in vilifying another group or sub-group within the human species is to attribute animal-like qualities to them. This precedes the domination, enslavement, and slaughter of that group. <P>Stewart David, who is profiled in chapter six, states, "If the public is allowed to remain detached from the suffering of the factory farms, animal laboratories, fur farms, steel-jaw leg hold traps, rodeos, circuses, and other atrocities, these atrocities will continue. We must make them feel the pain of the creatures whose screams are hidden behind the locked doors, out of sight, out of mind. Their language may not be understandable to others, but we know what they are saying."<P>In one chapter Mr. Patterson discusses a worker who explains that on pig farms sows are forced to live on concrete and develop such painful conditions that they can't walk. "On the farm where I work", she states, "they drag the live ones who can't stand up anymore out of the crate. They put a metal snare around her ear or foot and drag her the full length of the building. These animals are just screaming in pain. They're dragging them across the concrete, it's ripping their skin, the metal snares are tearing up their ears." Mr. Patterson goes on to explain how worn-out sows are dumped on a pile, where they stay for up to two weeks until the cull truck picks them up and takes them to renderers who grind them up to make them into something profitable.<P>The mistreatment of people and the mistreatment of animals are connected.<BR>The last three chapters parallel the treatment of animals and the holocaust. The slaughterhouse appears to hold the very same atrocities as the Nazi death camps. Eternal Treblinka forces the reader to face the horror of present day factory farming; it also awakens a soul to the plight of the voiceless. <P>While the screams of these creatures are kept comfortably hidden behind locked doors, they cannot be comfortably hidden from our collective consciousness.<P>Review by Patricia Rodriguez</span>

                    <span>Eternal Treblinka is a book to be loved by those who believe pursuit of the truth is the way to the most valuable things in life. It naturally will be deplored by those who wish to maintain blind faith in social fictions to the effect that all is well as long as external enemies can be smited and the markets kept operating.<BR> After defeating the Nazi Holocaust, our society expanded its own. Its holocaust against animals, nourished by 10,000 years of animal domestication, fed on the technological opportunities for managing and slaughtering animals that the Nazi Holocaust had used for managing and slaughtering human beings. The breeding for preferred traits, the exploitation and killing of "life unworthy of life," the killing in a depersonalized fashion as a matter of daily business with machinery designed for the purpose, the talk of "humane killing"--these are defining features of both holocausts. Eternal Treblinka argues that the long-ago enslavement of nonhuman animals informed the Nazi Holocaust. One of the key technological developments along the way was the animal dis-assembly line -- the slaughterhouse -- admired and imitated for manufacture by Henry Ford, who had a relationship with Hitler based on mutual admiration, Ford's antisemitism holding special appeal for his German penpal.<BR> For some, reading Eternal Treblinka will pose problems because it reveals evil running through countless human lives that we are encouraged to consider good. For others, it will raise the difficulty that ignorance of its contents will be a sign of extreme naivete. We are each a part of the solution or the problem with regard to the animal holocaust, depending on what we choose to know and to do. Eternal Treblinka helps show us how to choose for the better.</span>

                    <span>I read a lot of criticism about Charles Patterson's book, "Eternal Treblinka" before I actually read the book, so I was expecting something thought-provoking and controversial, to be sure. I was not disappointed. I know there have been many who have been offended by the comparison of mankind's treatment of animals to the Nazi's treatment of the Jews, and I can understand why. But on the other hand, the parallels that Mr. Patterson draw in this book are compelling, and seen from an objective, not emotional, point of view do make sense. <P>I've also heard of the protests where meat-eaters object to being likened to Nazis, and I'd like to point out right now that no such correlation is made in this book. It seems that many of the critics of "Eternal Treblinka" have not bothered to read the book. <P>There are many other sociological parallels that can be drawn in regard to our treatment of animals and their systematic slaughter from mere existence, but given Mr. Patterson's background, this is the one that makes sense to write about. What emerges from the pages of horrifying stories (both of animal abuse and human abuse) is a compelling argument for an open and critical discussion of our role, as humans, in the world and how far our dominion over other creatures really stretches. <P>I was surprised to learn that so many animal rights activists are either survivors of the Holocaust, or family members of survivors (or, in many cases, German citizens who were on the "safe" side during the war). These personal stories are moving, and the fact that these people can extend their sanctity for life beyond humans is truly inspiring. <P>This is a wonderful book. Hard to read in the way it's hard to face any tragedy and stare it down. Well worth it though. You will not be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>The book is interesting. Not much in it was new as far as factory farms etc. I was I admit a bit put off with the suggestion that all killing of animals for food is wrong, since my family has hunted for centuries in the United States and as a hunter I know what a clean kill is.<P>Personally I would like to see the mass market feed lots and slaughter houses done away with. Even the kosher ones. Since I detest waste and believe that if someone is going to eat meat they better raise and cull it themselves and use every part of the animal from hide, to bone.<P>Completely ignored were issues like native Americans in Artic areas where eating animals has often been the only means of survival. Or even my own Passamaquoody family from eastern Maine in times past.<P>My challenge to anyone who believes that eating animals is always wrong is stop using any and all products, including life saving medicines derived from animals of any kind. Be consistent and risk dying for your beliefs.<P>And how ironic that on pages 160-161 we have Professor Peter Singer who is an animals rights person, as well as a 'human' who believes disabled or sick babies up to 30 days old should be killed or allowed to die. Seems odd that he would be in a book about Nazis who did that to Jews and other humans.<P>Why 5 stars? Because overall the book has some valuable information and I tend to take what I want from good books and ignore the rest.</span>

                    <span>Reading Charles Patterson's THE ETERNAL TREBLINKA: OUR TREATMENT OF ANILMALS AND THE HOLOCAUST is a shattering experience. If Patterson's postulates are true, and he has carefully researched and documented with copious footnotes the facts he so bravely reveals here, then we as a global society need to take responsibility for the horrors against fellow man we so willingly assign to 'others', never ourselves. The parallel of man's treatment of animals from Genesis to the present and the recurring genocides of humans is stated early on in this wise book: "Not only did the domestication of animals provide the model and inspiration for human slavery and tyrannical government, but it laid the groundwork for western hierarchical thinking and European and American radical theories that called for the conquest and exploitation of 'lower races,' while at the same time vilifying them as animals so as to encourage and justify their subjugation." And later, "Throughout the history of our ascent to dominance as the master species, our victimization of animals has served as the model and foundation for our victimization of each other. The study of human history reveals the pattern: first, humans exploit and slaughter animals; then, they treat other people like animals and so the same to them." <BR>Patterson traces our carnivorous society to the Ice Age when plants were no longer available for food and animals became the source of staving off hunger. From this beginning he traces the gradual herding, forced breeding, selective trashing of the weak and infirm, sterilization techniques, American Indian genocide and slavery practices throughout the world as well as in America, slaughterhouse productions lines (suggesting that Henry Ford who made assembly line production popular and who was one of Hitler's few heroes forged the way for models for the extermination camps of the Nazis) - all steps from the abuse of animals to the extermination of peoples in such a way that we as readers are forced to reflect on what we have always considered as atrocities that shamed other countries and societies are actually rooted in our own history. <BR>Good books make us think. Patterson writes so well that despite his historical didactic approach to this uncomfortable subject, it is difficult to put this book down. Many may not wish to finish reading his tome, but everyone should be made aware of its postulates. In the midst of his documentation of his theory he places an utterly poetic tribute of a chapter to Isaac Bashivus Singer, the Nobel Prize laureate for literature in 1978. Singer was a vegetarian and a poet of kindness and Patterson seeks to imbue hope in his readers by emulating Singer's visions. <BR>THE ETERNAL TREBLINKA is an important book and if we are to learn from history to prevent repetition of past sins then this surely stands as one source of instruction. Would that schools could include this as recommended reading for all students - form Junior High to high school to college.</span>
