                    <span>Well Bill, you have done it again. This is going to be big, really big. Have you ever wished you could learn more about the movie business? Well this is your chance to look behind the scenes with a slightly different view. Most people don't ever really see to many mistakes on the big screen or at home on TV but, that is just because they are not properly trained as to what to look for. I will say that after reading this book you will become a "Master Flim Flub Finder". I know that I have. Bill has once again produced a GREAT "G" rated book that you can take the whole family to read. Everytime you turn on a movie you will run to the book shelf to find out where the mistakes are in that movie. Thanks to Bill it is all wrapped up in a nice little package for you to enjoy. You will want more and that will be very easy because this is a "Sequel" to other "Film Flub" books that Bill has written. You will find that the information located in this book will keep you amused for years to come. This is the kind of "G" Rated material that we are all looking for. You will enjoy this book over and over again with you family and friends. Don't stop now Bill, there are new movies being released every year and that can only mean more mistakes to catch. I have rated this book at the highest rating of 5 even though I believe it to have a much higher rating. I have found some flubs that even Bill hasn't caught yet. Buy the book and find out for yourself how much fun you are missing. Bill, once again I say keep up the good work and don't stop. Thank You.</span>

                    <span>I must have been one of the first people to own this book. I am now a follower of Bill's books. After reading this book I had to go back and watch all of those flicks that he talks about. I was amazed at what I had missed. This book will give you hours (no, days) of amusement. I have gone on to find may film flubs not yet published by Bill. You will learn so much from this book that you too will become a "Flub Master" as I have. This book is worth finding at any cost so that your Bill Givens set can be complete. You are not wasting any of you good hard earned money here. This is good "G" rated entertainment and sometimes thats hard to find anymore. I rated the book 5 stars for its content and its ability to make me think now everytime I watch a movie for things that I would never of thought of before. Bill Givens don't ever stop. To this very day I still refer back to this book when an old movie comes on that is profiled in this book. I have enjoyed this book not only with my whole family but also with my friends. Thank You.</span>

                    <span>You see them all the time. Or maybe you don't. Those with sharp eyes catch them. How an actor in a movie might be holding an object in one shot and it's not there in the next. How the "reality" of a film's time period can be proved invalid with anachronisms like watches and sneakers. These little slip-ups, called, in the business, continuity errors, happen in virtually every movie, and finding one can be a joy to a viewer. Especially if one has read any of the "Film Flubs" series by Bill Givens.<P>This series of books, which focuses on these curious little mistakes that happen in films, reaches new heights of hilarity with the third installment, "Film Flubs: The Sequel". I guarantee that once you've read these particular volumes, you'll find yourself searching for those same "little mistakes" yourself. <P>  In the book, Givens, a writer for several magazines, takes us on a whirlwind tour of some of the biggest blunders captured on film in recent years. He doesn't shy away from attacking the big name directors, either. He has whole sections entitled "Picking on the Biggies" where he focuses on some of the biggest films of recent years: "Terminator 2," "Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves," "Cape Fear," and more. Among the more memorable gaffes...<P>  -In "Terminator 2," Linda Hamilton is heard stating that the human body has 215 bones. There are only 206.<P>  -"Robin Hood"'s character of Azeem (Morgan Freeman) seems to be WAY ahead of his time in some of the contraptions he carries...a telescope, gunpowder, a Scimitar sword, all of which did not exist in the 12th century. <P>  -In "The Rocketeer," set in the mid-1930's, German money is referred to a "Deutchmarks." Even then-Disney head Jeffery Katzenberg had to 'fess up to that one...German money back then was actually called the "rieschmark."<P>  This is just a quick sample...there are many more for your enjoyment and amusement in "Film Flubs: The Sequel." And, as much as I enjoy this book, I also strongly urge you to pick up all of the other "Flubs" books...they contain even more wonderful gaffes from some of the top movies of all time. <P>  But what is the main reason you should read "Film Flubs: The Sequel"? Take a close look at the section marked "The Sharp Eyed, Quick Witted, Film Flub Spotter Squad," where Givens lists the names of those people who contributed to the book. Yep, my name's in there! Let it never be said that I don't engage in shameless self-promotion now and again...<P>  -Jeff McGinnis</span>
