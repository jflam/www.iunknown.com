                    <span> When reading books on computer security, you will be told that computer security is a mindset that must be achieved and held. However, achieving this lofty goal is a matter of doing a lot of small things right. And they must all be done right, for even one apparently minor mistake can open a security hole potentially as big as escorting the attacker to a terminal already logged in as administrator. Brown covers a large amount of ground in the area of Windows security by examining 75 common principles. 
<br /> Many are in the form of questions, some of those questions asked in the title and answered in the text are:
<br />
<br />*) What is secure code? 
<br />*) What is a countermeasure?
<br />*) What is a nonprivileged user?
<br />*) What is security context?
<br />*) What is a null session?
<br />*) What is a guest logon?
<br />
<br />Some of these questions are much more difficult to answer than it may first appear.  For example, volumes could be written to answer the first two questions. Brown is effectively brief, writing enough to impart initial understanding, but not so much as to incite boredom. 
<br /> Some of the other points that are not in the form of a question are:
<br />
<br />*) How to enable auditing.
<br />*) How to program with SIDS.
<br />*) How to program ACLs.
<br />*) How to configure security for a COM(+) client.
<br />*) How to store secrets on a machine. 
<br />*) How to programmatically lock the console.
<br />
<br /> This book contains very valuable material needed in your struggle to make your systems secure. Some people will read the principles they are interested in and justifiably complain about the lack technical depth. However, if your interest is to learn the fundamental aspects of the topic, then this book is just right for you.

                    <span>I have been a fan of Keith Brown and regularly read his blog on www.Pluralsight.com/community so this review may appear biased but I honestly believe this is a very useful book if you want to develop secure applications or are just wondering how security is implemented in windows.
<br />
<br />Though this book is available in its entirety on winsecguide.net, if you are like me, you will not be disappointed if you kill a tree and buy the book.
<br />
<br />The book deals with Windows security, something every windows developer worth his or her salt should know.
<br />
<br />The book is organized as a collection of practical, to the point insights on windows security. 75 topics are covered as items. This is what I like the best about this book. Each topic is short, to the point and covers just the right amount of information. Curious readers are urged to do their own further investigations. Although the book does not directly talk about security as implemented in the .net frameworks, and it may appear that the title is a misnomer, the underlying concepts are beautifully described. This is a very easy to read book. You don't have to spend endless brain cycles to in reading a chapter and get something useful. In about 5 minutes you can read most "items" and digest the nugget of security insight.
<br />
<br />The 75 items in the book are grouped into 6 parts or categories. Part 1 paints the Big Picture and lays the groundwork. You will learn about different kinds of attacks and how to mitigate them. Part 2 describes what Security context is all about. Here you can read about security tokens, daemons, impersonation and a host of other things you didn't even know about. In part 3 you will learn about Access Control and how to grant/restrict access to various resources. Part 4 talks about COM(+) and Enterprise Services. Part 5 deals with Network Security. You will learn what Kerberos, SSPI and IPSEC are. Part 6 is for items that did not fit under the other 5 parts. One of the misc items talks about how to store secrets on a machine. You can also learn to programmatically log off or reboot a machine.
<br />
<br />To summarize, this is a very easy to read book with bite sized information on windows security. As more and more emphasis is being placed on developing secure applications in an increasingly networked world, you will find yourself reaching for this book often.
<br />
<br />Go buy it.

                    <span>I have been trying to get into security for a while but the task seemed daunting. Security is a complex subject and it is difficult to know where to start. The book's hyperlink-like structure allows you the understand the whole picture and navigate through the chapters easily without being drowned in details too quickly. This book I think must be read twice to finally put in straight in my mind. 
<br />Thanks Keith.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for an experienced programmer looking to learn about Windows Security settings. 
<br />
<br />In particular I found that the treatment of programmatic security, CoInitializeSecurity(), is the best and most thorough discussion on the topic that I've found anywhere. I especially appreciate his terse, clear writing style. Easy to understand and you don't have to wade through pages and pages of dense prose.</span>

                    <span>This book is not for everyone, but if you are a programmer and you want an introduction to what you can do to create more secure programs integrated into Windows 2000 -&#62; Server 2003 in a .NET framework, you will find this book worth the read.
<br />
<br />If you are already security saavy and you do not know much about programming this book will help you ask your coders the right questions.
<br />
<br />The first 35 pages are the fundamentals of security.  The next 30 pages show the interface to security in the windows environment.  The real value for me as a reader started on page 65.  From there to the very last page there is example after example.
<br />
<br />Keith Brown continues to be the master of clear writing, no fluff, everything is in consise topics that tell you the straight scoop you need to know about that topic.
