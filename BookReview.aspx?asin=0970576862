                <span id="Label1">September 11th was a departure point that will define our future. Consequently, we have all been forced to rethink - an act that requires introspection and reinterpretation of standard thinking.   <P>RETHINK, A de.MO Project, is a book about history and politics, a book about our lives and about our world, and what we are trying to accomplish in it. RETHINK confronts our diversity, our stupidity and cleverness, our preoccupations and rage, our laughter and desperate tears, our need for justice and love, our thirst for blood and power, our need to nourish and be nourished, our need to breathe, close our eyes and dream.   <P>Investigation of the historical, political and moral aspects of such a tragedy, the events that may have fostered it and its political consequences creates a new viewpoint. de.MO believes that ignoring explanation and questioning can foster new catastrophic events.  <P>The contributors to RETHINK had the freedom to create their own voices and were encouraged to respond in a manner that would acknowledge the historical events and causes that brought us to September 11th. Their varied responses create a document of great interest at a time when politics and values are in tremendous flux.   <P>RETHINK can be used as a weapon or as a treasure, and readers are invited to handle it with care. In RETHINK, we are forced to be open-minded, to review all opinions and issues with the possibility that we might emerge with a new perspective and personal ideology.</span>

                    <span>You know it's sad, like the people below from Chicago illustrate quite well, that some people just don't get the true purpose of a book like this. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, no matter how wrong they are, but there is a point in which it just becomes so mind blowing as to some people's ignorance.<P>This book's purpose is to open people's eyes up to the brutal and horrific world in which we now all live in. America was awakened by the events of 9-11, but so few realize that this is what people face day in and day out throughout the rest of the world. I would no more call this a coffee table book, than call Schindler's List just your typical movie drama. "Rethink" tells a story, one in which we are still creating & doesn't have a foreseeable end in sight. The key to all history is to know what you've been through, so you don't repeat the same mistakes twice. Pain, suffering, & death isn't something which is solely confined to our immediate surroundings, it's a worldwide plight to try and survive in this ever more demanding and deadly environment. The stakes are higher now and the consequences of our actions are even more so. We all have choices, either to be open and realize that we aren't isolated in the actions & decisions we take & make, or to keep going down a path of self destruction, while ignoring the rest of our earthly inhabitances leading us to a catastrophic ending to this story, which has not yet been written. <P>As the reader from Chicago so eloquently tries to state, "RETHINK is an overwrought, "full of itself" and pretentious treatment of the post 9/11 terrorism war." Take a closer look at this book and you will come to find out that a lot of these pictures weren't taken around or just after 9-11, but throughout the past decade or two. This is an accumulation of our world's actions along with the results of what we've done leading us into the present. The purpose of this book, is to try & make us "Rethink" what we've done, should've done, and the biggest of them all, what will occur down the line & next if we continue down this rocky path that we're currently on ??</span>

                    <span>Another elegantly published 600-page photo book world we all easily can live without. RETHINK is an overwrought, "full of itself" and pretentious treatment of the post 9/11 terrorism war. To my husband and me it is the classic example of proverbial "coffee table" book in the endless stream of vanity self publishing. <P>Granted, this photo album has some great images by Mr. Knight and by few others, nice design touches here and there and the obligatory these days' presence high profile essay contributors. <P>We expected something different, maybe less predictable form RETINK. The previous reviewer raved about it. But it is my fault -- I should hold to my money and not spend it at Barnes & Noble for the sleek photo book that we opened once. Maybe more luck next time...</span>

The editing is superb, the design is just right ... If you are interested in the last 50 years of american foreign policies this a book not to pass. Highly! Highly! Recommended. Great piece of work.</span>
