                <span id="Label1">The John Wooden Pyramid of Success features the words and values of the master: the official Pyramid of Success Lecture, Coach's favorite maxims, interviews with him about his life and philosophy, and 30 photos of Wooden throughout his life. Wooden is the consummate businessman, who during the last twelve years of his job obtained a virtual monopoly on the national title for collegiate basketball. Learn how he did so as the master strategist, psychologist, motivator, and example. Husband, father, friend, educator, poet, athlete, Hoosier, and just plain great guy, Coach Wooden&#185;s story and approach to life is an inspiration for all ages. At last, the complete story is told. For the inside story of a true hero in sports and life, this is indispensable and joyous reading.</span>

                    <span>Technically, much improved over the first, I highly recommend the second edition of this book. The author, Neville Johnson, presents a wide variety of interviews with family members, friends, former players, and others associated with John Wooden throughout the coach's influential life. Mr. Johnson also takes great effort in presenting a "balanced" look at Mr. Wooden's philosophy embodied in the Pyramid of Success and its effect on the friends, family, and players who know "Coach". The interviews (which cover at least half the book's content) are candid and revealing. The interviews alone are worth the purchase price. Many years of work went into the research for the book and the reward is for those who read it. Each reader will discover information about John Wooden and his philosophy of life not found anywhere else. I would not describe this as a "how-to" book, but, rather, a very deep look at a man who has influenced more people than he will ever know. The insights gained may well translate into a practical outlook on all aspects of individual lives.</span>

                    <span>I think Mr. Willingham is reviewing the first edition of this book. I have seen a copy of that and there are many typos in that edition. I should know as I am a professional proofreader. But I have a copy of the second edition, the one that has the cover shown on this page, and I have found very, very few typos, and most of those small grammar things that you might find in any book. Considering this book is well over 400 pages I think it is presented very well. I do agree with Mr. Willingham that this book gives a lot of new information about the people around Coach during the Wooden Era. All in all, I find it an excellent read and a must for any Wooden follower.</span>

                    <span>This book has a great deal of information about John Wooden, UCLA basketball, and many of the people who were involved with Coach Wooden during the "Wooden Era". However, this book is also FULL of typographical errors, grammar problems, and such. While it does not severly impact the content, it is frustrating and irritating for such a product that has so much potential.</span>

                    <span>I am a licensed psychotherapist practicing in San Francisco for the past twenty years. I am always looking for books that give people a healthy and motivational structure for living life. <BR>John Wooden's Pyramid of Success is one of those books that I recommend to my clients. This book was recommended to me and although I did not know much about John Wooden, I was very inspired by his life and his work. His ability to educate, and help others build character, gain wisdom and expand their capacity to live a life of integrity, service and love is remarkable. <BR>Most people come into therapy because there is some area of their life that they are dissatisfied with. Therapy is about bringing into consciousness deeper emotional truths that can keep us from achieving a truly satisfying and meaningful life. <BR>The Pyramid clearly defines the actions we are taking and the decisions we are making when we are living life to the fullest. John Wooden is an important role model and teacher for us all. This book is an excellent resource for living on purpose and for reaching the upper limits of what is available to us all in life.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the most comprehensive book on Wooden yet. About half the book is interviews with former Wooden players, with Wooden's family, his friends, and even his former teachers. These interviews prove Wooden truly walks what he talks. The biography section is as in-depth as anything I've seen on Wooden and the amount of new information revealed is daunting. If you are a Wooden fan, or want to learn more about the former UCLA coach, this is the book for you.</span>
