                <span id="Label1">At just over seven pounds, the updated <I>Total Football II</I> has the heft of a refrigerator (see William Perry, defensive tackle, p. 1173), and, at 1812 pages, it covers about as much ground as a scrambling quarterback (see John Elway, p. 774). It has all the requisite stats that make a sports reference necessary, but that's just the straight-ahead stuff good for three yards a carry. Where <I>Total Football II</I> breaks free is in the razzle-dazzle of its essays and opinions. Argue with its list of the 300 best players ever (good as he is, shouldn't Terrell Davis have a few more seasons under his belt before "all-time" is stamped on his helmet?). Study how the game's strategies evolved, and learn how to read their diagrams. Even discover how to decipher the mysteries of what the quarterback means when he calls "Red right. Eighteen. Bob odd oh. On three" in the huddle, gets up to the line of scrimmage, and barks, "Pro. Blue 32. Blue 32. Down. Hut! (Pause) Hut! Hut!" <p> Football's blitz on the culture is covered in a series of smart essays that range from the mystique attending Super Bowl commercials to why football movies usually come up short. In a nifty examination of the game's penetration of the language, a scenario presents itself: "The average Joe woke up this morning, got into his car, found a seam in the northbound lane of the freeway, and drove to work. At his desk, he huddled with his coworkers, went over his game plan ..." and, well, you get the point. These are just some of the volume's many <I>extra</I> points, and it's the ingenuity of the extras that earn <I>Total Football</I> the right to celebrate in the end zone. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998. The Draft had all of the picks but I wish they would have who the top players were in each draft like the hockey one.
<br />I thought this book was okay it had some good stats but is no where near Hockey-Baseball-Basketball versions.</span>

                    <span>For those of you who are looking for every NFL player - even those who never played a game - I suggest rubbing a magic bottle and hoping for a genie, because that'll be the only way you'll find that information.  It simply doesn't exist.  
<br />
<br />While some bellyache that the statistical information isn't organized and re-printed 30 different times in every discernable way, they don't understand that this book is almost 2000 pages long.  Repeating all of that information AGAIN would involve hundreds, if not thousands, of additional pages.  
<br />
<br />Total Football II is by far and away the most complete statistical reference there ever was.  No, there are no indexes of high schools or longest punt returns or pre-season, third-stringer touchdown records, but please!  This book contains every important stat available.  
<br />
<br />The articles are written by people with centuries of cumulative years of experience covering and writing about the NFL.  Even though your favorite game may not be listed, I can assure you that you probably haven't seen as many as the great writers who created this book did.  Keep that in mind before you criticize them for not including Billie Joe Tolliver in their 300 greatest players segment.</span>

                    <span>If you're expecting the football equivalent of Total Baseball, you'll be disappointed. The text articles are superficial and unimpressive. For example, while Total Baseball has articles on Japanese baseball, Total Football does not discuss Canadian football. Total Baseball discusses the history of black baseball players, but Total Football does not do the same for black football players.<p>But perhaps I am being harsh in comparing Total Football to something as canonical as Total Baseball. Total Football has been an invaluable reference. It has statistics on every NFL, AFL and AAFC player (no comprehensive playoff stats, though); team statistics dating to 1920; and scores and attendence (where available) for every game played. The book even lists players' high schools, although unfortunately it does not have an index of high schools. For stats junkies like me, the book is a lot of fun.</span>

                    <span>Don't expect to find a football book you can use exclusively from the rest.  This is a good supplement to books like "The Pro Football Encyclopedia" (by Maher/Gill).  If you're into statistics this is one of the best to have.  Whereas "Pro Football Encyclopedia" has players longest gains, which this book doesn't, this book gives you kickoff and punt return stats for all players, the encyclopedia doesn't.  This book is mainly about the NFL.  I bought it for the statistics.  It's also a good book to use if you want to find out more about a specific player (statistically speaking).  Chapters like "The 25 Most Memorable Regular Season Games" and "The 300 Greatest Players" etc.. are not what I got this book for.  I would prefer a book that leaves out author's opinions.  I've seen games I'll never forget that I knew wouldn't make the list and also players.  Although these chapters are somewhat interesting along with others I could live without half this book easily but like I said, it's a good season by season individual stat book that has information other books don't. It mainly depends on what you're buying this book for.  There are statistics here excluded from other books but there are stats left out that ARE in other books, like blocked punts for instance, which may not seem to matter to most, but it all depends on what you're buying it for.  It has stats other books don't, that's what I bought it for.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must have for all serious football fans.  It is the most complete one volume source of information about professional football. <p>My favorite sections include:<p>History of the game:  The introductory essays on the history of pro football and the complete histories of each team is fascinating and an important context for many of the conventions and the culture of today's game.<p>History of players:  Not only is there a complete roster of every player who has ever played in the National Football<br>League and it's antecedents, there are more detailed biographies of the "500 greatest players" as determined by the panel of writers responsible for this encyclopedia.<p>Complete game summaries of and statistics for all the playoffs, Super Bowls, and most important games in league history:  I personally found this the most nostalgic reading, as I could remember where I was and who I was watching the playoffs and Super Bowls with.  <p>And much, much more -- some more mundane (essays on player equipment) and some more interesting (history of defunct leagues like the United States Football League (USFL)).<p>I do have two complaints about the encyclopedia -- one minor and one a glaring omission.  <p>My minor complaint is that they need a better copy editor.  I found many typos, especially the detailed information about playoffs and Super Bowls.<p>My major complaint is that is has a woefully incomplete section detailing the individual records (most rushing yards in a game, etc.) which is a terrible omission.  I can find a more complete listing of individual and team records in a sports almanac.  A book purporting to be TOTAL FOOTBALL shouldn't need a companion book to round it out and have all the facts one might want at hand.  I strongly recommend they improve on this in the next volume.</span>
