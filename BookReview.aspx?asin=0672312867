                <span id="Label1">This title brings the popular three-week tutorial format to aspiring Delphi 4 programmers, combining plenty of hands-on knowledge of the most essential features of Delphi 4, including its strong database capabilities. This book is a good choice for the beginner or intermediate programmer who wants to get a solid foundation in Delphi 4 development in a minimal amount of time. <p> The book begins with the basics of the Delphi programming environment and object-oriented Pascal. The author then explains the fundamentals of developing with the Visual Component Library (VCL) and discusses how to build basic user interfaces and menus using Delphi 4 design tools. This first section also includes excellent material on graphics and multimedia programming.<p> Further chapters examine the basics of building database programs, again using Delphi wizards. More advanced topics include building and using dynamic link-libraries (DLLs) and ActiveX components, plus creating Web-browser applications with Delphi's support for Internet controls.<p> Though this tutorial stresses the basics, there's quite a bit of material here on the finer points of programming using the built-in abilities of Delphi. There's also good attention to using the wizards and tools that help make Delphi a much more productive environment. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I purchased Delphi 5, and also the Developers Guide - but found it difficult to actually program in Delphi. I have a very strong programming background in procedural languages, but not in C or C++ or any other OO paradigm, and the Delphi manual and Delphi 5 Developers guide are far too advanced for beginners. This book was very easy for me to understand, and although I think that the subject matter simply cannot be mastered in 21 days this was the only book that was able to explain many of the reasons why (and how) you would use the different VCL components. Although there are many cases where more complex examples would have helped, I think that it was appropriate for the author to ignore them. This is obviously a beginners book. I would have preffered some more details on some of the more "odd" language features such as the typecasting, the use of "AS" and "IS", peculiarities of creating classes, etc, as well as some more info on the Object Pascal language and some programing conventions that may help to reduce coding errors - the syntax is particularly odd in its use of semi-colons, a fact that Borland admits in its own documentation as one of the prime reasons for intorduction of program 'bugs'.<P>One of the nice features of the book is the end of chapter tutorials. I did them and found the they did re-inforce the chapters, and also provided additional stimulus. You are encouraged to use the on-line help, and it does help. There is no way to progrm in Delphi without it. In order to really follow along you must interact with the software. <P>The book does not come with a CD, you must download sample code from the Internet, which is a bit of a bother.<P>In summary a very good book. The examples and text work for Delphi 5 as well as Delphi 4. I think that any beginning Delphi programmer should have this plus an advanced book, and they should be ready to take on most projects.</span>

                    <span>An ideal book for anyone who wishes to begin learning Delphi (version 4, 5 or 6). I an experienced Visual Basic programmer and purchased Delphi 5 hoping to use the on-line documentation to learn Delphi but found it too advanced and not an ideal learning environment. (On-line help tends to be a great reference tool but it's always hard to learn from.) I then purchased the Delphi Developer's Guide, which seems to be regarded as the best book on the subject. Although a superb book in its own right, its not aimed at beginners. I have now completed the Sam's Delphi 4 in 21 days, and let me say, it's a terrific book for beginners, which teaches in a lesson format, which is actually surprisingly easy and fun to follow. Don't be put off by the Version 4 title either, all the lessons work just fine in Delphi 5.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book, without having any background in programming in any computer language, except a small amount of Basic & HTML, hoping for fast results. The truth is that although the book is comprehensive and user friendly, it relys heavily on a pre existing knowledge of the subject matter and is really NOT for the absolute beginner. My only other observation would be the constant "I'll cover that part later" aspect of the text, which is very frustrating, and makes the reader want to skip ahead to consolidate learning. I would certainly recommend this book, but only as an addition to the library of someone who knew a great deal about Delphi first, without which 21 days is optomistic at best!</span>

Make sure not to buy this book I was very very disapointed, it is supposed to be for an intrudoctory level, but this book is way below that, the only person who should by this book is someone who has never used a computer. This is very disapointing considerint other Sam publication. Botom Line DON BUY THIS BOOK</span>

                    <span>I used this book as my introduction to Delphi and found it useful, but less than ideal.<P>The early chapters of the book gave a good introduction to the basics of Delphi programming, and in particular the many tricks which Delphi has to make programming easier.<P>If all you intend to do is produce a program to present databases in a particular way this book will probably meet your needs fine. <P>My reservations relate to the presentation of information about the language itself. The explanation of the various features of classes seemed sketchy, and left me unsure of when I should use what sort of features. I had hoped that the chapter on "Advanced programming techniques" would help, but this focused on elements which "polish" a programme, but don't bridge the gap to a finished application of any real complexity.<P>I didn't bother finishing the last few chapters on matters such as producing components and DLLs as I felt I needed to learn more about classes, properties and datastreams before I would benefit.</span>
