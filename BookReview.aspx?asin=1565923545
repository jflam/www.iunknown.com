                    <span>I've been programming embedded systems now for about 5 years and I'm always looking for new tips and tricks. Unfortunately this book is only for beginners. Having said that, it really is a great book for beginners. I'm going to make all of my graduates read this book cover to cover. But if you've been programming embedded systems for anything more than 12 months you probably won't get much out of this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a very well written whirlwind tour of the process of developing embedded systems. But keep in mind, it is extremely superficial. In other words, it's a great introduction for people who have no idea whatsoever what embedded development involves. For anyone who has done some embedded work -- no matter how light -- or even only worked with an embedded group there will be little new here. Someone complained about the old processor selected for demonstration: I don't think it's a significant flaw because the book is not a practical, down-to-the-metal kind of thing anyway, and for a high-level overview, the good old 186 is probably even better because everyone knows it, while the concepts, at that level at least, definitely apply to other platforms. Make sure you know what to expect here, and if your aim is right, you'll like the book. If not, then... well, see reviews below. 
<br />
<br />If you need something more fundamental, then hit something like Liu, or, going further, Buttazzi, or Kopetz, or similar on the RT side, and, perhaps Ball on the embedded side. If you need a down-to-the-metal book, get Labrosse's uCOS book -- it's clumsily written and printed in huge letters on cardboard-thickness paper, but it comes with the source for a real, full-scale, widely used real-time embedded OS, so you'll be able to dig into the real guts of a real thing with your source code browser; no amount of book-reading will beat that. There's also a rather old but friendly, informative, unpretentious, and detailed book by Walter Heath that I could recommend (if you can get it: it's out of print now; it was published by Van Nostrand Reinolds). It's based on an old Motorola, but so what: even if you don't care for Motorola, the assembly part is readable, and anyway, most of the code is C).
<br />
<br />Once you're comfortable on that level, you really don't need any more books, just read other people's code, processor manuals and other vendor literature, and if your OS comes with the source, never neglect to learn it. And if you've never done this kind of work, Barr's book will help you get over the initial fear of unknown and make the first step into that entertaining, ever-changing, and never boring area of computing that real-time embedded development is.</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book.  It is short and to the point and yet introduces many good basic concepts such as terminology, typical build/debug environments, and the parts of an embedded RTOS. It also includes great stuff like an Object Oriented Driver API that are somewhat advanced topics.
<br />
<br />I have lent it to several people that were cramming for interviews because it is so readable - to the point where my copy never returned - and I will certainly buy another copy.</span>

                    <span>I usually expect books on embedded programming uses either of these : Motorola, 8051, and PIC microcontroller. Guess what the author use in this book.. a 80186!!
<br />I would rather say that is an antique processor,which is not suitable for modern embedded system. This book doesnt mention important features in embedded system such as keypad, LCD, push button, ADC ..etc At most, this is only a C programming book. 
<br />
<br />Even for that, this is not a good book on C. It only give some very brief introduction, there arent many detail code, no special tricks to make your C code to run more efficient. He author think ROM limitation is more critical than RAM in embedded system, which i definitely dont agree with. Did you see the term "C++" in the title? you expect it to use up big portion to elaborate on that? you wil be dissapointed, it merely uses a few pages to comment about the advantage/disavnatages of C++ (after reading, I still didnt know what is all about embedded C++).
<br />
<br />To experienced programmer, this is never the book for you. To beginner, maybe this is easier to understand, but i really dont think this will help you in EMBEDDED C programming.</span>

                    <span>From page 18:<br>"One of the most fundamental differences between programs written for embedded systems and those written for other computer platforms is that the embedded systems almost always end in an infinite loop."<p>For the a novice who might be misguided by this ridiculous statement: many, many, useful programs written on "other computer platforms", including almost all windows programs, are built over an infinite loop. <p>At another point the writer uses his stopwatch to figure out the clock frequency of the microprocessor he is working with and pats himself on the back for being so clever. Once again, for the novice: an embedded systems developer with enough skill to write a book on the subject would use an oscilloscope to make this measurement. <p>And so on.<p>Buy "An Embedded Systems Primer" by David E. Simon instead of this P.O.S. It will serve you well.</span>
