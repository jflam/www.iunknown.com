                    <span>The Complete Guide to Public Speaking is a complete guide. I was quite impressed with the array of topics covered in this book. There are almost fifty chapters in all! I didn't get this book because I am nervous in speaking. I got it because I want to be a better speaker than I am. I feel that with this book, I will be. There are really good chapters on getting prepared for a speech, dealing with the audience, and even handling what goes
<br />on after your speech. The chapters progress in a very quential, logical fashion. There are lots of exhibits, charts, and helpful lists that the author uses himself in his career as a speaker. While I don't aspire to be a professional speaker, I think that anyone who wants to advance in their career recognizes at one time or another that you're going to have to do some kind of speaking. To that end, this book will help a great deal.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent presentation for students of formal
<br />public speaking. It covers model speakers, target audiences,
<br />content, gestures and many of the fine nuances that professional
<br />speakers utilize in making presentations before audiences.
<br />The authors even cover insensitivities and proper protocol
<br />for public speakers. The book is a worthy investment for
<br />business people, a large constituency of students, teachers,
<br />collegiate administrators and public policy makers.</span>

                    <span>This book is simply the best in its field. I am guessing there are<br>probably more than one hundred current books out on public speaking. Lots of<br>them focus on important issues, but I can't imagine there are any out there<br>that cover the gamut of all the things that are covered in The Complete<br>Guide to Public Speaking.  Jeff Davidson has paid his dues as a speaker and<br>apparently as an author and lets it all fly in this book. He reveals the<br>inner secrets and little-known tidbits of wisdom that you have to know in<br>order to get better at public speaking. My confidence level in front of<br>groups has already risen as a result of reading this following some of the<br>recommendations, particularly those in the chapter on handling questions and<br>answers, what to do about nervousness and perspiration, and how to keep the<br>audience on your side.</span>

                    <span>This book covers so many areas unaddressed by other books in the field that it belongs on the shelf of every speaker and would-be speaker. The author talks about critical issues such as how to determine if your topic will be demand, who will want to listen, how to inject humor into your presentations, and how to keep your audience awake and alert. The author draws up many experiences from his own speaking career, but also cites dozens and dozens of other speakers and what they do to be successful. The chapters on story telling, avoiding speaker mistakes, and working with meeting planners are quite simply invaluable.</span>
