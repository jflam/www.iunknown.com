                <span id="Label1">While the second edition of <I>The Non-Designer's Web Book</I> won't  answer all of your technical questions about the inner workings of the Web, it  explains most of what a beginning designer needs to know: what the Web is, how  it gets to your computer, how to use it, and, most of all, how to design for  it.<p>  Any artist can tell you that you have to know how a medium works to get the most  impact from working in it. A basic understanding of how the Web works enables  the good designer to create the most effective sites. This book thoroughly  discusses the different kinds of graphics that are used on the Web, when to use  one over another, how to make the most of text styles, and how to design  navigation systems.<p>  The comparisons are the best stuff here--good design vs. bad design, why  designing Web pages is different from designing printed pages, and why a site  looks terrific on one monitor but terrible on another. Two chapters on properly  preparing graphics and setting typography for use on a Web site describe how to  avoid obvious mistakes that would make your work look amateurish.<p>  Not limited to design, <I>The Non-Designer's Web Book</I> shows how to get a  site up and running, register the domain name, and add it to search engines.  After the design is finished and implemented, the site has to be uploaded and  updated; this is explained, too.<p>  If there is one fault with this book, it's the lack of information on specific  authoring tools. The barest overview of the current crop of tools appears in  chapter 3, "Just What Are Web Pages, Anyway?", but a discussion of why you  should choose one package over another is absent. <p>  Don't let that fault stop you from buying this book, however. Plenty of  magazines regularly have Web authoring tool "shootouts." What the magazines  don't do, and what <I>The Non-Designer's Web Book</I> excels at, is tell you how  to make well-designed pages. If you're going to build Web sites, for either  personal or professional use, but you have no clue where to begin, start with  this book. It's easy to read, devoid of confusing jargon, and full of dos and  don'ts to help you avoid common snags. <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>"The Non-Designer's Web Book, 2nd Edition" is perfect for those of you who want to build your own site but don't want to use one of the canned templates so many ISP's offer. <br>Ms. Williams advice is, as usual, right on target and very easy to understand. Her humor is understated and well placed, encouraging the reader to continue in the project at hand. The book has plenty of color illustrations and screen shots, and is peppered with great advice on creating graphics, getting your site listed, basic design principles, and even a few lessons on HTML coding, if you like.<br>Each chapter concludes with a short quiz to help cement the principles that were just taught, and her coverage (despite what some people have written) of the basics is just what is needed for those of you who have skipped over an idea or two and wonder just what the heck something such as the difference between search engines and directories are. <br>Starting on page 50 is a Ms. Williams takes you through setting up a page and the associated site, step by step, in a concise, easy to understand way. It covers such things as typing and formatting text, changing colors, creating links and adding an email link, adding graphics, setting up a table, explaining what frames are and how to use them, and finally, adding some HTML code, if you want. These topics are the very basics of web construction, and the author expounds on them in later chapters, but it's especially nice that she distilled them into a short, easy to read section (that is extremely well illustrated) so you don't have to hunt through the rest of the pages later.<br>Some people have taken exception to the Netscape emphasis. They fail to realize that when the book was written Netscape was still a big player, and that IE's implementation of standards left a lot to be desired. Also, someone has stated that there are big errors throughout the book, but I haven't found any, and the example the reviewer gave (directions to use a page-sized graphic as a background) doesn't exist. In fact, Ms. Williams stresses that's just want you DON'T want to do. <br>There is a slight Mac-bias, but it is slight, with plenty of screen shots of Windows software along with the appropriate instruction. Given that the design industry is predominately centered on the Mac platform, this preference is easily understood. <br>All in all, this is one of the best books out for learning the basics of setting up your web site, as the title implies. You won't go wrong with Robin William's books, and this is just one example of why: clear writing, excellent advice, easy to follow instruction.</span>

                    <span> <br>We have been teaching 17-year old kids Web Publishing for many years. The Non-Designer's Web Book (1st -> 2nd Edition) used to be our textbook. We only realised how useful this book was after we replaced it with another textbook last year, now we change it back.<p>With lots of visual examples and straight-to-the-point explanations, this really is the Web book for beginners. <p>Also, although our teachings have been PC-based all along, we have no problem with the book at all.</span>

                    <span>This very fine book is well written, beautifully illustrated and generally most helpful. However, there are two parts to the book. <p>1. How to create a web page.<br>2. How to create an outstanding web page.<p>The 2nd part is outstanding, but the first part suffers from trying to be all things to all people. There are many web authoring packages, so I decided on the free FrontPage Express and Internet Explorer. The authors admit that they prefer Netscape, and appear to have a preference for the Mac. While they tried to be helpful to people who made my choices they failed. I was unable to finish the first exercise because their instructions on how to create an internal link makes no sense in FPExpress.<p>If you are comfortable with web design, and want to learn about design, color, balance etc. this is the book for you. But if you, like me, still find the whole idea of creating a web page intimidating you would be advised to find a different book; perhaps returning to this one when you have mastered the basics.</span>

                    <span>This book was awesome!  It is generated toward the beginner with very simple explanations and wonderful pictures so you know exactly what they are saying.  But even the experienced web designer can gain from this as you see your own work through more simple eyes.<br>Lots of ideas, explains from thought through concept, even shows you what NOT to do.  Touches bases on color, graphics, search engines, typography.  I was very impressed by this book and if you are a beginner this really is the book for you.  I was very surprised to the amount of information and the wide range it covers in such a little book!</span>

                    <span>This is a fabulous story written beautifully by: Eve Bunting. It is about a boy named Danny that gets in trouble with a gang called the outlaws. He ends up running and catching a boat to Alcatraz to hide for a while. He meets a girl named biddy on the boat. He starts taking the tour and he sneaks off and hides. Meanwhile he doesn't know that the outlaws are on there way over to find him. So he is walking around and he sees one of the outlaws and starts running. He gets away from the one but there are three left. They spot him and he starts to run and he sees biddy so he stands by her thinking that it would stop them but it didn't. The outlaws took both of them hostage and held them up in the prison. There is only one person on watch and that is an elderly woman named Mabyline. She has her headphones blaring and the TV going so she can't hear anything. Do they escape or is death there only escape. You will have to read and find out more.</span>
