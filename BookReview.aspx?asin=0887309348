                    <span>This book is controversial, but it is actually pretty good. If you can get beyond some of the surface-level disagreements you might have with Mr. Pollan, you will find his work insightful and that you agree with him more than you disagree with him.
<br />
<br />I enjoyed the read. I liked the "theory" part of the book better than the "pratical" part. I wish he had made the "theory" part a bit longer.
<br />
<br />I don't agree with everything that the author says, but I can't discount the value of the book. It is worth a read and will give you some real good advice without sentimental fluff. 
<br />
<br />Of course, this book is a career-oriented book, so if you are looking how to "live rich" religiously, philosophically, metaphysically, or whatever, look elsewhere. Most criticisms of Mr. Pollan's viewpoint on money is because the people criticizing his work are coming from a metaphysical or spiritual angle, while this book merely instructs on how to live richly in sense of a career. And he does that make it clear throughout the book (in telling people to use their career to get money and their other aspects of life to get other things).
<br />
<br />I guess someone may accuse Mr. Pollan of advocating overly strict  compartmentalisation of life. I can understand that point of view. Even if you are against Mr. Pollan's ideas in this sense, I suggest you still read this book. It will challenge you and is especially good for entreprenuers, who often get too involved in making their business big and "successful" without remembering about the bottom line--for them. This book is worthwhile on that account alone!</span>

                    <span>A number of negative reviews of this book mention Pollan's affinity for making money.  They also point out that he may be heartless, cold-blooded, un-loyal, and uncaring because money drives the theme behind lvining rich.<p>Welcome, finally, to corporate America people.  The fact is, as hard as it may be to digest, work IS about money and has been since we stopped bartering centuries ago.  Corporations are loyal to employees insofar as they can make money with them (note the recent issues with wholesale offshoring of technology jobs...do you really think other countries do it better than the richest, most educated populace in the world?  No, but they CAN do it cheaper).  Companies are loyal to their bottom line.  They don't cry over laying you off, restructuring your job, right-sizing, or anything else you read about everyday in the business section.<p>I happen to like my job...to Pollan and Levine, I'm one of those people that should consider themselves fortunate because I do gain some emotional satisfaction from the work I do; however, after reading the book and agreeing with the authors that emotional satisfaction can be derived from many, many other things but money is acquired only through work, I completely changed my attitude about my job.  No longer do I get upset about inane decisions that are made by management, the nonsensical policies that make up the paradigm of the week, the prepubescent co-workers:  I work for money.  I enhance my skill-set for money.  I look for promotions for money.<p>I don't worship money and never have.  Nor do the authors; they draw a clear distinction of why money is valuable and why you should obtain it (legally, of course, though other reviewers may have you think otherwise).<p>I recommend this book to anyone that works in our new (past 12 years?) economy.  It's helped me through two reorganizations in my company, and I expect it will continue to help me through the next.</span>

                    <span>This book contradicted itself in several places. For example, if you're an employer, pay as little as you can, offer no benefits, especially continuing education, hire indie contractors instead of employees, etc. If you are an employee, no loyalty, ask for as much money as you can get, demand paid continuing education, change jobs every three years happy or not, etc.<p>His advice works only if you are in businesses that are like his, lawyer or othere white collar professional, or jobs where machines can do most of your work. SOMEBODY has to do physical work of some sort, so that others can do what Pollan espouses. Someone has to clean houses, make food at restaurants, take care of the elderly in nursing homes. Are you prepared to either work all your life to pay $$$$ an hour for this, or at some point are you going to do some of this stuff yourself to save money and/or make money off of others? <p>He seems to feel that any sort of actual "labor" is something to be avoided. Well, who is going to weed his garden, or make the computers or any other machines he needs in his business?<p>I actually found part 2 of the book more useful.</span>

                    <span>"Live Rich" was published 2 years after the monumental book "Die Broke" by Steve Pollan and Mark Levine.  The latter comprising of  the most common-sense, statistically backed-up, and realistic approaches to life, career, and finances for the New Economy.  Most people then, and still now, follow an outdated philosophy designed for an economic environment that began the dissolve in the early 1970s.  <p>How many MBAs do you know who that have job security today?  Which job # are they on?  How about those lovely stock options?  How many have blown their chance of retiring by their late 30s (unless they switch models soon)?  Pollan's model for the new economy: "quit today, pay cash, don't retire, die broke."  Mass firings, down-sizing, and layoffs have been rampant in the 1990s when this book was written (1998), and they will continue as companies will have to cut their costs, oft-times quickly, in order to remain competitive and survive today (2003).<p>In "Live Rich," Pollan has 98 short but informationally full chapters ranging on lifestyle, employment, to investing.  The first seven are philosophical and the latter ninety-one are "Putting Theory To Practice."  Some chapter titles are: insurance, networking, benefits, financial ratios, mentoring, creditor relations, negotiating, receivables, payables, and seed money among many more. <p>The first chapter, is entitled "buying your freedom," and notes that freedom is subjective and means a different thing to different people.  For some it's a dream house on the beach, or being able to make a living from sculpting and painting.  Perhaps, spending more time with family, traveling the world, or starting one's own business.  Freedom involves doing what one wants to be doing.  Is being a W-2 worker, paying high amounts of taxes throughout your life, and waiting for the end of it to do what you want, freedom?  Some folks can tremendously benefit from reading this latest work if they can change the way they've been conditioned.  For those who haven't read Stephen Pollan yet, it's better to read "Die Broke" first.</span>

                    <span>Making money and achieving goals are wonderful aims, however, this book might as well be telling you to rob, steal and murder to get what you want. To be one person at work, and your human self afterwards. While not everyone can do what they love for work, I think a persons character is most important, nomatter what you're doing. This book seemed to have no ethics at all. <br>I couldn't stand it anymore, and trashed it. There are plenty of good books about being wealthy- spriritually and materially at the same time- that's what I want to fill my life with.</span>
