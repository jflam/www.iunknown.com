                    <span>Marathoning is more than a physical effort. It is also mental and spiritual. Body and mind both must be conditioned for the 26.2 mile adventure. This book addresses the whole person's preparation for a marathon. Bingham stresses that each person can find success at their own level. <P>A few years ago, I joined "Team In Training" to do a marathon while raising money to fight cancer. A noble goal, but I had never done more than a 5K. In fact I am a cancer survivor myself! I read this book cover to cover, and followed the ideas. Foure months later, I finished my first marathon! I have done a few more since then too! <P>If you are a hot-shot runner, go write your own book. Want a technical book in running? Go get one. This book is for the rest of us who just want to do the marathon, go the distance, and have some fun too! <BR>Thank You John!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for whomever needs some help on his/her training. It explains in perfect detail how to train for a full or half marathon according to your current level. It tells you what to expect, how to prepare yourself, and especially it makes a lot of emphasis on cross training (which means training by doing other sports other than running). Cross training is a key component in a good routine. Few authors put so much emphasis on this. He also explains the importance of stretching and using other sports for your benefit. I really think this is one of the best books you can get if you don't know anything about training for a marathon and you are planning to train for one.</span>

                    <span>Bingham always has a great perspective inside each edition of Runner's World. 'Marathoning for Mortals' keeps the same tone while connecting the dots of his 'high five' mantra into a training regiment.<P>You'll get high praise from Bingham while "Coach Jenny" brings it back to the training. They cover everything for the beginner as well as the the runner who is looking to take on his/her third/fourth marathon.<P>It takes you month by month through the training, anticipating every heartbreak and muscle ache. If you're thinking about marathoning, then start here, then move onto Galloway or Higdon.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book for a friend who is a beginning runner and wanted to achieve a lifelong dream of running a marathon. I did look through it before gifting it and found it to be full of doable advice for the average person. Mr. Bingham does not take the elitist attitude some runners have towards the sport of marathoning; that it has been cheapened by the influx of "mere mortals" who dare to venture out on to the 26.2 mile course with nothing more than a pair of shoes and a few weeks of training. Instead, he maintains that there is a place for everyone in the pack (and I agree) All runners pay the same entry fee. The "mere mortal" may have put in just as much training as the elite runner to get to the finish line. Some can cross the line in just over 2 hours, others require 3 or 4 times that long. In my opinion (and Mr. Bingham's) if they have given it all they have for 26.2 miles, they have run the same race. Anyone contemplating this lifetime achievement (I will NEVER forget the feeling of crossing the finish line at my own first marathon) but who fears that it is out of their reach, should buy this book.</span>

                    <span>A great easy-to-read book that gives you interesting info about what distance running means for your body, and what it takes for you to be prepared both physically and mentally, to get to the start line. John's and Jenny's explanations, experiences and suggestions encouraged me to revisit my training routine for, as I kept on reading, I realized how my original approach was not helping me to get the best out of my effort. I made some adjustments and they have resulted in evident improvements. <P>If you are not one of those seasoned-supersonic runners in the world, I'm sure you will find the book of great help, and at times, even a source of inspiration.</span>
