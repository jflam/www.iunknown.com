                    <span>Spoelstra's sub-title, "How to Market a Product Nobody Wants," is a bit of a misnomer.  For me, that conjers up the negative stereotype of the salesman/marketer tricking you into buying something you don't want.  Inside the book, Spoelstra's concept clearly is the polar opposite of that.  He should have called the book, "Making Your Product into Something People Really do Want: a Broader Definition of Marketing."
<br />
<br />Once you're inside the book, Spoelstra presents a litiny of ideas that are obvious once presented to you, but often seem counter-inuitive without some assistance seeing them.  As a marketer in a larger firm, I've run into a lot of the same resistance as Spoelstra and have found that if you can break down the resistance, his ideas really do work.
<br />
<br />Overall this is a practical guide, not just for marketers, but for anyone who runs a business.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Eskimos have all the ice they need and presumably don't perceive the need to get any more, let alone buy it.  Joe Spoelestra illustrates how to take that ice and turn it into something desirable (a Slurpee) for example, or bundle it with something that makes it desirable - a sled and a lift to create an experience to sell.  <p>Joe details his experiences, primarily in sports marketing. They are especially applicable to those in the entertainment and service industries but can be applied in virtually any industry.  The book is full of new ideas, fresh insights, and ways to repackage that which nobody wants in such a way as to change the customers' perception of value and create a compelling value proposition.<p>The book is much better than this review. :-)  Pick it up, read it, enjoy it and act on it.  "Ice to the Eskimos" will give you fast easy ideas that can be used to jump start your business!</span>

If you have been working in marketing for years, still, READ IT coz the author not only shares his real-life experience with you, but also REMIND you with something you have missed and not thinked of.<p>Marketing, Employee mentoring, Management...you can find everything from this book...<p>I would recommend this book to ALL people.

(I am applying them to my job profile now)<p>trust me...this book is a MUST for everyone.</span>

                    <span>This book by Jon Spoelstra is by far the top book on marketing I have ever come across.  He brings together so many fundamental truths in this easy to read format, that you can't help but wonder: 'How come I didn't think of that?' This book is beautifully presented with clear cut anecdotes that help the reader understand the authors viewpoint on customer service, marketing and expanding a company.  Too often in America today we have the viewpoint floating around from wall street down to small business industry that `down-sizing' is pro-survival and words like `expansion' is seldom addressed as a long term solution.  I found this book to be very refreshing with intelligent solutions for business owners and marketers with struggling products.  Everyone, no matter where you are in the American business scene, can benefit from this book.  Spoelstra is a true genius and has a sincere concern for the people he works with.  He conveys a very refreshing message throughout the book that business can be fun and rewarding, and marketing is a great game for the innovative.   I simply loved this book and found myself wanting to read it again and again.   Spoelstra has worked for four different NBA franchises and he shares his battle-tested experience with taking struggling organizations and making them profitable and successful.  His words of wisdom are truly wonderful, and I know everyone who has ever been in business will thoroughly enjoy this one.  Let the bells of bright ideas start chiming!</span>
