                    <span>I started a new carpentry business a while ago. This book really helped me out. Business wise, from figuring manhours, to giving job estimates and to actualy earning money. Skillfull tips such as scribing a jambless window sill and coping crown moulding. I've read many books on this topic, but I have to say this is one of the "best".</span>

                    <span>I am a retired aerospace engineer experiencing a "second life" as a woodworker/carpenter. Of all the finish carpentry books I have looked at, this one is better suited to the person going into the business (I am contemplating it). It offers a decent overview of the range of projects a carpenter will be called upon to do, and serves as a good general reference, though it takes on too wide a scope to go into much detail on all the topics it tackles. However, the last chapter, "Setting Up a Subcontractor Finishwork Business," is worth the cost of the book for someone who wants to learn about contracts, billing, and some of the management issues involved, which may be even more intimidating than the hands-on work. If you really get serious about the business, however, be sure to check out David Gerstel's "Builder's Guide to Running a Successfil Construction Company."</span>

                    <span>This book is outstanding. It has already paid for itself many times over.  If you're doing a finish carpentry project or even contracting one out, then this should be required reading.<p>This is a well-written manual that covers all aspects of finish carpentry including pricing your work.  The advice is sound and this book has saved me from making a number of mistakes.  The best part is that Mr. Tolpin is a fine writer and he even manages to make this an interesting read.<p>If you're interested in finish carpentry this is a great book for you.  I read this book while a contractor was building a house for me -- I learned enough to get him to correct some framing and drywall problems that would have hurt me later.  I also learned what to do before the drywall went on to save myself time when I added the chair and crown moldings.</span>
