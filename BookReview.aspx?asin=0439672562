                    <span>This detailed, intricate pop up by Robert Sabuda is a must have for any pop up lover. It would make an incredible Christmas gift, too. Sitting out on a table during the holidays, it will attract adults and children. If nothing else, it will slow you down a bit during the season to open every alphabet letter and appreciate all the detail of the book.</span>

                    <span>This thrilling book grabbed me immediately. The paper folding is unbelievably intricate & gorgeous. The story behind it was so meaningful, too. I bought about twelve copies for presents the year I first saw it. It's not for small children unless an adult is present to stop possible damage to the paper folds. I'm saving one copy for our son whenever he marries.</span>

                    <span>This is a simple, yet beautiful book of pop-up paper scultptures, each representing a theme from A to Z. It is not a book for young children, but rather for an older child or an adult who appreciates simple elegance and dramatic paper sculptures. This is also a great book for people who like to collect alphabet books. It also makes a beautiful "coffee table book" during the holiday season.</span>

                    <span>I discovered Robert Sabuda's books while researching Amazon for children's books.We have 5 grandchildren , all under the age of 2 with the exception of l; she turned two in July! Not only do I plan on ordering this exceptional book for them all, I'm getting one for myself. I am 62 years old!!! I plan on collecting ALL of Sabuda's works of art. That's how highly I recommend The Movable Mother Goose. You will be highly pleased with this book!</span>

                    <span>While the cover of this book looks very inviting, the lack of color inside makes the book uninteresting for children. Adults/Teens may enjoy the oragami cut-outs, but the child we gave it to had no use for the book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in oragami. It should not be confused with a teaching tool for the alphabet at Christmas time.</span>
