                    <span>I support Oracle 8i and 9i on Windows, HP-UNIX, Solaris and LINUX. This book has become my only UNIX reference. It not only explains how to interact with UNIX but also details the differences between the different major UNIX dialects. The focus is not on tuning Oracle so much as establishing and monitoring the UNIX platform to support an Oracle Database. The author explains UNIX administration from a DBA's point of view and details those commands a DBA needs to understand to insure that Oracle operates optimally in the UNIX environment. The scripts allow a DBA to proactively monitor UNIX and anticipate problems. If you are looking for a book on installing UNIX this is not it. If you are a DBA supporting Oracle in a UNIX environment you should always have this book close at hand.</span>

                    <span>I'd worked with Oracle 7.x on AIX boxes before but my most recent experience has been with Oracle on Windows. Our production system (9.2.0.3) was moving to an AIX box and one of the other DBAs thought that this would make a nice Christmas gift.<P>A nice thought.<P>The major problem is that most of the examples are wrong. The technical editing was incomplete. In the example comparing MS-DOS and UNIX commands, half of the examples are placed in the wrong column. I kept going throught the book, hoping that the examples would clear up or that I could find a systematic error so that I would know what errors to expect. The errors are random and persistent. An erratta sheet would be basically republishing the book.<P>It sits on the shelf unopened. I have not used it to bring our Windows DBAs up to speed on UNIX because I would first have to unteach them the flaws that they saw in the examples.<P>The text itself is perfectly good. Excellent. If you know Oracle and you know UNIX and you can ignore the examples then it's a fine book.<P>But for someone going from Windows to UNIX I predict that it will lead to much frustration.</span>
