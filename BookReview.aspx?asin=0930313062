                    <span>I bought this after about 5 years as a bookdealer thinking it might help me out on the road. It did not. Most of first edition identification is common sense, and I just didn't find this booklet very useful. It is concise and accurate and comprehensive, so no taking away from the other reviewers. If you have never worked in the used book business, this would be a very good book. But if you are very serious, consider the Zemple guide from Spoon River Press.</span>

                    <span>The introduction gives a solid background on first editions in general. The bulk of the booklet -- and it is a booklet to carry with you -- is a 100-page list of about 3600 publishers, large and small, famous and obscure. For each publisher, the typical first edition clues are given. Indispensable and affordable.<P>For the details of well-known true firsts, itemized title by title, see the author's other book, Points of Issue.</span>

                    <span>I owe quite a lot to Bill McBride and his A Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions. When I started collecting books in earnest over a decade ago, I knew very little about first editions [more correctly 'first printings']. My first education in 'firsts' came from a 3rd Edition of this handy little book. I always carry it [now the 6th Revised Edition] when I'm doing the used bookstores somewhere [the urban counterpart to the rock collecting I do in the outback] and many times Mr. McBride's little book has saved me from buying a book misidentified as a 'first' and has helped me find a few bargains when a long sought 'first' was not identified as such. Before you challenge the used bookstore circuit [my favorites are in San Francisco, Berkeley, and the Los Angeles/Orange County area] or, braver yet, the yard sale/estate sale/swap meet/Goodwill circuit, make sure you have a copy of Mr. McBride's little book in your hip pocket.</span>

                    <span>I can't function without this booklet. The best I've come across so far. If you're a book seller/dealer or a book collector, this is what you need to help identify First Editions. It has the Publishers'names and how to identify each Publishers'First Editions. And, small enough to carry with you everywhere. I highly recommend this booklet, the knowledge it gave me is priceless.</span>

                    <span>This little book in a nutshell clears up any questions you may have if you're having trouble telling if your old book is a first edition or not. As a book lover and collector AND seller of books online, I found several books in my possession that I had doubts were first editions. I searched my book and found they WERE First Editions. Without this little book, I would have never, ever known.<P>A Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions is a little expensive, but in the end, you'll get your money back!</span>
