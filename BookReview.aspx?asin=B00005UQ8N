                <span id="Label1">The war in the South Pacific, a country doctor in Colorado, victims of industrial pollution in a Japanese village--all were captured in unforgettable photographs by the legendary W. Eugene Smith. This program showcases over 600 of Smith's stunning photographs and includes a dramatic recreation in which actor Peter Riegert (Crossing Delancey, Local Hero) portrays the artist using dialogue taken from Smith's diaries and letters. Interwoven through the program are archival footage and interviews with family and friends of this brilliant, complicated man, whose work developed from twin themes of common humanity and social responsibility. </span>

                    <span>This is a great introduction to the greatest photojournalist. I don't feel that I am exagerating here at all. Smith changed the history of photography, and his pictures changed in very real ways, the history of our country and others as well. He was a complicated person, likely suffering from significant psychological issues and other problems, but his work shines through.<BR>The movie shows him, blemishes and all, as the photographer,poet,benzadrine user,manic artist who defined a discipline that brought horrow and joy from places far away, suddenly into our living room, suddenly very close to us.<BR>This is a typical "PBS style" documentary - you're children may become bored, but I would recomend it to any one who loves photography and photojournalism.</span>

                    <span>I just watched this documentary. It is an honest and very well conducted portrait of this man, Gene Smith, probably one of the most important photographers of our time. Claerly, the man who inspired the fancy-overrated-rich-and-famous Sebasti√£o Salgado. But Eugene was an artist in the pure sense, sensible, human, and with a genuine concern about our world, and obsessed with his job to show us the truth. Even a very bad conducted personal life, wouldn't hurt the precious art he left to us.<P>The fact about this film is that it seems to be no book around as rich and detailed. If you already like Eugene Smith, buy it. If not, buy it too, and you'll learn to love him.</span>

                    <span>The video W. Eugene Smith - Photography Made Difficult gives a solid picture of a complicated, talented photographer. It is not a picture album on tape. It is the dramatization of Smith's life as he moves from place to place to capture his stories. This video is the story behind the story. If you did not know that Smith was passionately outraged at social injustices and bringing those injustices to the public eye, you certainly know it by the end of the video. Excellent for soruce of knowledge and for entertainment.</span>
