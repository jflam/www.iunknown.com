                    <span>Vaillant's long-term study of college graduates investigates the ways in which the adaptive mechanisms of various individuals help explain why some people manage to cope effectively with the challenges in their lives while others cope barely or not at all. "One can live magnificently in this life if one knows how to work and how to love.... Adaptation to life means continued growth."

                    <span>I read this book a decade ago. I am a woman, and despite the fact that the study was of men and their maturing process, this was the most influential book I have ever read. Some of the Harvard men who were born with silver spoons in their mouths did not do very well in life; others who came from comparative "poverty" did better than those who had a foot up. Why? Those who did well learned how to respond to the knocks that life gives all of us. The book is very specific about what consitutes a mature response to life's setbacks and what constitutes an immature response. It gave me hope that no matter what a person's background, they could rise above it by becoming self-aware and learning how to better respond to what happens to them. This book gave me hope -- not in an inspirational "you can do it" kind of way, but in a researched, "this is what happened to these poeple" kind of way.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Vaillant mines a long-term study of exemplar Harvard graduates and plots those men along a dimension of "adjusted-ness" to life.  Some the best-adjusted share particular personality traits.  Some the least-adjusted also have commonalites of ego defense mechanisms.  Truly, time will tell who gets the most out of life and who does not.  Thanks to the Grant Study and Dr. Vaillant, much has been revealed about what influences the course of one's life.</span>

                    <span>I am now thinking about buying this title. I've read the opinion of the reader that backs it, but .... I am almost sure (due to many previous experiences) that the only shortcoming is not just about women, it for sure has been very probably written taking into account (hope I'm wrong) that north-americans are the only people living in this planet. So, if you are looking for readings that help you to succesfully deal with another and/or different type of society, or another type of country, opinions are so deeply oriented to northamerican way of handling life, they are not worthwhile and hardly applicable.</span>

                    <span>I've read ''Adaptation to Life'' several times over the past decade, and I'm not a mental health professional. It's extremely interesting to anyone who wants to learn more about the ego mechanisms of defense, yet is markedly different from the usual self-help tome authored by a psychiatrist or a social worker based on findings from his/her practice. Why? ''Adaptation to Life'' is based on the findings of a study of actual human beings from the time they graduated from college through late adult life (60 years old or so).  That long-term view helps to illustrate that what might be construed as good adjustment to life in one's twenties might be less useful when one is over 50. Its main theme, that rather than being absolute and unchanging, mental health develops and matures over a lifetime, is reassuring. I've found the book useful as a ''guide,'' of sorts, to return to again and again as I grow older. The only shortcoming to ''Adaptation to Life'' is that the study did not include women.  I'm curious as to whether the development and maturation of ego mechanisms of defense might be different for women than for men. But to dismiss this well-written book entirely for that reason alone would be a mistake; after all, many of the hurdles that must be addressed in the course of human development are the same for males and females. The final plus is that ``Adaptation to Life'' is fairly free of medical jargon and therefore an easy read for non-clinicians.</span>
