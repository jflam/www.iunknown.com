                <span id="Label1">Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, offers an historical examination of U.S. foreign policy and the way it has become so complicated, divisive, and fraught with unintended consequences that it is beyond the control of any one group or ideology. Looking back at the 20th century in an attempt to identify a grand strategy for the future, he declares the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the attacks of September 11, 2001 to be "lost years" in which a difficult global shift began to take shape. He identifies this transition as the beginning of a shift from a "Fordian" (as in Henry Ford) system of mass production and mass consumption to a more dynamic "millennial capitalism" in which the free market is changing to benefit more people around the world, particularly those in developing countries. Mead also looks closely at how the Bush administration has reacted to the September 11 attacks and the threat of further terrorism, offering both thoughtful praise and sharp criticism in nearly equal measure. (The book is worth reading for these incisive comments alone.) In explaining the distinctions between "sharp" (military), "sticky" (economic), and "sweet" (cultural) power as tools for shaping the world, he makes clear that he believes the U.S. should be shaping the world&#151;ideally by example and shared values, but also through military force and economic coercion when necessary. A strong "advocate of the American project," Mead remains optimistic about the future and predicts that the U.S. will be successful in spreading economic and political freedom far and wide, including regions that will offer great resistance to such changes. At times the narrative gets bogged down in potentially confusing academic terminology, but overall the book is filled with thought-provoking ideas and intriguing details about the role and limitations of U.S. influence and what it bodes for the rest of the world. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>Don't judge a book by its size: the scope of this small book is immense and its proposals, put forward in a balanced, bi-partisan spirit, deserve serious consideration. My two complaints are: (1) As in many books in international affairs, the recommendations -- some of his best material -- are held to the very end of the show. By then, I'm afraid some of the audience may have left for home, missing a set of very interesting observations. (2) He takes President Bush to task for failing to prepare the American people for the level of effort required to stabilize Iraq. He is not alone in that criticism. But I think there were significant limits to what the Administration could have done in that area. American expectations were anchored in Desert Storm and, no matter the argument, those expectations were not to be easily budged. <P>Now, back to the Mead's Metternich line -- what's not wrong, is the American project. That project consists of the efforts of the U.S. to bolster its own security while building a peaceful world order of democratic states linked by their adherence to the global market (and capitalism generally). Working from the premise that the project is sound, Mr. Mead wrote this book for the purpose of improving our ability to realize the objectives of the project. In doing so, he covers a considerable amount of history, for he is keen to show how, despite our underlying success over the past century and the last decade in particular, forces below the surface and barely discernible developed like a "gathering storm" in opposition. The decline of the Fordist state, with its emphasis on productivity, but its allowance for a scope of state action, created hostility to the project among poliltical elites. And, not surprisingly, at century's end, a broad mistrust developed over the rising wealth and power inherent in pax Americana. According Mead, to secure the American project in the 21st century, American must take a greater interest in building a stronger institutional base for global governance. Here, I think, the challenge is immense. Domestically, probably only Republicans can lead that charge; internationally, I fear that only Democrats will be sufficiently trusted, at least while the Bush Administration reigns. I think Mead is right about the need to bolster global governance, including regional institutions; so I hope I'm wrong about the obstacles posed. His final pages, about how it is critical to unleash the forces of global market mechanisms to the relief of intense poverty are absolutely spot on. Perhaps Mead's next project might explore that important objective at greater depth.</span>

                    <span>This book, along with John Lewis Gaddis' SURPRISE, SECURITY AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE, will tell you what's going on in U.S. foreign policy and why.<P>POWER, TERROR, PEACE, AND WAR is a page-turner. I read it in two days, and am now wishing for more. <P>Probably the most important aspect of the book is that it explains what America is trying to build in the world, not just what America is trying to destroy. It also explains why the world is not convinced that the American project is either sound or good. <P>POWER, TERROR, PEACE, AND WAR contains the most balanced assessment of the Bush White House I have seen. I would not call this book an argument for American unilateralism, although it does explain why the Bush administration has acted as unilaterally as it has. And I cannot predict, after reading this book, which candidate Walter Russell Mead will vote for in 2004.<P>The final chapter is a tour de force, offering novel solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to U.N. reform, to Mexican immigration and to the retirement of the Baby Boomers (hint: the last two issues are linked). Amazing.</span>

                    <span>Walter Russell Mead's greatest talent may be his ability to distill remarkably complex issues into useful and easily remembered paradigms. Moreover, his paradigms invariably improve on or expand popular ways of things about complex issues. So, for example, in "Special Providence," Mead broke down the standard binary concepts for foreign policy schools such as "hawk vs dove," and "realist vs idealist," and replaced them with four traditions named after presidents (Jacksonian, Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, and Jeffersonian). This paradigm is a more useful prism to think about how Americans conceive foreign policy.<P>In "Power, Terror, Peace, and War" Mead again suceeds in retooling popular abstractions for a better understanding of US foreign policy. The book devotes itself to explaining the transition of American foreign policy grand strategy, from Cold War era policies to the present. <P>Mead begins this effort by finessing Joseph Nye's popular concept of "hard" vs "soft" power, further dissecting them into "sharp" (military),"sticky"(economic), "sweet"(values, culture, ideas), and hegemonic (the collective geopolitical effect the three have in creating a global order). These concepts are explored in lively, insightful prose, and the reader will easily carry the concepts with them long after reading the book.<P>Next, Mead engages in an engrossing discussion of the economic/political transition of America from a more standardized, centrally regulated "Fordist" system, to the highly decentralized, mobile and fluid system of "millenial" capitalism. The opportunites and resistance that the shift offers the world is explored, but Mead sees the revolutionary impact America has stirred as unavoidable for the rest of the planet. Understanding this tranistion, argues Mead, offers a valuable prism through which to interpret the highly charged and often contradictory attitudes many foreign societies harbor to the US.<P>The main body of the book, in fact, is devoted to explaining how the breakdown of "Fordism" and the revolutionary effect of "millenial" capitalism at once both strengthens and weakens America's position in the world, as well as destabilizing political/economic orders in foreign nations while also offering potential gains for the world. Here, Mead is generally optimistic, but says the waters will prove challenging to navigate.<P>The closing chapters assess the Bush administration's response to the challenges laid out in previous chapters, along with a discussion of the unique challenge posed by al Qaeda. Due to the highly charged politics today, it is within these chapters that many will either applaud or decry Mead's argument. His take? He believes that strategically, Bush has made the right decisions, but often botched the public diplomacy. What will further ruffle feathers, however, is Mead's easy acceptance of both the "Jacksonian" zeal and rise of evangelical populism as defacto forces that are ascendant, inevitable, and even healthy for our republic, a cocktail of politics Mead describes as "American Revivalism." Liberals, secular warriors, and those who believe in global governance will have great difficulty with these chapters.<P>Mead's book closes with a call for reinvoking the containment policy as both a paradigmaic and public diplomacy tool to define a new counter terrorism policy.<P>Overall, "Power, Terror, Peace, and War" lives up to Mead's standard for improving a reader's ability to think and talk about US foreign policy. Personally, in my informal conversations about US FP, I cite Mead more often than any other author, and this is testament to the utility of his concepts. This book is not, however, a proscription or road map on specific policies - leave that for Kissinger or the "Brez." I rate the book at 4 stars because it didn't quite match the level of insight of Special Providence, and also because the book was a bit shy on citations. IMHO, in discussions as broad as US grand strategy, it is almost a requirement to streamline prose by frequent reliance on citations, where readers may pursue to verify or dissect an aspect of argument. Mead is a bit a thin here, opening him up to the caricature of "polemic." Despite these quibbles, however, I rank this as one of the more important books on US FP, up there with Kagan and Brez.</span>

                    <span>This is largely a justification of American foreign policy. Mead's position is that Bush made mostly the right choices even if some of the planning and execution were not the best. Along the way I think Mead does a good job of explaining why the current administration believes that preemptive wars and unilateralism are sometimes necessary. He uses a plethora of coinages, American Revivalists, Arabian Fascism, millennial capitalism, harmonic convergence, Wilsonian Revivalism, Fordism, etc., in an attempt to provide a historical context. To be honest I got a little lost among these labels and had to frequently turn to the index to look up their first use so as to keep them straight in my head.<P>Mead's approach is bipartisan and he strives to make it non-religious as well, although ending the book with a quote from Christ is perhaps not the best way to achieve that, nor is some seeming naivete about the double meaning of the word "revival." Indeed one gets the sense that Mead is not only cozying up to neoconservatives but to Christian fundamentalists as well. Nonetheless he also quotes the Prophet; and the label he pins on Middle Eastern terrorists, "Arabian Fascists," attempts to secularize the conflict. Of course he can use all the labels he wants (some of which are clearly euphemistic while others are attempts at political correctness and bipartisanship); regardless the conflict between the West and the terrorists in the Middle East will continue to be played out in quasi-religious terms.<P>In addition to labels, Mead also uses special terms to define American power. There is "sharp," "soft," "sticky," and "sweet" power. Sharp power is military force and it is, to use Mead's words, "a very practical and unsentimental thing." (p. 26) Soft power is "cultural power, the power of example." Sticky power is economic power and it is sticky because it enmeshes others into economic dependence on business with the US. Sweet power is pretty much the same thing as soft power, "the power of attraction to American ideals, culture and power." (p. 36) In some places in the world, I would guess, sweet power would more properly be called "saccharine power."<P>Clearly this is American foreign policy seen from and justified from an American point of view. Thus Mead writes, "We do not want to...[impose] our will at gunpoint, but we also do not want to live in a world in which the United States cannot act without permission from a majority of other countries." (p. 63) This seems reasonable, and at any rate is realistic, but there is a fine line between realpolitik and the sort of absolutist belief in our righteousness that leads to the use of force to impose our will. Indeed Mead writes "that, for neoconservatives and Revival Wilsonians generally, American power is itself the summum bonum of world politics." He adds, "The End is so noble...that realist means are fully justified." (p. 90) The danger here is that along the way we may become that which we are fighting against.<P>Sometimes Mead's tone gets away from him and we are treated to indecorous outbursts. For example, while justifying the invasion of Iraq as a part of the greater war on terror, Mead writes, "This was a war, and the enemy had to learn who was the strongest and, if it came to that, the most ruthless." (p. 117) I dearly would hope that we can conduct the "war" against terrorists without becoming more ruthless than the terrorists.<P>At other times he is a bit snide, as when he remarks that "stroking Europe only seemed to increase Europe's already inflated sense of its importance in the world of American foreign policy." (p. 132) This is the mentality of the old politics among nations based on power. However I don't think this is the way we can best achieve American values and goals in the world. As Mead himself admits later on, less than five percent of the world's population, regardless of its power, cannot hope to control the other 95%. (p. 212)<P>Often Mead uses fuzzy phrases to make what are largely rhetorical points. In this way he reveals the politician in his soul rather than the professional journalist that he is. For example he writes, "The United States is not going to slow down its capitalist development to avoid offending the sensitivities of foreign countries..." (p. 159) But what does "capitalist development" mean? Is that the development of the Brazilian jungle or the Iraqi oil pipelines or is that about some infrastructure at home?<P>One can discern Mead's bottom line position from this statement on page 160: "A perfectly justifiable military action against the rogue regime in Iraq was effectively and widely portrayed as an assault by the United States against the foundations of international order." And one can see that he has a desire to broaden the war on terror when he avers that "Countries that allow their territory to host terror camps...and who...allow their financial systems to be used...[by] terrorist groups, are committing acts of war against civilization." (p. 174) I tend to agree with this sentiment, but does that mean we should consider invading Saudi Arabia?<P>Where I find myself in substantial agreement with Mead is that the structure of the United Nations must be amended in such a way as to reflect the actual distribution of power in the world. As Mead notes it is not right that (for example) France should have veto power over the rest of the world, or that a country with a million people should have the same voting power as a country with a billion people. Indeed, I believe that restructuring the UN and other international organizations such as the WTO should be a major goal of US foreign policy.</span>

                    <span>I found this an easy and interesting read. Mead's basic premise seems to be that the future of American foreign policy is less a question of who will be elected in November, and more a result of the impact of the transformative effect of the development of modern (millennial) capitalism. Important to me was the sense that foreign policy has become decentralized not only in the United States but in the world in general. No longer can the US, or any nation's government "go it alone" in setting its foreign policy - rather the interaction of political parties, corporations, special interest groups, etc. coupled with the every increasing unfettered access to ideas and coordination mechanisms (read "the internet, web logs, etc.) has "democratized" the foreign policy process in the sense that setting of foreign policy is no longer the sole domain of central governments.<P>Mead also creates some interesting labels for various political attitudes - Fordian, Jacksonian, Wilsonian. As noted above, he also has created labels for various forms of "power" or persuasion. They may not be perfect, but they do help the reader build a framework for thought.<P>Central to the theme of the book appears to be the notion that "millennial capitalism" is inexorable. My experience in the business world suggests that, unless we do fall back into despotism and dictatorship the driving forces of "millennial capitalism" are a genie out of the bottle. This suggests that those who would take issue with the general thrust of Mead's writing need to get beyond reactionary politics (its all about the oil!) and address the larger question - the negative impact on embedded special interests that benefit from the current economic order by the continued transformation of global enterprise. Downsizing, outsourcing, short product cycles, international management of global corporations (it is no longer a given that senior management of large domestic corporations are all American,) the internet, are creating new winners and losers in the world. The losers want to fight back. Others see in the dislocations the opportuity to rise to power. Thus, Mead suggests, the "grand strategy" has to contain both threats. To disagree, I suggest that one has to prove that "millennial capitalism" is not inexorable by proposing a viable alternative or convince me that those who are going to lose their positions of power, prestige, and privledge are will to go quietly into the night.</span>
