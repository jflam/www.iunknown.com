Many people don't realize that Acrobat PDF files can be used for more than just sharing cross-platform, visually accurate copies of their documents with colleagues and customers.

This full-featured guide also offers instruction on how to set up a digital signature for yourself and add security features to PDFs so you can sign contracts and other legal documents and share them safely and digitally.</P><P>In addition, the book covers some of the more commonly known features of the full version of Adobe Acrobat 5--using the comments tools, making eBooks, searching PDFs for keywords, setting opening preferences for your readers, and designing interactive forms. And, of course, it shows you the various ways you can make PDFs from other leading applications.</P><P>As an added bonus, the print book comes with a companion CD-ROM that demonstrates how to use Acrobat to create movies, interactive crossword puzzles, maps, and more. You'll be surprised at all you can do with Acrobat by the time you're done reading this must-have reference!</P> </BODY></HTML></span>

                    <span>I have to concur with the NY reviewer who said this is a manual that all others should aspire to. How to's and examples are often presented in multiple forms to aid in understanding. The illustrations are clean, clear, and exremely helpful. The writing is concise, clear, and actually fun to read! The included CD presents wonderful examples of state-of-the art pdfs. While hardly a geek, I found myself reading the book before bed at night simply because it was so interesting! Kudos to the authors! I highly recommend this book not only to anyone wishing to learn everything worth knowing about Acrobat but also to anyone who aspires to write a similar text. It's a master class in information presentation as well as how to produce pdf's.

                    <span>I bought four books on Acrobat 5, and this one is by far the best. It is written conceptually. It appeals to the senses as well as providing an education. Taking vast amounts of information and refining it so that it is presented simply yet thoroughly. I enjoy reading it. <br>  I also bought Classroom in a book by the Adobe Creative Team and it is work. I am sure over time I will derive a lot from it, but Master Class is fun. You would never know that your working because you are too busy seeing all the cool stuff you can do with Adobe 5 and how to do it. <br>  I also bought Real World PDF with Adobe Acrobat 5 by Anita Dennis, Industrial Strength Production Techniques, and that is a book for advanced students. It explains everything clearly, and is a big benefit for explaining the details on how to fit Adobe PDF into your print production overflow. <br>  Adobe PDF is so much more than simply converting your files. It appears simple on the outside, but when you read Adobe 5 Master Class, you will be enthralled with how much more it does. Highly recommended for beginners and advanced students.</span>

                    <span>It was tough to decide if this is a four-star or a five-star book. Four and a half stars would be my preference.<p>At any rate, if you can afford only one Adobe Acrobat 5 book, you might be better off buying Acrobat 5 Hands On Training (HOT). I recommend, though, saving up enough money to get every book on Acrobat you can, for it is the wave of the future and a must for anybody wanting to put information-interactively on the web - my term is info-tivity - and the best thing this Hypercard pioneered the process at Apple's MacIntosh.<p>There probably is not single more valuable software tool for making money than Acrobat and I will be upgrading to version 6 as soon as I return stateside. That's the good news - the bad is that I will likely have to upgrade my library to keep in tune with the changes in this great software.<p>Back now to the review - if you intend to post any video, animation or audio on the internet you simply are going to have to purchase this book.<p>Further, if you are going to self-publish any sort of periodical on the web, you will definitely want to download HOW NOT TO START A MAGAZINE. by B. Ann Bell. Then, go read HOW TO START A MAGAZINE, STARTING & RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL NEWSLETTER OR MAGAZINE, PUBLISH YOUR OWN MAGAZINE, GUIDEBOOK, OR WEEKLY NEWSPAPER, and PAPERLESS PUBLISHING and do a google search for the soon-to-be LJs BREAKING FREE$.<p>Yes, that list is long but each of these is a valuable source of information for anyone trying to make money by publishing on the internet - Bill Anderson (LJ).</span>

                    <span>I create PDF multimedia presentations and I own every book available on Acrobat 5.0+. Master Class is by far the best reference I own in terms of practical information.<p>If you're creating complex forms or trying to master Javascript, you'll need Padova and Deubert, too. But if you're looking for ideas on how to create presentations that blow people away, this is the book to buy.</span>
