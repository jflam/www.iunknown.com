                <span id="Label1">If Dilbert and Tom Peters ever attended the same party, they'd probably find themselves in opposite corners. The cynical cartoon character would have a hard time in Peters's upbeat, high-energy world of "Cool-Beyond-Belief." <I>The Brand You50</I> is Peters's manifesto for today's knowledge workers. It joins his Reinventing Work series, which includes <I>The Projects50</I> and  <I>The Professional Service Firm50</I>.<p>  In <I>The Brand You50</I>, Peters sees a new kind of corporate citizen who believes that surviving means not blending in but standing out. He believes that "90+ percent of White Collar Jobs will be totally reinvented/reconceived in the next decade" and that job security means developing marketable skills, making yourself distinct and memorable, and developing your network ability. His <nobr>list-filled</nobr> prescriptions cover everything; for example, "You <i>are</i> Your Rolodex I: BRAND YOU IS A TEAM" (no.&nbsp;22), "Consider your 'product line'" (no.&nbsp;25), "Work on your Optimism" (no.&nbsp;35), "Sell. SELL. <I>SELL!!!</I>" (no.&nbsp;47). While the book is overwhelming at times--its hyperactive typography pretty much shouts at you--any baby boomer thinking about his or her career will find much to consider. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I></span>

<br />What Peters writes is undoubtedly correct if you want to get on in the new workplace.  If you don't have the backing of wealth and/or family ties then behaving as he suggests is probably one of the best ways of attempting not to sink to the bottom, or near bottom, of the wage heap.  However, in order to succeed by his method you have to do a little bit of self deception.  You have to pretend that the old way was bad, and that the new way is free and in the original American craft/mercantile tradition.  
<br />
<br />Peters spends quite a lot of time attacking the old way of jobs for life and workplace security as being boring and unfree, so this seems to be an important part of the technique you must apply to yourself (of branding yourself).  What he doesn't emphasise is that in the old system you had the security to be free.  You could pretty much work as you pleased, you could leave the work if you found you hated it, or it was too oppressive, and get new work reasonably easily, you could partially avoid authority because no-one cared as long as you looked like you were achieving something.  If your marriage was in trouble or your kids were ill, people would cut you some slack - you could have some kind of workplace community, mutual knowledge and mutual support.  You had unions, so you could stand together and try and make sure that you got decent wages and that not too much of your life was sacrificed to work, or workplace injury.  You and your boss might even get on with each other.  Not true in his method.  With the new workplace you have to please and appeal to your masters all the time; compete all the time, otherwise no work.  No work, no money, no record, no status, no more work.  And, of course, even though this may be the only way to work nowadays, it will not be successful for everyone anyway.  The system requires catastrophic failure to motivate success - blame it on lack of skill, lack of talent, lack of hard work, lack of work - what ever you will, it's no responsibility of the masters.   The laws will go into place to make it so, if they haven't already.
<br />
<br />He also attacks the social security system for demoralising people.  Perhaps he has not seen too much of the demoralisation produced by starvation and no money, or perhaps he dislikes it because it did mean that people could leave their work if it was bad and look for something else.  It meant people were not desperate if they lost work or their company went bust, they could survive without having some do-gooding religious group prying into their lives.  Sure, some ingenious people used it to be free and do what they wanted, art, surf, look after their kids, set up a business, get an education, become self reliant and that is a undoubtedly a bad thing, but most people used it because they had to.  Indeed you might think that the more work becomes temporary and unstable, contracted and job to job; the more everyone might need social security, the more it might support the system.  But not if you want most people to be desperate to take anything and to be really subservient.  
<br />
<br />So this is freedom.  Sure even in slavery you could be free in this way, you could say `yessir', `yesmam' as quickly as possible.  You could be as pleasing as possible, as appealing to the whims of your masters as possible, you might become entertaining and useful, and in return you might get an ok life - you might even be allowed to breed and own something.  Peters recommends this life for us all.  So it's up to you.  Do you take Peters on board and learn to bow and curtsey, deceive yourself and be cute, or do you take up some kind of political action?  That's the only choice really.

                    <span>I've only gotten through a few pages, and am very surprised at the profanity in it. Not the severity, but the volume of it. Profanity is usually a sign that the writer does not know English very well, which I doubt is the case with Mr. Peters. In the future, I would suggest he look up expressive words that are not profane, to try to get his point across. We don't use language like this in our house, so I'll be marking out his childish profanity in this book. As he says, 
<br /> 
<br /> For the one-in-a-hundred-thousand who doesn't 'get it'
<br /> 
<br /> he needs to 'get it' himself.
<br /> 
<br /> It's a shame, as I will probably agree with the sentiment (minus the profanity) that he is *trying* to get across.</span>

                    <span>Professor Peters is/was a Harvard professor of business who concentrated on researching and teaching competitiveness. I liked his serious books and text books. He's a really high energy speaker and has a quite lucrative business in coaching. Therefore, I should not be surprised that this little book is full of gimicky fonts, colors, buzz words... and is closely associated to the sales-oriented web site of the same name. Maybe there's good content there, but the presentation screams: motivational, not content-rich. And that's what I think the book is good for.</span>
