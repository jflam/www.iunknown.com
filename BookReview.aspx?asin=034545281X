                <span id="Label1">Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson&#8217;s groundbreaking bestseller, <i>When Elephants Weep</i>, was the first book since Darwin&#8217;s time to explore emotions in the animal kingdom, particularly from animals in the wild. Now, he focuses exclusively on the contained world of the farm animal, revealing startling, irrefutable evidence that barnyard creatures have feelings too, even consciousness.<br><br>Weaving history, literature, anecdotes, scientific studies, and Masson&#8217;s own vivid experiences observing pigs, cows, sheep, goats, and chickens over the course of five years, this important book at last gives voice, meaning, and dignity to these gentle beasts that are bred to be milked, shorn, butchered, and eaten. Can we ever know what makes an animal happy? Many animal behaviorists say no. But Jeffrey Masson has a different view: An animal is happy if it can live according to its own nature. Farm animals suffer greatly in this regard. Chickens, for instance, like to perch in trees at night, to avoid predators and to nestle with friends. The obvious conclusion: They cannot be happy when confined twenty to a cage. <br><br>From field and barn, to pen and coop, Masson bears witness to the emotions and intelligence of these remarkable farm animals, each unique with distinct qualities. Curious, intelligent, self-reliant&#8211;many will find it hard to believe that these attributes describe a pig. In fact, there is much that humans share with pigs. They dream, know their names, and can see colors. Mother cows mourn the loss of their calves when their babies are taken away to slaughter. Given a choice between food that is nutritious or lacking in minerals, sheep will select the former, balancing their diet and correcting the deficiency. Goats display quite a sense of humor, dignity, and fearlessness (Indian goats have been known to kill leopards). Chickens are naturally sociable&#8211;they will gather around a human companion and stand there serenely preening themselves or sit quietly on the ground beside someone they trust.<br><br>For far too long farm animals have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings. Shattering the abhorrent myth of the &#8220;dumb animal without feelings,&#8221; Jeffrey Masson has written a revolutionary book that is sure to stir <i>human</i> emotions far and wide.</span>

                    <span>Congratulations and thanks to Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson for another insightful and inspiring book. "The Pig Who Sang to the Moon" lives up to the legacy of "When Elephants Weep" and his other books, as it opens our eyes to the reality of the animals' world so that our hearts embrace the depth and complexity of their emotional lives. <P>The book is filled with surprising, heartwarming and even humorous stories that illustrate the emotionality of the animals typically relegated to the role of "livestock" in our culture. It also reveals hard facts about how these sensitive creatures are handled between the barnyard and the dinner plate. But mercifully, Mr. Masson succeeds at telling the often troubling truth about what animals experience at the hands of humans, without making the book too gruesome for sensitive readers to endure. The more gory details are tucked away in the endnotes at the back of the book for those who need the information and can bear to read it. The rest of us can move safely through the text, reminded of the reasons to make conscious choices about the food we eat and the clothes we wear, but also entertained by the remarkable stories and uplifted by the recognition of how much we share with our four-legged or feathered brethren.<P>"The Pig Who Sang to the Moon" is an enormously valuable collection of information and anecdotes that will help us all move a little closer to shedding the veil of denial about who animals are. We'll be the richer for it, as we dissolve the boundaries between "us" and "them" and renew our connection with all the creatures who share our planet.</span>

                    <span>Scholar and prolific author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson burst on the scene as one of the foremost contemporary writers about animals with the publication of "When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals" in 1995. "Elephants" was groundbreaking, showing that non-humans of all shapes and sizes lead complex emotional lives. The book became a New York Times bestseller.<P>Masson has since published three books about cats or dogs. All were fine works and fun reads, yet, as each focused solely on one species, none captured Masson's affinity to bring the reader onto the printed page as did his first animal book. While his dog and cat books touched your heart, "Elephants" seeped into your soul.<P>With the publication of "The Pig Who Sang to the Moon: The Emotional Lives of Farm Animals," Masson makes a grand return to his previous lofty accomplishment. Like "Elephants," "Pig" focuses on beings in addition to the chosen one who gets a mention in the title. Sharing with the reader the emotional complexities of many animals is one of Masson's greatest strengths; certainly no writer today is his superior. When he writes, "Farm animals-perhaps because of the fate that invariably awaits them-seem able to feel something I cannot," it makes you wonder if he's being too modest, while questioning whether you, the reader, can feel what he, the author, does.<P>In "Pig," Masson covers all of the modern-day farmed animals, devoting chapters to pigs, chickens, sheep and goats, cows, and ducks and geese. His research is superb; whether you are a long-time ethical vegan or a committed carnivore you will discover something you did not know about each of these beings. Are you aware that a pig is easier to house train than a dog? Or that chickens always know exactly what time it is? That goats are funny, inventive, and love unconditionally? Masson uncovers these and many more gems, including the elderly New Zealand couple whose two ponds fill up with wild ducks "every year, the night before duck season starts."<P>Masson also expertly discusses his supposition of farmed animal emotions, foreshadowing the naysayers certain to question his premise. He writes that "not so very long ago, ... people intimately connected to the lives of animals did not care whether animals had feelings or not." He then quotes Frans de Wall, Ph.D., Professor of Primate Behavior from the Yerkes Primate Research Center, who wrote in a 1999 New York Times editorial, "I still remember some surrealistic debates among scientists in the 1970s that dismisses animal suffering as a bleeding-heart issue. Amid stern warnings against anthropomorphism, the then-prevailing view was that animals were robots, devoid of feeling, thoughts, or emotions." Masson concludes: "in the absence of communal signs, such as physical gestures or sounds, humans are simply not equipped to understand animal emotions. This does not mean they are not there."<P>"Pig" is a book that pulls no punches, yet is "mainstream" enough to reach a wide audience. Masson doesn't shy away from the real issues, stating, in the first chapter, "The position I take in this book is a radical one," and "I think it is wrong to raise animals for food." Later he states "All you need do to make [animal slaughter] unnecessary is to say once and mean it: these deaths are not necessary. I do not have to eat meat."<P>In his concluding chapter, "On Not Eating Friends," Masson proclaims, "I have to be honest: My research leaves me in no doubt whatsoever, that to prevent animals from suffering unbearable agony, we must become not only vegetarian, but vegan." These are powerful and refreshing words coming from an author whose book is certain to get wide coverage and exposure.<P>If you wish to give farmed animals the best Holiday season ever, purchase two copies of "The Pig Who Sang to the Moon"-the first for yourself; the other as a gift for one of the future vegetarians on your shopping list.<P>~ Joseph Connelly (editor@vegnews.com) is founding editor of VegNews (vegnews.com)</span>

                    <span>I have been a vegetarian for 11 years, unwilling to eat anything that required "killing" an animal. After reading "The Pig Who Sang to the Moon", I cannot with a good conscience continue to eat the foods produced by animals/birds. The suffering they endure for my benefit cannot be justified. I am now beginning my path toward veganism and the small, but necessary, contribution I can make to alleviate the suffering of animals for the selfishness of man.</span>

                    <span>Masson is doing important work here. Those that accuse him of sentimentalism or anthropomorphism don't understand the project. All Masson is trying to do is generate a little consistancy between our feeling towards the animals in homes and the one on our plates. Perhaps some people will read this book and decide we should start eating dogs and cats. However, Masson rightly expects that most people would sooner pull all animals off the menu.</span>
