                <span id="Label1"><P>With its powerful combination of visual layout tools, application development features, and code editing support, Dreamweaver MX 2004 is sure to become the constant companion of many Web developers. Here to get you hands-on with it fast is the definitive project-based training on the topic from one of the master teachers at Linda.com training. Using a combination of project-based lessons, guided exercises, and QuickTime tutorials, veteran author Garo Green walks you through all the Dreamweaver MX 04 basics: navigating the new interface, creating and managing Web sites, and linking among pages. You'll learn about frames and forms, cascading style sheets, and Fireworks and Flash integration, and gobble up Garo&#191;s suggestions about best layout and typography practices. You'll also find extensive coverage of all of Dreamweaver's newest features: dynamic cross-browser validation, improved CSS support, built-in graphics editing, and more. Throughout, Garo shows you not just how to do something but why you&#191;re doing it and the results of your actions.</P></span>

                    <span>If you're running Panther on a Mac G4 machine, than this is the book for you, assuming of course you've upgraded from Dreamweaver MX. If you haven't than you certainly should think about doing so, because the 2004 version has so much to offer.<P>Others have said it, and I'll second the motion, this "Hands-On Training" book should have been the one to come with the official program. Garo Green and Lynda Weinman from lynda.com assume you have only limited knowledge of how your Mac works. No knowledge of HTML is required. If you can work your mouse, you're ready to go. You'll be designing your first website in no time at all. This one gets two thumbs up.</span>

                    <span>I started learning about web design and developing one year ago as an absolute novice. I read quite a few other books regarding Dreamweaver Mx and Flash Mx. Most of them are quite tedious but I forced myself through because I didn¡¯t know better. I wasn¡¯t able to put a web site together till I found the Hands-on Training series. I got acquainted with Garo Green¡¯ book and followed every step illustrated in the book to build a model site bansaihut.com. Within 3 months I was able to put together a sophisticated site (with the help of using Flash MX as well). Garo Green¡¯s humorous style makes a daunting task of learning web building from scratch simply a fun enjoyable process. Matter of fact, his book is so effective that I easily adapted to using Dreamweaver MX 2004. Out of curiosity, I purchased this 2004 book just for reference even though it¡¯s too easy for me now. Now I am a certified Macromedia Dreamweaver developer, I found Marc Campbell¡¯s Developer Certification Study Guide a must read for my current level. <BR>I don¡¯t regret spending time reading other books. In fact, it¡¯s best to read a few books regarding the same subject and learn something new from different authors. <BR>I¡¯m not saying other books are of lesser value but it¡¯s this very book ¨C the Hands-on Training that gave me the ability to create a live functional web site.</span>

                    <span>The authors start out by informing us that they are very proud to be teachers. They feel it gives them insight into how students learn. And they do a good job working you through the many features of Dreamweaver. In this respect I recommend this book.<P>But I've got a bone to pick...<P>As a hobbyist web builder who has been hand-coding for quite some time but now needs the time-saving power of a program like Dreamweaver - I feel they are teaching some bad habits. In Chapter 6 "Typography" they spend the first 2 pages talking about how the techniques they are about to teach are frowned upon and may one day be considered non-standard code. They also explain that in a later chapter they'll be teaching another way of working with Type that is future-proof. I ask: Why wait? Why not move up that later chapter to Chapter 6 and leave Chapter 6 as a PDF on the CD-ROM?<P>I'm also not a big fan of table-based design. But I can't fault the authors for embracing it - it's still the best way to get your site to look good on different browsers.<P>Overall the book is good. Especially for beginners.</span>
