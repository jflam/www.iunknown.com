                    <span>A wonderfully written little trip from the beginning of... well, everything right through to the ascendancy of humans. Bryson's mastery of language and his ability to turn a phrase are put to good use in taking a look at the theories and science behind astrophysics, geology, archeology, paleontology, and several other "ologies" as well. The best part is that Bryson manages to cover all this without being boring or overly breezey.<br>Almost everyone will find some part of this book interesting. Even if you weren't a straight A student in science class back in high school or college, the bits of science you do know are probably woven into the grander tapestry of science and time in a way you'll appreciate.</span>

                    <span>If you're feeling a little down, or just in the mood for a little laugh this is the perfect book for it.  Filled with little wisdoms this book is funny and cute.  They really made my laugh and some of them I could relate to.  This book is filled with pictures from the old books, and if you've read them, or seen the old cartoons you might recongnize some of these senarios.  One of my favorites is:  <p>"If you are trying to find your way home, and keep finding yourself instead back at the same sand-pit, it may be that the sand-pit is following you about."  <p>The book is filled with cute little wisdoms like that, many that are funnier.  I really enjoyed the book, and I think everyone will.</span>

                    <span>I thought that this book was adorable and very sweet.  It's perfect for all ages and it makes you  notice the simple things in life and that sometimes people make things more complicated than they need to be.  Winnie the Pooh definetly has the best advice on how to live a wonderful life and  realize what is really important - friendship.</span>
