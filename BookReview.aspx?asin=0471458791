                <span id="Label1">"As I write this, I&#146;m sitting in a restaurant in a major U.S. airport, eating my breakfast with a plastic knife and fork. I worked up quite an appetite getting here two hours early and shuffling in the block-long lines until I got to the security checkpoint where I could take off my shoes, remove my belt, and put my carry-on luggage through the screening system &#133;    <P>"What&#146;s going on? It&#146;s homeland security. Welcome to the new age of knee-jerk security at any price. Well, I&#146;ve paid, and you&#146;ve paid, and we&#146;ll all keep paying&#150;but is it going to help? Have we embarked on a massive multibillion-dollar boondoggle that&#146;s going to do nothing more than make us feel more secure? Are we paying nosebleed prices for "feel-good" measures? &#133;    <P>"This book was painful to write. By nature, I am a problem solver. Professionally I have made my career out of solving complex problems efficiently by trying to find the right place to push hard and make a difference. Researching the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, CIA, INS, the PATRIOT Act, and so forth, one falls into a rabbit&#146;s hole of interdependent lameness and dysfunction. I came face to face with the realization that there are gigantic bureaucracies that exist primarily for the sole purpose of prolonging their existence, that the very structure of bureaucracy rewards inefficiency and encourages territorialism and turf warfare."    </span>

                    <span>Ranum's book is engaging, unsettling, entertaining, and disturbing. Yet, I think it is an accurate assessment of the morass that is "homeland security." MJR may not make any friends in the FBI, INS, or DHS, but as he turns his keen analytical mind towards security issues broader than an area for which he is world-renowned -- computer and network security -- he brings clarity to this seemingly unfathomable topic. <P>Many security practitioners have recognized the "when you don't know what to do, do something" aspect of some homeland security initiatives. Ranum identifies the agencies and actions that shape homeland security, and makes suggestions for change. Warning: Not everything is fixable, and he makes that clear also. But the beginning of any solution is to first recognize the real problems -- the real risks. The next step is to assess what you are already doing. The third is to toss out what is not working, reform what is marginal, and implement what is missing. In this book, Ranum suggests solutions.<P>The security of the US homeland, and all that it entails, affects Americans, certainly, as well as the whole world. Mr. Ranum is a skilled writer and instructor. Never satisfied to merely lecture, he endeavors to "cause one to learn." Though he is famous in a highly technical field, the "techie" as well as the "artsy" will be able to read this book, as Ranum makes the subject matter accessible and -- although the subject matter is "life and death" -- enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>It is the kind of book you read slowly because you don't want Ranum's points to end. <BR>Ranum takes command of the reader from beginning to end just as forcefully as the PATRIOT act was literally rammed through by lawmakers. <BR>Each chapter captivates the reader by the very clever points and poignant facts. Ranum succeeds in presenting each point with a gripping sardonic crisp view.<P>Ranum yet again lives up to his reputation as an outspoken security expert with prolific, inventive points presenting a platform for a cataclysmic change of the public's opinion of Homeland Security and the various other security agencies that supposedly protects the United States.</span>

                    <span>It was reassuring to see Ranum discussing the areas he's known for: downplaying the over-hyped risks cyber-terrorism (and he has thoughtful comments on a cyber "pre-"Pearl Harbor). <P>But the rest of the book is a lot more about Ranum's opinions and speculations, and rather light on reliable facts. Where you already agree, you might cheer Ranum on. But if he introduces material that surprises or challenges, he cites no sources, so who know's if he's talking fact or blather?<P>In numerous places, he's vague or superficial or appears to contradict points he made a chapter or two back. It's as though the book was written in a number of brief bursts, the author forgetting between times what he'd said before.<BR> <BR>One strange example: on p174, Ranum claims that the Code Red virus might have been caught even by outdated virus software, hence Code Red's spread is indicative of mass lack of any kind virus protection, not simply virus writer being a small step ahead. Interesting enough to deserve a bit more of an explanation.<P>The book review by Rob Slade (Google newsgroups) takes Ranum to task for this comment. Then an "annoyed" Ranum, replying in Risk Digest 23.14, claims he never wrote this!<P>I'm pretty sure this was just an example of vagueness... but it's emblematic of what's wrong with this book, and it's exponentially moreso in the squishier political and governmental areas.</span>

                    <span>Don't waste your time or your money. Why would anybody want to read a book about homeland security (given all such a title entails) by an information security geek? Well, if you do fall for it, that's exactly what you will get. <P>For a more complete, expert treatment of homeland security issues, I recommend Richard Clarke's book Against All Enemies or Dan Verton's book, Black Ice: The Invisible Threat of Cyber-Terrorism.</span>

                    <span>This book is a rambling collection of opinion and assumed facts. It is very poorly edited (one chapter ends in mid-sentence) and there are way too many subheadings and bold extracted quotes that give the book more of a tabloid feel (and expands the number of pages -- maybe there wasn't enough material??). A lot of the "You should know" sidebars are statements of opinion dressed up as fact. There are some interesting factual tidbits, but it is almost too much effort to wade through the chaff to find them.</span>
