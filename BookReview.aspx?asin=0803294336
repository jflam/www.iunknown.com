                <span id="Label1">How good a pitcher was Washington Senator ace Walter Johnson? Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Joe Jackson considered him the best ever. His career strikeout record lasted for half a century, and no one's ever come close to his mark of 110 shutouts; some of his Senator teams were so bad, the only way Johnson could win was literally to keep opponents from scoring. Of course, the numbers alone don't tell the story. Johnson was a towering figure in the first quarter of the baseball century. One of the most respected--and liked--men in the game, he was something of an anti-Cobb: straight, honest, and clean, with a life off the field as content as it was accomplished on it. This is an excellent, exhaustive biography, showing clear affection for Johnson from the first pitch: Thomas is Johnson's grandson. Despite the blood tie, Thomas doesn't just go straight down the middle; he is willing to work the corners of his grandfather's life, which actually allows his relationship to his subject to add to the work's significant depth. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>THIS BOOK IS ONE VERY DETAILED AND FACT FILLED BOOK. I DON'T LIKE LONG AND DETAILED BOOKS BUT THIS IS AN EXCEPTION. THE AUTHOR DOES A GREAT JOB TELLING OF HIS STORIED CAREEER. JOHNSON WAS ONE OF THE NICEST AND RESPECTED MEN THE GAME HAS EVER SEEN. HE TRULY HAD ONE OF THE GREATEST ARMS EVER. I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN FOR IT TRULY IS A MUST READ. THE STORIES ABOUT HIM PITCHING TO SUCH GREATS AS BABE RUTH AND TY COBB AS FASCINATING. FOR HISTORIANS AND ALL NOSTALGIA FANS OF THE GRAND OLD GAME.</span>

                    <span>One of the best baseball books I have ever read- easily on my top ten list and maybe even in my top five. I was not aware that the book was written by Johnson's great grandson until I began reading; this certainly gave the material a lot of credibility.<br>  Walter Johnson was, without question, the greatest pitcher in baseball history. Along with Al Stump's work on Ty Cobb, Robert Creamer's work on Casey Stengel, and the recently published Cy Young biography (author's name escapes me), this book establishes a lasting legacy of Johnson on and off the field.</span>

                    <span>Simply stated, this is the most detailed as well as accurate baseball bio, at least of a player from pre-WWII years, we have. Yet Thomas keeps the story moving, and we get the full picture of the man and his family life as well. Jack Kavanaugh's "Ol' Pete" (Grover Alexander), and Reed Browning's "Cy Young" make excellent relievers, but here's your starting pitcher, and Big Train didn't need bailing out very often.</span>

                    <span>Written from the heart, and it shows.  Truly a magnificent piece of work from Henry Thomas.  I loved this book from beginning to end.  Follow Walter Johnson from beginning to end through the eyes of someone that actually cares about Walter Johnson, his grandson.  I cannot say enough great things about this book.  Such a teriffic treat about a wonderful character in the history of baseball.</span>

                    <span>I stopped after the first 300 pages or so, because the detailed game descriptions were just getting to be too much. I felt like I never got to know anything about Johnson the man, or his life, or the times that he  lived in. If you like reading those expanded box scores that they usually  have in USA Today during the World Series, and which tell every play in the  game, then this is the book for you.</span>
