                    <span>I am an avid reader, but I barely wanted to even finish this book.    I was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, and I don't think this book gives him enough credit.  I don't like the writer's style: his logic is difficult to follow sometimes, and he goes off on tangents instead of focusing on Reagan.  He describes Reagan as a President that no one liked; this is NOT true!!  
<br />Furthermore, I don't care for some of his (the author's) biased viewpoints that he threw in, like about the Vietnam War; they have no place in a book that is discussing the Life of Reagan.  </span>

                    <span>What an excellent read!  Not only well written that keeps one's attention, but this is fair and balanced, many times sounding Reagan opposition as well as laudatory.
<br />
<br />Truly a complex individual, Reagan is hard to capture without maintaining tensions, and this book achieves that.  Looking at his life in politics, it provides some background before his involvement with Screen Actors Guild, then his GE days before his governor days leading to the White House.  Then it disects his presidency from viewpoints of economics, Soviet Union, etc.
<br />
<br />One forgets just how passionate and into his love of freedom and country so this account provides this joggers so that the reader can see just how intelligent and responsible this leader was.  History I believe will bear that his was one of the significant presidents of all time, since he accomplished so much.
<br />
<br />Learned much that I had forgotten about him, e.g. his admiration of Calvin Coolidge, as well as famous wit and debating skill he possessed.  As Thatcher said of him, "He won the Cold War without firing a shot."  This was the Great Communicator.

                    <span>5DSouza's biography of Reagan starts off strong because he immediately addresses what most people who were born after, say, 1950 think of when they think of Reagan: that it is mindblowing that a man who was neither rich, nor intelligent, nor good looking, (sorry Ron) became not only the most powerful man in the world but also widely acknowledged (even among some democrats even!) to be one of the most effective leaders in the history of the world - perhaps most extraordinary in that even his staunchest allies concede that his success was improbable, yet even his strongest detractors agree that he was staggering in his impact and his efficacy. Any book that does not pause for a while to ponder this theme immediately loses credibility as a "modern" treatment of Reagan's tenure. So I give D'Souza credit for not ignoring what most people find so interesting about Reagan.
<br />That said, I do not really think this is an interesting book. It is pretty breezy and not that detailed. I also think that D'Souza is a little bit infatuated with Reagan, which is okay up to a point but he sometimes can't help but sound rather stilted or even inane in his praise. More or less, once D'Souza is done addressing the nature of the social phenomenon that is Reagan, his conclusions fall quite flat. Reagan was a success because he was "an actor" with the ability to adapt to any situation while tricking those around him into thinking that he really was as stupid as his brown polyester suits made him look? Yeah, right. Reagan was such a success promoting capitalism abroad because he "intuitively" understood the fact that leftist economic regimes were a bad thing? Sounds nice, but a big yawn as a driving idea behind this "new" look at Reagan. 
<br />(IMHO, I believe Reagan did not simply get up one day and grunt "Communism is bad." Over time, he came to understand HOW leftism corrodes and perverts a society to its very core - and that leftist governance invariably leads to fatal disintigration from the INSIDE OUT within a few generations - rather than from the OUTSIDE IN. Reagan's comprehension of the distinction between the two models of understanding are what were REALLY made him great in my opinion at least.)  
<br />Sometimes I was not sure whether D'Souza was fawning over the man or committing the same mistake he accuses other scholars of making: that of oversimplifying a most complicated person.</span>

<br />This illuminating work re-evaluates the presidency of Ronald Reagan with the benefit of hindsight. In the Prologue: The Wise Men and the Dummy, the author shows how wrong all the experts were about the Soviet Union for example, and how right Ronald Reagan was. When the most powerful empire in history quite soon imploded, Reagan's prophecies came true. It was the same with the economy.
<br />
<br />In chapter 1: Why Reagan Gets No Respect, D'Souza looks at the Reagan enigma, the harsh criticism of the pundits and the secret of Reagan's success. It reveals a complex figure, a distinctive personality of a man  larger than life. In chapter 2: The Education Of An Actor, the author considers Reagan's childhood, his career as an actor, first steps in politics and the way life prepared him for the presidency.
<br />
<br />Chapter 3: Reagan Goes To Washington, discusses his political career from 1964 to 1980. The part on how he confronted the counterculture chaos as governor of California makes for riveting reading. In the chapter A Walk On The Supply Side, the difficult year of 1982 is discussed, a year in which the economic prospects looked bleak. Reagan however, stayed the course and carried the country with his optimism.
<br />
<br />The next year, 1983, saw the beginning of a 7-year period of uninterrupted growth. The recovery took Reagan's critics by surprise, and that's when they ceased calling it Reaganomics. Contrary to popular myth, the 1980s was also a decade of great generosity, which saw a real increase of 57 per cent in charitable giving, from about 65 billion dollars in 1980 to 100 billion in 1990. In this period America became more prosperous, more innovative and more technologically advanced than Japan or Europe.
<br />
<br />The following chapters: Confronting The Evil Empire, Making The World Safe For Democracy and The Wall Came Tumbling Down investigate how Reagan foresaw the collapse of communism, how he planned it and how he brought it about. D'Souza points out how the intellectual eggheads got it wrong and Reagan got it right once again. Here also the events in Grenada, Afghanistan and Nicaragua are discussed. Against the odds, the Reagan administration achieved a remarkable turnaround and a massive worldwide advance towards the concept of democracy for all. The role of Margaret Thatcher and the Pope are also dealt with, and these chapters include information on SDI (the space shield or star wars as it was also called).
<br />
<br />In the Man Behind The Mask, D'Souza considers the paradoxes in Reagan's life, for example his personal faith, his non-attendance of church and his sardonic view of organized religion. His wit, humour and tolerance of human failings went hand in hand with an objective standard of truth and virtue. Spirit Of A Leader looks at his leadership style and qualities and how he shifted the political centre by changing the terms of the debate. This is measured in the way his opponents adopted his rhetoric and his objectives.
<br />
<br />Epilogue: The Road Not Taken is a rather glum indictment of the route that America took from 1989 to 1996, in which D'Souza takes the GOP leadership and conservative intellectuals to task. This book was published in 1997 so perhaps Mr D'Souza might want to get out a new edition with a more positive postscript. Well researched, the book concludes with copious notes and a though index. 
<br />
<br />Together with Peggy Noonan's book When Character Was King I found this to be the best book on Reagan. He revived the American Spirit, won the Cold War and made the world safer for democracy. And he had a good influence on me in the 1980s when I happened to be a gaunt youth with a gloomy, gothic outlook on life. To learn more about this great man, listen to his speeches on the 5-CD set Speaking My Mind, or read the book Dear Americans: Letters From the Desk Of Ronald Reagan.

                    <span>D'Souza's account of Ronald Reagan is excellent, not syncophantic. And brought to sunlight is a hugely important reality of our age: the liberal re-writing of Reagan and the USA's victory over the USSR. D'Souza's important book corrects the liberal lies about Reagan.
<br />
<br />Reagan was ahead of his time, as D'Souza chronicles. You get insight on a real leader in the fight against communism, a pioneer. You get a solid appreciation for what an oppurtunity it was to live during Reagan's tenure and ACTUALLY WITNESS A GREAT AMERICAN PRESIDENT DISCREDIT SOCIALISM AND TEACH US ALL ABOUT A FREE MARKET ECONOMY, RE-BUILD THE MILITARY, AND OUTFOX THE KGB.
<br />
<br />American liberals won a few, small tactical victories against Reagan, but Reagan beat them soundly on all the major battles: defense against communism; income tax rate cuts; rescue of the dollar and ending stagflation.
<br />
<br />Almost no one on the Left or Right thought the cold war would ever end. No one had the courage to envision that the USA could bankrupt and outmaneuver the murderous thugs of the Soviet Union . . . except Ronald Reagan.
<br />
<br />And after the collapse of the USSR, the Left actually claimed the USSR was a paper tiger. Yet when Reagan was in office the Left constantly lectured about the arms race and nuclear winter. WELL INTO THE 1980s AMERICAN LIBERALS BLATHERED ON ABOUT THE SUPERIORITY OF THE KREMLIN'S COMMAND AND CONTROL ECONOMY. The Left claimed a third way between the dreaded capitalism and socialism would emerge. The Left courted the KGB's clients like Castro and Ortega.
<br />
<br />Many on the Right were pessimistic and rambled on about the decline of the West. Not so bad as the Left, but many on the Right thought Reagan was a fool.
<br />
<br />Reagan was so successful that the Intelligentsia and its gullible audience have forgotten (or don't want to remember) how bad a set of problems Reagan solved.
