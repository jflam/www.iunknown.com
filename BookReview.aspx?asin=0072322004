                <span id="Label1"><i>Introduction to Languages and the Theory of Computation</i> is an introduction to the theory of computation that emphasizes formal languages, automata and abstract models of computation, and computability; it also includes an introduction to computational complexity and NP-completeness.  Through the study of these topics, students encounter profound computational questions and are introduced to topics that will have an ongoing impact in computer science.  Once students have seen some of the many diverse technologies contributing to computer science, they can also begin to appreciate the field as a coherent discipline.    A distinctive feature of this text is its gentle and gradual introduction of the necessary mathematical tools in the context in which they are used.  Martin takes advantage of the clarity and precision of mathematical language but also provides discussion and examples that make the language intelligible to those just learning to read and speak it.  The material is designed to be accessible to students who do not have a strong background in discrete mathematics, but it is also appropriate for students who have had some exposure to discrete math but whose skills in this area need to be consolidated and sharpened.</span>

                    <span>During the course this book has been anything but helpful. The introductory part is a laugh as it takes for given you as a reader is very deep into mathematical lingo and proofs. Indeed the poofs are some of the worst written, many of them using statements as "Clearly it is..." and "It is now easy to see...", well, no, it isn't easy and mostly seems like a shortcut from the author to excuse himself from actual explanations.<p>Even worse is the examples where solutions reference something form an excercise, here's a hint to Mr Martin, students don't solve all the extremly many excercises unless asked to, so saying something will be clear after a certain excercise doesn't work, how will we ever know if we're right or wrong?<p>The educational value is very low due to the authors way of writing, never really getting the point across and always assuming the reader knows exactly what's going on. This is certainly not the way to teach people rather complex things. All in all anyone should look elsewhere to have a chance.</span>

                    <span>I normally don't write reviews. Couple of not very positive reviews could not stop me writing one for this title. In my opinion, this book really presents a breadth of information<br>on the subject. If one is considering to buy this book, one should have due background in Discrete Mathematics.</span>

                    <span>This book is awful. Hard to follow along with the reading. Poor examples, lacking and skipping many steps when there actually is an example. Answers to a few of the questions would have been nice, to know if the problems were done correctly. Must be a master of discrete mathmatics to have any understanding what is going on. I have seen many better books.</span>

                    <span>I read this book during my preparation for a comprehensive exam, which includes materials about theory of computation. I was bad at theory all the time, but reading this book removes all my confusions. It looks like lots of math at first glance, but all the theorems explained clearly after the declarations. This book is also very helpful to understand the fundamental theory for programming languages. I recommend this book for all new graduate students of computer science.</span>

The writing style is among the worst I've seen. <p>Go with 'Introduction to the Theory of Computation' by Michael Sipser.<p>Nuff said</span>
