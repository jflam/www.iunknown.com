                <span id="Label1">You've got a hot idea for a new dot-com, and you're itching to join the folks who regularly show up on CNBC and at the Lexus dealerships in Silicon Valley. But you also know your odds of big-time success are about as long as Bill Gates's position in MSFT. What do you do? John Nesheim, an adjunct professor at Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management, who has personally structured over $300 million in new-venture deals, lays out the step-by-step skinny in <I>High Tech Startup</I>. Incorporating some two dozen case studies spanning the technology spectrum, he presents info specific to this industry that will help you get from concept to IPO. It begins with a 14-phase schedule itemizing time requirements, necessary assistance, typical participants, major costs, main risks, and desired results for each step. It then details all the critical stages (i.e., forming the company, preparing the business plan, assembling the team, dealing with venture capitalists and other funding sources). Nesheim focuses on practical strategies that should certainly improve your chances, but don't start prepping for that on-air interview with Mark Haines just yet: Only six out of 1 million high-tech ideas, he notes, ever become successful companies that go public. <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>If the title was "Managing and Financing Your Startup", I would not have been disappointed. It seems that Nesheim's central message is to find an experienced CEO, and push constantly to get financing.<P>Nesheim is so insistent on this point that he basically ignores the critical, fundamental question of market assessment: how to determine whether the product is desirable and whether the company has a true "unfair advantage". It seems that Nesheim is more focused on a successful IPO and exit for the funders than on developing a viable business.<P>As I read the book, I thought of companies like Webvan. Webvan would be successful in Nesheim's view: experienced management, seasoned directors, and well financed. But history showed that they had a product that was too expensive for the marketplace, and they are gone. While Nesheim does not cite Webvan, he does offer other success stories that have fallen far from their initial valuations: DoubleClick, Netscape, and SGI.<P>Given that, I have a hard time trusting this book. The prettiest forecasts are meaningless unless they are based on a solid product and a solid competitive advantage. And here, Nesheim offers virtually no guidance.</span>

                    <span>Thinking about starting a company? Read this book to find out what it really takes to create a successful high-tech company. This book covers just about every detail and sacrifice you will need to make. A lot of techies aspiring to be the next Bill Gates thought they could start a company based upon the merits of their idea alone, but the facts are it takes a lot more than a good idea to create a successful high tech company.<P>The book outlines the whole process from initial idea to IPO. The book tends to focus on the IPO-Venture model for startups, giving little ink to other methods. The only downside of this book is it was written during the height of the .CON boom, so don't expect to find the magic formula for developing a startup in today's business climate. The information dealing for personnel, legal, IP, and getting VC funding is worth the cover price alone. Overall, this is an extremely informative book and a must read for anyone thinking about starting a company or joining a startup.</span>

                    <span>For neophyte Hi-Tech entrepreneurs this book lays out the areas that need to be dealt with in order to successfully move from the early idea stage to the functioning company stage. <P>There must be a lot of people who would start companies because they already have a great product idea, but don't know what is required in order to do so. For people like this without the desire or time to go get an updated business degree with a course or two in entrepreneurship this book fills a big need. <P>If you need to actually do some of the required steps in moving from idea to company you will want to get some of the specialist books that cover a single topic such as writing the business plan or those that deal with intellectual property.</span>

                    <span>I'm giving it four stars because it really was a good and informative book, but it focused too much on raising money from venture capitalists and taking your company public. This is THE book if you've got the next hot electronic gizmo and will need millions to get it to market, but definately look elsewhere if you're a gal or a guy with an idea for a small internet-based business.</span>

                    <span>This book changed the way I view the role of CEO in a start-up. Being a CEO of a start-up is a hard job. You raise money, you find good people, you raise money, you fight fires, you raise more money. This book provides an education for what you need to do to raise initial capital and how your world will change if/when your company reaches an IPO.</span>
