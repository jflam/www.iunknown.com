                    <span>I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, and it has some interesting information about Ewan's childhood years in Crieff. Filled with amazing photographs, from black and white to colour. This book is worth the money. It also has a filmography at the back, if you want the titles of all the acting bits he's done. By the way, Ewan is talented and gorgeous!!!</span>

                    <span>This book is an okay biography with incredibly BEAUTIFUL photos.  It is worth buying just for the pictures.  I did actually read it, and I did learn a lot about Ewan.  However, the pictures are the real reason to buy it.  They are stunning.</span>

                    <span>I love Ewan McGregor and I think this book is a bit tired. Nothing I  didn't know, really. But the irony of it all strikes me. Playing Obi-Wan  appears to have really boosted Ewan's career to most Americans, though he  is a very successful actor in Europe and quite famous in the independent  film circuit. The ironic part is this: Ewan's predecessor as Obi-Wan, the  famous and sadly deceased Alec Guinness, received the opposite end from the  role. He was hounded and practically went into hiding. When he died, the  first I heard of it was on the Star Wars web site. Then, subsequent  announcements always contain something like "The 86-year-old actor,  famous for playing Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars..." I  wonder if that's what Ewan will be remembered for? I hope not. If you  really want to see him be an actor and not just a handsome face in a movie  that is heavy on effects and light on plot and dialogue, go rent Shallow  Grave or Brassed Off or Trainspotting or Emma or Nightwatch or A Life Less  Ordinary or ... See my point?</span>

                    <span>Robb's book is an amusing and quite compelling book. I enjoyed it a lot cause I discovered many things about this cool scottish lad called Ewan. The book  includes some interesting information about Ewan's life and how  did he managed to get to where he's now: an outsanding actor that can play  a heroin addict, a glam rock star or a venerable Jedi Knight. Don't miss it  if you're a fan!</span>

                    <span>Brian Robb's effort, Ewan McGregor: From Junkie To Jedi, is aimed at youthful audiences that buys books for the pictures not text.  Riding the coat tails of the popular actor whose role as Obi Wan Kenobi in the most  recent Star War's episode introduced him to American general audiences,  this book offers nothing than already known general facts and statements  published elsewhere.  What it does offer in plenty is photographs, head  shots in fact, that present McGregor in a variety of poses, both studio  sittings and film extracts.  The man is cute, no doubt the reason for his  enormous popularity with young females, but McGregor is more than just  another pretty, adorable British face.  He can act.  The body of work  already to his credit is formidable for a 28 year old.  McGregor is  outspoken on many subjects that draw attention in the press, and on almost  every page of the 128-pg. paperback is a tidbit of the wit and wisdom of  Ewan McGregor.  It is well known that McGregor has never given permission  for any book on his life, nor is pleased by author's who made intrusions  into his private life, however, if you absolutely must know who, what,  where, and when of Ewan McGregor, this book will do.  Buy two copies, one  to cut up for the photos and the second to add to the long list of McGregor  unauthorized biographies.</span>
