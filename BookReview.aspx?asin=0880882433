                    <span>I found this to be an excellent notebook. Keep in mind that this is essentially a workbook, not a text on writing. If you are looking for a beautiful place to put your thoughts , this is for you. Quotes from the author are scattered thoughout the book to prompt your inner voice. I like this book so much, that I'm going to buy another copy when I fill the first one.<p>The lush artwork of Ms. Goldberg is itself worth the price of the book:)</span>

                    <span>Those who are familiar with Natalie Goldberg's other books will be disappointed. This is basically like any other blank journal, with colorful pages, some quotes, and the very occasional writing prompt. For the same money, you can get a simple notebook and one of Natalie's other - and considerably more substantial - works.</span>

                    <span>I bought this writing journal 3 days ago at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House, just hours before attending a one-day Natalie Goldberg writing workshop.  The instant I saw this journal I knew I had to have it.  It is colorful and inspirational, with many of my favorite quotes from "Writing Down the Bones" and "Wild Mind" included throughout the book, as well as some basic prompts at the top of certain pages.  Every 5-6 pages there is a full color page of Natalie's brilliant paintings, which have inspired me to be more colorful in my own writing.  Inside the front and back covers are lightly inscribed "Keep the pen moving" phrases.  The journal, about 5x7", is the perfect size to keep inside a purse, is spiral-bound with light lines throughout, and with its inspirational writing messages scattered throughout, the journal just begs to have a fast-moving pen fill its pages.  Any Natalie Goldberg fan is guaranteed to love this new journal.  I do.</span>
