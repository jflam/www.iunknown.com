                    <span>In a conversation with a retailer discussing the buying habits of the public, he told me, "I follow Roy Williams." The name sounded somewhat familiar. The merchant then said, "want to read his book; I have it in the back?" As soon as I saw the book, I remembered that I had already read "The Wizard of Ads."<P>Roy H. Williams takes advertising and turns it upside down, right-side up, and inside out. You see what works, what doesn't, and how to walk the narrow path that gives you the best return on your advertising investment dollars.<P>Most important, Bard Press and Williams make it a great read, good-looking book with substantial pages, big print, no extra verbiage, lots of white space, and new and exciting concepts:<P>1. Huebner Fifth Rule of Mountaineering: Never look where you don't want to go. 2. Six Tugs of War 3. Calculating your APE 4. Hamp Baker's advertising genius 5. Nitroglycerin 6. The Secret Path to Miraculous Ads 7. Find out the real story of how we got our Statue of Liberty 8. The Buying Public is Your Dog 9. The Three Sacred Cows of Advertising<P>Williams' concepts are intelligent: better to focus your advertising to reach 10% of your market 100% than throw money at 100% of your market to reach 10%.<P>Advertising is a complicated art and Williams boils the concepts down to make them user-friendly for you. What more could you want to make you curious about his wisdom?</span>

                    <span>All those in advertising and in business can benefit from the kind of inspiration Roy Williams delivers in "Secret Formulas". The advertising media is so often held hostage for instant success for the ad dollars spent, as if ten magic words all spoken together will instantly remove a business from bankruptcy. Williams gives the reader a real-world view of what businesses should expect from their advertising, and gives several blueprints for success. Be prepared, however; there's no magic potion, no 'eye of newt' that, when added, will turn your business around. It's hard work to create good marketing and advertising, but Williams takes on the complexities of advertising in a way that offers a bounty of food for thought. Those in media sales, especially Radio, ought to have this stuff down cold if they truly want to jet-propel their careers-- and help their clients succeed beyond their wildest dreams. Our Radio clients will all receive a copy of this book for Christmas. <P>(P.S. I've had the privelege of meeting and talking at length with the author. He's as genuine as they come.)</span>

                    <span>Roy Williams and his series of books were introduced to me by a radio station that I advertize with. The information contained within these pages have been nothing less that inspirational! I have never been in a better position to assist my dealers in making marketing decisions and develop local ads. I can't wait for the day that I can afford to visit the Wizard Acadamy and learn as much as I can!</span>

                    <span>What is branding? How do people really remember you? How do you build your brand? This book gets back to the basics. There really is a magical formula. For you. For your company.<P>I bought this book because it was different. It disagreed with everything I had previously learned. This book can change the way you think. Forever. My mind turns in a completely new direction. Seeing things from a complete new angle. How can anybody pass up such an opportunity?</span>

                    <span>Some people like those straight forward 12-steps to business success books. I happen to be one of them. They are very focused and industry specific. But what those books lack is a deeper look at why people make the decisions they do. <P>This book doesn't just talk about what works, it talks about why it works. <P>In Secret Formulas, Roy Williams deconstructs successful businesses, people, and advertising. Sure, some people may say "what does brain function have to do with advertising"? Here's the thing....EVERYTHING has to do with advertising....how people think, how they make decisions, how their memory works, what their personality type is. History, art, poetry....it's all a part of understanding what makes people tick, what makes them successful. <P>Want to really be a successful advertiser? Want to build a succesful business? You need to know more than 12 steps. Take a deeper look. Study different people in different industries. These secrets aren't new. They're proven to work. Apply them to your life and business. It's made a huge difference in mine.</span>
