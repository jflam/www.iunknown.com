                    <span>"The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004" packs a lot of information into its 1008 pages. The book is well organized and easy to use. Included are three separate indexes: an extensive general index, a quick reference index, and (on the back cover) a quick thumb index. The book covers information in many different areas: the U.S. government, world history, religion, science and technology, sports, etc.<P>The almanac is full of interesting and timely features, such as the following: a review of the top news stories of 2003; profiles of major party U.S. presidential candidates; a special section on the "Baby Boom Generation"; and a year in review chronology. Internet surfers will find a treasure trove in here; the book includes Web addresses of U.S. government departments, international organizations, sports organizations, U.S. and Canadian religious groups, major U.S. business corporations, and much, much more.<P>There is also a color section with maps and pictures of the flags of the world. Other interesting features: a glossary of computer and Internet terms; a special section on Antarctica; a sidebar article on the seven wonders of the ancient world; a list of words new to the English language; and much more. I consider this book to be an essential reference source for work, school, home, and library.</span>

The problem with this reference manual is in certain points when it has to give a history, you have actual misinformation, they say certain leaders were elected when they didn't allow real opposition or the book takes sides in conflicts to the end of offering "balance" at the expense of accuracy. A real problem in a book that couldve been better</span>

                    <span>This is my favorite almanac. It is compact, easy to use, with well organized information. I think it is more complete than other almanacs, offering extensive coverage of the US Presidents, elections, and a state by state breakdown of Presidential elections since 1952, even going so far as a county by county breakdown in the hotly contested 2000 election. It has excellent sports coverage, as well as arts and entertainment. It presents the US Constitution in its entirety, along with brief synopses of landmark Supreme Court Decisions. This almanac also provides a short history of the National Anthem and the contentious Pledge of Allegiance, which had "under God" amended to it in 1954. It is packed with other vital information such as a breakdown of membership of religious groups in the US, the location of these religious groups headquarters, and a record of Easter Sundays up to 2100, so that you can plan ahead for this ever-shifting holiday. There is a very good section on health and nutrition, including dietary requirements for children and other salient information on how to better maintain your health. And, there is a comprehensive section on the nations of the world, including many timely statistics that will clue you into the demographics of the vast multitude of people. In short, everything you need to know to keep abreast if this ever-changing world we live in, as well as help you solve the NY Times crossword puzzle.</span>
