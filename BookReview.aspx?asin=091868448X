                    <span>Robert Cameron presents a place and its' character in this "above" book (as well as in the other ones). Some people fly over the Los Angeles area, gagging and shaking their heads. Mammoth highways, concrete, smog, track housing, and monster burbs. These qualities do exist. But Cameron's photos also allow you to see the different personalities and idiosyncrasies of the many communities that make up what we call Los Angeles, from the Southbay beaches to the hills. (Where LA begins and ends we're not always sure). The area of Los Angeles (like other places) is different from other major metropolitan American areas for a variety of reasons. For one, most of the topography is flat, and it's a coastal desert paved with transplants with ambition and liking for the sun. These pictures allow the City of Angels to be more intriguing and have more of its' personality exude itself, as the reader gets a closer look at it through these pictures. <P>Mental pictures. <P>Yes, there are those who state Los Angeles County is an area with few landmarks. First you've got have a good disposition to this place, and second you've got to get close. Cameron's shots provide plenty of pockets of beauty and character, and plenty of quintessential "LA" landmarks. One must close enough to observe and experience them. "Above Los Angeles" lets us. Photos that highlight the interesting and beautiful icons of this city's architecture and natural character. <P>Another book for LA-philes and those interested in its' history and growth is: "LA Lost & Found: An Architectural History of Los Angeles (California Architecture and Architects, No 21)." by Sam Hall Kaplan, and Julius Shulman (Photographer).</span>

                    <span>Los Angeles is a wonderful city so full of interesting things. This book has it all. All the areas are greatly photographed and look clear. LA's smog problem seems to be subsiding as the photos show clear days (most of them) and LA is only getting better. Every part of the city is showned. If you like photos from the air, you'll like this book. Also, the Library tower is shown (this is the first building to get blown up in the movie "Independence Day") in several photos. The older printings of this book didn't have them in it. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Good book, with great photos, as is to be expected. Generally does a good job of depicting LA's expanse, and its widely varying areas, with one exception; oddly, there is absolutely nothing about the beach towns: Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. The book skips from Venice and LAX to Palos Verdes, omitting what arguably is the section of LA most representative of Soithern California. Very good nonetheless.</span>

                    <span>There are about 25 WORLD CLASS CITIES on Earth (out of the millions) and Los Angeles just so happens to be one of them! It is such a privilege to live in this beautiful city with SOO much to offer. I purchased this book because I love this city so much. "Above Los Angeles" (although A LITTLE outdated...but not by much--just one building in downtown that was not fully completed) captures the sheer power and size and incredible beauty of "The City Of Angels." I, myself, have seen Los Angeles many times from the window of an airplane, and every single time I am in awe as I stare out looking at one of man's greatest accomplishments! Day or night, this city "sparkles" with beauty. This is a great souvenir for anyone who has visited L.A. or even someone who just loves L.A. period. Good journey.</span>

                    <span>I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles and this brings back so many good memories. This is the best book on Los Angeles that I have seen in years! The aerial photography is excellent. This is a fantastic picture book. I highly recommend this book. What makes this even more interesting is that photos of the past are compared to current photos. This is a must buy book!</span>
