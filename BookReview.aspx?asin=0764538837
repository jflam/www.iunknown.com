                    <span>The last book review I wrote on this site was close on one year ago... for no other reason than leading a busy life doing other things. But I just felt I had to come out of 'exile' for this book because it's classic Peter Weverka at his stunning best.<P>Clear, precise, a touch of gentle humor, Peter cuts through the jargon like a hot knife through butter. There is simply NOTHING that doesn't get properly explained and simplified.<P>"Office 2003 All-In-One" is the Dummies Guide to not just one program but to no less than NINE. (Word 2003, Outlook 2003, PowerPoint 2003, Excel 2003, FrontPage 2003, Access 2003, Publisher 2003, Office 2003 - one step beyond and Windows XP). It's a true compendium of reference books - a genuine all-in-one library.<P>Just so you understand why I feel so qualified to comment on this publication, I should tell you that I am an 'expert user' at Excel and Access. I'm very much a middle-of-the-road user at Word, Outlook, PowerPoint and Windows XP, and I have never before even looked at FrontPage or Publisher. I reckon that gives me a unique insight into how effective Mr Weverka's writing for all types of users and all levels of expertise.<P>I can assure you it hits the mark at EVERY level. Never condescending, never too clever for his own good, always explained in clear simple language, this book is an absolute pleasure to own, and a real treasure house of information and reference.<P>Screen captures are clean and easy to understand, cross-referencing is more than adequate, and there's hardly a word of unintelligible jargon or computerese anywhere. (Oh, and the author throws in a few smiles from time, to time, just to stop you nodding off.)<P>Peter Weverka has really excelled himself, and has again produced a masterly tome that will stand the test of time. If you want to know more about the inside workings of Office 2003, THIS is the only reference book you will ever need... and that's a promise.</span>
