                    <span>Three years hence, Buster Olney brings us back to that fateful Game 7 in 2001 which effectively ended the Yankees' 3-year championship run. Interspersed with the narrative are interesting backgrounders on each main character of the Yankee team - Steinbrenner, Torre, Jeter, O'Neill, Brosius, Rivera, Girardi and Knoblauch. 
<br />
<br />The Yankees that Olney describes in this book are a team with shared experiences from Torre's and Stottlemyre's battles with cancer to the loss of a parent for some team members. Particularly poignant was when Paul O'Neill returned to the locker room after the 1999 Series clinching game and realized that he could no longer call his father as he before Game 3. Shortly after, the door opened and in came Clemens, followed by Brosius and Sojo, all who have already lost their fathers comforting him. 
<br />
<br />In the center of the book is the Yankee's indefatigable owner George Steinbrenner who'll stop at nothing to build a World Series Champion. From that fateful loss at the hands of the D'backs, he relied less on less on the judgment of his executives resulting in a team of All-Stars which relied less and less of that team dynamic to win games but fell short of championships. 
<br />
<br />Though Olney may not have been aware of it, he has no doubt provided quite a convincing argument not only why Rivera blew the save in Game 7 that day but also why Rivera and ultimately the Yankees blew a 3-0 lead in the 2004 ALCS against the hated Red Sox.</span>

                    <span>Long before they became the travelling roadshow of over-the-hill once-weres and young never-will-bes that continue to disappoint in the big show of the World Series, the New York Yankees were a team stocked top-to-bottom with the best talent money could buy, but also a cohesive and productive unit. In "The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty", Buster Olney provides the reader with a unique and moving portrait of the Yankees of the late Nineties and the emotion-drenched season of 2001, when winning a baseball game for America's team took on more significance. What he emerges with is a portrait of a team on the brink of failure.
<br />
<br />Olney uses Game Seven of the World Series to build his narrative around, and he effectively conveys both the tense drama of that one storied night and the events and characters who came to be on that night. Olney breaks through the image of the Millenium Bronx Bombers as "invincible" to show their human side. Olney's task isn't easy, considering the restrictions George Steinbrenner places on clubhouse media, but he manages to peel away at the mystique and reveal a team of complicated individuals brought together by a desire to win, and the costs of constant success under a man like Steinbrenner.
<br />
<br />We get a look not just at men like Paul O'Neill, Scott Brosius, and Derek Jeter on the field, but also men in the front office like GM Brian Cashman, former manager Buck Showalter, and the Yankees' clipper for that championship run Joe Torre. Oleny humanizes the often faceless Yankee corporation, leaving the reader with sympathies for those most responsible for the impossible string of victories as they stare down the possibility of losing.
<br />
<br />Other profiles include Darryl Strawberry (whose plight with drugs has never been rendered so tragic before), Jorge Posada (an unsure prospect who emerged as one of the team leaders), and Chuck Knoblauch, who fell victim to a mysterious ailment during his tenure in the Bronx.
<br />
<br />Olney also lets us see the men who would upset the dynasty: men like Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, who would carry on trying to beat the Yankees even after the emotional toll of September 11th made the New Yorkers "America's Team". Olney's book is not only a look at the championship run that came crashing down one November night in Arizona, but also the forces that converged in society and a larger perspective than just baseball to invest in the traditional game new notions of what it meant to keep playing in the wake of tragedy.
<br />
<br />This will long be the official history of that magnificant and hated Yankees run many years to come. No other book could do justice to the mighty New York Yankees of 1996-2001 and their amazing rise (and shattering fall). Buster Olney gives Yankee-lovers and Yankee-haters equal reason to identify with the team despite their alligences. You'll have to look long and hard to find a better glimpse into the machine that Steinbrenner built, before it self-destructed and became a shadow of its former self.</span>

                    <span>This coment mostly goes for the review questioning the scope of it asking where is the 2004 red sox.  Olney was the beat writer for the yankees til the end of the 2001 season which is when he says the Yankee Dynasty ended.  The book was published before the Red Sox won the world series and their WS victory was not the end of the yankee dynasty the 2001 world series was.
<br />
<br />Olney did a terrific job saying things that were never said about the yankees and george steinbrenner to really give a great a idea about what went on at the end of 2001</span>

                    <span>For starters, this book talks not only about the Yankees' dynasty from 1996-2001, but also the overall process of building the dynasty.
<br />
<br />What's great about this book is its revelations of the personalities of the players, managers, coaches, and above all Steinbrenner himself.  Several player confrontations are revealed as well as confrontations between Cashman and Steinbrenner.  Moreover, the overall pressure of playing for the Yankees is also revealed in great detail.
<br />
<br />Definitely a book worth picking up but there is one point that is way off in this book and that is the subtle criticism of the Yankees spending and pricing other teams out of competition.  Spending does not guarantee winning.  It's been four years since the Yankees won a title and teams with half their payroll have won in recent years (Marlins, Angels).  Steinbrenner can spend all he wants, but ultimately, he as well as every other team must spend wisely and create a balanced roster.
<br />
<br />Overall, this book is fun to read and is a definite page turner.</span>

                    <span>I understand ancient history is important to understanding the current situation in the Balkans or the Middle East.  I was floored by the scope of this book.  Where is the 2004 choke against the Red Sox?  Had this been recommended to me by Amazon I probably would have bought on the strength of the title and been disappointed.  Just goes to show Amazon has my number.</span>
