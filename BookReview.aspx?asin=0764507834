                <span id="Label1">Digital cameras have encroached upon the territory of scanners a little bit, but scanners remain eminently useful for digitizing the family photo album, archiving documents, and sending kids' artwork to distant family members. They're also absolutely essential for serious design work. <I>Scanners for Dummies</I> shows you how to get the most from your scanner by guiding you through everything from basic hookup and software installation to moderately advanced graphics-editing techniques. The author, Mark Chambers, patiently explains terminology and concepts that have to do with translating a physically recorded image (such as a photograph) into a digital file (such as a JPEG or GIF image). <p>  Most readers will be able to get a lot from this book by simply reading chapters straight through, since the explanations of traditionally nebulous concepts such as resolution and color depth are accurate and easy to follow. Even the quality of the illustrations--often a shortcoming of trade computer books--is high, which is important in sections that show how to adjust contrast, sharpness, and resolution. Chambers deserves kudos for doing many of his tutorials in Jasc Paint Shop Pro, an excellent yet inexpensive editing package. Some readers might prefer coverage of one of the freebie editing suites; they should look for a software-specific book to supplement this one. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Digitizing images via a scanner connected to a computer running Microsoft Windows. Hardware connectivity (via parallel, SCSI, USB, and FireWire) is covered before the author explains the scanning procedure and how to manipulate images in an editing program. Suggestions for craft projects and some troubleshooting tips round out the volume. </span>

                    <span>This book is as good as the amazon editor claims, I got my new HP scanner up and running in an hour so you know the installation and setup chapters were good! The coverage of web graphics is very good and provides lots of tips and instruction. You won't find as much on PhotoShop but the step by step Paintshop pro material is worth its weight in gold. Well written and funny. I am going to add this author to my Dummies watch list!</span>

                    <span>As a long term fan of the Dummies books, I can't begin to express my disappointment in this offering. Scanners for Dummies is so exceptionally elementary as to offer absolutely nothing beyond how to "push a button" or "move a slider." Nothing is presented that couldn't be discovered by simply turning on the scanner and playing with it for a half hour or so.<P>The worst part, however, is that much of the information about scanners and Paint Shop Pro is misleading and in several cases, just plain wrong. This is the absolute worst Dummies book I have ever read and, while it is not my first one by Mark Chambers, it may well be my last.</span>

                    <span>I have bought several scanning books, but this one is all you need. The author covers the entire process and all the settings, including those buttons and sliders that you have never heard of before. There are two chapters that address basic and advanced image retouching and editing. The tone is friendly and funny and things never get too complex. The troubleshooting chapter has already helped me solve an annoying bug that I've had to put up with since I installed my scanner! Overall, I give this Dummies book a very high rating for anyone that's searching for a scanner or has recently bought one.</span>
