                    </div>
                    <span>This is a very good book for the newcomer to SQL Server, particularly for those who have little experience with other databases. 
<br />
<br />It addresses various topics that are just enough to get you started on being able to get some work done with SQL Server and know what else you need to learn. Strange as it may sound, IMHO, discovering what you don't know is a valuable endeavour. Sure, it could've gone into a lot more detail on the query optimizer or how lock escalation really works, etc... but really, where do you draw the line? There's no good place that will please everyone. This book did a decent job.
<br />
<br />This is not the book to make you an expert. In fact, it won't even make you an "intermediate" if there's such a state. It introduces enough to get you going. If you find yourself asking "well, what about this?" or "ok, you showed one way to use stored procedures, what if I wanted to ....", then the book has done a good job. If you have no questions or don't know what to ask, then it's failed. 
<br />
<br />As for the readers/reviewers who slammed the book for not making them experts, really, what were you expecting? You won't even know the ins and outs of installing Oracle or DB2 in 21 days much less get into any useful state (I've been an Oracle DBA for 7 years and DB2 for about 2 years, I know a thing or two about them).
<br />
<br />If you are an experienced database administrator or developer on another database, this book is probably kinda slow for you and certainly will not contain the depth that you're probably seeking. For this audience, I'd recommend Inside SQL Server by Kalen Delaney. It's not all there but it's a great start.</span>

                    <span>This is a well written book that covers a lot of topics...in the end you'll have a very clear understanding of SQL Server 2K from both the administration and programming perspectives. <p>I disagree with the other reviews posted on here about this book being too wordy or poorly organized. Perhaps those folks work for Oracle :-)  There is a lot of material covered in this book, and for the most part, it's concise and doesn't adopt a condescending attitude towards the reader. <p>In my search to learn SQL Server, I've found this book to rank at the top for general coverage of most of the DBA and programmer/user topics you encounter.<p>Worth your time to read, and money to spend.</span>

                    <span>This is a very poorly written book.  It wastes thousands of words telling the reader what it is going to tell you...and then...after all the build up...it doesn't tell you as much as the built-in SQL help files.  The writing is often obtuse, and sometimes cryptic.  Microsoft's on-line help gives more information, more concisely.  This book does not live up to SAMS books reputation.</span>

                    <span>This is the most useless book I've ever purchased. It rambles on from "what is a databse?" to "cost threshold for parallelism" without ever covering something as simple as inserting the date and time (or null not as a string) into a table. Certainly the last "Sams" book I'll ever buy.</span>

                    <span>I have no doubt that the authors of this book are very experienced at development and admin of SQL Server 2000 and earlier versions. They covered all topics in sufficent breath and depth. However, I would only rate this book as adequate for the following 2 reasons:<p>1. There was a definate lack of organization to the way the material was presented. Quite often, there were non-sequeters: the text would be explaining some concept, but then suddenly there would be a paragraph on something quite unrelated (at least, I did not see the connection). The authors should have explained how the paragraph relates, or put it in a side-bar, or perhaps in another section. 'Stream of Consciousness' prose does NOT belong in a book providing technical instruction!<p>The book was also disorganized in the fact that concepts were often used before they were introduced or explained. I know this is necessary sometimes, but it should happen rarely, and an author should explain fully why they are doing it so the reader is not left to wonder if they missed something.<p>2. There were some errors in the code examples, not as much as in some computer books I have seen, but more than I think is acceptable. When I am paid to write code, I make damn sure it runs, and I hold authors of computer books to the same high standards. As a novice to T-SQL, I need to be able to examine CORRECTLY WORKING code examples; I really am not in a position to debug code in a langauge that I am just starting to learn. <p>Bottom line: this book is OK, but the authors need to do a better job at organizing their material before presenting it, and checking over their own code.</span>
