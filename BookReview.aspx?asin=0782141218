                <span id="Label1">This innovative, full-color book, from the co-author of the best-selling Flash 5 Magic, is written for savvy web designers who want to use Flash ActionScript to add dynamic interactivity to their Flash creations, but who don't have a programming background. Authors Hamlin and Hall make everything from ActionScript fundamentals to high-end techniques accessible by truly teaching how ActionScript works, not just presenting code. Throughout, they take a consistently visual approach, including color charts and copious conceptual illustrations, complimented by interactive tutorials available on the book's companion site. With a striking design, matte cover, and high-quality paper, it all adds up to a premium book ideally suited for everyone from web/Flash developers, and multimedia producers, to instructors and web directors. </span>

                    <span>I've been using Flash for awhile now and have purchased quite a few books on the subject. When I learned enough of the basics to move into actionscript, I was lost. Most of the books I had assume you are a programmer or else just dump code in your lap expecting you to just plug it in and not really know how it works. This is the first book I have found that gives you the code and explains HOW and WHY it works - and all in simple, easy to understand English. I am an artist, not a programmer, but with a book like this, I too can enter the realm of coding and truly unleash my creativity...and isn't that what it really all about?

                    <span>Since 2003 I have read this book 3 times as a source book. It's realy great in putting you to the world of ActionScript 1, however the ActionScript 2 has become famouse these days, but the base thought in this book is efficient.</span>

                    <span>I was looking for ActionScript books here in the Philippines and this book caught my attention when I held it in my hand.<p>I asked the National Bookstore lady to open the package and lo and behold! The pages are packed with full colored images. <p>I love reading books if they have a lot of images. This makes you more interested on finishing the book from start to finish. <p>I am planning to take up Flash courses and I will bring this book whenever I go. =)<p>One thing that was lacking was a large list of ActionScript tags. What the heck...the tutorial is more pleasing to read though.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must have for any designers library. I have wasted a lot of money buying books that were shere geek-speak. It is easy to understand. I am not a linier thinker and Flash tends to be a lineir program....I have stayed away from Flash because I have had a hard time grasping it. Scott Hamlin and Jennifer Hall have given me a tool, I can finally use to better understand Flash and Flash's actionscripting. Thank you both for the time and effort you put in to write this book. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good, easy to understand, user freindly Flash actionscripting book. Scott Hamlin's website is also a must join site for anyone looking for great tutorials on Flash files, Web Site layouts, and Photoshop files. ...</span>
