                <span id="Label1">Finally someone has gone straight to the real experts: hundreds of men and women who have resolved a drinking problem. The best-selling author Anne M. Fletcher asked them a simple question: how did you do it? The result is the first completely unbiased guide for problem drinkers, one that shatters long-held assumptions about alcohol recovery.<BR><BR>Myth: AA is the only way to get sober.<BR>Reality: More than half the people Fletcher surveyed recovered without AA.<BR><BR>Myth: You can't get sober on your own.<BR>Reality: Many people got sober by themselves.<BR><BR>Myth: One drink inevitably leads right back to the bottle.<BR>Reality: A small number of people find they can have an occasional drink.<BR><BR>Myth: There's nothing you can do for someone with a drinking problem until he or she is ready.<BR>Reality: Family and friends can make a big difference if they know how to help.<BR><BR>Weaving together the success stories of ordinary people and the latest scientific research on the subject, Fletcher uncovers a vital truth: no single path to sobriety is right for every individual. There are many ways to get sober - and stay sober. SOBER FOR GOOD is for anyone who has ever struggled not to drink, coped with someone who has a drinking problem, or secretly wondered, "Do I drink too much?"</span>

                    <span>Sober for Good is a book filled with hope. It offers perspectives rarely seen in alcohol-related materials, and I sincerely hope that it gets wide distribution.<P>I'm a certified moderator (volunteer small group leader) for Women for Sobriety groups, and this book is a driving force in the sobriety of nearly all of the women I meet. Not everyone benefits from AA, and it's incredibly validating to see that other people similar to ourselves have gotten sober (and stayed sober!) using other methods.<P>The book is put together in a way that allows the reader to go to the parts that relate most to her/his situation, which is particularly important for people still grappling with addiction or newly sober.<P>You go, Anne. You have a big fan club in San Francisco!</span>

                    <span>Sober for Good &#8211; Anne Fletcher<P>I was sent a complimentary copy of Sober for Good, and opened it much as one might open a piece of junk mail &#8211; casual, uninterested, getting a fix on the waste bin for rapid disposal. Shortly afterwards I was reading avidly. <P>This book displays the immense variety of ways that people really stop drinking destructively, from the traditional methods of Alcoholics Anonymous to a personal decision, taken and held to. Anne Fletcher calls people who have tackled an alcohol problem and now live comfortably &#8220;the Masters&#8221;, and I&#8217;m one of them, in her terms. The book was created from first person accounts of people who have successfully resolved alcohol problems, using a wide variety of methods, and the author pulls these personal stories together to offer a balanced and very helpful overview of the varied ways that people use to stay sober for good.<P>The Chapter titles give an excellent précis of the contents.<P>1 A New Look At How People Really Solve Drinking Problems 2 There&#8217;s Not Just One Way: How The Masters Got Sober - And Stay Sober 3 It&#8217;s Not How Much You Drink: How The Masters Faced Up To Their Alcohol Problems 4 You Don&#8217;t Have To &#8220;Hit Bottom&#8221;: How The Masters Reached The Turning Point 5 It&#8217;s Not Necessarily One Day At A Time: How The Masters Made A Commitment To Sobriety 6 Be Our Own Expert: How Seven Masters Found Their Way With Seven Different Approaches 7 You Can Help: The Masters&#8217; Advice To Family And Friends 8 One Drink Does Not A Drunk Make: How The Masters Determined Whether They Could Ever Drink Again 9 It&#8217;s Not Enough Just To Stop Drinking: How The Masters Deal With Life&#8217;s Ups And Downs Without Alcohol 10 Recall The Past, Live In The Present: How The Masters Stay Motivated 11 With Or Without A Higher Power: How The Master Handle Spirituality 12 There&#8217;s Nothing Missing: How The Masters Find Joy Without Alcohol Appendix A: A Consumer Guide To Recovery Options<P>A lot of the book deals with familiar and comfortable ideas about alcohol and recovery, but there is also a great deal that I found new and thought provoking. I attended AA for many years, reaching a position of contented sobriety, but decided last year that I should move on. I chose SMART Recovery® as an alternative, and have found it suits me very well. Sober for Good showed me that this type of progression is not unusual, and that it is but one of many options. Others organisations offering help include Secular Organisations for Sobriety (SOS), Women for Sobriety (WfS), Rational Recovery (RR). Several stories came from people who used professional services such as brief intervention, formal treatment or individual counselling. Other Masters used what Anne Fletcher calls &#8220;eclectic methods&#8221; which I interpret to mean a bit of this and a bit of that, reading, acupuncture, yoga, family and friends&#8217; support &#8211; but if it works, it works. I know personally someone who did it on her own and that option doesn&#8217;t show up in this book at all! There really are many routes to recovery from alcohol, and all of them work for someone.<P>One of the reasons I liked this book so much is that it combines careful work with kindness. The spirit of the author shines through without being obtrusively personal. It is plain that Anne Fletcher has worked very hard to understand the people whose stories she has gathered and deployed. The result offers a wealth of insights and information that will help anyone who seeks personal recovery or wishes to help other to recover.</span>

                    <span>I don't know what people think of when the term Alcoholic comes up, but I see a meeting room full of people who smile and have hope in their lives for the first time ever! Do I belong to AA. Yes and No. I could, yet because I also am an addict I belong to NA. Alcohol is a drug...period! <P>Anne is in some kind of a fog, maybe from one of her occassional drinks on the moderate plan. Or is it that she is not an Alcoholic, which is interesting because she refuses to even acknowlege the word. Why? <P>Virtually MILLIONS of people Recovery with AA, and add another with NA. Which is simple: we don't use no matter what, no matter who comes up with either some "new" Scientific viewpoint, or demented thinking that seems to be intoxicated. <P>I take the book as a very poor excuse to drink, no matter what. If it just so happens that someone, like an alcoholic, picks up the book and decides that he or she can do likewise, then God be with them. <P>And as a side note: AA and NA is NOT religious, Spiritual yes, Religious no. For we know that our disease is more then just the drugs that we used. And developed an allergy to. Sheesh, you would think that someone would get some information correct on the disease first before bashing ANY 12-step Program and printing a dangerous manuel for relapse.<P>I would love to see her in an AA meeting and discuss her viewpoints. Just once, which I sure would be enough for her.<P>A very dangerous book.</span>

                    <span>Are you concerned about your drinking? Wondering if it is becoming a problem? Questioning, if I do have a drinking problem - then what? Or perhaps concerned about a loved one's drinking? Then this book is for you. Author Anne Fletcher, having overcome her own drinking problem, interviewed over 200 "masters" who overcame drinking problems about what worked for them. She allows readers to learn from her interviewees' experience - from determining whether drinking has become a problem to deciding what to do about it to building a life that doesn't revolve around alcohol - and supplements the masters' stories with findings from the most up-to-date research on recovery from drinking problems. The result is a highly readable book that covers a wide variety of approaches to quitting (or, in rare cases, moderating) drinking. The author handles controversial issues, such as moderate drinking or alternatives to the traditional AA approach, carefully and evenhandedly. There is also an excellent chapter on what family and friends can do to help. Reviewed by Deborah Van Horn, originally posted July 12, 2002.</span>

                    <span>Contrary to what some reviewers have written, this book does not "bash" AA. Among the hundreds of people Fletcher contacted about their drinking problems (and their subsequent successful years of sobriety), it is clear that AA worked spectacularly for many of them; for others, not so well. This is because--as this book demonstrates so powerfully--we are all different, and no single approach can work for us all.<P>What this book does provide, however, is an enormous set of strategies and information for getting clean, from a great variety of "masters"--what Fletcher calls people who have successfully mastered their drinking problems. There is something for everyone with a drinking problem in this book, and lots of great words of wisdom and sympathy from those who have been there.<P>I recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone who suspects they might have a drinking problem, or who has a loved one who does. It has everything you need to make an informed decision as to what to do about it, in an approach tailored to you.</span>
