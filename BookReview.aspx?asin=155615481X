                <span id="Label1">The eagerly awaited second edition of this well-known volume.  INSIDE WINDOWS NT has long provided the best architectural overview of Microsoft Windows NT-and that's made it an important road map for Windows NT developers and for students of operating systems. Now this new edition is fully revised, updated, and expanded. The material on the Windows NT file system (NTFS) that was a separate monograph has been folded into the new edition, as has an entire chapter on the cache manager.  This edition includes more detailed descriptions of code flows, data structures, and other elements.  It also includes hands-on experiments that describe how you can watch the internal behaviour of Windows NT by using various tools that come with the product.   Readers will discover a detailed under-the-hood investigation of the Windows NT 4.0  internals and the associated coding implications. This edition includes prerelease information about Windows NT 5.0.</span>

                    <span>Inside Windows NT provides an extensive overview of Windows NT, and a high level peak at the internals. Packed with conceptual drawings, this book delves into NT tools and the core system itself.<p>Written at a time when information about Windows NT internals were hidden or not very well documented (even for those of us who wrote device drivers), this book provided valuable insights.<p>A valuable and interesting read for professional who must write code for NT or just want to know what goes on under the hood.</span>

                    <span>This book is absolutely great in its first half. So get an overview, learn about processes and memory management. Don't try on the more advanced topics though. Yes I do recommend this book, there is no good alternative  to this important subject.<p>Another aspect are the practical excercises.  They basically boil down to reading a number in some tool. This number  corresponds to the just read text. For me this wasn't helpful.</span>

                    <span>A lot of OS internal type of books talk and talk, even though most of them are indeed technically superb. But Inside Windows NT is special in that the author knows humans have to practice to learn. After you read a few pages,  you come to an Experiment section and see what comes on screen if you do  this and that. For non-systems programmer like me, this may be the only  book to satisfy my curiosity to know more about Windows NT.</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute must-have, whether you're a programmer or an NT administrator (although the former will get more out of it). The only gripe I have with the book is that the chapter on security is really weak (about 1/3 the length of every other chapter)--if you're looking for a detailed  programmatic discussion of NT security, pick up Kevin Miller's "NT  Services" (Wrox Press). This book isn't about security per se, but its  chapter on security is terrific. Sorry for the digression, Inside WinNT is  screaming to sit on your shelf now!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the books where I have to force myself to stop reading as one interesting a paragraph follows the next. The first few chapters give a general overview of the basic subsystems and how they work together. The  information described in these chapters are taken as a basis for the  following chapters that each discuss one subsystem. <p>For a general  overview of how a subsystem works the first few pages of a chapter give you  the general idea. If you want to know more the chapters will then go  deeper. <p>The book will NOT tell you how to program NT but rather  introduce you to the concepts that are working 'under the hood'.  <p>Shortcommings: Sometimes terms are used at the beginning of a chapter  that are defined somewhere in the middle of a chapter or in another chapter  further into the book. Also the network subsystem is not described at all.</span>
