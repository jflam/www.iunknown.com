                    <span>If you collect new, inexpensive teapots, this may be helpful, but for someone looking for vintage and antique teapot info, dont buy this book, its a total waste of time. There are a few vintage pots, but most info in on cheap import teapots. I found this to be a waste of money</span>

                    <span>Collectible Teapots is a wonderful book if it only had an index. How can a book that has "A Reference & Price Guide" right under the title not have an index? I don't believe it is the fault of the author, Tina Carter, because she has a section titled "Finding Your Teapot in this Book" and the first sentence says "If you want to find information on a specific teapot, the first place to look is in the Index." Well there is no index.<BR> I called Krause Publications and the person I talked to suggested that it might have been cut out to keep the book a certain size. If that was the case somebody made a real bad decision. After you read through the book and then want to refer back to something you have to flip through the pages hoping to find it again.</span>

                    <span>A gorgeous 208 page softbound volume containing more than 400 large, full color, sharp photos. A joy for the teapot collector. In addition to the great photos and descriptions, year 2000 values are provided. Just a few of the topics covered are Teapots as An Investment, Striking the Right Deal, Starting a Collection, What to Watch For, Condition, Marks, Exhibit and more. The type of teapots covered range from advertising, souvenir and commemorative, children's, fine china, floral, glass and holiday, to music box, novelty, porcelain and pottery. Each topic is completely covered. There is plenty of information in the "Collector's Guidelines" section. A beautiful and useful reference work, worthy of every collector's library. You'll refer to it often.</span>
