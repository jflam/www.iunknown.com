                <span id="Label1">The Film Developing Cookbook is an up-to-date manual for modern film development techniques.  While the original Darkroom Cookbook focused entirely on photographic chemicals and formulae, this book concentrates on films, their characteristics, and the developers each requires for maximum control of the resulting image.<br><br>  The Film Developing Cookbook specifically addresses the difficult subject of T-grain film development. It includes rarely found information on film development and the nature of film developers. The authors take bold and controversial stances on many widely accepted film developing dogmas. They tackle many of the widely accepted "myths" of film development. They reject the trend toward `scientific evaluation' of films and developers in favor of the photographer developing a personal aesthetic without relying exclusively on densitometry or H&D curves.<br><br>Steve Anchell is a contributing editor to Outdoor Photographer and PhotoWork magazines.  He has written columns, feature articles, and interviews for Camera & Darkroom, View Camera, PIC, Shutterbug, Photo Shopper, and PhotoPro magazines.  His previous two books with Focal Press, The Darkroom Cookbook and The Variable Contrast Printing Manual are photography best-sellers.  <br><br>Steve's photographs have been exhibited in galleries and are shown in private collections.  He photographs and prints both color and black-and-white with 35mm, 2&#188; and large-format ccameras.  He has conducted over 80 photographic and darkroom workshops since 1979.  Steve is currently the program director for the Photographer's Formulary Workshops in Condon, Montana.  In early 1998, the first collection of his personal work, entitled The Nude at Big Sur, will be published by Whitefish Editions.<br><br>Bill Troop is a highly respected independent photochemist.<br><br>&#183; Contains the most current material available on film developing<br><br>&#183; Filled with relevant, hard to find information<br><br>&#183; A companion  volume to the bestselling The Darkroom Cookbook</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as the other books I have are now a bit dated. As the understanding of film development is always evolving, I thought this book would give me the latest ideas and knowledge.<BR>It does to some extent, but I could not help feeling the authors did not take the time to fully research and comprehend the details. Where they have quoted chemists / researchers the details are clear. However where they have tried to interpret or discuss aspects in some places it appears they do not clearly understand what they are trying to explain. The result is that they contradict themselves, fail to make things clear, or just plain get things wrong. They also only seem to address research by Kodak and a few independent researchers. The book thus misses out on research done by Fuji, Agfa, Ilford, etc. which is a significant omission in my opinion.<P>So is the book worth it ? I think that I would still buy it as there are very few sources of up to date information available. And to be fair, they seem to have taken care in reproducing the formula. However, I would be sure to read some of the older books on developers, and cross check the information before relying on it.</span>

                    <span>I bought and read every page of all three of Steve Anchell's black and white photo information books: The Variable Contrast Printing Manual, The Film Developing Cookbook, and The Darkroom Cookbook. Why? Because he gives a mix of an historical view plus tells what to pick of the best current chemistries. He does this without bogging down in the actual complexities of a college chemistry course keeping it at a usable technicians level. Since he also tells you why you are using various chemicals or paper his books do not dumb down but instead give you fascinating useful information. Anyone serious about darkroom work will appreciate his insights and commentary about chemistry use. He lists so many historical and current B&W chemical formulas and their use that any B&W experimenter will find the books useful.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book under the assumption and recommendation that it would teach me how to begin developing my own film... Unfortunately, this is NOT the book for that! This book has great historical value in describing the different formulas, their strengths and weaknesses, and contains charts that are probably valuable to those who ALREADY process their own film. This book is NOT for beginners looking into how one goes about processing their own film!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to get back into B&W photography. While I'm only up to the description of PMK, I've already been seriously influenced by this book. It explains, thoroughly and beyond my understanding of chemistry, all sorts of B&W film developer. It contains formula, suggestions and experiments for modifications to formula, references to sources, and development times for each combination of developer and film (I think). So now I'm looking into this "pyro" thing. PMK... got that. Special fixer... got that. Now I just need some film to develop. I'm going to do that... tomorrow. Now to find "Book of Pyro".<P>A seriously good book.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who is developing black and white knows that there are a lot of conflicting opinions out there. Kodak wants you to agitate the film a certain way, Ilford says to do it another way. Which developer do I use, and why? This book gives very logical and satisfactory answers to these questions. It allowed me to figure out how I was going to standardize my technique for the films that I am going to use. Don't be mislead by the title. This book does go into details of the effects of metol, phenidone, etc., but it is not a cookbook in the sense that you will come out designing your own developer. It does contain many recipies for developers, for those who mix their own. But, my aim was to figure out what the characteristics are of the developer that I am using, and how to maximize it. The book really excels in this area.<P>I've run through about 75 feet of Tech Pan film trying out how to develop it using Xtol. Following Ansel Adams' advice in his book "The Negative" turned out to be a mistake, in this case. I was making my negatives way too dense. Anschell and Troop explained why this is, in their chapter on "Document Films". This covers Tech Pan, amongst other similar films. After having read through the book, I revised my working temperature, diluted Xtol to 1+5, changed my agitation style, changed from an acid stop bath to water, and got the fantastic results that I had sought for so long! It's also worked for other offbeat films like Kodak 5302 Positive release film for the B&W slide fans like myself (using Polymax 1+2). If you REALLY want to know what you're doing, and want to save tons of time and money from wasteful trial and error, get this wonderful book. It's really improved my results!</span>
