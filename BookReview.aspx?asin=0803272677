                <span id="Label1">No sport reveres its past quite the way baseball does, and no sport has mined the richness of its oral tradition quite the way baseball has. Picking up where Lawrence Ritter left off in the marvelous classic <I>The Glory of Their Times</I>, Honig set out across the country with a tape recorder to preserve the voices--and memories--of the men who played the game between the two World Wars. This is a wonderful and essential collection, full of bravado, pride, and passion for the game, with a lineup that includes Bob Feller, Lefty Grove, Johnny Mize, Charlie Gehringer, and Pete Reiser. You don't so much read it as put your ear to it, as it alternately whispers and roars. <p> Just listen to Hall of Fame hurler Wes Farrell, in the midst of explaining the art of the knockdown pitch, segue into what it was like to face Babe Ruth, just one of the volume's hundreds of remarkable moments: "I never threw at Ruth, though. You just didn't do that. He was baseball. What was it like pitching to him? Like looking into a lion's jaw, that's what. Hell, man, you're pitching to a <I>legend</I>!  And you knew, too, that if he hits a home run, he's gonna get cheers, and if he strikes out, he's still gonna get the cheers. You were <I>nothing</I> when Ruth came up."<p> Nicely illustrated with vintage action and portrait photos, <I>Baseball When the Grass Was Real</I> gives a fine face to its voices, but long after the cheering's stopped, it's the voices that remain memorable. By preserving them as fully as he has, Honig's provided a virtual vehicle for traveling through time and eavesdropping on history. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD BOOK BY DONALD HONIG. THIS IS ABOUT THE MEN WHO PLAYED IN THE 20'S 30'S AND 40'S. SOME GREAT STORIES AND INTERVIEWS ARE WHAT YOU GET IN THIS MUST READ BOOK. WISH IT HAD MORE BUT WELL WORTH READING FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED ABOUT BASEBALL WHEN THE GRAS REALLY WAS REAL. VERY RECOMMENDED.</span>

                    <span>If you loved Larry Ritter's "The Glory of Their Times," then you definitely should read this one.  It follows the same format and lets some of baseball's greats (and not quite so greats) from the 20s and 40s tell it  like it was.  It'll make you yearn for the good ol' days of Ruth, Gehrig,  and Foxx.</span>
