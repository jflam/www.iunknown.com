                <span id="Label1">American-born Paris dweller Patricia Wells has turned her love of French food into a remarkable series of culinary works. <I>The Paris Cookbook</I> reflects that affection and her familiarity with the Paris food scene, offering 150 of its best recipes. From famed chef Jo&#235;l Robuchon's sublime Creamy White Bean Soup to a hearty flank steak dish courtesy of Wells's butcher; from bistro Chez Benoit's Asparagus and Green Bean Salad to confectioner La Maison du Chocolate's Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse, the book abounds in wonderful food. Wells's achievement, here as elsewhere, is to make her recipes genuinely accessible to the average cook; well-chosen and lucidly written, they invite even the hesitant into the kitchen with the promise of great eating.<p>  Following the courses of a typical Parisian meal, from appetizers through desserts, the book presents three-star dishes like Arp&#232;ge Eggs with Maple Syrup, as well as more humble fare, including an exemplary Lemon Chicken and <I>socca</I>, the delicious Proven&#231;ale pancakes. A section on pasta, rice, beans, and grains offers such standouts as Flora's Polenta Fries. Desserts also receive their due with delights like Fresh Fig and Almond Gratin. Illustrated with photos that evoke Parisian life at the market and at the table, and containing a wealth of tips and helpful information, wine recommendations, plus the addresses of the dining spots mentioned, the book is a worthy addition to Wells's dependable store of cooking guides. <I>--Arthur Boehm</I> </span>

                    <span>The recipes contained in this book are numerous and diverse. However, unless one is experienced in French cuisine, it may be difficult to achieve the exact same end result as one who has experience, such as the author. The recipes are certainly original and authentic. <P>As dedicated chefs will know, one cannot rush in the preparation of these recipes and the downside, for most of us who are career people, is finding the time and energy to prepare most of the recipes contained here. They are by no means ones you can whip up in thirty minutes or less. Some take the best part of the day to prepare so perhaps these recipes are best set aside for special occasions, week-ends or for some event where time is not a factor. "The Paris Cookbook" will make a great addition to any library. Most of the recipes tried to date are excellent such as the Bonaparte's Chicken Salad and the Zucchini and Curry Soup; however, you might want to pass by the White Bean Soup - it left a lot to be desired and had the same appeal as wallpaper paste! Oh, well, we cannot expect every recipe to be perfect.</span>

                    <span>This recent book by Patricia Wells is a selection of the author's favorite recipes from the restaurants, Boulangerie, and patisseries in Paris. In a sense, it broadens her focus of the book 'Simply French' from the single restaurant of Joel Robuchon to look at many leading Parisian establishments. While being broader, it is also just a bit less deep in it's exploration of complicated recipes, as very few in this book match the complexity of the typical recipe in 'Simply French'.<P>I would place this book as my third or fourth French cookbook after Julia Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking', Richard Olney's 'Simple French Food', and Madeline Kamman's 'The New Making of a Cook'. While these are some of the best texts on the principles and techniques of French cooking, this book by Wells is real world application of the principles. As it looks at the real world, it offers the reader some pretty unusual dishes in giving us a variety you may not find in a single restaurant cookbook, even one so good as the recent 'Balthazar Cookbook' from the chefs at the New York restaurant of the same name.<P>While this book is not a teaching book, it is still true to the style of cooking you will find in Paris and, as such, it is primarily a book for the gourmet, the entertainer, the traveler to Paris, and the wine lover. Like 'Simply French', the book gives wine suggestions for all savory courses. These wine suggestions are a bit more generic than those in 'Simply French', so it will be easier to find something to match, even in the oenologically backward state of Pennsylvania. <P>Before you get the impression that none of the recipes in this book have any general currency for the average cook, I must say that many are really very easy, especially the salad, vegetable, and soup recipes. Even some meat recipes are fairly simple, such as the braised lamb shank recipe Wells did on 'Emeril Live' when she made a promotional appearance after the book first came out. Everyone does braised lamb shanks, but Wells does it just a little differently, and offers some good suggestions on choosing the best cuts. But, there are some real novelties, such as the Arpege Eggs with Maple Syrup. I will be content to simply read about these dishes.<P>The organization of recipes is classic, following almost exactly the same chapter headings as in 'Simply French'. These are:<P>Appetizers, Starters, and First Courses<BR>Salads<BR>Breads<BR>Vegetables<BR>Potatoes<BR>Pasta, Rice, Beans, and Grains<BR>Soups<BR>Fish and Shellfish<BR>Poultry<BR>Meats<BR>Desserts<BR>The Pantry<P>The first two chapters plus the third and fourth are real gems. At the $30 list price of this book, they are worth the price of admission. The Breads chapter is a little teaser with only six recipes, each fairly complicated, but very rewarding. Just enough to whet your appetite for a book by a bread heavyweight such as Nancy Silverton or Peter Reinhart. The chapters on protein dishes are surprisingly simple. They are certainly less complicated than the soups and desserts. The desserts chapter is quite large, with many recipes for apples, cherries, and ice cream. The Pantry chapter gives all the expected recipes for vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, spice mixes, stocks, and sauces. This is somewhat better than average.<P>In spite of the utility of cookbooks that organize by menu for occasions and themes, this is still my favorite organization for a cookbook covering many types of dishes. One entertains once a month, maybe. One cooks for your small family in a single household every day. This is better for the latter situation.<P>I am not a fan of splashy color photography in cookbooks. When it is there, I rarely look at it except to judge its quality for a review. To my mind, the photography in this book is just right. Its occasional black and white pictures of people and places have informative captions and decorate the book with views of Paris and its people.<P>If you are traveling to Paris or love French food or need new recipes for entertaining with a lot of ta-da, this is the book for you. Be aware, however, that basic cooking skills and a well-equipped kitchen are a must in order to accomplish many of the recipes in this book.<P>You may also find yourself developing irrational urges to visit your favorite travel web site for plane tickets to Paris. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Wells wanders around Paris, gathering recipes from her friends, grocers, mentors, and even taxi drivers; that turns out to be fine, since she knows lots of people who cook brilliantly. What's even better is that many of the dishes illustrate the return to long cooking techniques, using less-expensive meats. This is right up my alley -- I'm a braisen' fool -- and so far, I've been happy with everything I've made. One caveat: Wells is no wine expert. Approach her wine pairing recommendations with caution.</span>

                    <span>I've only had this cookbook for a few months, but I already rely on it as a source of creative, well-crafted recipes. The dishes are fresh, simple, accessible. Try the Green Olive Tapanade. It takes about 10 minutes to make and was a huge hit. I think it will be a great use for spring/summer basil.</span>
