                <span id="Label1">This book's introduction features a humorous story of a man with a line of people behind him, who explains to his boss, "I can't find an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people." This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems, namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice.<p> The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; <I>Computers and Intractability</I> does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems. (There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.) <I>Computers and Intractability</I> also contains a list of more than 300 problems--most of which are known to be NP-complete--with comments and references.</span>

                    <span>I first read this book while researching heuristic techniques for reaching "good enough" solutions to the Travelling Salesman problem. "Computers and Intractability" was a breath of fresh air. It was as rigorous as any mathematical treatise, but written in a way that even a non-math major could understand. If you ever want to know why computers are so buggy, you'll know the mathematical reason for this within the first few pages of this book. By the time you reach the end, you'll never trust cryptography to absolutely, without a doubt, keep data secure for long, if at all.</span>

                    <span>Yes, it's a classic.  Yes, every computer scientist MUST own it.  But enormous significant progress has been made in the field of NP-completeness (and computational complexity more generally) in the two decades since this book was published.  An up-to-date edition -- which would probably be well over a thousand pages long -- has been badly needed for years.</span>

                    <span>I think every computer science student should  read some of this book to  learn about complexity theory and the notions reducibilty and completeness.  Moreover, you may come across a problem that you have to show is NP or P  complete, and the examples in the  book provide a good model for doing so.  Papadimitriou's book on complexity is also a great place to learn more  about the subject.</span>

                    <span>Every graduate CS student will probably encounter this book--it is a classic.<p>But long after that course in NP theory was over, the astonishment of a different aspect of the book remains.<p>One course assignment was the development of 15 polynomial reduction proofs (proving  the computational complexity equivalence of pairs of NP problems).  Part of  these proofs can be simple geometric shapes, locations and connecting  lines, which are defined as elements in the 2 problems.  Because the  elements are rigorously defined, the resulting geometric pictures model  rigorous proofs of equivalence.<p>I was astounded at the power of such  abstractions (which most programmers perhaps wouldn't even recognize as  legitimate proofs).  This experience underlined the fact that rigorous  logical proof may take many outer forms, whether mathematical equations,  formal symbolic logic proofs such as the Irving Copi notation, or simple  geometric drawings.<p>Many veins of rich ore may be mined from this work,  and only 1 of them is NP theory.  But the reader must be ready to do battle  with some difficult ideas, and mathematical notation which can obscure the  creativity of the material covered.  (For astounding creativity, examine  Cooke's Theorem proving that the Satisfiability problem is NP-Complete!)</span>

                    <span>Absolutely required text.  The introductory material is useful, but I must admit I've found other texts easier for that (I like Sipser's book).  But the reference list of NP-complete problems, and transformations, can't be beat.  I used it over and over as a student, and now just as much as a  professor.</span>
