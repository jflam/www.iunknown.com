                <span id="Label1">An irreverent, off-the-wall, PC-slammin', totally-biased look at Apple, and what it's like to be a Mac user stuck in a Windows dominated world. <I>Macintosh...The Naked Truth</I> is definitely not another Mac how-to book; it's a mass-market, personality book about a computer platform and the people who love it, and the love/hate relationship they have with Apple. It's about what you feel, how you're treated (and mistreated), and what it's really like living life in the computing minority.The book, based upon the author's hugely popular magazine column, takes a humorous, evangelical look at Apple Computer and what it's like to be a Macintosh user living in a PC-dominated world. The success of Kelby's column lies in the fact that although it makes serious points about Apple's shortcomings, and what it's really like being a Mac user, it presents them in a humorous, often sarcastic, and occasionally sophomoric way that Mac users love. It's brash, unapologetic, insightful, controversial, outspoken, and often hilarious, peppered with 100% Macintosh attitude. Although it pokes light-hearted fun at everyone from Apple CEO Steve Jobs to the PC users manning the Apple section of CompUSA, each chapter contains an underlying message of Apple evangelism, and it can often be as inspiring as it is funny.</span>

                    <span>The book includes most if not all the senseless arguments of what PC users, rather: ill-informed PC users, often say about the Mac.  Kelby comes up with clever and accurate metaphores, and at the same time goes back in history and why it is that computer makers with an enormous market share have gone out of business, but not Apple.  It's written in a light and funny tone, and contains serious truths.  Highly recommended for any Mac user.  Sure, PC users can or should read it too, but be prepared for the revelation of the best kept secret in the computing world.</span>

                    <span>This book was hilarious to read! I absolutely loved it. Scott Kelby used a lot of personality and humor to make this book great. As all of my friends use PCs, it was helpful in giving me information to get back at their persistant "Windows systems are easier and better than stinky Macintosh!!" attempts. Let me tell you: read it! You'll love this book, especially if you use a Macintosh.</span>

                    <span>Scott Kelby is one of the smartest and fun-loving writers I have ever followed. And his contributions to Desktop Publishing (DTP) and the Macintosh can never be duplicated. What Scott has accomplished usually takes 4 or 5 very talented people. Only Scott could write a book with this title because his magazine, MacDesign, has become the central switchboard for Windows bashing.<p>The book covers all the important points but I felt that the book would have been more effective if he would have cut short some of the sensationalism and focused more on why the Mac is such a superior computer.<p>As an example, I was a Windows DTP professional for 14 years. I spent an incredible amount of time and money fixing, reformatting and replacing my Windows based computers. Since becoming a Mac user two years ago, I rarely need assistance. And I am not a computer nerd or geek. Forget the ease of use and speed. In retrospect, I wasted a lot of time and money. All that is gone now because I am a Mac user. <p>It is this type of information which is the real naked truth. I feel the readership would have been better served with emphasis on these kind of issues rather than focusing on a neighbor who formed a personal opinon about Scott based on his choice of platform.<p>Now that I am a dedicated Mac user, I share some of the same frustrations as Scott does: Trying to open up a site that can only be open with Windows, wanting software that is only written for Windows, etc. What adds to this frustration is when you know you are using a superior platform. <p>So maybe this book is not perfect but the spirit of Scott's writing does reflect what most Mac users experience. Overall, I do recommend the book to anyone who loves their Mac (just about all Mac users) or anyone who is considering switching platforms.</span>

                    <span>I absolutely love this book!!!  Being a Mac user myself since I bought my own computer I was happy to find this book one day on the shelf.  The title was what caught my interest first.  After reading the back cover though and skimming through the book i knew i had to buy it.  And so I did.  I love this book it makes me laugh so much, since I am the only Mac user in a group of PC users (including my fiance) its great to have a book written to my tastes and making my Mac and other Macs better than PCs everywhere.  Thanks Scott!!!!</span>

                    <span>I'm a 20 year Apple user (yes, even before the mac came along), a Kelby fan of most of his works, but this one is gotten old too fast. Most of the stuff he writes about is from way back when macs were years ahead of the windows machines, and that is no longer the case, macs are still so much better yes, but is not black and white anymore. I personally don't find his style funny at all, I find it like he's trying too hard to be funny, too simplistic sense of humour I'd say. Some stuff he says is still true today and there are some things even usefull, but that's about it.</span>
