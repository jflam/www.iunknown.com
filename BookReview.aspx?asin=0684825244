                    <span>"Not since Gunnar Myrdal's 'An American Dilemma'" has any book looked so searchingly at the nature of race in America. This was a statement by Thomas Sowell regarding his review of The End of Racism. Regardless if you agreed or disagreed with D'Souza's conclusions, you can't objectively deny Sowell's assessment. Unfortunatly, those who find his logic and conclusions unpalatable have systematically reverted to misrepresenting his arguments rather than facing them squarely. I guess it is easier to knock down imaginary arguments rather than real ones. Some common misrepresentations include: <P>1. D'Souza questions whether slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination etc bear "any" responsibility for the state of Black America. Reality: D'Souza is very clear in saying that these factors are the VERY REASON that blacks are in their state today. These influences, according to D'Souza, gave blacks a unique experience in America through which a culture of resistance wa! s eventually fostered. It is this vestigial cultural orientation, D'Souza argues, which today most impedes black progress in a society that is quite different from the 19th and early 20th century. <P>2. D'Souza doesn't care about white racism, he only wants to abolish white guilt. Reality: D'Souza ultimately concludes that while racism is a problem, it is a minor problem. Shocking as this is to many, it is no less true. Civil rights activists committed to struggles of yesteryear have every incentive to beat the drum of "white racism" past the point of diminshing returns - particulary when they are dependent on such activities in order to maintain notoriety and to continue living such plush lifestyles. As for white guilt, D'Souza would probably have no problem with whites feeling as guilty as they want so long as that guilt has little role in policymaking. It is white guilt which has driven racial policy in America for the past 40 years and the black underclass is in ! worse condition than EVER. <P>3. D'Souza doesn't believe th! at racism exists anymore - just "rational discrimination" - which, as Ellis Cose said, is "to put not to fine a point on it, discrimination against people who ought to be discriminated against." Reality: D'Souza's argument here is not that complex. He clearly conceeds to the immorality of such behavior - especially as to its demoralizing and hurtful effect on law abiding black males who have PhD's and not a spot on their criminal record. Yet the act of discrimination (such as a taxicab not picking up black men) is occouring precicely because the taxicab driver, or store owner, or little-old lady, etc. does not have any information on that person. Taxicab drivers have had many blacks beat the fare or leave no tip (moreso than whites) or have had other drivers regail them with stories of the blacks that held them at gunpoint (again, at a higher rate than whites). Korean store owners have had similar experiences - including having to sit on the roof of their ! store with a rifle to ward off looting black teenage males. If you talk to any restaurant waiter, they will tell you that, on average, blacks tip much more poorly than whites. As such, many sigh a groan of frustration or despair when recieving a table of blacks. The point is that these actions are not "racism" in any conventional sense because they do not stem from any subjective animus towards blacks. These are simply people who are acting on what their, or another's experience has taught them. Some can argue that these generalizations are unfair - but they are exactly that - generalizations, not racism.<P>4. D'Souza asserts that because a few blacks owned slaves it was "not at all racially charged." Reality: D'Souza clearly says that slavery was fraught with undertones of race, but that the plane of causation was in reverse: that is, slavery caused racism - not that racism caused slavery. One only has to look that the history of slavery in the world to se! e that it certainly wasn't unique to Western Civilization. ! What was unique, however, were the philisophical priciples of Western civilization that ultimatley destroyed this most enduring institution in human history - that is, slavery. Thus, many rationales were used to justify the enslavement of blacks (who were, by the way, enslaved predominatley in the Americas because they were abundant in supply and easy to maintain as slaves - certainly in contrast to the indigenous American Indians). Most of these rationales, D'Souza argues, were founded on the principle that blacks were inferior - that is - "made to be slaves." Ultimately, racism was the rational many used to justify an activity that flatly contravened with America's most cherished principle of individual freedom. <P>5. D'Souza portrays Columbus as a humanitarian, slavery as benevolent, and segregation as a system intended to help blacks. Reality: In no way does D'Souza portray Columbus or any of the other European explorers as anything close to "humanitarian.&q! uot; D'Souza does use passages out of Columbus' journal to show that Columbus was indeed impressed with the Indians he first encountered whom he described as among the "most beautiful and gracious people he had ever seen" - but that's about as far as he discusses Columbus. Yet D'Souza fully conceeds the "occupation and brutality" of Western colonialism that followed in Columbus' wake but qualifies it by stating that there was not, in fact, anything unique about it other than the fact that it went against a still evolving Western thought concerning human and property rights. Ironically, these principles are used selectively by contemporary American Indian activists to condemn a the very civilization who actually put them into practice. In no way does D'Souza say that slavery was even close to benevolent - only that slaves were thought of as property. As such, they were expected to yield a return and could not do so if they were excessivly abused. The same si! mple logic prevented farmers from excessively beating a hor! se that pulls a carriage or an ox that pulls a plow. D'Soouza did say that segregation was, in part, designed to protect blacks in the sense that it was perceived by paternalistic Southerners to keep blacks away from a violent racist minority that would certainly do them harm. <P>D'Souza's arguments are coherent and easy to follow. His policy prescriptions (such as the abolition of affirmative action and repealing of anti-discrimination laws in the private sector) are debateable - yet they are also logical. This book and other books such as these are difficult for many modern day "race-merchant" liberals to come to terms with. It is easier to insinuate the author said something he did not, in fact, say - then to attack the insinuation. How hypocritical it is for anyone to condemn D'Souza for using extreme and moderate voices interchangeably in his text (although quoting them accurately)- and then to turn right around and compare him to Hitler or David Duke and call h! is a Social Darwinist. If liberals ever expect to win the intellectual battles, they had better get past the idea that their adversaires are "not in error, but in sin."</span>

He carefully examines racism with a sober approach supporting and refuting positions with remarkable scholarship and revealing anecdotes. At times D'Souza's analysis is far too laborious than the subject matter deserves but you appreciate his sincere effort in making sense out of all the related issues.<P>The most distressing part of the book is how he exposes black pathology in all its naked absurdity and degeneracy. This work will incite those who believe more acknowledgement should be given to the contributions African-Americans have made to American society. Additionally, they will argue that D'Souza, as an East Indian immigrant, doesn't fully understand the dynamics of black culture. 'It's a black thang. You wouldn't understand', so to speak. He does celebrate black culture but this book is about bridging the socio-economic and cultural gap between blacks and whites. Black anti-social behavior, unfortunately, is one of the reasons for the gap. Also, as an immigrant, D'Souza provides an objective perspective to an issue that needs an objective perspective.<P>He is absolutely correct in stating that what is described as present day racism is actually rational discrimination, which is the sensible prejudgment of an individual based upon the factual behavioral characteristics of the group the person belongs too. He isn't arguing that it is justifiable for taxis to pass anyone by based solely on the color of his or her skin; however, if tomorrow a huge crime wave came mainly from East-Indian communities, don't expect many taxis picking up Dinesh D'Souza.<P>His review of American slavery is eye opening. At first his analysis may seem suspiciously apologetic for an immoral system by pointing out that a substantial number of free blacks (and Native Americans) owned black slaves not just to rescue family members but like white slave owners, to exploit free labor. However he does so only to bring a nuanced perspective over the politicized history of slavery, which in not a Western invention and has always existed in various forms in all societies. D'Souza points out that it is liberty and individual rights that are relatively new and Western concepts. However, with regards to reparations, this doesn't make his churlish question, 'what do blacks owe America for ending slavery?', any less condescending.<P>For all his meticulous study of cultural relativism, rational discrimination, early 20th century eugenics, and even the Greek understanding of nature and the polis, he surprisingly didn't extend his scrupulous analytical talents over the roots of black rage. D'Souza exhaustively discusses its paranoid nature and the depravity it produces. He does discuss how the unique characteristics of black culture developed under slavery and how they persist today contribute to some of the community's dysfunctions. But why did black rage flourish in the 1960's, as oppose to after the end of slavery when presumably blacks should've been bursting with rage? Why and how did black rage metastasize into its present form of rampant crime and illegitimacy? Such an analysis would've been important because though there are similarities between white racism and black rage (so similar in fact that D' Souza exposes the astonishing collusion between Malcolm X and the KKK), black rage emerged essentially as a response to white racism. The difference is not inconsequential. The emergence of black rage after the liberating repercussions of the Civil Rights movement suggests there it may correlate with the cathartic qualities of universal suffrage. This analysis could provide additional insights into how a multiracial society can prevent or at least mitigate the rise of such pathologies, which seem to stem from group resentment and an inability to effectively deal with group underachievement.<P>This criticism is in no way an attempt to give credence to the idea that we must 'understand the root causes' of a problem to effectively deal with it. Placing criminals in jail is far more effective in stopping crime than trying to 'understand' what compelled one to commit the crime. However, if we're to consider present day white racism as rational discrimination, then another question should be asked: is there rational black rage? At the time of the Civil Rights movement, despite the stubborn efforts of the free market, which allowed for black economic and social mobility, the ubiquitous 'System', with its Jim Crow laws and societal discriminatory mores, was real and was actively working against blacks. At one point the paranoia behind black rage was legitimate, hence rational. But as paranoia tends to do, it spun out of control. The rage became an alibi for immorality and underachievement. Additionally, the mayhem emboldened self-serving judges, policy decision makers and race merchants to justify the circumvention of the Constitution out of deference to the fulfillment of proportional representation, which has been guised as the protection of minority rights. Even if the crisis within the black community were to be repaired tomorrow, America would still need to contend with the rampant judicial activism that is wreaking havoc on our democratic traditions. D'Souza should've discussed this further.<P>After 400 years of slavery and Jim Crow it has been difficult for a people, whose entire historical and cultural identity can only be verifiably documented no further than North American shores, to accept that the virulent forms of white racism ended within less than a generation. It would almost be irrational to believe this, but it is true. What D'Souza is analyzing is how a people are painfully struggling with the reality that there has been, in fact, an end to racism. <P>This book is a must read for anyone thinks about race in America.</span>

                    <span>I read this book during my years at Colby College, which is a very liberal college in Maine. The book presented many contrarian points of view that I found refreshing in the environment where I found myself. Colby College was all about "diversity" and "tolerance" which are all excellent ideals, but were tarnished by the way the College presented them. D'Souza's book takes a completely different approach to racism in society, as opposed to "white privilege" which is a very popular theory which I do not espouse; D'Souza tries to use cultural history in his explanation. I have heard people call him disgusting words for his views, but I think he has some excellent points. If you are one who believes in white privilege, do not get this book--it will probably just upset you. However, if you tend to be more moderate or are looking for a point of view, D'Souza's End of Racism is a well researched work that carefully constructs arguments that will engage your mind and help to explain some of society's ills.</span>

                    <span>First, let me say that I am a libertarian (an ideology whose adherents generally seem to agree with the principles D'souza espouses). Second, let me add that while I am not a racist ( a term I find misleading, because it implies a defining character trait as opposed to one that may manifest in certain situations), I hold the uncommon viewpoint that racism is just as legitimate of an ideology as any other, and that discrimination CAN be rational. However, this book is so pathetic that it ranks lower than whatever deconstructionist, multiculturalist, Marxist book is popular.<P>Let us first look at the meat of D'souza's work, which I will sum up in three points.<P>1. Slavery has nothing to do with current black poverty.<BR>2. Black poverty is caused by black culture.<BR>3. The pathologies of black culture are a result of slavery.<P>While not making any link, D'souza explains that blacks' condition is a result of the fact that black individuals are more likely to be lazy, criminal, etc... than whites. He then (actually, he does this earlier in the book) explains convincingly how slave culture obviously lends itself to laziness and theft. Both of these points are probably true, but they contradict the central thesis of the book which is that past oppression has little to do with current black poverty.<P>The secondary thesis of this book is that Western Culture is superior to that of any other. Let us now look at his claim of Western Moral superiority. He claims that modern western cultures were the first to ever voluntarily abolish slavery, and he cites a study which attempted to complete the difficult task of researching every culture that ever existed and the way they dealt with slavery. However, it is a known fact that slavery was outlawed in Ancient India.<P>Another problem with this book is that it supports the neocon claim that Martin Luther King supported black and white equality and colorblindness. D'Souza avoids the many things king wrote explicitly in favor of reparations for slavery, affirmative action, separatism, and black economic protectionism such as:<P>"A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis." <P>"No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries...Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages. The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of a the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes. The payment should be in the form of a massive program by the government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement in accordance with the accepted practice of common law." (MLK's 1964 book "Why we cant wait")<P>D'Souza attacks a straw man about how while king believed in equal results by claiming that he felt the way to accomplish<BR>this was through equal rights, and that if he had lived longer, he would have seen his error.<P>D'souza's account of Christopher Columbus is terrible History. (For an equally shoddy, but opposite point of view, read anything by Howard Zinn) He simply selects certain quotes by explorers that support his conclusion, while eschewing others that may serve to contradict it.<P>Most of the early part of the book, which focuses on a time in a more distant past, is made up of anecdotes from contemporary figures, which he uses as "proof" of the way the world was. If someone did that to describe present day America, they would be laughed at, why don't people do this for ancient history?</span>
