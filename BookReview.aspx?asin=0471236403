                    <span>The real differentiator of this book is that its focus on how to build Web services from Java and J2EE to solve real-world problems, rather than reproducing the Web services specifications and tutorials itself. As such, it's a much more pragmatic approach to building Web services using popular web services implementations (like Weblogic, Axis and Sun JWSDP) than the other books I've read on the subject. <P>The author starts by taking high-level perspective along with real hands-on examples on the Web services and its building blocks, building web services architecture showing the different design considerations that need to be applied when choosing which<BR>J2EE technologies to use. A case study (ACME Web services) is described and elaborated at Chapter 11 of the book, showing how can you build a complete Web services solution putting together with JAX APIs (This is missing in other Java web services books). <P>The book also provides a load of examples, which I found useful for my projects. Overall, the book serves well for a Java programmer who wish to build Web services solutions, not just understand the technology.</span>

                    <span>This is an ideal book - with the right mix of code, examples and detailed explanation of Web services technologies. Books with too much theory drown you with diagrams, whereas you want to hit it asap. I liked the explanations, especially with the wealth of code.<P>After an extensive search, I found this is the only book which demonstrates a real world Web services architecture with code in action. It shows a live example of Web services - showing how to create, publish, locate and invoke web services using JAX APIs - JAX-RPC, SAAJ, JAXR etc.<P>In addition, this book has a wealth of ready to use examples using Weblogic 7.0, Apache Axis 1.0, JWSDP 1.1, IBM Web services security kit and Microsoft .NET. The examples walksthrough from how to set up environment, implement code, ANT build scripts and finally how to deploy and execute them in the target environment.<P>Overall I found this to be the best JAVA WEB SERVICES book on the market. It gives the reader the hands-on experience on all popular tools and Sun JAX APIs...from getting started to advanced examples.</span>

                    <span>After reading the complete book i got the impression that the only possible audince for this book are students. For getting just basic understanding on Web Services.<BR>Despite the volume, size and weight, this book is no more than introductory to the basic concepts of WS. Any themes that are slightly beyond basic usage of standards and APIs are not decribed well.<BR>The title does not match contents.<BR>Security. This is very little in the book about real security. Again all limited by SAML and other standards. Nothing on .NET WS security, ws-security, 3d party vendors. Difference is that standards in WS security little have with real deployments.<BR>Architecture. This is not book about architecture of Web Services. Architecture focuses not how this works but what we build. In this sense this book have nothing in this extent.<BR>Describing standards and APIs does not define architecure apparently.<BR>Industry domaina are not covered. Generally business part of WS is not covered. Where is BizTalk, ebXML, XML databases?<BR>Nothing about RDF and Semantic Web as well.<BR>Bottom line is that i can recommend you the book only if you want to study Web Services from academic point of view being a student. This is not a book for professional developer, engineer, manager or software architect.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is provides a comprehensive overview of creating web services with Java. The first part composed of two chapters is an introduction to web services. It portrays web services as the natural progression of distributed computing. The second part covers architecture and technologies like SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, as well as interoperability with .Net. The third part includes important Java APIs for XML (like JAXB, JAXP, etc.) and the Java Web Services Developer Pack. The fourth part covers web services security. The fifth part is basically an introduction to the Sun Net Open Environment (Sun ONE). For the most part each topic has sufficient depth, but for instructional purposes a somewhat different organization (i.e. progressive concept building) would make it an easier read, but perhaps less valuable as a reference.<P>The book contains numerous code examples and diagrams that depict how things are supposed to work. A couple of interesting pieces are the Case Study using JWSDP from Sun and the Further Reading appendix. Since JWSDP is a free download from Sun, it is a good way to experiment with web services without a large investment. The further reading idea is a good one that is not used frequently enough. Some books have a bibliography, but where do you go to further your knowledge?<P>Overall, I felt that the book was repetitious and wordy. However, it covers many topics that are important to success in Java Web Services. There is so much repetition that a reader could probably just drop into a chapter on a topic of interest and begin reading. While many developers focus on how their particular vendor delivers web services, if you want to know how the technologies are supposed to work together, this book is a good resource, but you may not want to start here. At 700+ pages, this volume could be quite daunting.</span>

                    <span>This book is too repetitive and verbose. Pretty much everything is repeated over and over again. When you repeat something over and over again, it becomes painful to read and comprehend. Repetition also increases the number of pages. May be the publishers feel they are providing value to readers by giving them a thick fat repetitive book? When you repeat something repeatedly, you lose the gist of what the person is trying to convey. Repetition makes the discussion verbose. I don't particularly find verbosity and redundancy as positive qualities of a book. The authors also have not scoped the topics to cover well. They are all over the place trying to touch upon in little depth a wide range of topics. That allows them to repeat themselves even more.<P>Or you could have just read the title of my review. ;-)</span>
