                    <span>The author seems to have "bought" into Public Key Infrastructure completely. Many chapters have a simliar formula: <BR><P>1. Explain background on the compliance issue or standard<BR><BR>2. Then explain why PKI is so great and solves a majority of the problems with the particular issue being discussed.<BR><P>This leaves a bit to be desired in some cases as the compliance-heavy discussions really move past PKI and into extremely detailed market compliance issues. This book will be useful for individuals looking for information having to do with Financial, e-Government, and Health Care compliance issues but not necessarily with PKI implementations for Enterprise organizations.</span>

                    <span>Good stuff on PKI: technical and business angles. Compliance was the main reason I took at look at this book, since HIPAA affects us day to day. I did appreciate the introduction to the technology (with technical depth). One thing I did really like it was that (to large degree) the book was vendor neutral. Some of the books through the RSA label have some spin. Definitely worth adding this book to the security collection.</span>

                    <span>This book covers a good chunk of digital security strategies with a focus on digital certificates (PKI). The first part of the book covers the PKI basics including technical and business topics. The next part of the book goes over the compliance laws (in relevant vertical areas) and how PKI (and compatible technologies) help resolve them. The last part of the book goes over resources and specific products/companies.<P>What I really liked about this book is it focus on how solve real problems such as compliance issues. Plus the case studies and specific vendor references make this is a good book to use for actual implementations. <P>Finally, this is a recent book on PKI and I have not seen too much on this topic as of late. The international coverage in the book also does well to keep the material relevant and current.<P>I would say this book would be ideal for security consultants as well as decision makers doing anything related to digital certificates and/or ecommerce in general.</span>

                    <span>This book covers methods to provide security for digital transactions. Using a commonly used technology, called PKI (digital certificates), applications and transactions can be secured for a range of applications (even when you buy this book on this site you use PKI!). The book has a focus on how the technology can be used to solve certain compliance issues in various verticals (healthcare-HIPPA, financial--GLB, etc...). <P>There are several excellent aspects of this book: practical with good tips, guidance, and case studies. Also useful is the vendor solutions section that describes a sample of companies in each space (talked about somewhere in the book). This way you can go out and actually talk about implementation and real solutions right away. <P>Other good aspects include a modular approach to the book. Each section scales and serves a different audience (including techies). Even the business/IT manager can read how to crunch out numbers to justify a security deployment.<P>Finally, the book was rather insightful. Research is given as to where PKI is used in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Having a global view makes this book very useful.</span>
