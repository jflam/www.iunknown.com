                    <span>I read this book so fast, the way it was written was so interesting and easy, evey single question I had in mind was answered, nothing is left! I loved the book, unfortunately I cannot get the Ace the IT INTERVIEW book, because it is not available in my area, but I would definetly the interview book too! by the way there is a very good chapter about interview in this book! 
<br />four little things i hated about this book:
<br />
<br />- much more of network than software development ! but it is ok coz most careers are in Network administration. 
<br />- in a resume there was: Modem Software!!, this is called Browser...!
<br />- adding Norton AntiVirus in an IT resume is something stupid!
<br />- PHP and C-Sharp: top programming lanuges not mentioned in the book!</span>

                    <span>This book's objective is to land you an interview. Before reading this book I could only say I had 1 maybe 2 interviews total in a period of a few months. After reading this book and using some of its suggestions I have had several more. 
<br />
<br />Overall I'd rate it a 4.8 since I feel that Paula is a bit too forward with some of her suggestions (for example closing statements on cover letters that are a bit overboard imo).
<br />
<br />But that's my only complaint =)
<br />
<br />No matter your position in life be it a freshout of college or an experienced IT vet who's looking for something different, this book will pay for itself many times over. </span>

                    <span>I do not know where these women got their credentials, but they are WAY off the mark!  DO NOT LIE ON YOUR RESUME!  No matter what this book recommends!  For instance, the authors state: "If your offical title is Tech Level I, you might be responsible for database administration, PC support, and webmaster duties.  If you're hoping to move into DBA, list 'database administrator' as the job title and as the first bullet describe your responsibilities in this function."  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  As a hiring manager and interviewer, if I discover you lied about your job title, especially when you were a Tech I and you claimed to be a DBA, I will wonder what else you lied about.  And believe me, I'll find out when I call your previous employers to verify your employment history.  No, instead, when in this situation, downplay, emphasize the job title you want, and even omit your job titles, and use the opportunity to emphasize your skills.  That way, even if you don't have the right job title, you can demonstrate to me that it doesn't matter.  But NEVER, EVER lie or deliberately mislead anyone.  Then they'll just feel like you were trying to trick them, which is NOT very impressive.</span>

                    <span>My survey of resume books was disappointing until I found this one. This book helped me translate my military experience into a robust resume better than any "military transition" book I read. No question it will work the same for recent college grads or self-employed IT folks. The authors understand the differences the tech people face when creating a resume vs. the standard admin/clerical/business formats. Plenty of examples included--I didn't need to buy an extra book for sample resumes to cover a range of scenarios and backgrounds. It took my average resume and streamlined it into an effective, TARGETED tool. I was pretty impressed and now recommend it to everyone in the sector looking for a job.</span>
