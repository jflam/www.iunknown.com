                    <span>Yellowstone Treasures, by Janet Chapple, is the key to appreciating this beautiful park. Because the book is organized into Road Logs, wherever you are you read about what's coming up next: geological phenomena, animals, trees, flowers, trail heads, lakes and human history are all included. The maps are clear, plentiful, accurate and useful. Each section is amply expanded with information boxes about things such as how geysers work, how terraces are built, how the names of places were chosen, petrified trees, geological mysteries, etc. The chapters on geological phenomena, human history, flora and fauna are a gold mine of information. Take the book with you, but look at the website http://www.yellowstonetreasures.com/ well beforehand, because it is also a treasure. We were never without this book during our visit.</span>

                    <span>I just took this book to Yellowstone and found it indispensible! We quickly gave up using the official park guides to the various geyser basins and relied on this book to tell us all about the different geysers and their histories. The book is packed with information about the history of Yellowstone. It even has a flora and fauna guide! Included are lists of suggested sights to see, hikes to take, driving distances, road maps (but no topo maps), discussions about how geysers work, the Yellowstone caldera, the 1988 fires, where to stay, etc. The book is printed on nice paper and the photos are in full color. This is really an indispensible book to bring along on your next visit to Yellowstone!</span>

                    <span>Janet Chapple's Yellowstone Treasures: The Traveler's Companion To The National Park (together with its companion website www.yellowstonetreasure.com) is the quintessential guide to the oldest national park in America. The second largest national park (after Death Valley), it is also the most varied park in the continental United States. This impressive and comprehensive guide showcases all the places of interest to be found along Yellowstone's 350 miles of park roads. Information is provided on the geological and historical background of the area, including geyser basins, wildlife-viewing spots, waterfalls, and unique vistas. The supplemental website provides practical advice on trip planning, descriptions of the seasons, and up-to-date information on hot springs, striped mountains, and even alpine windflowers. If you are planning a visit, then begin with a careful reading of Yellowstone Treasures and checking out its remarkable and "user friendly" website.</span>

                    <span>This is a handy and detailed guide to Yellowstone with descriptions of the Park's features arranged by the five main roadway entrances: West, South, East, Northeast, and North, plus the Bechler Region.<P>For each approach there is a full color map with icons symbolizing the main attractions, facilities, trails and so forth. The guide then takes you mile by fraction of mile with a description of the historical, geological and natural features you will encounter. There is also a historical chronology, a discussion of the wildlife, an chapter on the 1998 fires, and a lot of useful travel phone numbers and tips.<P>The inset maps, pictures, and sidebar stories are wonderfully presented-- when you look at this book you will be drooling to visit the Park! It is beautiful, and the solid fund of information makes it a good buy at only twenty bucks. The geologic explanations are particularly neat. <P>This is a guide that will suit educated visitors (and daydream wanderers) who have want to know the story behind the major and minor sights. You may need a more tourist oriented guide if you want detailed info on in-park and near-park lodgings and places to eat. Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park by Lee H. Whittlesey would make a fine counterpart to Yellowstone Treasures.</span>
