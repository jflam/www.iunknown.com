		<description>You don&#039;t try and answer a question like that during a random news conference that will be reported around the world. You wait until you have something substantitve to contribute to the conversation. This is a great example of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.</description>

		<description>The most amazing thing about this is that you are amazed by it. Wow is right.

 You think he can summarily order the TSA to stop screening passengers in such an aggressive manner? You know what would happen if he did, right? He would be vilified by fox news and others, and when someone from sand-land slipped in with shoe-bomb of the week, Obama would get all the blame. Obama&#039;s recent remarks were not an inaugural address, just an acknowledgement of the present situation. 

He&#039;s damned if he does, damned if he doesn&#039;t.</description>
