                    <span>If you are a Yankee Fan like myself you probably have a lot of Yankees related books in your collection. Chances are that Harvey Frommer wrote more than one of them. Mr. Frommer, a life long Yankees fan wrote for Yankees Magazine for sixteen years. He also wrote more than thirty Sports books including The New York Yankee Encyclopedia and New York City Baseball. Recnetly he commemorated the Yankees 100th Season with his latest "A Yankee Century. Given 5 Stars by BehindtheBombers.com<P>This book is the perfect companion for the encyclopedia. It is written so that you can bounce from one topic to the next. It starts you out by looking at a chronological look at the Yankees first 100 years. It takes your from the birth of the Bambino to the dedication of Reggie Jackson's plaque in Monument Park. <P>What is your favorite moment in Yankees History? Chapter 2 looks at them all and the perfect way to trigger your Yankee memories, both good and bad. The book continues with a Who's Who that cover just about everyone you could think of and a few you couldn't. Then a new twist is added when Harvey Frommer looks back at some of the great and not so great Yankee teams of the century. <P>Babe Ruth was known as the Sultan of Swat and Mickey Mantle was know as the Commerce Comet. But who what the Brooklyn Schoolboy? Bruiser? Or Dial a Deal? Well all those answers can be found in this book.<P>Although the Bombers were the first team to wear uniform numbers the next section, "By The Numbers" is more than that. For instance what does the number 4 mean to the Yankees? The most balks in a game by Vic Raschi on May 3, 1950. It is also Casey's streak of managing losing All Star games (1950 to 1953). And of course it is Lou Gehrig's uniform number.<P>There is a section on Yankee trivia entitled 100 Question Yankee Quiz. This quiz separates the men from the boys and the women from the girls. It covers the ridiculous to the sublime. See just how good a fan you are.<P>What Yankee Book would be complete without a section where you can find lists, charts, Yankee Firsts, Yankee Lasts, Yankee Longests and much much more.<P>With an introduction by Yankee favorite Paul O'Neill what more can you ask for. This definitive compilation captures the Yankee tradition in words, stats and photographs. It is the Yankees at your fingertips. It is light reading or something you won't want to put down. A perfect gift for the Yankee fan but buy two you wont want to give it away.</span>

                    <span>A Yankee Century may at first glance seem like a special interest book, and it will indeed appeal particularly to Yankee fans. However, because of their sheer dominance--it really was their century--the history of the Yankees is to a unique extent a history of baseball in general. Where 100 years of a team like the Reds would inevitably have vast dry patches, we all know and rooted vigorously for or against the Yankees of many different eras. Thus while there are delights in store for the fanatic--like the fact that Babe Ruth by himself had more homeruns (60) in 1927 than the 2nd place team (the A's with 56) or that when Grover Cleveland Alexander had his legendary confrontation with Tony Lazzeri, the Yankee was just 22 years old, just a kid really--no one who follows the game will have trouble finding material here that interests them. Mr. Frommer has included copious illustrations and the book is broken up into a wide variety of sections, from quizzes to profiles to statistics. This makes the book very accessible and, in the best sense, putdownable. It's a book that you want to delve into a bit at a time and to skip around in, rather than to read in one sitting. It's like a king-size Whitman Sampler.</span>

                    <span>In the northeast, the winter of 2003-2004 will be remembered as one of the snowiest, iciest, coldest and dreariest in recent memory. A YANKEE CENTURY was the perfect cure for those miserable days. Filled with the baseball history that took place on the sun-drenched field of Yankee Stadium, Harvey Frommer has provided us Yankee [and most baseball] fans with a warm nostalgia and a good feeling for the springs and summers to come.<P>With equal parts statistics and anecdote, the book is a well-balanced exploration into the most successful sports franchise in history. Peppered with wonderful photos (some that I had never seen before), this 400+ page book moves swiftly. The writing is respectful without becoming sentimental. And Paul O'Neill, who I will always remember as our favorite water-cooler kicking hothead, proves to be a sensitive and articulate commentator. Congratulations to both writers.<P>A YANKEE CENTURY is a great exploration into the Bronx Bombers, and by extension, to the history of 20th century baseball itself.</span>

                    <span>The Olympian<P>A Yankee Century" ($16, Berkley). Baseball's spring training does not truly reside in the deserts of Arizona or near the sands and swamps of Florida. It resides in the hearts and minds of children-turned-adults, who carry with them years of baseball lore and feelings (rational or not) of intense rivalry. <P>So the paperback version of "A Yankee Century" is just the ticket for warming up to the first crack of the bat. As one raised on the Baltimore Orioles, I can do nothing else but hate (rationally or not) the Yankees. <P>That said, 100 years of Yankee baseball is a walk through much of baseball history. Harvey Frommer's book covers so many of the details that fans love to savor that it's irresistible. <P>Frommer stays out of the statistic pit (although there are plenty of numbers), instead making a winning delivery out of stories and quotes that will help baseball fans stay sane on a rainy late-January afternoon. <P>The Olympian, Olympia Washington</span>

                    <span>This N' That with Tony Mack:<BR>BLACK ATHLETE SPORTS NETWORK<P>BOOK REVIEW: A YANKEE CENTURY\\<BR>***************************************************************<P> BRISTOL, CONN---Earlier this year, you may have read a book review I wrote on the historic relationship between Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson. That book was penned by noted baseball writer and historian Harvey Frommer.<P>Prof. Frommer has since come out with another historic baseball book, this time about the sport's most celebrated franchise.<P>Frommer, who authored "The New York Yankee Encloypedia", has now penned "A Yankee Century: A Celebration of the First 100 Years of Baseball's Greatest Team". <P>Not only does Frommer give an oral history of the Pinstripes, but there are several rare photos of Yankee greats past and present.<P>From Babe Ruth to Derek Jeter, Lou Gehrig to Reggie Jackson, and all those in between, "A Yankee Century" is keepsake dream for fans of the Bronx Bombers and a nightmare for Yankee haters all over.<P>Even though this review is being written by a lifelong Met fan, I found this to be a very entertaining read.<P>One of the things that was enjoyable about the book is how Frommer has separate "Yankee Stories" on the well-known and lesser known ex-Yankees.<P>A humble Chris Chambliss talks about coming over from the lowly Cleveland Indians in a 1975 and then winning the pennant with a dramatic homer in the 1976 ALCS against the Royals.<P>Frommer also writes about the plight of Elston Howard, the first Black to play for the Yankees. His struggles on and off the field are chronicled along with a review of his very understated career as a player and coach. <P>The breathtaking and sometimes tumulous career of Reggie Jackson in pinstripes is also well chronicled. "Mr. October" had one of the greatest moments in Yankee history when he hit three homers in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series.<P>At the time, it gave the Yanks their first World Series title in 13 seasons and he would help them go back to the next season. <P>Among some of the other African American players that are featured in Prof. Frommer's book are Jeter, current third base coach and ex-captain Willie Randolph, Bernie Williams, and Hall of Famer Dave Winfield.<P>The book also includes a comprehensive trivia quiz, quotes, anecdotes, and other entertaining features for all baseball fans, Yankee or otherwise. <P>If you know a true Yankee fan, it's a great addition to their library.<P>If you know a true Yankee hater, this will be a best way to start an arguement.</span>
