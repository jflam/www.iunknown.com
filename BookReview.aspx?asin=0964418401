                    <span>Suzanne Massie creates a moving, romantic view of the palace and park at Pavlovsk. Indeed, the author gives an interesting history of the palace, the creative force of its first mistress, Maria Fedorovna, in shaping its structure and extraordinary park. <P>The history falls thin in unfolding the history of subsequent inhabitants; and in describing the development of the many features of the park (at one time the largest private park in Europe). That Suzanne Massie skimps on the history of those post Maria Fedorovna inhabitants and in placing the park in its proper framework mars the descriptive of Pavlovsk's story. <P>The historic descriptive becomes a prelude for the heroically painted picture of A. M. Kuchumov, the head preservationist at the time of palace's reconstruction (A. M. Kuchumov's story by itself, would be substantial material a book); and, thus, may explain the scant detail of the park's restoration, since A. M. Kuchumov displayed heroic dedication and courage to his work that would overshadow the story of the park in favour of that of the palace itself. There is no information on the continuing efforts to address all the problems persisting from that palace reconstruction--the first to be rebuilt after WW2--or the continuing story of the park. <P>Suzanne Massie does leave out the dimensions of the incredible collections at the palace-museum; and the continuing extraordinary work of the conservators. (It also may be of interest to note that the legendary Rose Pavilion has been reconstructed (1993-94); and that Suzanne Massie had contributed work towards fundraising for lighting for the palace, but no longer maintains such connections with the palace-museum and park.) <P>I should like to see an update and an expansion of this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a book about a Russian palace, Pavlovsk, a classically beautiful building which was designed by Charles Cameron and furnished by Maria Feodorova, the daughter-in-law of Catherine the Great. The palace managed to escape the uncertain taste of descendants and the Revolutionary commissars to somehow remain intact. Then came the Second World War. The Nazis occupied the palace, stripped it to the walls and set it on fire. It was reduced to smouldering shell. A devoted band of Russians devoted their lives to restoring the palace to its former glory. Their work is like a detective story as they trace looted furnishings and use old blue-prints and photos to rebuild. Rebuild they did, and the palace is now open to the public. A heroic story, though not in the conventional sense.</span>
