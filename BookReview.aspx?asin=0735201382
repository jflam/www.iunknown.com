                <span id="Label1">Fixed-income investments will never be as sexy as the day's hottest stock or a mutual fund focusing on the market sector du jour. But their very stability, combined with the equilibrium they provide when the Dow and the NASDAQ start bouncing around like 6-year-olds on a sugar high, are exactly why savvy investors count on them to round out their portfolios. Marilyn Cohen's <I>The Bond Bible</I> offers an unambiguous look at this once-arcane world, which--like much relating to investing--has become considerably less mysterious and immeasurably more accessible with the advent of the Internet. Cohen, president of a capital management firm, fully explains everything from income streams and the Treasury yield curve to the pluses of federal agency bonds and the negatives of high-yield issues. In simple terms, she also addresses advanced strategies such as leveraging, credit rating agencies, and insurance, bond funds and unit trusts, and nontraditional vehicles such as those tied to rock & roll royalties. Exactly how much of your portfolio should be devoted to bonds is a personal choice based on individual circumstances. Once you determine that, however, this book will help you reach an informed decision on what to buy, where to obtain it, and how to manage what you've got. <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>You've heard the old mantra: Diversify, Diversify, Diversify -- but have you actually heeded that advice? Until I read this book, I had no real concept of what bonds could do for my portfolio. To me, bonds were boring, stale, stagnant, and, well, really couldn't hold a candle to the potential double digit returns stocks and mutual funds could produce. Why would I even bother?  
<br />
<br />Marilyn Cohen takes you by the hand and walks you through the often convoluted terms (i.e. rate to maturity, convertible bonds, laddering, callability, etc.) and explains them in easy to understand terms with practical examples. Don't let that deter those of you that are experienced bond traders -- there are things in here for you too.
<br />
<br />After reading this, I feel a lot more comfortable adding bonds to my portfolio, as well as talking about them with investment professionals. There's a lot of potential out there in the fixed income field if you know what you're looking for.  At this point, I know enough to adequately diversify my portfolio.</span>

                    <span>My name is Bond. Bond Bible. All jokes aside, bonds have been sorely underestimated. So many people forget that bond holders are creditors. So that when a company folds, shareholders lose out, but most often times bond holders get paid out. Ms. Cohen pulls no punches and is solid in her review of the bond world. I even like her inclusion of "Bowie" Bonds, the rock and roll bonds that were founded several years ago. <p>In all her talk I found her discussion light on leveraged bonds. Bond futures are also a viable means to enter this fixed income investment. I should know I've been doing it for 11 years.<br> <br>That aside this is a one of kind book that no modern investor can do without.</span>

                    <span>"The Bond Bible" is a solid primer on bonds and bond trading for those who are not financial services professionals.  Interest in fixed income investing has risen dramatically with the recent vicissitudes in the equity markets, but wise investors already had a portion of their portfolio assets in debt securities.  Marilyn Cohen cites the rule of thumb that an investor should have a fixed income component equal in percentage to their age -- and while not an advocate of "rules of thumb" in general -- I agree.  To steal a phrase from Warren Buffett -- it's often more important what you don't lose than what you make!  The last two years in the equity markets have demonstrated the value of proper asset allocation, but before charging off to reallocate your investments into fixed income, read "The Bond Bible." A well managed bond element in your portfolio can reward you with income, capital appreciation, AND a return of principal.  You won't see that in equities.</span>

                    <span>I've had enough stock-talk!   I've listened to the experts and alot of good its done me! Bond advice?  Get real, when "experts" talk about bonds its as if they are only talking to each other! Marilyn Cohen educates her readers like real people.   The Bond Bible sheds light on a very necessary part of our portfolio (whether to protect against the not-so-reliable stock market) or to plan for retirement.  Thank you, Ms. Cohen, there IS another way!</span>
