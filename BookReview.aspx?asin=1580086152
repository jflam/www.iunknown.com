<br />
<br />If you don't understand who you are, and what you have to offer, how can you find the right vocation ?
<br />
<br />This book makes a great graduation gift.

                    <span>Parachute is the best book in the world of its type - but only if you are looking to transition into a new career. This is very definitely a book for job-changers (the flower exerise is still a marvellous resource for this), it is of almost no use to real people on here-and-now job-hunts.
<br />
<br />If you know what you want to do next in life, this book has very little of value for you. Bolles spends almost no time on the two elements in the mix where most job-hunters fail to succeed: the written stage and the selection interview. There is no breakdown of how to put yourself across on paper and a very abbreviated, almost philosophical, discussion of how to sell yourself at interview. 
<br />
<br />Given the changes in the marketplace, I was hoping to read Bolles' ideas on behavioural and competency interviewing, but he has NOTHING on either of these subjects in the 2005 Parachute. In fact, there is virtually no difference between the 2005 edition and the 2002 one. He has slotted in a few paragraphs about the market being tougher, but none of the 'practical' material has changed since 2002. The "new edition every year" concept seems to be a marketing tool rather than offering anything really new. 
<br />
<br />As ever, his ideas on networking and informational interviewing remain useful, but there is nothing new in these sections. If you need practical advice on securing a great new job, try D'Alessandro's CAREER WARFARE or Manahan's WHERE'S MY OASIS.</span>

                    <span>I researched Bolles' updated for 2005 and it is still a classic.  My review below still stands, but updated as follows. 
<br />
<br />Bolles' advice on the new realities we are struggling under is very pointed.  There are jobs and ways to find them if you know what you want and where to find them.
<br />
<br />I still think if people were to use this book as a workbook it they would discover so much about themselves.
<br />
<br />Bolle's book is still timeless for job seekers of all kinds. I feel that his book updated each year to meet the current trends in society is critical. He needs to address those issues, like the web, downturn in the economy and the like.
<br />The most critical part of the book is the self evaluation section. This is a very structured process that can be used intutitively as well. Bolles asks you to write a few stories about yourself, then, what did you like and dislike about those stories? What did you do well, where did you fail or feel challenged beyond your abilities? These are the critical areas of the book that take time to get through, yet you can evaluate yourself and understand what you like, it is what you do best, usually.
<br />
<br />We excel what we are good at, according to Bolles, this method will help us discover what we are best at.
<br />
<br />I have recommended this book to many over the years, and still do. Whether someone is in college, or someone is going through a long term transition after being in a job for a long time or moms returning to the work place, this book will be very instructive for you.
<br />
<br />One of his processes is very simple asking you to compare who you would most like to talk with or groups of people you would rather relate with. This is a standard set of tests for some very expensive career consulting, he gives it to you for the price of his book and the time to self evaluate yourself. Then, he breaks down the possible job areas and skill sets related to these groups.
<br />
<br />Again, a worthwhile journey for anyone not wanting to wander any longer in the world of work.

                    <span>As a career coach and trainer, I'm constantly looking for resources that will give clients an edge - and "What Color Is Your Parachute" always delivers.  This updated 2005 version offers an extremely relevant overview of the current economy and the motivating reminder that there are always jobs out there. While reinforcing the best of the proven "Parachute" job search methods, this year's edition also offers new and expanded exercises to help you discover what you love to do and target where you'd love to do it. And the process of positioning yourself as a proactive problem solver, not just a "job beggar", helps you to stand out from the competition and become a magnet for reaching your goals.</span>
