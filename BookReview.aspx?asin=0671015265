                    <span>October 6, 2002<p>Hoping for a peek into the arena of sports agency, I <br>picked this up one lazy afternoon.  Wow!  I suppose if <br>you're the right sort of person with the right sense of <br>humor, you could have a lot of fun wallowing inside this <br>fellow Drew Rosenhaus's own fascinated vision of himself <br>and his life--replete with numerous descriptions of how <br>crafty and tough he is, as well as an insert bikini photo <br>of his model girlfriend (with whom he's formed a deep, <br>lasting pair-bond, I'm sure).<p>However, it's more likely you might be left gaping at a <br>printed ego that approaches the sociopathic, pondering<br>about what publisher and editor were possibly thinking, <br>and wondering how many Drew Rosenhauses are out <br>there, tolerated, even rewarded, in this, the tackiest, <br>but best dressed, of all possible worlds.  <p>Tolerated and rewarded not just in professional sports, <br>which would be bad enough, but in civil law, corporate <br>finance, government . . .</span>

                    <span>I could not belive how someone could be this self involved... I am a negotiator and was hoping for good negotiating advice but got something much different.  I am sure that half of this book was untrue, however I  have to give credit were credit is due, he did make it to the top.  I just  hope that after the realease of this book he is able to stay there,  "now that would be impressive"...</span>

                    <span>This book was a good read. The writing was not great, but I got the point.  A must read for aspiring sports agents and true NFL fans.  Rosenhaus is quite a character and his story is truly unique.  Gives a inside account of  the inner workings of the NFL and the contract negoitiation process from  recruitment to finalization.  Rosenhaus is truly passionate about his  profession and the NFL.  GO SHARK GO!</span>
