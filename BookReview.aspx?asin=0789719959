                    <span>I loved this book. It was fun and easy to read, and made alot of sense from the very start. Now, Im a professional computer games programmer, but I bought this book out of pure interest. However, my only "complaint" is the programming part of this book. It is supposed to be a guide into to a career as a computer programmer, and it starts explaining subjcts such as Recursion etc. I dont think this should be in the book at all, but naturally, some programming should be in there. Maybe some easy material such as keywords, variables etc...<P>But this is only a minor glitch. The book itself is excellent. It teaches you alot about how to get a job, write your resume and how to act in a job interview. It also open you to a world of books (which Jessy recommend any wannabe programmer to read), and you get the inside scoop on how it is to be a programmer.<P>My advice to anyone who want to begin programming: Read this book first! Then read Jessy's "Teach Yourself C++ In 21 Days" (that is, if you are going the C++ way).<P>Excellent work Jessy!</span>

                    <span>This book is wonderful for those people that think that a career in programming would be a good thing for them, but don't know where to start. It goes through some programming basics (not languages per se, but theory of programming), and then talks about developing "road maps" so that you are clear on how developing a particular skill fits into a useful career development path.<P>It discusses the types of programmers out there, and why you might be good for one type of programmer or another.<P>Finally, it gives you good advice on landing that first job.<P>It's written in a way that's very easy to read - sort of like if you were sitting down and having a personal tutorial with Jesse Liberty.<P> The author really does back up his books with after sales support when you have questions, or are just stuck. You really feel like you are a part of a community as you're reading the book.<P>After reading this you'll WANT to read his other books, like "Teach Yourself C++ In 21 Days". Full marks, Jesse!<P>There is one downside - he mentions his own books regularly, but if you are intelligent person and can appraise those books yourself (just read their online reviews right here on Amazon.com), you'll be fine, and you won't make a purchasing mistake!</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately Liberty comes across with a chip on his shoulder against formal college education in this book. Statements like some of the best programmers he knows are "taxi drivers and psychologists" and former university training mainly teaches students to operate "mainframes". In the Introduction it says "According to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, by the year 2005 there will be over two million new jobs for software professionals!" which fails to mention most of the jobs will be overseas easily outsourced as making tennis shoes. Otherwise, Liberty still shows his expertise and there are good sections on advice for interviewing and resume writing. But in the end as an idiot, I wished I had majored in engineering instead of computer science especially when 90% of my undergraduate computer science student body were graduate students from the eastern side of the world.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is the best choice for peaple who are wanting to learn how to program but don't know where to start. It doesn't teach you how to program in a specific language, but it shows you the basic thing of lots of languages. It has lots of book and magazine suggestions also. This book is very easy to understand. Although you might not agree with what Jesse Liberty is suggesting for your career, it's a great book.</span>

                    <span>A more appropriate title for this book would have been "An Introduction to the Field of Computer Programming." It's an excellent read for someone interesting in understanding what computer programming is about. It is not, as the author claims, a guide to building a career as a programmer. <P>The author would have you believe that all you need to become a Software Engineer is to study a couple of books on VB or C++ that he's written (indeed, much of this book seems like an advertisement to persuade the reader to buy his other books). That's like saying you can become a doctor by reading physiology books in your spare time. ...<P>If you're considering a career in programming, this book can help give you an idea of what it's like so you can decide whether it's for you or not. Then, if you do plan to pursue this field, take some computer science classes at your local college or university. ...</span>
