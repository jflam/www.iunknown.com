                <span id="Label1"><p align="left">Rebecca Martin is a single mother with an apartment to rent and a sense that she has used up her illusions. <i>I had the romantic thing with my first husband, thank you very much</i>, she tells a hapless suitor. <i>I'm thirty-eight years old, and I've got a daughter learning to read and a job I don't quite like. I don't need the violin music</i>. But when the new tenant in her in-law apartment turns out to be Michael Christopher, on the lam after twenty years in a monastery and smack dab in the middle of a dark night of the soul, Rebecca begins to suspect that she is not as thoroughly disillusioned as she had thought.</p><p align="left">Her daughter, Mary Martha, is delighted with the new arrival, as is Rebecca's mother, Phoebe, a rollicking widow making a new life for herself among the spiritual eccentrics of the coastal town of Bolinas. Even Rebecca's best friend, Bonnie, once a confirmed cynic in matters of the heart, urges Rebecca on. But none of them, Rebecca feels, understands how complicated and dangerous love actually is.</p><p align="left">As her unlikely friendship with the ex-monk grows toward something deeper, and Michael wrestles with his despair while adjusting to a second career flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, Rebecca struggles with her own temptation to hope. But it is not until she is brought up short by the realities of life and death that she begins to glimpse the real mystery of love, and the unfathomable depths of faith.</p><p align="left">Beautifully written and playfully engaging, this novel. is about one man wrestling with his yearning for a life of contemplation and the need for a life of action in the world. But it's Rebecca's spirit, as well as her relationships with Mary Martha, Phoebe, her irresponsible surfer ex-husband Rory -- and, of course, the monk downstairs -- that makes this story shine.</p></span>

                    <span>Once I started this book, I was hooked. Tim Farrington has a way of bringing his characters to life with a few well-chosen words. Rebecca, the disillusioned divorced mom trying to raise her six-year old daughter; Michael Christopher, the disillusioned monk who has failed at monastic life and is now cooking burgers at Mcdonald's; Phoebe, Rebecca's witty and oh-so-California mother; Rory, her immature, surfer-dude ex-husband, Bob Schofield, the over-eager suitor who just won't give up his hopeless pursuit. <P>Somehow they all become real in this beautiful, sensitive romance. Will they ever work things out? What will it cost them? For beneath the surface of this love story the author is asking a deeper question. What is the meaning of love itself? The love of God or the love of men and women. What is it really? What is its cost? The novel is never preachy, but a deep religious consciousness lies just below the surface. Real love is more than ecstatic emotion, it says; it is faithfulness, constancy, washing dishes, picking up the child from daycare, sitting quietly with the one you love without saying a word, no matter how much it may hurt.<P>You will laugh, you will cry, you will blow your nose a few times. And you will want to read it again. This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. I wish I could give it more than five stars!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>How refreshing it is to read an intelligent romance about smart, imperfect people just trying to make a life for themselves. I found all the characters well-developed and likeable even in their bad moments ... very real. Rebecca's mother is especially charming as a secondary character, as is the ex-husband -- the boy who refused to grow up. And the monk, Mike, provided the perfect spiritual balance -- without being too religious -- to Rebecca's synicism. Mike's letters to his fellow monk, who was otherwise unintroduced, were welcome interjections that help the reader get to know the character. <P>Unlike a previous reviewer, I did not snooze through one page -- found it completely charming, witty and insightful. <P>(I was a little distracted by the author's inconsistency in referring to the monk -- sometimes as Mike and sometimes as Christopher. I'm not sure if Michael was his first name and Christopher was his last name, or if he had a double name like Mary Martha. Insignificant in the long run, but a little distracting.)</span>

                    <span>This book was okay - a sweet story - but I was hoping for more. I never really felt like I cared about the characters. I didn't even like the main character that much. The monk was a little to perfect - always acting right and making her feel so comfortable - except for the one scene where he says the wrong thing. Maybe it's just me - all the other reviewers seemed to really like this - but it just didn't do much for me.</span>
