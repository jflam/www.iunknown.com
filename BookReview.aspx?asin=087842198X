                    <span>This is the best book about Arizona, and I've read quite a few. You can certainly read this book straight through (you'll find some duplication of stories because of the format), but the book is best read when travelling around the state (turn to whatever highway you happen to be on - while someone else is driving!) or by just opening to any page and starting to read. You'll be amazed at all the information contained herein!<P>From the capital city of Phoenix to tiny state route 73 (Carrizo to McNary), something happened practically everywhere in Arizona - and this book will tell you what it was and when it did.<P>An excellent book by an excellent author! This book, Marshall Trimble's best, is highly recommended for anyone in Arizona who wants to learn more about his state, and for anyone outside Arizona who wants to know what all the fuss is about.<P>**** SECOND EDITION ****<P>The second edition is now available! In addition to the updates you'd normally expect in a second edition, there is also a lot of new material! Also, the maps are vastly improved so you can tell exactly where everything is! If you DON'T own the first edition, make sure you get this one! If you DO own the first edition, make sure you get this one anyway!</span>

                    <span>If you travel around Arizona (or even if you don't) this book is a nice resource to have. Most of Arizona's major roadways are covered and the author does a nice job of describing historical events that occurred at various locations. Before I bought this book, I passed many historic locations and was never even aware of it. Now when I travel around the state, I can point out these historic places or explain the history behind various small towns or landmarks (whether my fellow passengers like it or not). I've read several of Trimble's books and this is the one that I refer back to the most.<P>Another reviewer stated that there were inaccuracies in this book. Not being a historian, I can't comment on that. As someone who has read many books on Arizona history, I must admit that it is annoying to read one book about an event, then read another one that gives a very different account. Unfortunately that is the frustrating part about history - parts of it seem to become lost or reinterpreted as the years pass.</span>

                    <span>This book gives you information about many Arizona towns and cities. What I liked is that Mr. Trimble explains the history of the towns, even those small ones in the middle of nowhere. He explains who founded the towns, how and why, and gives you the background on the people involved. Mr. Trimble's writing style is humorous, easy to read, and fun! This book is a must for anyone traveling Arizona's roads!</span>

                    <span>I don't know about the rest of the book, but almost every paragraph on Grand Canyon has an inaccurate statement and he had NO canyon reference in the bibliography. I wrote Mr. Trimble and he stated "Everyone interprets history differently". Not well established dates. Therefore, I don't trust the accuracy in the rest of the book and do NOT recommend this publication. NATIVE ROADS is a MUCH better book!</span>
