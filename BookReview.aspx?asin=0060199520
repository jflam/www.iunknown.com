                <span id="Label1"><P>From the author of the bestselling <I>Audrey Style</I></P><P>Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was known by many names, but to us, she is Jackie. And whether she liked it or not, she was, and still is, the most famous woman in the world.</P><P>"No one else looked like her, spoke like her, wrote like her, or was so original in the way she did things," said her brother-in-law Senator Edward Kennedy. Her style -- what made her Jackie -- has been emulated, imitated, even occasionally reviled, but never fully examined. For the first time, this biography details the singular life that made Jackie an icon and contributed so greatly to her enduring appeal. Drawing on original interviews with Valentino, Hubert de Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik, and Oleg Cassini, as well as close friends C. Z. Guest, George Plimpton, and John Loring, and family members such as Joan Kennedy, Hugh D. Auchincloss, and John Davis, this compelling volume brings to life the private Jackie her family and friends loved.</P><P>With one hundred rare color and black-and-white photographs and sketches, and never-before-published personal letters, memos, and essays, <I>Jackie Style</I> re-creates not only Jackie's extraordinary history -- fashion being just one part of it -- but the world she came from, the White House she revived, the husband and children she adored, the causes she supported, and, finally, the life she chose to lead.</P></span>

                    <span>I think it's great that there are authors like Keogh around. You can tell that she really wants to portray Jackie at her best. But the problem is that this book is written in a cut and paste way, and despite what the dustcover says, there is nothing new and revealing at all. Let me explain more.<P>First of all, this book is called JACKIE STYLE, but it is really just a popcorn biography. Keogh claims that she has new interviews that reveal new insights about Jackie. Well, tell me, how does the designer Cynthia Rowley saying she admired how Jackie dressed reveal new insights into Jackie, the person, the first lady, and everything that Jackie was and became??????<P>Then, there is the claim that there is over 100 black and white, and color, photos of Jackie that have never been seen before. Not true; with the exception of 25 or less, all have been published before. And the 25 are not of Jackie, but of her friends, or a date, or a Kennedy.<P>This book is written well, but is just isn't about her fashion. There are good photos in the bood, and Keogh does have an inviting writing style, even if she tends to sometimes overpraise her subjects, but it is not about Jackie's style.</span>

                    <span>I was attracted to this book by its feel and the promise of learning more about that certain "something" Jackie radiates. After mentally debating the price, my lust for more Jackie style information won out and I purchased it. It is a substantial book in many ways but weak in others. The beginning of the book is awkward as the author describes what Jackie was thinking after her husband won the Presidency. How could the author know? The authors assumptions immediately made me question the rest of the books authenticity. As I read through the book however, the author changed tactics and began to describe the first lady using research that was factually supported. She discusses Jackie's upbringing, her role as young woman, and beyond. Though most of the information has been written about before, several aspects were elaborated on to add a new twist and make them more interesting. For example, I had read many times about Jackie winning Vogue magazines Prix de Paris competition, but never in the detail Keough gives. There are a number of photographs in the book but unfortunatly the way they are presented lacks impact. Many are black and white, others small for the page, few are new, and in general they don't have the luster that they could. For example, p.182 has a full size, black and white photograph of Jackie with flowers fully covering her face. If this is one of the never seen photographs Keough promises well I can see why. Another page is devoted to a full color photo of Ari Onasis. Since the full color photos of Jackie are few why not make it one of her? Pamela Keoughs previous book Audrey Style had a much better selection of pictures that made an impression! There are also some line sketches of Jackie in a pillbox. The sketch looks more like Anjelica Houston. The information in the book is broad. The author has obviously done alot of research and she relays the information with her fresh perspective. But many readers will wish for more information about Jackie's STYLE not her life history. For those just beginning to read about Jackie this will be a good introduction but to those familiar with her and the books about her this will be a rehash and retelling.</span>

                    <span>Pam Keogh's clear and stunning portrait of Jackie Kennedy Onassis gives the reader aspects of this complex and intriguing woman from the inside out. It is a warm and visually beautiful view of JKO that goes beyond what she wore where. If you want a glimpse of the private Jackie, buy this book!</span>

                    <span>I am a voracious reader of all things biographical - memoirs, historical, famous people etc. This book struck me as suceeding on many levels: it is a respectful history of an American icon, it is a well-researched and thorough pictorial panorama of Jackie's life, and it is a fun romp through a period of our past with which, it is safe to say, many many people are still fascinated all these years later. Ms. Keogh has taken a subject well-known and certainly oft-discussed and written about and given it a fresh spin and a new approach. I greatly enjoyed every page of this book and will treasure it as a valuable addition to my library. Well done Ms. Keogh!!</span>

                    <span>I really liked the Audrey Hepburn book in this series and looked forward to the Jackie Kennedy book, but when I read it, I was annoyed by how shallow and trite it turned out to be. Where's the elegant Jackie Kennedy? The brave Jackie Kennedy? The STYLISH Jackie Kennedy? <P>The worst part were the stupid Jackie Kennedy Make Up tips that looked ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE HER.<P>A big ZERO in my book.</span>
