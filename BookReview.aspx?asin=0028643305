                    <span>I created my first and only  web site back in the days when all browsers were Netscape, all graphics jpg or gif, all coding html and all backgrounds medium gray. I was determined to design my own site and not be seduced by simplistic, pre-packaged templates, but I was intimidated by the possibility of getting buried under too much complex instruction. Macromedia's Dreamweaver and David Karlins Complete Idiot's Guide to Dreamwewaver MX sounded like just the ticket.  I was not disappointed.  David Karlins writes in an often humorous style that puts him right there with you, anticipating your next question or guiding you deftly around the pitfalls and frustrations.  This book is well written and informative.  It is obvious that Mr. Karlins has a great deal of experience teaching the subject and loves to teach.   A bonus that I hadn't expected was the fast and helpful email responses from the author on those few occasions I did get in a corner.  I highly recommend this book, and not just for the beginner.  It's just plain fun to read and use.</span>

                    <span>For the self-taught novice, Dreamweaver MX can be both delightfully user friendly and infuriatingly confusing.<br>Joining Macromedia's own MX manual, a number of other available MX user guides adorn my workstation shelves.<br>After a number of weeks trying to sort out the pros and cons of just when and how to use the FRAMES, TABLES AND LAYERS features, I had the good fortune to come upon David Karlins',blessedly clear explanations,in his "...Idiot's Guide...."  From my point of view, as a newbie designer, this work's enduring value is that, not only are the fundamentals clearly explained, but insights,tips, cautions and introductions to more advanced capabilities are included. He also presents important introductions to Macromedia's Fireworks and Flash interfaces. Read this first, then your owners manual.</span>
