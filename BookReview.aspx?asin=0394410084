                    <span>Percy Boomer will probably go down in the annals of golf history as the finest teacher in the history of the game. He does this by explaining the proper conception of the golf swing as one athletic movement, not a series of positions to reach as in modern instruction. Boomer had the benefit of NOT having stop motion photography and video cameras - instead, he explains that the movement of the golf swing is a swing in the strict definition of Ernest Jones: that the club should be moved in a centrifugal motion, through the proper use of the core (center) of the body. Much like a pitcher or batter in baseball, a discus thrower, the golf swing according to Boomer employs the same physics, as the body generates this centrifugal force and imparts maximum velocity and accuracy through the clubhead, as the hands and arms act only as connecting agents to the club. All motion below the waist is active, while all movement above the waist is passive, or responsive to the hips, knees and feet. Jones, Hogan, Sarazen, Snead, even Moe Norman, arguably the greatest ball striker in golf history, employ this motion. While none appear the same in terms of setup, posture, grip, etc, they all utilize the body to swing the clubhead - the dog wags the tail!<P>Boomer is the seminal voice in golf instruction history. Jimmy Ballard developed his theories with much from this book. Ballard even took the term "connection" from Boomer. David Leadbetter and his "dog wags the tail" concept, was directly taken from the pages of this book. Modern instruction however detailed, somehow fails where Boomer excels. Modern gurus believe in positional instruction: lag the clubhead, width at the top and through the swing, clughead leans forward at impact, hit down and through, etc. If the golfer uses the motion described in this book, guess what happens: every one of the aforementioned positions are achieved! Does anyone really think that Ernie or Jack or Tiger try to lag the clubhead and in the last instant, snap it through impact? Of course not, they instead have and do use the motion of their bodies to achieve the centrifugal motion. Centrifugal force is the most powerful force that can be used in the golf swing.<P>Buy this book and revel in its incredible ability to convey to the read the conception and feel of a centrifugal motion in a golf swing. You will not be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>This book will allow you to get the right conceptions for producing a good golf swing. And as Percy says, it is the swing rather than hitting the ball that is the thing. It is not a technical book but he does make technical points in it. Its key virtue is that it gets rid of several common misconceptions about how to swing a golf club. Percy's tone is absolutely wonderful and he has a nice sense of humor. It would have been a joy to experience his teachings in person. Buy the book, read it and then practice its concepts and you will find yourself capable of nailing every shot. Of course, the result is that golf becomes a very fun game again, as it should be. Best golf instruction book I have ever read and I have read a bunch, including Penick, Hogan, Armour, Leadbetter, Haney, Harmon, etc.</span>

                    <span>Of all the golf books I have read, and I have read over a hundred, this pearl has done the most to improve my game. I learned why standing on the practice mat trying to think through the swing did not improve my game. And I learned what had to be done to improve my game. My score, which had languished around 110, started dropping soon after I adopted Boomer's concepts. After three months, I am now in the low 90s to mid 80s and am still improving. Don't pass this gem by! Boomer was the Harvey Penick of an earlier generation and his ideas are still true.</span>

                    <span>To put it bluntly...Percey Boomer is God. Percey Boomer knows... but better yet Percy Boomer explains - perfectly...eloquently...amusingly...concisely.

The first lesson I had before I ever started playing was to read this book. In three months I broke 80. I still read this book.

If you understand what you're trying to do and you understand how to do it and you understand what it feels like when you're doing it right... Then you've read Percy Boomers - On Learning Golf</span>
