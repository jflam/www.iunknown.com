                <span id="Label1"><P> For generations of resolute adventurers, from George Mallory to Sir Edmund Hillary to Jon Krakauer, Mount Everest and the world's other greatest peaks have provided the ultimate testing ground. But the question remains: Why climb? In <I>High Exposure,</I> elite mountaineer and acclaimed <I>Everest</I> filmmaker David Breashears answers with an intimate and captivating look at his life.  <P> For Breashears, climbing has never been a question of risk taking: Rather, it is the pursuit of excellence and a quest for self-knowledge. Danger comes, he argues, when ambition blinds reason. The stories this world-class climber and great adventurer tells will surprise you -- from discussions of competitiveness on the heights to a frank description of the 1996 Everest tragedy.</span>

                    <span>High Exposure by David Breashear, is about his life experiences that indulged him into attempting and doing the impossible.  Breashear's passion for mountain climbing and hiking is described through his adventures in Colorado, Tibet and other parts of the world.  	<br>	Breasher's book is really good for people who are interested in reading inspirational books.  David describes how he pushed his mind, body, and soul to its limits through his hikes and climbs around the world.<br>	One thing about High Exposure that wasn't eye catching dealt with David's childhood and what influenced him to climb.  In his book he explains what made him develop a passion for climbing but with little detail.  It makes the reader wonder why didn't he use the amount of detail described in his experience across Tibet?  Overall the book was very motivational.  After reading the book, you'll just want to overcome any obstacle in life.</span>

                    <span>I was gripped by Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air and wanted another viewpoint on the 1996 tragedy.  There is a bit in here about that but it is mostly All About David -- the autobiography of an intensely self-focused individual.  When he meets his future wife, his thought is, "this is the perfect partner for me" -- and that, to me, says it all.  It is also poorly edited.  I do not recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>David Breashears writes a fascinating book on climbing that will appeal to those who climb, those who aspire to climb and those who live out their fantasies of climbing through others exploits.  The book outlines his background and growth as a climber and describes his love for the sport from the time of his youth.<p>He touches on many interesting aspects of various climbs he has made but they are better understood by reading the book rather than a review.<p>The best part of the book is the story of his climb of Everest for the IMAX film and his participation in the attempted rescue of the climbers stranded there in the disaster of 1996.  There are better books that describe the disaster itself (see Krakauer or Bokoreev for example).  But Breashears interest isn't in describing the events of the disaster as much as it is in trying to explain the desire to climb peaks like Everest while honoring those he knew who lost their lives in the disaster.  The tale is both fascinating and heart rending.  <p>This is a book that's hard to put down.  While it stands well on its own, a reader who enjoys the book should take a look at the film that came out of it (Everest can be found in IMAX - it's best version - but also in a very good video version) and follow up with two different views of the disaster by two people who lived it:  "Into Thin Air"  and "The Climb."</span>

                    <span>This is mostly an autobiography of David Breashears.  But since he was one of the rescuer in the 1996 accident, this book is also a very good first hand account of how that tragedy had came to be.  Personally I like this book very much, because Breashears' writing was very inspirational.  By examining his writing, one can't fail to notice that the author is a man with a genuine passion for the mountains; not to conquer them, but to be there.</span>
