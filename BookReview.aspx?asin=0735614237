                <span id="Label1"> This core reference demonstrates how to use ActiveX Data Objects.NET (ADO.NET) to access, sort, and manipulate data in enterprise-wide, Web-enabled applications. Readers learn best practices for writing, testing, and debugging database application code using the new tools and wizards in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET-with code on a companion CD, plus insider tips. The book also describes the ADO .NET object model, its XML features for Web extensibility, integration with Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and more. </span>

                    <span>Unlike other tomes I have used, you walk away understanding the underlying principles after using this book. It was proofread and the code samples actually work. Having the "book online" feature allows you to cut and paste the code into Visual Studio and run the snippets for better understanding of the concepts. This book is the first that I have encountered that is assembled in a logical order as well. You will be ready to do professional ADO.NET after going through this book if you understand either C# or VB.NET.</span>

                    <span>The book will definitely show the ins/outs of getting connected to databases. The samples in the book show you how to use the drag-n-drop objects as well as using only code to manage your database applications. Samples in book were very realistic and give you a complete view of what goes on with database applications. Each sample gives you code for both VB.Net and C# which is nice since I am also interested in learning C#. You pretty much get the code for both languages for the price of one book. If you are unsure of what book to buy, go to your local bookstore and look at the contents, then come back to the NET to make the discounted purchase. Why pay more in a store retail?...</span>

                    <span>After reading many tutorials and books on ADO.NET, I must say that this was the best one so far.
<br />Not only does it explain everything there is to know about ADO.NET, it does so in an entertaining and well presented manner.
<br />The code samples are in both VB.NET and C#, and above all, they are complete, or at least complete enough to understand without having to refer to the code samples on the CD.
<br />I was able to read and grasp the concepts explained in this book in less than a week.</span>

                    <span>I've read the reviews and the praises for this book and I want to believe them, but I could just never get into it. It's thick at about 700 pages and I couldn't get the flow of the book. I know that some will dismiss my evaluation as ametuer and that's OK. I hope that it works for you. I found Shawn Wildermuth's "Pragmatic ADO.NET" much more palletable. I am keeping this book around for reference though. From the look of the other reviews I have a feeling that all of the information is there and, now that I've had a primer from another book, it will be more digestable. </span>

Ancak kitap özellikle konuyu anlattýktan sonra baþvuru kýsmýnda bazen kodlarý tekrarlýyor. Yada anlattýðýnýn kalanýný bu kýsýmda veriyor. Bu biraz kafa karýþtýrýcý olabiliyor. Web kýsmýyla ilgili olan bölümleri biraz cýlýz bulsam da yeterli. Bu kitap da kaynak baþvuru olmayý hak eder kalitededir. Bence es geçmeyin.</span>
