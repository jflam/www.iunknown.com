                <span id="Label1">mod_perl embeds the popular programming language Perl in the Apache web server, giving rise to a fast and powerful web programming environment.  <i>Practical mod_perl</i> is the definitive book on how to use, optimize, and troubleshoot mod_perl.    New mod_perl users will learn how to quickly and easily get mod_perl compiled and installed. But the primary purpose of this book is to show you how to take full advantage of mod_perl: how to make a mod_perl-enabled Web site as fast, flexible, and easily-maintainable as possible.  The authors draw from their own personal experience in the field, as well as the combined experience of the mod_perl community, to present a rich and complete picture of how to set up and maintain a successful mod_perl site.  From writing and debugging scripts to keeping your server running without failures, the techniques in this book will help you squeeze every ounce of power out of your server.  True to its title, this is the practical guide to mod_perl.</span>

                    <span>At almost 900 pages, this is certainly the biggest book on mod_perl that has been published so far. In my opinion it's also one of the most useful.<P>Stas Bekman and Eric Cholet are two of the best-known and (probably more importantly) most respected names in the mod_perl community so you can be sure the the information you get in this book is going to be top quality.<P>Part 1 of the book is about mod_perl administration. It starts with an overview of what mod_perl is and how it relates to CGI and the Apache web server before going into a chapter which gives a quickstart guide to installing and using mod_perl on some of the most common platforms. Chapter three then goes back over the installation process in far more detail. Chapter four explains how to configure mod_perl in various ways and chapter five cover monitoring, upgrading and maintaining your mod_perl enabled web server. Chapter 6 is full of advice about how to write Perl code that takes advantage of mod_perl's features.<P>Part 2 is all about mod_perl performance and contains chapters about benchmarking and tuning your server. I found chapter twelve to be particularly useful as it discusses a number of useful strategies for splitting server load between a mod_perl server for dynmaic content and a "plain" (non-mod_perl) server for static content. Other chapters in this section cover other strategies for improving performance by tuning Apache's configuration, changing your Apache and mod_perl build options and being cleverer about the HTTP headers that you return.<P>Most dynamic web sites have a database involved somewhere so part 3 covers using databases with mod_perl. Part 4 is all about debugging and troubleshooting your mod_perl server. Finally, part 5 looks at what has changed with the release of the forthcoming mod_perl 2.0.<P>And this isn't just theoretical stuff. The two authors have been involved in developing mod_perl for a long time but they are also mod_perl users. You can just tell from the way they write that the problems they discuss are problems they have dealt with. This is the voice (or, rather, voices) of experience.<P>A lot of the text in the book is based on the mode_perl guide which has been available on the web for some time, but all of the content has been revisited, updated and expanded. This book is not really in competition with books like The mod_perl Developers Cookbook or the older Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C as those books largely concentrate on how to write code for mod_perl whereas the emphasis in this book is on configuring and administering a mod_perl server.<P>And if you are the administrator of a mod_perl server then you should really consider adding this book to your library.</span>

                    <span>Practical mod_perl is a doorstop sized volume that provides more information on using mod_perl than you ever thought you needed.<P>The almost 900 pages are divided into five parts and a bunch of appendices. Part I, "mod_perl Administration" covers building, configuring and installing mod_perl, followed by some Apache details and an 80-page guide to coding with mod_perl in mind. Part II, 'mod_perl Performance' deals with ways of getting the best out of Apache and mod_perl, with a little about security. Part III deals with databases, including persistent connections and data sharing. Part IV is a great guide to debugging and troubleshooting. Part V is a brief look at Apache 2 and mod_perl 2.<P>The appendices are useful. The first is a short section of around a dozen small 'recipes' for performing various tasks using mod_perl. I found these a good base for more complex tasks, particularly when combined with examples from elsewhere in the book. The second is a list of Perl modules that extend Apache and mod_perl with a brief description of each. The third gives some strategies for providers wanting to host Apache with mod_perl. The fourth and fifth give good overviews of the Template Toolkit and AxKit, an XML application server built on mod_perl.<P>The book is readable, tending towards heavy writing and certainly dense, but I didn't feel this was a problem in a book meant for a fairly advanced audience. I think you'd want to be a fairly good Perl programmer and well versed in Apache before needing this volume and shouldn't expect to be spoon fed. I thought it well written.<P>In a book of this size you expect to find a lot of example code, and you won't be disappointed. The book is peppered with short Perl examples and example command lines and configurations, all well explained. The one shortcoming is that there aren't many examples of full-blown applications where you can see everything discussed and have it explained all in one place. I would have appreciated some more of this, the examples tend to be on the short side.<P>This book sits well in the marketplace. It provides more details on running, installing and configuring mod_perl and Apache than mod_perl Developer's Cookbook (and also delves more into the reasons for doing something one particular way and much more help on debugging), though the Developer's Cookbookbecomes a good companion to this volume as it provides a lot more in the way of examples. For those that want to get deep into the high end of mod_perl there is Writing Apache Modules in Perl and C, which is at core a good book on high end mod_perl programming.<P>O'Reilly have their usual website with Table of Contents, an example chapter, and errata. The authors have their own website with some of the same information and all the code examples from the book as both individual files and one 40k tarball.<P>I would recommend this book to anyone who administers and writes for mod_perl, it fills the missing pieces in mod_perl Developers Cookbook and is a good companion volume to it.</span>

                    <span>I reserve 5 stars for really life changing books, but this one makes me want to bend my own rules. It's really a great book for anyone doing serious mod_perl work. Stas and Eric know mod_perl and pass along a ton of great information.<P>This book is sitting by my desk side as I port an existing web based application from traditional Perl to mod_perl. I know I'll be diving back into it frequently. Whether you're getting ready to use mod_perl, or already using it, I'd heartily recommend this book for everyone on your team.</span>
