                    <span>All I can say is that I totally agree with Kevin Towes. Anyone who feels that there is another book out at the moment that is better than this could be the reason why there aren't any inspirational FlashCom work out there. This is the foundation. Nothing else compares with it. Forget about the typos and work to make the projects in the book work for you. I have, so there is no excuse. Great work Kevin!</span>

                    <span>Don't believe the 5-star hype above about this book.  I bought this book since it was the *only* source on flashcom and unfortunatly it currently still is.  The code and examples presented are very rocky, full of errors and difficult to understand.  I just about gotten half way through the book and I am utterly disgusted.  Even though it may fill in a few blanks about flashcom, the fustration, confusion and frankly the price of the book is just not worth it.<p>I feel foolish as I figured since I am a 7 year veteran of Flash and have extensive programming experience that I could hack through this book even though it had poor reviews.  I thought perhaps it may be of some value to my study of flashcom.  Boy was I wrong, its not even a decent reference.<p>Don't support incompetent authors/publishers by shelling out your money for this one.</span>

                    <span>This book represents Flash Communication Server MX version 1.0.  Currently version 1.5 is available, with new Flash UI Components.  There are significant changes to some of the ActionScript and components from version 1.0 to version 1.5. These changes may cause the code examples in the book to fail. Please review the release notes from Macromedia if you are having problems with the exercises.<p>There are updates (errata) and free code samples on the book website: http://flashcom.pangaeanewmedia.ca.  Flash Communication Server MX is a complicated product with a lot of moving parts.  I strongly recommend downloading the chapter examples, and installing them on your computer as you follow through the book.<p>Flash Communication Server MX is a powerful product, and this book will help you get the foundation you need to build incredible video conferencing, messaging and always-on applications using the Flash player.</span>

                    <span>Because this book, for the time being anyway, was essentailly my only option, I bought it.  If you have any programming experience what so ever - especially any experience programming ActionScript, you will find this book tedious, repetative and slow moving.  It tends to repeat itself every couple of pages and provide no truly useful figures or images, but is chock full of erroneous code and typos.  I'm looking forward to replacing this book as soon a a new one on the topic can be found, and I would suggest it ONLY if you truly need some reference material on FlashComm now.</span>

                    <span>I had high hopes for this book especially since Jeremy Allaire wrote the foreword. What I discovered was that I had just bought a book that is FULL of errors. I was unable to get ANY sample application to work that required actionscripting. For days I couldn't figure out what was going on until I realized that the examples are simply poorly written.<p>Some chapters, like Chapter 9 on creating a presentation application are completely wrong. Kevin Towes wasn't able to even spellcheck his code so you find references such as - root.mymovieclip - or rtmp:\\localhost.<p>The companion website is just as frustrating. It's difficult to figure out how to dowload sample scripts and when you do the folder structure just doesn't make sense. Even after downloading the completely rewritten version on the app in Chapter 9 it wasn't working.<p>You will also notice that the book references version 1.0 and NOT 1.5 of FlashComm Server. The changes are minimal but some components have changed since then. The only way you find out is by trial and error. <p>Since it's mostly error I want my money back. Don't waste yours. It's not worth it.</span>
