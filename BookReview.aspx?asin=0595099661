                    <span>I felt compelled to add this review after seeing the book get five stars and one star and no review really providing a fair summary.  This book is fairly advanced and has alot of great information in it and as someone states elsewhere is the only place where you can find information on the water placement that is in english. But this book is brief on explanations. Without some prior background readers will have a tough time figuring it out. But if you first read a book which provides a sound basis in nine flying star such as eva wong's book "a master's course in feng shui", or lillian too's book "nine flying star feng shui", or the complete idiot's guide, then you can read this book and put it to good use.</span>

                    <span>This book is an ultimate manual for flying star feng shui practitioners.  It is concise and explains only things necessary for practicing flying star feng shui.  I am always carrying this book whenever I visit my clients.  I am definitely recommending this excellent manual to every flying star practioner.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book on classical Feng Shui that includes advance knowledge, in addition to a comphrehensive Flying Stars system, this is the only book I have seen that includes the following classic Water Dragon methods:<p>Ling Shen<br>Zhao Shen<br>He Tu Castle Gate<br>Castle Gate<br>Water and Mountain Fan Gua<br>Fan Gua Five Ghosts Carry Money<br>Peach Blossom<p>Save yourself hundreds or thousands of dollars attending workshops to get some of this information; for $14.95 it is the bargain of the century.<p>Thank you Mr. Twicken for revealing this important Feng Shui knowledge, I have studied with people for years and never got this information.</span>

                    <span>No history, no explanation, miniscule background, and there are some truly glaring errors. Must have been written from notes, which explains the jumpy editing and the problems with some of the calculations and theories. There are better sources for Xuan Kong calculations than this book (try Eva Wong or "Complete Idiot's Guide") and they don't mess up their math.</span>

                    <span>The best book on "traditional" Flying Stars Feng Shui. After reading this book it is clear traditional feng shui is different than the other styles that are predominant in the market. <p>This book presents the entire foundation of Flying Stars with complete charts for all cycles and 24 mountains and special prosperity charts. I feel now I have learned authentic traditional feng shui, I even emailed the author with a few questions and he resonded with detailed answers the same day!<p>Among over 300 books in the market on feng shui, this is a gem, simply the best on Tradional Flying Stars Feng Shui! If you are looking for a quick feng shui fix, this book is not for you. If you are serious about learning the most popular form of feng shui practioned in asia, this book is a must.<p>Thanks Mr. Twicken for revealing this ancient and powerful form of Feng Shui!</span>
