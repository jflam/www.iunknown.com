                <span id="Label1">Bobby Jobe is a pro golfer whose swing is better than his attitude. When he bogies the last four holes and blows his lead in a major tournament -- again -- he berates his caddy, Henry "Greyhound" Mote. Jobe loses both Greyhound, who walks off the course, and the game. And before the day is out, he'll lose his eyesight to a lightning strike and his future in golf -- unless he can do what no one has ever done blind: make a comeback. Bob Cullen's funny and wise story, full of PGA lore, perfectly captures the mysterious and irresistible nature of the game of golf, not to mention, love, friendship, and life. </p></span>

                    <span>I'll be honest, I don't like fiction books. But I've got to tell you, A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe has changed my mind. Mr. Cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place. The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience. You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel. Can lightning strike twice? Absolutely!</span>

                    <span>I hesitated to begin this book, since I know nothing of golf and suspected it would be full of golf jargon I would have a difficult time deciphering. I was right, but the author so splendidly weaves a touching tale around the golf, that I fell in love with the story almost right away. Bobby Jobe is a professional golf player, playing the PGA tournament one day and being a pompous jerk to his caddie as usual, when suddenly a tragedy turns Bobby completely around. It doesn't help his caddie however, whom he calls "Greyhound" and whom he initially blames for the tragedy. "Greyhound" is actually our hero in this book and he is a figure to be reckoned with. He is as real and as life-like as an author can make a character, and he is also lovable and a great golf caddie. His real name is Henry Mote, he initially caddies for the arrogant and abrasive Bobby Jobe, until that one moment in time when a tragedy changes them both forever. The tides get reversed, and Henry finds himself in an awkward situation when he is asked to once again caddie for Bobby Jobe, but in a very different capacity. This book has everything you need for a great escape, buy it today!</span>

                    <span>If you're like me and don't know a birdie from an eagle, you'll still enjoy this book. The characters are strong and the tale is not so much about golf as it is about losing and finding yourself. You may find yourself skimming through the intense golf-related stuff, but you'll probably be casting it as you read it, as I did!</span>

                    <span>I really thought this was a great book. True, as some reviewers have noted, the plot itself is a little predictable, though well constructed. But the value is not in where you go, but in how you get there. This book has so much insight into the game of golf and the world of professional golf that it more than makes up for any picky plot shots. I enjoyed it thoroughly, great character development as well. I put it ahead of the Dan Jenkins book by about 325 yards.</span>
