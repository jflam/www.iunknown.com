                    <span>It is sometimes difficult to find a reason to laugh in these days of corporate and government corruption, but at least there are a few rays of laughter, including this short book of short poems.  Mr. Trillin aims his barbs at Cheney's greed, Bush's (toughest hombre ever hid in the Guard) low IQ, Rove, Delay, war, fundamentalists and political campaigns, and the poems are insightful and sharp.  There are even a few sea chanteys (Let's Heave Ho Toward the Center, Lads)!, and sometimes the titles are the real punch line, as in "On the Bush Administration's Reversal of the Announcement that Testing School Lunch Meat for Salmonella Would No Longer Be Required" or "Richard Perle: Whose Fault Is He?", which ends :
<br />
<br />"And he's got planes and ships and tanks and guns--
<br />All manned, of course, by other people's sons."
<br />
<br />The title comes from the first rhyme of the book, 
<br />
<br />"Obliviousy on he sails,
<br /> With marks not quite as good as Quayle's"
<br />
<br />I thought the most biting was this one, called "A Silver Lining View of George Bush's Not Attending Military Funerals, Lest He Become Associated with Bad News":
<br />
<br />"At least there's no Bush eulogy
<br />On why they had to die.
<br />It's better that they're laid to rest
<br />Without another lie."
<br />
<br />Fine, satirical poems with a liberal/moral/rational bias.</span>

                    <span>If you haven't read Calvin Trillin before, it's about time you got started!  We are lucky enough to be living at the same time as this comic genius, and any one of us who does not take advantage of reading his hilarious & intelligent creations, is just... well... missing out.  
<br />Even if you love our current administration, you're gonna laugh.  If you don't laugh, well,  too bad for you.
<br />This book is funny!  Buy it! & while you're at it, don't forget all the Trillin masterpieces!  If you own a car in nyc, check out Tepper!!!! Thank you Mr. Trillin, for more giggles!

                    <span>Political verse is much like political cartooning: both require trimming complex ideas into a few small, deft strokes.
<br />
<br />In this short yet pungent book, Calvin Trillin has distilled the essence of the foibles and failings of the Bush II administration. Trillin has reworked Broadway show tunes, Gilbert & Sullivan lyrics, sea chanties, Irish songs and all manner of doggerel to lampoon the follies of the Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft. A sample:
<br />
<br />A Two-Pronged Approach to the Afghan People
<br />By night our missiles rain on them, 
<br />By day we drop them bread. 
<br />They should be grateful for the food- 
<br />Unless, of course, they're dead.
<br />
<br />That says as much about the irony of situation or Afghans as any 200-page policy analysis. While there is little new here for those who already dislike Bush, at least Trillin says it with craft and ingenuity.

                    <span>There once was a man named Trillin
<br />Who's poems and books made a killin'
<br />He sang to the choir
<br />And swung on a wire
<br />As the Liberals his poison were swillin'
<br />
<br />Trillin told his stories in rhyme
<br />He cooked tales spicier than thyme
<br />The Libs would guffaw
<br />'Til their knees were so raw
<br />From rolling around in the grime
<br />
<br />But the Truth had it in for old Cal
<br />'Cuz Trillin was never Truth's pal
<br />Will Cal take a tumble
<br />When he and Truth rumble?
<br />Yeppers he will, I know he shall

                    <span>With all the books out on Kerry and Bush and yada, yada, yada, I was so glad to see one that actually made me laugh.  Man, will I be glad when this election is over so we can all get back to living!  <p>OBLIVIOUSLY ON HE SAILS is a funny, funny book, and not at all mean-spirited as I thought it would be.  It's the way we, as a country, USED to look at candidates and poke fun--not in a scathing way, but in a way that was both humorous and enlightening.  <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this clever romp and hope you will too-regardless of your political persuasion.<p>Also read two other very good books recently, neither of which (thank God) has anything to do with politics:  TEN BIG ONES was the first, and the second was THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD.</span>
