                    <span>"Closer" is the story of two couples--Dan & Alice and Anna & Larry. Dan (Jude Law), a journalist who writes obituaries meets Alice (Natalie Portman), a transplanted stripper from New York when she's involved in a car accident. They strike up a relationship and move in together. Dan is attracted to professional photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), and she meets dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) as a result of a prank arranged by Dan. "Closer" charts these four people at crucial moments over a period of years, and explores how infidelity permanently affects their relationships. 
<br />
<br />"Closer" begins as a gooey boy-meets-girl romance, but then quickly slides into a much darker, and more interesting film that explores the nasty side of human motivation. Dan indulges in infidelity with a standard approach, and his affair with Anna follows a rather typical pattern of deceit and subterfuge. Dan, however, fails to understand Larry's incredibly complex character--for Larry is a man with hidden depths and strengths. While many films focus on the subject of infidelity by narrowing the topic to the discovery, and subsequent fallout, "Closer" takes a much bolder approach. Larry understands the power and permanent pain one can cause by a well-timed confession lobbed correctly. Larry uses infidelity as a weapon and as a strength. In an ordinary drama, Larry could be scripted to be the cuckold, but instead, he becomes the puppet master. Clive Owens as Larry delivers an incredible performance. As a fan, it's gratifying to see him in a role that allows him to flex his skills. Owens' performance of Larry--the true Nietzschean hero is phenomenal--displacedhuman</span>

                    <span>I'd give this five stars, but although I play a cynic on TV, I'm actually a gushy romantic...and this movie is many things, but romantic? Not one of them.
<br />
<br />That being said, there's a lot of good things going on here. The cast, in addition to being overwhelming beautiful, is really spot-on. Natalie Portman steals the show, but all of the four leads  inhabit their characters with force.
<br />
<br />The story is every bit, or even more, subversive than you might think, and I loved that. It was somewhat over-the-top...but not really. Real life, oftentimes, is darker and crazier and more painful than most films are willing to portray. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to go there.</span>

                    <span>I think everyone should see this movie at least once since the character studies are at least partway interesting even if the characters never grow or display soul and passion but I certainly would not buy this on dvd. It is a pretentious, "arthouse" drama that gives one a good lesson on what sort of people to avoid when looking for love. All four characters are hateful, aimless, passionless, spiteful and pathetically immature, so much so that it gave me a headache. The dialogue is a little too, too....proper? No one speaks the way these people do in real life. And only idiots would continually hurt each other among the same stale group of people over and over again with constant deception, lies, infidelities and viciousness. Natalie Portman's character, interestingly the youngest one, seems to be the only one that outgrew the circle of stupidity in the end. The only really interesting character was Clive Owens character. His phisical presence, raw maleness, honesty and emotional brutality stood out like a shining light in an otherwise dismal and pointless film.</span>

                    <span>The 4 central characters are well played esp. Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, but this film just goes way over the top, opting for cheap fireworks instead of more examined fullness.  Way too many melodramatic reversals, too many histrionic fits and staged confrontations between the characters, until finally it just becomes repetitive and dull.  
<br />
<br />The language is raw yes, but if you mind hey that's how most people talk under stress so grow up and get used to it.
<br />
<br />Julia Roberts does have probably the most "real" role of her career as opposed to her usual Barbie doll roles (excepting "Erin Brockovich"), but Jude Law and Natalie Portman are doing their usual familiar bits here, nothing remarkable.  Clive Owen egregiously overacts in the Al Pacino style but he's still fun to watch, like Pacino. 
<br />
<br />Oh well, this still beats the pulp on TV at least.</span>
