                    <span>We all pretty much agree that the book is rather thin and covers topics in a very minimal and thin way, but after all, we were going to get our free 15 % off on the test. <p>I went to vue.com, after buying the book, signed up for the exam and just when i put in the voucher code a nice message came up:<br>" This promotion is VALID TIL 31 / 2003".<p>Great job!<p>I don't recomed this book simply cause you can buy something better, covering all topics extensivly and in details. <br>PLUS THE DISCOUNT ON THE TEST IS NO LONGER VALID!</span>

                    <span>i just passed the test. well, as mentioned in other reviews, you need more than this book. and yes, the book is too thin.<p>however, this book will give you a taste of the questions for the exam, the overall difficulties of the review questions is somewhat similar to the ones in the exam.<p>afterall, its free if u are planning to take the exam coz it gives you 15% off the exam fee. so why not buying it??</span>

                    <span>Hi all, M Sunil a form INDIA seeing the previous reviews i was under impression that this was a blind date. the following were the + and - points<br> + point:<br>This book gives very much information how the exam is conducted sample questions give a great moral support. As the Certificaton exam is pretty expencive here. it can be very good for begiuners too. If u r in flash designing form more than an yerr i tink this book is enough (it will be the practical experiance which will help u the most) <p>- point:<br>The book is too thin for the cost.But its also correct that "the matter matters the most".<p>The courier charges from US to IND were more than the book cost.<p>It does not give additional costing info. abt timings and cost excemption for non-US people.</span>
