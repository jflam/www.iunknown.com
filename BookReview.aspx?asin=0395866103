                    <span>I thought that the Donner Party was a very interesting book.  It's one of those books that you can't put down because you keep wanting to see what is going to happen next.  The author, Marian Calabro, was very descriptive and made the book which could have been very boring, was actually very interesting and exciting to read.  I know that when I read it I felt like I was there with Virgina Reed and the rest of the Donner Party.  I believe that even if you aren't that interested in pioneers and such you will enjoy this book.  However I will have to admit it was depressing in parts and it is definetly not an uplifting book.  How ever it also will make you admire the strenght the Donner Party had to get throught there hardships and struggles they had to endure. The book also has lots of extra information in the back and it has special features like Virgina Reed's diary and The chronilogical order of how the events took place.

                    <span>This book was amazing! There was so much information inlcuding speech from a survivor Virgina Reed. I really enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down. The detail and everything was incredible and it made me want to learn more! A great 'reed'!</span>

                    <span>The Donner Party is a story about a group heading to California in April, 1846. However, bad decisions and trickery lead them to the point of starvation. To survive, they must eat those that have died along the way.<p>The Donner Party is the most exciting nonfiction book I've rea, written not as a documentary or research thing, but as an adventure story. It is, however, hard to imagine this actually happening because it seams so much like fiction. It is also written in a way that all the families, excluding the main family, the Reeds, are shoved way into the backround and seem to barely exist.<p>I recommend this book to those that don't mind lengthy stories and the overall concept of the book. It may also work well as something to help a report or something, having all the information right there in an easier-to-read way than most forms of research. I'd recommend this book for ages 12 and higher, because of the way it is written and it's length.</span>

                    <span>I'm not much of a history buff, but I have to teach my kids CA history this year.  Once I started reading this book it was hard to put down.  The thing that surprised me the most was how thoroughly readable it is.  I didn't feel like I was reading a history textbook. The prose is well done, there are ample photos of the people involved and artifacts etc.,.. The only thing I would improve would be to include maybe one more map. But that isn't even worth complaining about. This book covers a gruesome and sad event in American history without being overly maudlin, grotesque or judgemental. Despite the elementary looking artwork on the front, it's not a book for children.</span>

                    <span>You think you've had "trubels"?  Wait until you read this book.  This story details the journey of several families, known as the Donner Party, as they travel from Springfield, Illinois to Sutter's Fort,  California in the Spring of 1846.  The author tells the story through the  eyes of the children, detailing Virginia Reed's recording of the journey.   This is a gripping story of the unbelievable determination of survival.   The book is loaded with authentic pictures and diary entries.  You won't  believe the sacrifices these people made to settle unknown land in America.   A great piece of historical work!</span>
