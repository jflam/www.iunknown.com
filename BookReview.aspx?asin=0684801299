                <span id="Label1"><p> His second major venture into nonfiction (after <I>Death in the Afternoon,</I> 1932), <I>Green Hills of Africa</I> is Ernest Hemingway's lyrical journal of a month on safari in the great game country of East Africa, where he and his wife Pauline journeyed in December of 1933. Hemingway's well-known interest in -- and fascination with -- big-game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative account of his trip. In examining the poetic grace of the chase, and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway also looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. Yet <I>Green Hills of Africa</I> is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape, and of the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man. <p> Hemingway's rich description of the beauty and strangeness of the land and his passion for the sport of hunting combine to give <I>Green Hills of Africa</I> the freshness and immediacy of a deeply felt personal experience that is the hallmark of the greatest travel writing.</span>

                    <span>Hem is hunting both big game and big literature in "Green Hills." On this 1933-34 African safari, his jovial, Socratic drinking pal "Pop" is actually Phillip Percival the famous white hunter who conducted Theodore Roosevelt on his first African safari. As a young man, Hemingway owned a copy of TR's book "African Game Trails," and it is undoubtedly one of the reasons he went on this safari, which was financed to the tune of $25,000 Depression dollars by his wife Pauline's uncle Gus, part owner of Richard Hudnut cosmetics. Further evidence of Hem's fascination with Africa can be seen in the way Jake Barnes teases Robert Cohn in "The Sun Also Rises." In chapter two, Jake says, " Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?" Cohn's lack of enthusiasm for an immediate trek to Mombassa seals his fate as a jerk. "Green Hills" vindicates Hem's real aficion for hunting--filled with long descriptions of the arduous and sometimes futile tracking of game, not just celebratory "kills." Finally, the best preparation for reading "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is to hike and sweat through these 300 pages of African "country." The long, crescent-horned sable which Hem was painstakingly stalking at the end of "Green Hills" never turned up. But instead, the experience of his African safari, was distilled into those two incredible stories--one about a coward who gets a chance to redeem himself and the other about a washed-up writer whose approaching death stimulates him to dream about--and the reader to enjoy--the fiction he never got to actually write. Unless you've got a rich uncle or wife, this is as close as you'll get to an East African safari, and it is very, very fine.</span>

                    <span>"Green Hills of Africa" was Hemingway's first non-fiction book, written after a 1933 trip to Eastern Africa (Kenya, Tanzania). It went a long way in establishing Hemingway's reputation as a hunter and adventurer. Though non-fiction it has the organization of a Hemingway novel and reads much like his other works. His descriptions of the landscape, local people, other hunters, and especially animals, hunting, and killing are superb. Hemingway also shares, mostly as dialogue, his thoughts on life, war, fate, and notably literature and the literary life. His often-quoted idea of all American literature being descended from one book by Mark Twain is presented here, as are his thoughts on how America destroys its writers. Some knowledge of Eastern Africa (such as a basic history, a guidebook, an encyclopedia article) might be useful as Hemingway often does provide much introductory material. With "Green Hills of Africa" Hemingway follows in the footsteps of Theodore Roosevelt's "African Game Trails"; both did much to popularize among Americans the idea of recreational travel in Africa. Hemingway went on to write two fictional stories set in Africa: "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber". A good book, moreso for fans of Papa and those with an interest in Africa.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Safe to say this "nonfiction novel" hasn't aged well. Boozy banter from Westerners who view Africa -- its wildlife, its people -- from within a gauzy cocoon of privilege. Ernest & co. chase down majestic animals, admire them and blast away at them with shotguns. I found the descriptions of animals madly circling once shot -- desperately, futile-ly fleeing a danger they can't possibly comprehend -- profoundly sad. I had the sense the narrative was aiming for (and probably achieving for its original audience) a breezy, witty, urbane tone. It seemed to me in 2004 like so much reveling in privilege, power and manly pseudo-attainment.<P>On the other hand, there's no way Hemingway could have portrayed himself, knowing full well that he would come across in certain passages like an egomaniac and a bully, without a great writer's ability to stand apart. He also explores the code of ethics within hunting -- the hunters' intense aversion to shooting females or young, or wasting meat. And his use of this English language is interesting and shot through with passion.<P>But having said all that: read something else.</span>

                    <span>Hemingway takes a trek through an Africa still largely ruled by "burdoned" white men. He tries to explain why assaulting the native creatures of the dark continent is acceptable (he ate what he killed after all!) But the most intriguing parts of "Green Hills" were not stalking wildlife through tall grass. Rather, Hemingway's most poignant recollections lie in describing the interpersonal relations, the ups and downs, between American and European hunters. <P>Throughout the entire quest for game, Papa stresses that time is limited by an impending rainy season as well as available funds. He goes on then to remark that hunters are not the only people whose life plans are upset by capitalism. He points out that artists and writers also fall victim to a world whose interpersonal works ravage most of us.</span>

                    <span>It is difficult to recommend this book in this day and age. I have always found Hemingway a bit self-centered, and he seems to me lacking any form of compassion. The hunting for trophies is the focus of this volume, and it is intent on describing the killing of wild animals, although in the classic Hemingway style, of course. But that does not help. It is still a horrific sport to kill for enjoyment. ...</span>
