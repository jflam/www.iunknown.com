                <span id="Label1">"A classic [that] covers superbly a whole era...Engrossing in its glittering gallery of characters."<br>CHICAGO SUN-TIMES<br>Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Robert K. Massie has written a richly textured and gripping chronicle of the personal and national rivalries that led to the twentieth century's first great arms race. Massie brings to vivid life, such historical figures as the single-minded Admiral von Tirpitz, the young, ambitious, Winston Churchill, the ruthless, sycophantic Chancellor Bernhard von Bulow, and many others. Their story, and the story of the era, filled with misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and events leading to unintended conclusions, unfolds like a Greek tratedy in his powerful narrative. Intimately human and dramatic, DREADNOUGHT is history at its most riveting.<br></span>

                    <span>Dreadnought is a very big book about a very big subject, the origins of World War I. The consequences of which were, needless to say, complicated and diverse for the road to the great war can never really be exactly determined. For example, a plausible argument may be made that the seeds of WWI were laid when the Roman Empire ended some 1,500 years ago.<P>(The origins of World War II, in contrast, are somewhat less complicated- the Treaty of Versailles being the predominate cause of the greatest war mankind has ever fought.)<P>Author Robert Massie tries, and generally succeeds, in telling us about the events and personalities that precipitated the conflict. The isolationism of Great Britain, the rise of Imperial Germany, the ins and outs of pre-war British politics, etc. The heart of the book is Massie's description of the Dreadnought program- the brainchild of Admiral Jack Fisher -which was an attempt to build a battleship that would revolutionize naval combat and keep England safe from invasion. Instead, the Dreadnought kicked off an arms race between England and Germany that contributed mightily to WWI. <P>Massie is, to say the least, a through historian. Everything is in here that could have played even the slightest role in bringing about the conflict. One senses that there is indeed too much information here. How important really was the political dispute over Imperial Preference, a proposal which would have given tariff preferences to British colonies over other imports, to the causing of the First World War? It is a fascinating tale, perhaps worthy of its own book, but hardly of great consequence here.<P>However, one cannot fault Massies thoroughness or prose, for Dreadnought is a readable book that is probably the definitive work on the cause of the First World War. Outstanding. A book that any student of history can be very enthusiastic about.</span>

                    <span>Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War examines the first arms race of the twentieth century, that of the modern battleship. Robert Massie lays out the development of the Dreadnought-class battleship and its implications, beginning with Queen Victoria's ascension to the throne and ending with the declaration of World War I. The focus is on the monarchies and constitutional governments, and the book closes with the sequence of declarations of general European war in the summer of 1914.<P>Interestingly, the book does so from a biographical perspective. Virtually every word is focused on giving the reader a clear picture of the personalities involved, from the Queen herself to Kaiser Wilhelm (referred to unfailingly as William in the book), from Cecil Rhodes to Prince Bismarck. This makes the book somewhat more readable, but leaves the reader with the impression that the arms race (and thus the War) is entirely due to individual personalities. Very little time or attention is given to broader social developments, reducing the citizenry of each nation to little more than observers, often even less given the secrecy behind many of the developments.<P>Kaiser Wilhelm is especially closely considered, making it clear that, at least in part, his own inferiority complex and vacillation between Anglophilia and Anglophobia led to Germany's near-inexorable march towards war. At times, he desired nothing more than the acceptance and respect of his grandmother and uncle (Victoria and Edward VII); at others, he would repudiate any possible tempering influence they might have had. After Bismarck, one chancellor after another rotated through the government, serving at the Emperor's pleasure (due to Bismarck's design in the constitution). Still, the volatile Emperor was occasionally easily manipulated by experienced politicians without realizing it. In most cases, this maintained peace and allowed the danger of war to pass.<P>Particular attention is also given to Admiral Jacky Fisher, whose reforms in the British Navy at the close of its heyday are still seen in modern navies all over the world. During the great sail-to-steam conversion, it was his focus on gunnery and simulation of wartime situations that kept his Navy at the top of the game. Realizing the importance of speed in naval operations, he continued to push for steam vessels even when this was still controversial. The development of the modern battleship is due in large part to his driving force, constantly seeking to defend his island nation.<P>Dreadnought does a fine job of illustrating the developments, both military and political, that led to the declaration of one of the most important wars of the last century, little-discussed though it may be. While Dreadnought spends practically no time on the war itself, gaining familiarity with this era of history leads to a sense of sadness at the loss of the world's innocence nearly one hundred years ago.</span>

                    <span>Despite the grand title, "Dreadnought" is not a maritime shoot-'em-up in the grand tradition of naval battles. The book's prologue, however, is about the battle of Trafalgar, the most significant naval confrontation of the nineteenth century, and thus sets the stage for the book's theme: maintaining Britain's mastery of the oceans at a time when Germany, the emerging economic center of gravity of the Continent, was beginning to establish an aggressive colonial policy. <P>This book should not be read solely to gain some insight about the battleship Dreadnought. Naval enthusiasts may be slightly disappointed because of the paucity of ship photographs and the relative deficiency of discussion regarding German naval matters. This colossal volume is, to a significant extent, about the building of the Dreadnought and the Anglo-German naval arms race. But most of the book is devoted to Machiavellian machinations among the major European and British players at the turn of the twentieth century. The crescendo of events leading to the Great War is made more accessible to the layman through biographical vignettes of the major personalities that shaped Continental and British diplomacy and public policy at the time.<P>The story begins four decades before the Great War. Bismarck, the Prussian premier whose politics were partly shaped by the events of 1848, initiated three wars--against Denmark in 1864, against Austria in 1866 and against France in 1870--with one ultimate objective in mind: German unification. Unification under the Prussian aegis set the stage for the 'conservative modernization' of the German state. In turn, rapid industrialization allowed for the establishment of a robust military-industrial complex and facilitated a shift toward overseas adventurism. The rising economic might of the Empire would allow Kaiser William II to argue for Germany's "place under the sun"--and set her on a collision course with Britain.<P>The appearance of Mahan's book "The Influence of Sea Power Upon History" challenged accepted wisdom about the role of a navy in national affairs. Mahan argued that domination of the seas would be highly critical to national welfare. Given this impetus, the two major powers, Germany and Britain, began a naval buildup which would see the emergence of HMS Dreadnought. <P>Unfortunately for Europe, the arms race coincided with several diplomatic gaffes, regional conflicts, and errors of judgment: the expiration of Bismarck's Reinsurance Treaty with Russia; the 1905 Tangier crisis over Morocco's ties with France; the Russo-Japanese war; the Daily Telegraph affair; the 1911 Agadir crisis; and so on. Massie discusses all of these discordant, inauspicious events with all of the panache of a cinematic auteur. A front seat to the drama is provided for, and the thoughts and motivations of the various dramatis personae are laid out.<P>In view of the climate of distrust and the preponderance of secret alliances, all it would take to ignite this powder keg and usher in a conflict of a global scale would be a tiny spark. Bismarck himself foresaw that the struggle will begin in eastern Europe. Admiral Fisher, who oversaw the creation of HMS Dreadnought, was no less prescient: he predicted that the world war would begin in 1914 upon completion of the expansion of the Kiel Canal.<P>Was the First World War was an inexorable, Manichaean contest between democracy and autocracy? The book certainly gives the impression that, given the unique combination of personalities in the world stage at the time, and in view of the circumstances, a Great War was unavoidable. Austria's resolve to conduct a preemptive war against Serbia for its pan-Slavic nationalism, France's decisive defeat in the Franco-Prussian war which led to revanchism against Germany, Germany's professed entitlement to "a place under the sun," and Russia's aversion to intimidation and humiliation following its 1905 defeat in Asia all precluded a limited conflict.<P>This book is a magnificent jump-off point for a reexamination of the causes of World War One. Massie is indeed a fine writer, and I look forward to reading his account of the battle of Jutland, which Admiral Fisher termed "the battle of Armageddon," in "Castles of Steel."</span>

                    <span>Like my title suggests, the book was a very long one [908 pages in my copy]. Even so, I could not put it down. It was very well written and there were numerous pictures. Massie even included many quotes and letters, diary entries, and the like. I especially liked how he divided the book into a British section and a German one. All in all, if one is interested in this type of book, I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I recieved this book as a birthday gift from a friend of mine whose taste I trust when it comes to history. However, I had my doubts about the entertainment value of a subject as dry as the pre-WWI naval buildup between Britian and Germany.<P>Nonetheless, Massie's ability to take the reader inside the halls of power and to introduce an intimate portrait of the major players makes this read as fascinating as any Clancy novel.</span>
