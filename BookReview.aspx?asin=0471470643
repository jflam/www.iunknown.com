For the benefit of instructors, we have collected some exercises and datasets that can be used in the classroom or for self study.

                    <span>Data mining is such a simple thing that you wonder why more companies don't do a better job of mining their own data sitting on their own hard disks.  
<br />
<br />If a customer buys the first in a series of mystery novels, who better to send a note telling him that the second book is now available. That's the essence of data mining. This would allow you to get a much higher return on your mailing, saving money and increasing return on your marketing. 
<br />
<br />This is one of those books that you need to read every few months. Each time you go through it you will find some idea that will enable you to get more out of your data. It isn't a book heavy on programming, but on the concepts that have worked for others. 
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.

                    <span>This book is very difficult to read. The authors say very little in hundreds of pages. I was looking for more content. The data mining techniques are explained in detail, but they are very difficult to understand. Perhaps this could also be because I am new to data mining. This is definitely not a book for someone looking for a quick introduction to data mining.</span>
