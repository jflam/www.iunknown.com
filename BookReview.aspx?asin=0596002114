                <span id="Label1">MySQL is a popular open source database product that supports key  subsets of SQL on Linux and Unix systems. If you want to build  database-backed web pages or other database applications, <i>Managing  & Using MySQL</i>, 2nd Edition has everything you need to get started.    It takes you through the whole process from installation and configuration  to programming interfaces and database administration. Also included is an  introduction to SQL and to relational databases. This second edition has a  greatly enhanced administration chapter, and new chapters on security and  extending MySQL. Ample tutorial material is included throughout.   <i>Managing & Using MySQL</i>, 2nd Edition contains chapters on the  programming language interfaces for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python, and PHP,  as well as a complete reference section with specific function calls for  each language.  The reference section also includes details of the SQL language, as well  as MySQL system variables, programs, and utilities. New to the second  edition is a reference chapter describing the internal MySQL tables.</span>

                    <span>I generally love the O'Reilly books because they tend to be very thorough and have lots of practical code examples, but this book was a big disappointment to me. I was easily frustrated by this book. As a beginner to MySQL and database programming, I was completely lost whenever I tried to apply something to my own projects. The explanations given here are very brief and the authors often send you elsewhere for more in-depth discussion. I wound up doing most of my research online and just using the SQL reference chapter to look-up query syntax. I give it two stars because it did help me get started, but I'd say this is a poor reference for anyone looking for in-depth coverage.</span>

                    <span>This book is clearly and succinctly written, and provides an excellent introduction to MySQL. It starts with a few pages on the history and philosophy behind MySQL, which is useful if you want to understand the advantages and disadvantages of MySQL relative to other options such as PostgreSQL or Oracle. It then follows with chapters on installation, with specific instructions for Solaris, Linux, and Windows; on MySQL's dialect of SQL (Structured Query Language); and on basic administration tasks such as configuration, startup and shutdown, logging, backup, and recovery. That's really all you need to get a basic database up and running, and it's all in the first 80 pages of the book.<P>Part II of the book covers more advanced administrative tasks, with chapters on performance tuning, security, and database design. This section of the book is weaker than the first section; while there's some useful introductory material on each of these topics, depth is lacking. For example, the discussion of putting a database into second normal form is misleading because it uses a table with only one field as the unique identifier, making it impossible to clearly illustrate the removal to a smaller table of fields that are dependent on only part of a (typically multifield) unique identifier. Also, some of the more advanced MySQL features which might be appropriate for this section are omitted.<P>Part III of the book, entitled "MySQL Programming", has sections accessing MySQL from Perl, Python, PHP, C, Java. These sections are mostly limited to information specific to MySQL that might not be found in general purpose documentation of these languages. For example, the PHP section documents the relevant function calls, since PHP uses different functions to access MySQL than it does to access, say, ODBC databases, while the Java section focuses on JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver configuration since the JDBC API is database independent.<P>Finally, there is a reference section and a good, complete index.<P>If what you want to do is get a small database up and running in a minimum of time with a minimum of hassle, this is the book for you. If you want more than an introductory level of detail and depth, though, you might look at other books; Leon Atkinson's "Core MySQL", for example, has more complete coverage, though the writing style is not as clear and direct.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book as a reference when I was migrating from SQL Server to MySQL. I was hoping to learn from this book some of the language implementations and how to administer on-line databases (backups, benchmarking, security). I found this book to be very lacking. The book provides very little of the language references of SQL, and devotes the majority of the text to function call references for C, Perl/DBI, PHP and Python. (I would think if you were looking for mysql function calls for these languages you would use the specific language reference). If you don't develop front-ends to MySQL in these languages (but still want to "Manage and Use MySQL") then the bulk of this book is probably useless to you. <P>As for managing MySQL, this text provides very little practical information. Sure it covers the GRANT statements, but doesn't go into much depth. For example, I found very little information about archiving or trying to incorporate some type of pseudo-replication. <P>In general, I notice that my book is still in fairly new condition, and doesn't get used much ... it is just an arm's reach away. I use the FREE online MySQL manual almost everyday. That should tell you something right there, huh.</span>
