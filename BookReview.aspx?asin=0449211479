                <span id="Label1">In the grand storytelling style that is his signature, James Michener sweeps us back through time to the very beginnings of the Jewish faith, thousands of years ago. Through the predecessors of four modern men and women, we experience the entire colorful history of the Jews, including the life of the early Hebrews and their persecutions, the impact of Christianity, the Crusades, and the Spanish Inquisition, all the way to the founding of present-day Israel and the Middle-East conflict.<br>"A sweeping chronology filled with excitement."<br>THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER<br></span>

                    <span>This was one of the first books I ever read by James Michener, and what an introduction! Don't be daunted by the size of the novel, for this book is a real page turner! Once you start, you will be drawn in and you won't want to put it down; however, being over a thousand pages, you will have to take breaks to eat, go to the bathroom, go to work, etc.! Only Michener can take a topic like the history of the Jewish race and weave an intricate historical fiction that captures the imagination, creates a sense of drama, and teaches the intellect. He begins with the earliest ancient settlement of a place called Makor, located in modern day Israel, and begins telling a truly fascinating tale based on archeological artifacts that are unearthed layer by layer by an archeology team digging in the present time. In the course of time, you will learn how the Jews first came to understand monotheism, the intricacies of their religion, and perhaps an understanding of why the Jewish people have been persecuted throughout history. There are 15 chapters and each is a mini-novel in itself. The Jews are truly a special people, and you will gain an appreciation of their beginnings, their unique travails as a race, and their nothing-short-of-a-miracle rebirth as a nation. You can read each chapter in a sitting and each chapter stands alone as a complete story, each fascinating and different. But put together, oh, what an epic Michener has created! I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in anthropology, archeology, history, or just good fiction. I guarantee this book will not disappoint! I have read to cover to cover four separate times and it has held my interest each and every time. It will end up on your personal list of favorite reads of all-time too.</span>

                    <span>One of Michener's early novels. His epic (this puppy is over 1000 pages long) writing style is definitely on display here though the overall construction of the book is unusual for Michener. The story starts with a "modern" day archeological dig (circa 1950). We are exposed to a range of relics of various types and ages dug up by the archeologists. There are 12 in all. The book then tells the "historical" tale surrounding each piece-12 stories. So, in essence, this is in reality a book of 12 interconnected and interrelated short stories-more novella's, really-- with a prolog and post-log involving the archeological dig. <P>Being an early effort and given it's unusual structure vis-Ã -vis Michener's traditional style the book lacks some of the elements of structure and style that so characterize Michener's later works-specifically, this book lacks the overall story line and continuity that characterize later efforts. On the whole I think this is actually a positive. A lot of Michener's books seem to weigh me down as I read them-the structure seems at times more important than the story and the stories so overblown as to be beyond the ken of merely mortal readers. Those aspects are absent here despite the books length. And while they book is more or less short stories/novellas, they are sufficiently detailed and expansive that interest is maintained but not abused.<P>The work is dated. While there is a sense that Michener was making a real effort to be apolitical and historically accurate, the fact is that the book nevertheless reflects the underlying predispositions of the time. I suspect if he were around to undertake this effort now the book would have a somewhat different flavor. This fac tin no way detracts from the viability nor the vitality of the stories, however.<P>On the whole, while this probably can't be adjudged Micheners best work from a technical or literary standpoint, I think it's his best work from readability and enjoy ability standpoint. A truly instructive and compelling read.</span>

                    <span>When I was in my early teens, back in the days of disco, fat ties, oil crises, and gaudy leisure suits (aka, the 1970s), I remember looking through my parents' book collection for the book with the most pages. At the time, I thought that the length of a book somehow corresponded to its difficulty level, and that if I could read a 1,000+ page book, then I must be REALLY smart and also grown up! Anyway, one of the first books I decided to read, based on these sophisticated criteria, was "The Source," by James Michener. Surprisingly, I found out that the book was actually easy to read, fascinating, and highly entertaining, and I whizzed right through it (boy, did I think I was smart afte that)! I remember being completely engrossed as the centuries flew past, as conquering armies marched, as cities rose and fell, as blood flowed through the streets of Jerusalem, and as the Jews wandered through the Middle East and Europe. I also remember thinking that the Middle East had an incredible history that I needed to learn a lot more about. <P>Well, almost 30 years later, with a Masters Degree in Middle East Studies, with a couple of trips to the region under my belt, and with a job dealing with the Middle East, I can blame it all, at least in part, on reading "The Source" at age 12 or 13. Seriously, though, I do believe that the seed of my life-long fascination with history, international relations, politics, and the Middle East was planted when I read "The Source" as a young teenager. Actually, come to think of it, another Michener book -- Centennial -- got me fascinated in the history of the West and the American Indian, while several others made me want to learn more about South Africa, Hawaii, the South Pacific, the Chesapeake region, and even outer space. So, definitely read James Michener, but be warned: you could become addicted to a lifetime of learning, travel, and adventure.</span>

                    <span>I cannot vouch for the absolute historical authenticity of this magnificent book. Even biblical scholars can't do that. I have read many religious texts that were supposed to inspire me, save my soul, help me approach God. They didn't quite measure up. Michener did not intend to write a spiritual text, but his convincing romp through the "evolution of religion" came close to turning my agnostic beliefs into those of a near-believer. Much more than the "Holy" Bible ever did. Fascinating, layered characterizations, riveting plots, and truly educational exploration of the meaning of mankind's place in the cosmos give The Source a top-ten ranking among my favorite books of all time. I was thrilled to see so many glowing reviews of this book, and so few negatives.</span>

                    <span>James Michner's the Source is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever been forced to read in my entire lifetime. Not only is it boring and confusing, it is also very graphic and repulsive. One of Michner's main characters, John Cullinane is confused as to which religion he is a part of. He is also a chauvenistic pig (which could only reflect upon Michner himself). I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they were alive in the time period (9834 B.C.) that the Source began in.</span>
