                <span id="Label1"><B>"Almost criminal in its housebreaking, burglarizing, second-story genius."&#151;James Kincaid, University of Southern California</B>  <P>The Victorian age is much closer to us in time than we might believe. Yet at that time, in the most technologically advanced nation in the world, people buried meat in fresh earth to prevent mold forming and wrung sheets out in boiling water with their bare hands. Such household drudgery was routinely performed by the grandparents of people still living, but the knowledge of it has passed as if it had never been.  <P>Judith Flanders's book is laid out like a Victorian house, taking you through the story of daily life from room to room. In each space she depicts the home's furnishings and decoration: from childbirth in the master bedroom, through the scullery and kitchen, the separate male and female domains of the drawing room and the parlor, and ending in the sickroom. A rich selection from diaries, letters, advice books, magazines, and paintings fills the rooms with the people and personalities of the age. 100 illustrations, 3 8-page color inserts.</span>

                    <span>Judith Flanders acerbic wit and pointed commentary liven up already engrossing material about the Victorian home. Using diary excerpts, letters, and household ledgers, Flanders reveals Victorian England in all its stinking, sooty glory. I have never been as absorbed in a non-fiction book as much as I was by this one.</span>

                    <span>Whatever one might have thought about the Victorian era...through books of that time, plays, photographs and other images of a golden age... have been thoroughly reconsidered in "Inside the Victorian Home", a stunning new book by Judith Flanders. It is hard to know where to begin to describe this important work.<P>The author's unusual setting is centered around different rooms of the house and finally street scenes surrounding that life. It is a brilliant way of conceptualizing because Flanders gives the reader a "guided tour" from top to bottom and from birth to death. She quotes prices throughout the book and so reasonably begins with a short page devoted to currency followed by an even more helpful section about men and women she quotes later. These references, skillfully put at the beginning of the book and not at the end, are the brochures which help the tour proceed.<P>"Inside the Victorian Home", though ostensibly inclusive of all types and classes of people, really focuses on two things: women and rules. The two are linked as tight as tightly-drawn corset strings (about which we learn in some detail!) and the author is terrific at conveying how Victorian women felt and how seldom they were able to express their true feelings.<P>Each reader, I'm sure, will have a favorite chapter or two. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on "The Scullery" and "The Sickroom", possibly because these two sections really get down and dirty, literally. One of the high points of the book is a description of why (because so many women felt that they never had any time for themselves) women often resorted to illness as a way to gain that precious personal time. <P>The rules of the Victorian era were striking and fiercely followed. The visits to friends, whether or not personally desired, followed a strict code. The author saves the best for near the end, however. In a four-page addendum to "The Sickroom", Flanders lists the regulations of "Mourning Clothes for Women". As I read them I honestly didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<P>The boundaries that Flanders uses for herself...(there are several points in the book where she feels she might like to digress but keeps her focus sharp and clear)... are almost in keeping with the Victorian tradition. It is, without doubt, a small but nice addition to her book.<P>I couldn't close this review without commenting on how beautiful the book looks, as well. There are three sections of illustrations comprised mostly of paintings with a few photographs. These enhance the book's beauty to a great degree.<P>"Inside the Victorian Home" is a monumental work of toil and love by Judith Flanders. She has researched things so well and presented them in such a way as to give immense care to everything she explains. I would suggest this book be read with due deliberation so as not to miss anything. (but maybe I'm sounding a bit Victorian, myself) As an author, Judith Flanders is wonderful. As a tour guide, she's the best.</span>

                    <span>Judith Flanders has written a book that is not only well conceived, well written, enlightening and informative, it is also a window to focusing the definition of the much maligned adjective 'Victorian'. Flanders writes with a fluid, novelesque style that cements her references and investigations into a fascinatingly powerful indictment of what many of us have believed to be a Golden Age. Using the unique format of going room by room through a middle class (and please note, this is not a book about the wealthy or the poverty stricken homes) English Victorian house, describing (and well illustrating!) the emphasis on appearances in the 'public sections' of the homes ( reception halls, parlors, dining rooms, libraries, living rooms) and the disparate Spartan appearances of the 'private rooms' such as the kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, maids' quarters, Flanders is indeed describing the social mores of that era. Everything is caught up in appearances: a woman's place is in the home preparing for the return from work of the husband, keeping the children at bay, overseeing the 'help' and paying lip service and public display to the superficialities of charity work. Men's live are public; women's lives are private. One of the many interesting aspects Flanders investigates is the crudity of coping with the filth of the homes - from the gaslight lamps, the soot from Industrialization, the lack of knowledge about bacterial contamination in food handling, the disgust of the mud and manure encrusted streets and shoes, etc. If ever there were explanations for the dichotomies that inhabit the literature, art, music, politics, gender problems of the late 19th century, they are here well documented by a first-rate writer. No matter your reasons for wanting to investigate the Victorian Era, this wise and very entertainingly informative book is an excellent resource. An excellent book on many levels and well worth your reading time!</span>

                    <span>I cannot say enough kind words about this book. The author has spent countless months, if not years, putting this book together and it shows. As the family historian, I've been looking for something to really give me some information about how my relatives lived in the Victorian age and the only books I have been able to find have been either political or pertaining to the Upper Class. This book details life of the average middle and lower class person and is so incredibly detailed I cannot put it down.</span>

                    <span>While there are many accounts of life for the upper classes in Victorian England, and on the working classes too, Judith Flanders has chosen to focus on daily life for the Victorian middle class, which exploded in England during the 19th century. With greater buying power and social influence than ever before, they created a lifestyle that still echos in ours today. And they were responsible for that English institution: the Victorian terrace house.<P> "Inside the Victorian Home" takes us through every room in such a house, and describes not only what happened there, but why. For example, the chapter entitled "The Scullery" outlines the multiple steps involved in doing one load of washing. We also learn how hard it was to keep a house clean in a time when coal dust coated everything, the difference between what boys and girls were expected to learn in the school room, and how the Victorians treated illnesses at home. Many of these are taken from diaries and letters, real life accounts.<P> But behind all of this domestic detail, the book tells us WHY all of this was so important to the Victorians. It underlines the moral climate of the time: "A man's home is his castle", and "Cleanliness is next to godliness" - sayings which became the virtues every family strove to display by the way they lived their domestic life. We are told how most of this responsibility fell to women. As mistress of the house, a Victorian wife proved the moral standing of her family not only by the way she behaved, but also by how clean her house was, how she regulated the servants and children, and how she handled the household accounts. All these were just as much expressions of respectability as marital fidelity or going to church. <P>Social changes are also explained to give context to Victorian daily life. For example, dinner was served in courses (entree, main, dessert) for the first time in the Victorian era. This is because servants became affordable for the middle classes, and this was a good way to show them off. Before this, all courses were set on the table at once, and guests served themselves. The social proprieties for engagement, marriage and mourning are also discussed in fascinating detail.<P>Inside the Victorian Home dispels the romantic view many of us have of the era, and instead gives us something real and alive, which we can relate to. Domestic details and social and moral conditions are blended to give an eye-opening account of the time. The book is well written and easy to read. I highly recommend it.</span>
