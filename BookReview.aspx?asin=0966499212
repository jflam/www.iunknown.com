                    <span>Rev. Long does a superb job in presenting ceremonies and rites of passage which are so valuable to the interfaith minister. I have searched for other books and there is absolutely none like it.
<br />
<br />Rev. Long's book is comprehensive, including various services for weddings for various religions and denominations, blessings, funerals, baptisms, and the list goes on and on.
<br />
<br />Every minister should have this book, especially those who perform interfaith services. It is clear, very interesting, and has very nice and appealing ceremonies.
<br />
<br />Great job!</span>

                    <span>This book has a huge variety of ceremonies that can easily be adapted to suit many belief systems.  I was surprised at how nicely everything was worded.  I found a lot of ceremonies that I could use and a few that I'll be able to use if the situation comes up.  It almost impossible to find good funeral ceremonies, but this book is full of them.  All the ceremonies are loving and uplifting.  Excellent book!  Something a lot of ministers have been waiting for!</span>

                    <span>This book contains some of the best advice, rites, and all around helpful information of any book for the new minister. If you're a "non-denom" minister, especially ULC this is certainly a work that needs to be on your shelf... or better yet in your hand.<p>I was lucky enough to receive one of the first copies of Amy's new book and am very pleased with it. The presentation is first rate with easily readable large type (a real plus when standing in front of a crowd) and an attractive black cover with gold lettering which gives a professional appearance.<p>The rites and ceremonies contained in the book run the spectrum from pagan to Christian to Jewish. The part on funerals was especially welcomed since this is often one of the most difficult services the itinerant non-denominational minister will do. Amy's approach is sympathetic, loving, and gives great guidance. The prayers section has become a favorite of our ministers at St. John & St. Sebastian since we utilize them in a variety of formats, especially on visitations for the sick.<p>If ever there were a much needed "prayer book" for the eclectic non-denominational set, this book fulfills that need.<p>We heartily recommend this book to our associate ministers and all ministers both old and new who might find themselves in a situation where a more universalist approach is not only apporpriate but necessary.<p>Thanks for this loving work!</span>
