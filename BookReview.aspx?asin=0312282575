                    <span>I truly believe there is only one way to judge a college basketball coach.  League titles, NCAA appearances, total wins, Final Fours and National Championships are the norm in measuring success.  And, of course, prowess in these areas will secure the legacy of anyone.  However, the way I quantify coaching greatness is much more important than wins and losses.  It's something you can't tangibly gauge.  Simply stated, it's the relationships he or she cultivates with players.  And the loyalty they show after they graduate.  
<br />
<br />Even his staunchest critics can not deny that Bob Knight is a Hall of Famer in this category.
<br />
<br />In "Knight: My Story" Bob Knight writes about the relationships he has developed throughout the years with his former players.  One needs to look no further than Landon Turner to realize why the ones he coached are tenacious Bob Knight supporters.  
<br />
<br />Landon Turner played on Knight's 1981 championship team.  Tragically, shortly after, Turner was paralyzed for life in a vehicle accident.  Through the efforts of Knight, Red Auerbach selected Landon Turner in the late rounds of the NBA draft.  A simple gesture which, Turner says, meant the world to him.  
<br />
<br />The book is a window into the philosophies of a man who through the yelling, screaming, so called intimidation, language, and perceived sour demeanor, somehow has found the greatest allies in his former players.  
<br />
<br />Some of Knight's pundits clearly know absolutely nothing about how to coach a basketball team; how to lead young men through a season of intense pressure and adversity.  And, they are obviously not bright enough to understand that basketball is a metaphor for life.  Knight is preparing boys for manhood.  Do you think anyone of them (who gets it) make excuses when their boss asks them do accomplish a task?  I think not. 
<br />
<br />Knight is not a coach of basketball, he's a teacher of life. 
<br />
<br />You need to look no further than his "eight greatest words", which appear in the first sentence of his book,  "America, America, God shed His grace on thee", to realize how deep his character flows.   
<br />
<br />I've been anticipating book since I was 15 years old.  It was worth the wait.     </span>

<br />Whether you love him, hate him, or are neutral toward him (I'm in the last category), Bob Knight's book is a fascinating glimpse at his personality, his Indiana basketball teams, and college basketball in general.  For Indiana basketball fans (I'm an ACC fan) and college basketball fans in general (a category I fit into), this is a must read.  Knight gives a lot of detail about his Indiana teams, especially those that won national championships, and discusses his point of view on the state of college basketball today.
<br />
<br />There are really two main topics that run throughout the book - and that is Indiana basketball and the controversies that have surrounded Knight - mostly because of his volatile temper.  From a basketball standpoint this is really a great inside look at the college game and the Hoosiers.  Knight's detestation of losing and lack of effort are part of what gets him into trouble because he is clearly a disciplinarian and expects a lot from his players and others involved in the program.  On the other hand that is also why his teams traditionally have been over achievers.  In my opinion, his success in college basketball has been mostly because of his coaching talent and getting his teams to play like a team instead of selfishly.  
<br />
<br />Even though in some ways Knight claims, and I think in a lot ways rightfully so, that a lot of controversies about his temper and clashes with players, officials, or others is a result of his reputation and are undeserved.  Frankly, I do believe him on this account.  And he does seem contrite about some incidents that are clearly his own fault where he's lost his temper.  Some may argue that he is not apologetic enough or doesn't face his own faults in some of the controversies and I can't disagree with that either.  On these issues the reader will have to decide what to believe.
<br />
<br />But either way, this is highly readable and very interesting.

                    <span>I moved to Indiana near the end of Bob Knight's reign as the Head Coach at Indiana University.  I was fascinated by the intensity and loyalty that the IU fans showed toward their coach and team.   I personally have always appreciated Bob Knight as a coach, though I may not have always agreed with his antics.   I do believe that college athletes need a coach who will teach discipline.  His autobiography gives you an inside look at his life and perhaps a better understanding of how the coach really is.  He definitely tells it as it is and does not pull any punches in this book.  One of the strong points of this book is the emphasis the coach puts on in his coaching philosophies and his past accomplishments.  You begin to understand, through the detailed recollections of important games, why the coach is revered by so many.  He seems to take you there and let you know what was going through his mind and how he handled the situations.  Also, the coach briefly addresses many of the "situations" he has been in over the years.  Although they are his side of the story, you get the story as Coach Knight saw it, not how the media reported it.  I thought it was particularly interesting when he discussed his firing from IU.  He firmly believes that the school was out to get him, and for a brief moment, you may begin to believe him.  I know that the media sure gave it a lot of attention here in Indiana, of course their spin on the situation was different then his.  A common theme in this book is Coach Knight`s disdain for the media.   <br>Overall, I think that the book is something that any "import" Hoosier should read.  You begin to understand the idiosyncrasies that are Coach Knight.  It also will help you understand why you see so many Texas Tech Red Raiders bumper stickers in Central Indiana.</span>

                    <span>If you're a Knight fan, you will love this book.  If you're not, you're likely to hate it.  Coach Knight recounts many of the incidents that have made him one of the polarizing figures in sports.  Find out what really happened in his final seasons at IU.  Laugh heartily at his tales of run-ins with non-fans from New Orleans to Puerto Rico.  Observe his relationships with colleagues (Parcells, Larusa, Woody Hayes), players (Jordan, Thomas, Alford, Cheney), and friends (Ted Williams, Dick Vitale).  Best of all, appreciate how he uses basketball as a vehicle for teaching character.<p>My only disappointment was his neglect of the reported friction between him and some of his former players (who I also admire) like Alford and Krzyzewski.  I wish he would have explained or dismissed the media's fixation on these supposed grievances.  Instead, he ignores it.<p>If you are disgusted by the deluge of recent negative stories from the sports page, then read this and be confident that at least one man requires his players study, behave, and play hard.</span>
