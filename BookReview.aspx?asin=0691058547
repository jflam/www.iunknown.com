                <span id="Label1">Until about 1975, logarithms were every scientist's best friend. They were the basis of the slide rule that was the totemic wand of the trade, listed in huge books consulted in every library. Then hand-held calculators arrived, and within a few years slide rules were museum pieces.<p>  But <I>e</I> remains, the center of the natural logarithmic function and of calculus. Eli Maor's book is the only more or less popular account of the history of this universal constant. Maor gives human faces to fundamental mathematics, as in his fantasia of a meeting between Johann Bernoulli and J.S. Bach. <I>e: The Story of a Number</I> would be an excellent choice for a high school or college student of trigonometry or calculus. <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I> </span>

                    <span>It would be a great side reading for Real Analysis and Multivariable Calculus class. The greatest wonder I had during the first half of Real Analysis (Rudin's book) class was answered. I thought 'e' should rather be called "magical log" rather than natural log because of all the fascinating features it has. Maor discusses every aspect of this magic number in a language that is friendly to non-mathematicians. I liked the real world application of natural log such as music and finance, and the derivation of Euler's Formula e^(i*pi)+1=0.<BR>Excellent.</span>

                    <span>This writer had written three books, as far as I know, the one before you, "Trigonometric Delights" and "To Infinity and Beyond." If this does not convince you to read this book, then nothing will.<P>I read this after Dr Beckmann's "A History of Pi," and found it to be the right choice. (for a review of that book click on the blue "a_mathematician" above to see it in its proper place). As Pi is closely associated with the circle, then so is e associated to logarithms and differential equations. It is even called the natural base!<P>Maor does an excellent job in accounting the historical points about e. In the beginning of the book we see e associated with the logarithms and then we see its characterization as the limit of some sequence of numbers. Then we go into some summary of the origin of calculus to see that the exponential function with base e is its own derivative.<P>If you find all this difficult to grasp right now, do not worry, because it is explained in the book in simple language.<P>The book then goes into spirals, and then to hyperbolic trig functions which are defined in terms of the exponential functions base e, and the book is concluded with the Euler's equation, the equation containing the four most important numbers in mathematics: Pi, e, 1, and zero.<P>I can't emphasize this enough, but the language of the book is understandable by anyone. Maybe you would be convinced if I tell you that my native language is not English, yet I could understand the insights of the writer. If you liked the book try a better one, Singh's "Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem."

                    <span>This is one of the best history of mathematics books I have read. It was comprehensive and easy to follow even for the uninitiated. However the last two or so chapters are challenging even for those who have a strong math background. This is not in anyway saying that the book is not worth reading, just that one might take care to put off reading the last few chapters until later in one's math carreer or seek the guidence of a wiser more experienced mathematician. Additionally I have actually taken a history or math course with Dr. Maor and would like to add he is a great lecturer as well... I highly recomend this book.</span>

                    <span>Many textbooks state very little or nothing about the background behind the history mathematics. Maor describes the thought processes of the mathematicians in such a way that one can appreciate Mathematics more. e: The Story of a Number speaks to a broad audience so that, regardless of your mathematical experience, you will understand mathematics better.</span>

                    <span>I read the book several times. It is an easy reading book for a begining math major (like me).The author did a very good and kind job to us. The other side of the my experience is that I had also tried to read the book "Euler, master of us all" (by a different author) and had found Euler's originals were easier to follow than that "expository" book.<BR>I had always been wondering how people calculated logarithms initially and how logarithm was originated. Well, the story explained to me from the very beginning. Each chapter it tells me something interesting and beautiful that I did not know before. While most textbooks rarely spare the ink to tell the reader how and where some of the most important math ideas and formulas had come along, this book tells me in a gentle and lucid way. I consider this book to be a good friend and I suspect that perhaps even advanced learners may find it a enjoyable read as well. Well, I also think it will be very nice if calculus professors use this book as one of their references.</span>
