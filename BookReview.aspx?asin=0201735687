                <span id="Label1">Perl is one of the most popular scripting languages for adding powerful interactive features to Web pages. Perl lets you place forms on your site that collect and process user input such as comments and product orders; enables visitors to search for information; and can integrate a database into your site, among its many other capabilities. <B>Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web, 2nd Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide</B> fully revised and updated since its original 1998 release, gets users to the core of CGI scripting with Perl. Even first-time programmers will be able to create useful, workable scripts from scratch, or adapt and customize existing scripts to their own needs. Hundreds of screen shots and clear, easy-to-understand directions make this the perfect Perl book for beginners, as well as a handy reference for those with previous programming experience.</span>

                    <span>I think Elizabeth Castro did a great job in this book.<BR>I went from a completely beginner on Perl to intermediate. This book covers a lot of material and even though is misssing the HTML part of the codes, any web designer can figure it out by him/her self.<BR>She explains the code and what it does, and that is something most of the visual quickstart guides are missing.<BR>What I didnt like about this book is that it assumes that you are going to use a Unix or Linux OS when a lot of people are hosting under Windows NT or 2000 servers. The extra part at the end that talks about basic Unix commands and how to do simple stuff is very useful for the newbies who dont know what an IP is.<BR>I really recomend this book to anyone interested on learning Perl for the WWW.</span>

                    <span>Firstly you should have some programming background to get the most out of this book - Unix platform being the most helpful. This book leaves no guesswork for the reader and provides everything you need to know in using CGI today! The best part of Elizabeth's books is that she provides a website for Q&A, updates, and revisions as supplemental material. She is truely one of the few authors who takes care and effort in trying to maximize a reader's understanding of the material. Yes this is a newbie book, nothing is glossed over or left to the imagination. I'm actually a fan of the 1st edition of this book and would recommend it instead. However, the 2nd edition is the result of suggestions and input from readers of the 1st edition as well as providing information on how to set up a desktop web-server to test your scripts. If your test platform is Linux then everything you'll need comes standard. If it's Windows then you'll have some choices to make and install (don't worry it's all free). If using Mac OS10.x then your test platform is ready to go with little effort!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to put CGI on my own website. When you send your data on the examples in this book they go to the authors CGI pages at a web site (www.cookbook.com)But you can use these examples on your own server and I have IIS version 5.1.<BR>The purpose of me trying to learn CGI was to make CGI scripts to have my own web page have my own Guestbook,ect,ect..<BR>This book really does help in learning perl. If you have IIS server on your computer there is a web site you can go to just type in "IIS Server .pl and .cgi on IIS Server" in Google search engine and you should find a web page to help you; and you should be able to get your IIS server running .cgi scripts from out of this book. A great book for beginners!!!!!</span>

                    <span>Castro has written several books in the Visual Quick Start series including her best-selling HTML book and more recently her book on XML. I've been using the HTML and Perl/CGI books since 2001 on various projects and have found them extremely useful. I have a few other books in the VQS series and I can tell you that they are not all created equal. Castro, however, is pretty thorough which is why this book is not only a good starting place, but a usable reference as well.<P>Some topics covered include getting familiar with Perl syntax and functions, installing Perl, communicating with Web servers, creating HTML pages and forms, serving up data, and dealing with security. If you know any programming language, you can begin to pick up Perl very quickly from her examples. In fact I used this book to tackle my first Perl script and had it working fairly quickly. She assumes some knowledge of HTML and the basics of Web servers and browsers.<P>Advanced topics such as using databases to store or retrieve data on Web pages is not covered in this fairly small book, but that is a topic worthy of a separate book anyway. Other issues such as dealing with specific Web servers are also best left to other books. For the price and ease of use, I highly recommend Castro's book. You'll be seeing the results of your first CGI script in no time at all.</span>

                    <span>Many educational books lead you along a plodding path, and if you skip ahead, you find yourself lost in the woods. <P>My motivation to learn anything is that I already have a practical application in mind and I want to gain enough knowledge to write it. If I don't have more applications on the back burner, I may well forget half of what I learned once the application is written, but I accept that about myself.<P>The organization of this book was such that it was easy to jump back and forth through the chapters, getting a handle on the bits I needed to write my script. <P>When I paused a few months, forgot a lot, then had another bright idea for a script, it was easy to dive right back in, using this book to refresh my knowledge and expand it a bit.<P>On the other hand, if you're coming in as a stark beginner, you can go through it chapter by chapter while you build up the confidence to start bouncing around.<P>It is mainly a survey of different concepts, without going too deeply into any. That's why it's called a "quickstart" guide. It's supposed to help you get out of the gate quickly and it does so excellently.<P>You may find that once you go beyond simple scripting, you'll need a more advanced book to help you dig down into the guts of Perl, but once you get to that point, you'll find that the [ahhhem] dollars you spent on this book were a heck of an investment, because you'll be able to plow into those more advanced tomes and not feel lost.</span>
