                <span id="Label1">Altars are everywhere. In executive suites and private homes, in restaurants and gardens &#150; whether religious in focus or not &#150; people are reinventing the altar in new and imaginative ways. From a simple cherished photo surrounded by candles and shells that serves to attract the eye and draw the mind into gentle contemplation, to a more elaborate expression of personal style, altars bring peace and a place of beauty into daily life.  In this first complete handbook on altars, Peg Streep shows readers how to use specific materials, colours, symbols, imagery, scents, crystals, music, and more to create their own personal altars. Streep covers the history, symbolism, and different types of the altar and provides detailed and fully illustrated guidance for anyone to create and enjoy sacred space. A discussion of offerings and rituals, along with a handy resource section, make this volume definitive, Altars Made Easy, makes the process simple and fun.</span>

                    <span>I thought it could be better. I own it and think it could be better. It lacks pictures and it would have made the book better to see what the person was talking about. I have another book on alters by another author called Dinese linn which was much better.</span>

                    <span>Complete it certainly is not. It brushes lightly over most of the major aspects of altar design and symbolic elements without getting too deeply into any of them. Good for the preteen earth mother or wicca type just wanting to get some basic information and maybe build her first altar. Good for those wanting to get a basic familiarity with the various mystic elements and traditions which can be utilized.</span>

                    <span>I thought this was a OK book not what I expected. I thought this was going to be a book just about pagan altars and is not, it talks about many other altars and things so a lot of what was in the book did not apply to me. I thought it was a kind of a let down it should be more pacific with what kind of altars she covers.</span>

                    <span>This book was great! It is filled with very useful ideas on making your own sacred space. I have never seen a book filled with so much information on multi cultural items, colors, stones/gems, flowers, animals and more items, with their meanings, that you may use on you own alter. This book is a must have for anyone looking to make their own alter or sacred space, or someone who is just looking to educate themselves on the meanings of a lot of items used on alters. The only drawback was there wasn't enough drawings. The ones used were great but I would have loved to seen more. I just couldn't get enough. This is a book you will truly enjoy over and over again!</span>

                    <span>I just loved this book. It's filled with useful and interesting information about altar-building from MANY different cultural perspectives. I found the fine art quality of the gorgeous pencil drawings of real-life altars to be breathtaking. I wish they were available as postcards, with helpful altar-building tips on the back.</span>
