                    <span>It was difficult to get through this book.  First of all, the writing style skips around.  This book wants to be a serious work of nonfiction, but the authors keep drifting in and out of a diary style of writing, as if we cared how long the ride from Marsailles to Nice is.  What's worse, they tend to start every third sentence with "we", so after a while the writing style starts to irritate the reader.
<br />
<br />The writing style is not the only problem.  The content of this book is laughable.  The authors make numerous claims without support or evidence.  In fact, most of the theories in this book are based on speculation.  To give an example, they often start a line of argument with the phrase "it could be imagined" or it is entirely possible", and then present one of their theories.  A few sentences later, they then take the previous speculation as pure fact and then build their arguments on that.  It is nothing but a house of cards.  Also, it should be noted that the authors are self-proclaimed paranormal investigators--hardly a source of serious knowledge.  Any educated person would laugh or moan on reading the theories presented in this book and the so-called evidence they bring to the table to prove them.  Save your money and buy another book.  Any other book.  It couldn't be worse than this.</span>

                    <span>It is hard to accept the basic conclusions of the author, especially if one has faith in the Shroud of Turin. Yet the universe created in this work opens many doors. It may be the best read in the category of hidden knowlege to come along.</span>

<br /> I have just finished reading this book and only a few days after completing "The Head of God"-The Lost Treasure of the Templars by Keith Laidler (see my review of March 9,2005).So, why read this book when I learned all the secrets already?I thought there might be a chance they both got it right.Well, who knows ;maybe they did,and maybe they didn't.However; what I was really looking for ,I found.I was trying to get a feel for the multitude of secret societies ,what their secrets were and why they kept their secrets.How ,and if, there was any connections to them .Are they basically religious,anti-religious or non-religious?What about occults,Satanism,Hedonism,Magic,,Worship of Icons,Alchemy,Mythology,Gnostics,Heresies,Pagans,Rosicrucians,New Age,and on and on?
<br />This book gives a pretty good overall view of a lot of these subjects particularly how they originated and how ,or even if, there were connections with the Templars and possibly with present day organizations such as the Freemasons.
<br />  There is a lot of material covered,and if the reader is still looking for more there are references throughout the book to other fairly recent books and each chapter is supplied with footnotes and references.On top of that there are several pages of a Selected Bibliography.Maybe the "the truth"is hidden somewhere amongst all that material;but it may be as elusive to find as the Holy Grail itself.
<br />  I guess as long as mankind has belief systems,this sort of thing will continue.While the assumptions and suppositions can't all be true;it's interesting to see how they developed.
<br />  You gotta admit though, Eric von Daniken,Berlitz,Lindsey and all didn't do too badly.Never mind simply finding the Holy Grail ;they get down to the real serious stuff like: "where did we all come from in the first place?"</span>

                    <span>The Templar Revelation covers a fascinating panoply of topics - John the Baptist as the true Messiah (not Jesus), how the Templars knew this but were ultimately suppressed, how the Freemasons also knew it but were not suppressed, Mary Magdalene as the wife/partner of Jesus and the figurative Holy Grail, the cult of black Madonnas, the Cathar suppression, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, etc.
<br />
<br />Honestly, I wanted to like the book.  And in fact, on some level, I did like it because I learned quite a bit from it.  The topic is interesting and I could appreciate the authors' meticulous attention to their research.  But I honestly could not recommend the book because it was such a struggle to get through. 
<br />
<br />A work of such magnitude, covering so many topics, needs a rigorous hand in organization and connective transitions.  This book did not have that.  In addition, the first half of the book suffered from a particularly muddled writing style.  It improved noticably in the second half of the book, but that remains a relative statement.
<br />
<br />Overall, I cannot recommend the book.  My apologies.</span>
