                    <span>Keys to the Rain is undoubtedly a valuable guide to Bob Dylan's recorded output.  The book is well-researched and written in a straightforward, accessible style.
<br />Unfortuntately, the book has numerous flaws that make it an often frustrating read.  The factual errors include the following: the author states that The Basement Tapes' version of "Million Dollar Bash" is "notable for Dylan's use of the harmonica" when there is no harmonica on the track; the version of "Spanish Is the Loving Tongue" that appeared as the B-side single of "Watching the River Flow" is not the same version that was released on the Dylan lp; "Step It Up and Go" is from the album Good As I Been to You, not World Gone Wrong; and "Down Along the Cove" is erroneously listed as being included on The Band's re-release of Rock of Ages.  
<br />Numerous errors in dates dot the book.  There is a wonderful photo of Dylan and two youngsters (page 602) that is dated 1966 but comes from much earlier (either 1962 or 1963).
<br />There is one particularly egregious misquotation of Dylan's words, as the phrase "Truth is shadowy" in the World Gone Wrong liner notes becomes "Truth is a shadow" in the book, which changes the phrase's meaning.
<br />Trager writes in the introduction that "unreleased outtakes" and "unreleased material from The Basement Tapes are not included."  Yet he includes songs never released by Dylan but recorded and released by other artists (which the author should have explained in the too-brief introduction).  There really is no reason for Trager not to have included these songs, since he includes all songs Dylan has played in concert (both original songs and cover versions), and he includes unnecessarily long biographies of the authors of said covers.  So the reader gets pages and pages on songwriters such as Sammy Cahn, Merle Travis, Lefty Frizzell and Donnie Fritts (to name a few), but nothing on such great unreleased Dylan songs as "I'm Not There," All-American Boy," "Goodbye Holly" and "Yonder Comes Sin."  The author says that "these omissions were made for reasons of space," but surely he could have cut back on his discussion of other artists in a Bob Dylan encyclopedia and made room for all of Dylan's original songs, officially released or not.  Nor is there anything on great covers recorded by Dylan in the studio but not released (such as "Freedom for the Stallion").  Including these songs would then have truly earned the book the title of definitive.

                    <span>I've got Trager's 1997 book--The American Book of the Dead: The Definitive Grateful Dead Encyclopedia--and have plucked it off my shelf numerous times.  I'll be doing the same with his latest effort, this Dylan encyclopedia.  It is interesting that with all the Dylan books out there, it took until 2004 for something like this to appear.  For the hardcore aficionado, this will be similar to Krogsgaard's Positively Bob Dylan and Heylin's Stolen Moments (as far as its usefulness), but to the casual observer it's a chance to get to know the songs Dylan has chosen to record and perform--not to mention biographical info.  Photos throughout, and enough details in its 700-plus pages to keep one busy throughout 2005 (and 2006 and 2007, etc.)  It's not dry either, I'd say Trager has a fondness and apprecation for the music.

                    <span>Another Bob Dylan book? Yes, and what makes Keys To The Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia a more 'definitive' encyclopedic guide than others is its descriptions of all 44 of his officially released albums including collaborative efforts, entries on over 700 songs he's recorded or performed over the length of his career, and biographical sketches of all musicians, songwriters and others associated with any of his projects, including film. And if that isn't enough... entries include track lists, musician lists, critical analysis, serial number info for all formats including cassette, and background history. It doesn't get any better - or more 'definitive' - than this.

                    <span>Absolute must for all those who consider rock and roll "art", and Dylan the ultimate "artist" of the genre.  A quick glance will provide such useful info that "Blonde on Blonde" was recorded in Nashville, using primarily studio musicians.  Consider that the next time you listen to "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands", and its haunting refrain.  Only problem is that in a few years it will be out of date.  Sadly, a compilation of Dylan's work will only be complete when Dylan retires which, gratefully, he shows no signs of doing anytime soon.</span>
