                    <span>I hadn't taken Chemistry since high school and needed to brush up on the basic principles for college and I found Chemistry Demystified to be a well written and a fun to read reintroduction to the subject.
<br />
<br />It was nothing like the stuffy old textbooks I remember from high school, it flows well, and packs your mind with information almost without you being aware of it.  It's written in an engaging conversational style that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The author is knowledgeable about her subject matter and presents even the most difficult concepts in a manner that the most obtuse reader should have no problem understanding.  
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a fun refresher in Chemistry or is studying Chemistry at an introductory level.

                    <span>The approach this book takes is pretty good, I think.  It starts with a bit of history, a description of the scientific method, and then some important concepts like significant digits and the difference between accuracy and precision.  Lots of quizzes and tests to help you gauge your progress.<p>But the errors!  I can't believe how sloppy this book is.  Typos and mistakes everywhere.  And big topics are slurred over, leading to massive confusion.  A formula is given in the text, 2n^s.  It quickly became apparent that it should have been 2n^2.  And there are brief references to the s, d, p and f electron shells, but the way these are referred to in notation is never explained.  Awful!  Maddening!<p>I finally gave up in disgust;  this one is going back, and I'm getting a refund.<p>It seems that the emphasis on sloppy, hasty publishing is spilling over from the IT book industry into other books.  The author mentions that suggestions for a future edition are welcome.  Here's one:  TRY PROOFREADING.</span>

                    <span>I made it to page 64 before I returned the book. There are just too many errors. Example 1: p23 477/5 = 70 NOT! Example 2: p43 claims that a periodic table chart is on the inside cover of the book. NOT! Example 3: p48, question 8 the right answer does not appear in any of the choices! Example 4: p64 A Molecule is composed of the same kinds of atoms, chemically bonded. NOT! (what about H20, get rid of the phrase "the same kinds of atoms") Example 5: p39, para 3 claims that the number 16, 32, 79!, and 128 are all multiples of the number 16 NOT! Don't buy this one. The writing style is accessible but there are too many errors.</span>

                    <span>this book is really good and working out for me.  This book makes chemistry fun and simple to learn. i have to take a series of chemistry classes starting next semester and i feel that this book is reinforcing what i have already learned and reteaching this stuff in a way to where it is easier to understand and i like it and would recomend this book to anyone.</span>

                    <span>This book is a horrible waste of trees.  Aside from the errors and omissions, it is condescending, thin in content (filled out with quizzes that take up many of the pages), and generally useless for any meaningful introduction to or overview of chemistry.  I would give it zero stars if that were an option.  Try the old workhorse "Chemistry Made Simple" instead.</span>
