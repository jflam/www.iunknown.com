                    <span>Geology has long been a hobby of mine. I own several of these books and thoroughly enjoy them all. The Washington roadside guide has the most meaning to me since I live in Washington State and have had reason to travel throughout the state for the last 12 plus years. I like the authors approach of using highways and cities as reference points. In addition, the pictures add realism. You can actually go to those places and look at the pictures in the book and see exactly what they are talking about.<BR>I think this book is a valuable educational tool as well for people with children. What fun to drive from place to place and learn about what is really under the surface of the ground! Reading the geological story of a particular part of the state made me want to travel there as well. Great books, very easy to read.</span>

                    <span>This is not a book for rockhounds -- there are no mineral lists, no collecting sites or things like that. It is aimed at a general reader with an interest in geophysical features and phenomena. I'd say it scores pretty well.<P>The authors focus on what can be seen along, and what underlies, many major Washington highways. They deal with both the surficial geology and the underlying basement rocks. There is an emphasis on relating what is right in front of you to "how it got that way" and how it continues to change today. <P>Their preface is an excellent description of plate tectonics, the engine that powers all the geologic activity. It would be easy for this description to lose the non-technical reader, but their writing makes it seem clear. Throughout the book they have a consistently light but careful prose style. More people would be interested in geology if introductory geology textbooks read like this one!</span>
