                <span id="Label1">The most extensive Exchange 2003 reference found on the market today from one of the world's leading Microsoft server experts, Rand Morimoto. Written from the ground up exclusively for Exchange 2003--not a revision of an Exchange 2000 book. Based on the author's experience implementing Exchange 2003 in heavy-use corporate environments since Beta release 1. Contains hard-to-find intermediate to advanced coverage far beyond the competition's typical installation and set-up how-to's including planning, migration, security, disaster recovery, and vast troubleshooting tips. A complete reference targeted at intermediate to advanced users for help in managing the complicated and business-critical matters of e-mail, message databases, and ever-increasing mobile and remote system access.</span>

                    <span>This book, like all technical books, obviously took a number of people a large amount of time to complete. No disrespect to the authors but they missed a lot of basic things.<P>The book does have some decent info. But, once again, it appears the publisher decided to put out a book to take advantage of demand for a new product. They should have focused more on beefing up their content and they might have had something.<P>There is a lot of information that should be obvious to somebody with experience in the technology field. Do we really need migration planning meeting notes with generic categories like "Budgetary Issues, Planning Considerations, Technical Resources?" I don't think so.<P>Worse still, some of the contents of the book were illegible. Figure 2.4 of the Sample Project Schedule was totally blotched. Is this a shameless attempt to further thicken a book that is 70% filler?<P>Perhaps this was once again a failure in layout. They could have included all that migration stuff in a later chapter. Why did they include that before discussing more about the Exchange Server itself?<P>In fairness, there was some useful info in the book. But do I have to see another screen shot of somebody right-clicking in the management console?!?! Argh!!!<P>It's a shame that this book was such a missed opportunity. Publisher's like this need to pay for experience technical editors to correct these issues before publication. I don't blame them necessarily for trying to put out a book quickly and make a fast buck though. <P>For somebody who is a TOTAL beginner in technology and wants to learn about Exchange, this book probably holds some value for you. If you've just been assigned to plan an Exchange Migration and you haven't a clue, there is plenty of filler here to prolong some useless meetings. For anybody with any experience or knowledge of Exchange, this book is repetitive, slow, and not an effective use of your time.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book recently in advance of our migration project that we performed. The author's do a very good job in explaining the nitty gritty of Exchange itself, and how to properly design an Exchange environment with all of the major items I was looking for. The migration section was great, and I also found some very good information on the best ways to setup and deploy clients with ActiveSync, RPC over HTTPS, Cached mode, etc.<P>I did find that this book is not really the type of book that you would use for day-to-day admin of Exchange, I like the books by Jim McBee for those types of tasks, but for architectual design and migration, this is hands down the best book I've found.</span>

                    <span>This book was more than helpful in helping me pull off a smooth and sucessful migration from Exchange 5.5 to Exchange 2003. I tried looking through a couple other books but found that the chapters in this one were really well written and easy to follow. I definately recommend this book if you are looking for a migration resouce.</span>

                    <span>I have just setup an Exchange 2003 Cluster and I'm sad to say this book was no help at all. Every time I go to the index to look up something, the topic does not exist. For example, I want to figure out how to make a resource (conf. room) automatically accept meetings and book the resource accordingly. This is not in the Index as well as the other two dozen or so things I tried to look up. Every time I had an issue and referred to this book I came up empty handed and found the solution on the web. Very poorly written in my opinion.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because others rated it so high. It was a great disapointment. Microsoft's 70-284 training kit had a more in-depth coverage of Exchange 2003, even though it is basically a copy&paste of technet articles, than Unleashed. I found Microsoft's course 2009 material to be the best source of information on Exchange 2003. It is definetely the most complete out of the three. I was surprised!<P>Well, my advice is if you want to go out and buy a book, don't get this one, get Microsoft's training kit. If you want to learn Exchange 2003, take course 2400 or 2009, they'll give you a better return on your time spent.<P>FC<BR>MCSE 2003,2000,4.0 MCSA Linux+ CCNA</span>
