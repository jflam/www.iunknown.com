I also have some earlier shots on my cheapo 50mm prime (see my blog post on rediscovering my 50mm f/1.8). The 50mm prime is equivalent to a 75mm on a film camera and is a very nice portrait lens - providing you can get close enough to the subject. I like having the telephoto zoom because it lets me sit far enough away that, even with the big lens, I can blend back into the background.\u003Cbr /\u003EGetting the nice bokeh (blurred background) is challenging on DX-sized sensors if you don't have a big aperture.
