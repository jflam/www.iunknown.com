                <span id="Label1"><I>The God Who Begat a Jackal</I>, Nega Mezlekia's much-anticipated first novel and follow-up to his award-winning memoir <I>Notes from the Hyena's Belly</I>, is a story of doomed love set in feudal Ethiopia in the last days of premodern Africa. It is a time when caste-system slavery is essential to the economy, women are married by force at the age of 12, and warlords run their fiefdoms with the fitful tyranny of petty despots. Mezlekia's heroine, Aster, is the only child of one of these aristocrats, the ambitious Count Ashenafi. Aster is an extraordinary child: she is clairvoyant, can walk through walls, and possesses an unparalleled intellect. Her fiercely protective father cloisters her under perpetual guard and dismisses all of her would-be suitors. Inevitably, Aster falls in love with her guard, Gudu, the count's court poet, and together they set out to record Gudu's immense knowledge of his country's poetic tradition. But their affair is soon discovered, resulting in bitter intrigue and civil war.<p>  While Mezlekia does spin a good tale, his novel is likely to disappoint readers  who enjoyed <I>Notes from the Hyena's Belly</I>. Mezlekia's memoir owed much of its success to the consistently high quality of its language, which was full of arresting images but seldom flashy and never pretentious. <I>The God Who Begat a Jackal</I>, on the other hand, features undistinguished writing of the sort one would expect from a particularly bland fantasy novel. The novel can be enjoyed for its plot and social commentary, but it isn't the gem that it ought to have been. <I>--Harvey Cornell</I></span>

                    <span>This is a well-written story set in the vicinity of the Ethiopian town of Harer in the years 1750-1800, according to the author's postscript. It tells of a love-affair destined for failure due to reasons of differing social status. As a backdrop, there are currents of class and religious struggles.<P>The problem is that the religious struggle is between Amma and Mawu-Lisa, which were, according to the postscript, indigenous African religions. Perhaps indigenous African, but not indigenous Ethiopian. In being more universally African, the novel loses what is uniquely Ethiopian. <P>At the time the story takes place, historical Harer is an Islamic stronghold in a Christian empire. Christianity is part of the country's soul. But, there is no mention of Islam or Christianity in the book. Instead, there are people passing through walls or taking to the air, powered by African magic.<P>Thankfully, the author cannot completely escape his Ethiopian roots. Even in this alternate reality some things ring true to life in (the real) Ethiopia, such as the pervasiveness of a religion, the different societal expectation of men and women, and some of the peoples' social customs.</span>

                    <span>Historical fiction is a genre that I always thought you have to suspend disbelief to a certain degree. That is usually supplanted strongly with the backdrop of history, allowing the reader to believe that the events actually have or at least may have happened.<P>Mezlekia unfortuanately sabotages this with his antics of magic and unlikelihoods in plot, that moves it more into a genre I'd like to call historical fantasy. But unlike Wilbur Smiths' River God series where the scenery of history and the fantastic elements he uses, Mezlekia writes a story that only confuses the reader and is filled with slow moving sections that only encourages skimming. Gudu and Aster's characters are developed well in some ways, but their motivations for some of their doings come across as baffling at times.<P>This is a good beach book, that's all it is really for me at the moment.</span>

                    <span>The love story was very engaging in this novel. However, about halfway through, it's lost and suddenly the plot became bogged down with historical information. It totally lost me and I found myself skipping pages. I think Nega is a great writer with much potential as a novelist. His first book was superb. I just think he needs to go back and perfect his novel writing skills. He's not there yet. The structure of this book was off. Historical elements are important but they need to be in the background, coloring the plot. More subtle. I eagerly await his next novel.</span>
