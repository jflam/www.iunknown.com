                    <span>I've always found Richard Branson to be a fascinating man from his strong business acumen to his perilous and well-documented adventures. That being said, when I picked up this book to read, I didn't expect to find it as intriguing as I did. Many business autobiographies that I have read tend to drag on and focus on the same old business philosophies.  Mr. Branson runs his business completely opposite to how we are told by most experts that a business should be run. 
<br />
<br />Branson's passion and drive are infectious. His blatant disregard for the stuffy way business "gurus" say that businesses should be run is refreshing.  The many stories shared in this book are extremely interesting and fun to read.  I found myself unable to put this book down, which is saying a lot for me.  A very enjoyable read!

                    <span>Branson is NOT your typical international business tycoon. For one thing, he dropped out of school at 16 in Britain. He was a near-sighted dyslexic who was told by teachers he would amount to nothing. Young Richard was terrified of reading out loud and supposedly had to sit in the corner with a dunce cap. In a world that admires people for the masque they wear - Ivy League credential, private club memberships, burgundy office furniture, house size, neighborhood whereabouts, and all sorts of external "proof" of worthiness ... Branson broke all the rules (not in a maliscious way), had fun, made a fortune out of adventure, and avoided suits, chauffers, and still was knighted by the Queen. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets an O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire) one day. In a nutshell, if you aspire to fly with your own entrepreneurial dreams and stay true to yourself ... Branson's book (there is an updated to 2003 edition out now) provide an informal mentorship in the art of believing in oneself.
<br />
<br />How often do bitter teachers crush the hopes of students because of their own insecurity? How often do people get promoted on the fact that they went to Wharton or Harvard and have an exclusive golf memberships? How many people go broke trying to look like a success and negate their true selves? Close to 90% of the population trying to go up the corporate ladder. Branson, like Charles Schwab, was featured in the May 2002 Fortune cover story "The Dyslexic CEO". His story is a testament to the power of will and street smarts that may not be taught in the bluest of blue bood MBA programs. If the saying is correct - "few great men could pass personnel" - then there is hope for countless others in the world. Who would have thought that 16-year-old dropout Richard, who would never have been hired as he was by any Fortune 500 comany, or at least identified as a "top talent" by the men in pinstripe suits, would rival Donald Trump. Trump, with his Wharton MBA, private school upbringing, and slick New York upbringing, was the one "most likely to be voted most likely to succeed."
<br />
<br />Branson, being British, also triumphed over a class structure and nation at the turmoil of socialist error. Thatcher's reign as Prime Minister may have helped young Richard, but I suspect economic Thaterism was an adjunct to his ruthless rebellious desire to amass an empire of his own that won in the end. 
<br />
<br />Losing my Virginity is witty, funny, honest, and intriguing. Richard Branson admits his errors, allows himself to be human, and seems to maintain his boyish charm. If you respect people who are self-made, not handed a thing, Branson is a great story especially when you'd like some real-life inspiration. Most of all ... Branson personifies why not to let your transcripts dictate your confidence, and why never to think that teachers or some educational authority is some oracle into what you can accomplish. 
<br />
<br />Rumor has it that Trump and Branson have some disagreement on business style. Whether it's true or not, consider this: would you rather spend your life being purley materially driven with money as your God OR would you like to go to your grave knowing that you have nothing left because you truly are "thoroughly used up when you die." Your talents released to their ultimate positive manigfestation in the world while you had a absoulute smashing time doing so?  If it's the latter ... buy Branson's book.

                    <span>Unlike most people whose exposure to Richard Branson came from his reality show, I bought this book after reading one of the Forbes "Richest People" lists. I was intrigued by a man who could make a few billion dollars, jump out of planes, set record after record, cross-dress for promotions, and still remain a respected businessperson!
<br />
<br />This autobiography covers Richard's life until around 1993, and the epilogue very briefly goes to 1997. Thus, there is no discussion about the impact of the internet on Virgin, or how the dot-com bust affected them, and so on. However, everything else until that time is very detailed and interesting.
<br />
<br />Reading this book, you will learn the challenges that Branson had to overcome in his youth, including dyslexia. You'll learn how he started a vastly successful magazine while still in school, all the gritty details that involved in operating it, and how he progressed to record shops, record label, mega shops, airline, and eventually his Virgin empire. Exploits in his professional and personal life are also revealed, including his many world records and how he broke them, his numerous relationships, and the historic case against British Airways.
<br />
<br />Make no mistake: Richard makes sure to put a happy face on Virgin and to promote his brand as much as possible. Then again, I don't know of a single book written by the founder of any such company - especially one that deals mainly with consumers - that does not "toot" its own horn on every other page. 
<br />
<br />Regardless, this is a great book of a great man by a great leader. Whether you are an accomplished businessman, a student, or a bystander looking to learn more about Branson and Virgin, this book is worth purchasing!</span>

                    <span>Branson has had in incredible adventure.  Just when you think there's no way he can do it, he does it.  His writing is equally outlandish, a lot of details and flourish in his triumphs.  But you have to give him credit, he is certainly one who thinks "outside the box" and does it extremely well.  Reading the book just for this insight is worth it.  Also what's heartening is that both his family life and business life thrills him.  He shows the importance of family amidst the success.  Reading him gives one hope for the impossible.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After reading the business autobiography of Richard Branson (Sir Richard Branson), 'Losing My Virginity', I've decided to tell of how riveted I was to the book. The CEO of Virgin has many things to say and for almost the entire book, I couldn't put it down (other than his extended musings on British Airways). From starting his first magazine called 'Student', then opening up the first Virgin store on Notting Hill, to buying an old castle to make into a recording studio, to losing his virginity to an asmatic girl. He has broken world records in hot-air balloons around the world. He gets the balloons up to an altitude of around 35k feet where the jet stream is and rides across the atlantic ocean reaching speeds of 240mph, or the pacific ocean and the way he recounts these trips is addictive to read and hard to put down. He's also broken ocean records by being the fastest man alive to boat the atlantic ocean averaging 45 knots (I think that's the speed). Branson's reality show on Fox starting November 9th at 7pm should be interesting since the contestants will compete over the CEO position of Virgin. I don't know if the position will be permanent or not. Branson's book is a very, very entertaining read and makes anybody want to go out and start their own business because he makes it sound just the opposite of business. One former airline CEO tells Richard that he needs to get a physical every year and have the doctor stick his finger 'up your bum, then he'll tell you what's what.' The man when on to say, 'just make sure to look back when his finger is up your bum and make sure that both his hands aren't on your shoulders.' Branson goes into detail about many of his relationships and what he thought about other people at the time and feels no shame, the book sounds as if the thoughts went straight from Sir Richard's steno-pad into publication. Richard Branson is now my new entrepreneurial hero. The book also explains the much asked question of why he decided to name his company something so innocent but epicureanly alluding.
