                <span id="Label1">Are you one of the millions of people across America are intrigued by professional football&#160;&#8211;&#160;and all types and levels of football? Perhaps you have a friends or a number of friends who have made the football season a ritual, from the last weekend in August until Super Bowl Sunday at the end of January. To be a part of that experience, you need to have a working knowledge of the game.   <p>   <i>Football For Dummies, 2nd Edition</i>, can provide you with that knowledge and help you relate to the passionate football fans in your life. On the surface, football may seem to be a very complicated game. The game becomes far less intimidating once you begin to understand the fundamentals of the game. After you break through that initial fear of being overwhelmed by football and what you don't understand, everything else about the game will fall into place, like dominoes. Get ready to find answers to all your football questions, such as:    <ul type="disc">    <li>Why do they call it the "gridiron" anyway?    <li>Is the ball really made of pigskin, or is that an inside joke?    <li>Why do you get six points for a touchdown but only three points for a field goal?    <li>Does it really matter how all those guys line up on the field?    <li>Does it really mean something when the officials do those funny signals with their arms, or are they just bored out there?    </ul>   <p>   If you don't know a touchdown from a touchback or an interference penalty from an interception, then this book is for you. You'll find easy-to-understand explanations of these topics and more:    <ul type="disc">    <li>The football season    <li>Rules and regulations    <li>Keys to successful offensive line play    <li>Defense tactics and strategies    <li>Coaches, general managers, and other important folks    <li>Youth leagues and high school football    <li>Why people love college football    <li>Fantasy leagues    <li>Conditioning, training, and diet    </ul>   <p>   Authors Howie Long&#160;&#8211;&#160;Emmy-award-winning football commentator and eight-time Pro Bowl defensive end&#160;&#8211;&#160;and John Czarnecki&#160;&#8211;&#160;editorial consultant for <i>CBS NFL Today</i> and <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i>&#160;&#8211;&#160;have teamed up to bring you the ultimate fan's guide to football. This second edition of <i>Football For Dummies</i> has been updated to cover new teams, stadiums, and players.    </span>

                    <span>The only thing I knew about football was from watching it on TV. I picked up enough information to enjoy the game, but occassionally I got perplexed by commentator remarks and wished I knew what they were talking about. So I bought the "Idiot's Guide to Football", learned a lot more, but still felt unfulfilled. Then I broke down and bought another book, the "Dummies" version, and got exactly what I wanted. This book covers much more detail and doesn't talk down to you. The Idiot's version, while trying to be humorous, succeeds only in insulting your intelligence. If one were to absorb all that is contained in "Football for Dummies", you may not get any calls for head coaching jobs, but you'll certainly better understand the jargon and the meaning behind a lot of the decisions that are made during and before a game. It even covers team motivation, player training and diet, fantasy leagues, the draft, game scheduling, high school and college football information, and a fairly large football- speak section that covers more ground that most other glossaries I've seen. This book contains everything you need know about football to understand and enjoy the game.</span>

                    <span>I've been a football fan for over 25 years and enjoy the game a great deal. So picking up a Dummies book seems a little embarrasing considering that I should know everything about the game. However I learned awhile ago that the only dummies are the ones who assume they know it all. I've read a few on different subjects and learned quite a bit to even impress so called experts on many subjects, so I though what the heck I might pick up a little more knowledge right? In this book Howie has something for everyone. As an avid fan I enjoyed covering the basics and learning a lot more about the finer points of the game. It is put in a simple and informative way and Howie shows little biased in his opinion even though he was a defensive star. Now I truly understand the game from a whole new perspective. Of course this book won't make you a head coach but I'm positive it will enhance your viewing experience. Now when I pick up an NFL preview magazine or watch the upcoming reports on TV I get even more pumped for the season. This book was definetly a great buy and it will sure come in handy when the girlfriend asks what a 'nickleback' is. It sure is easier to pass along the book than to have to explain. Even though thanks to Howie I finally undersatnd what it is myself. Great book!</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for people who's understanding and following of football ranges from totally clueless to moderate interest. The second edition picks up some key things that were absent from the first edition like overtime and how it functions on the college and pro levels.<P>Pretty easy read that isn't patronizing, and even people who understand football will find the facts and personal stories in the book exciting...if you're comfortable reading a book that says "Dummies" on the cover, that is.</span>

                    <span>This was a good book, but too focused on NFL. If you are a big-time NFL fan, it might be nicer, but I prefer college football. This is only important because of the final sections of the book where there are the top-10 lists (which are really top-10-NFL lists). Otherwise, it does an adequate job. The for-dummies part was adequate, but not extensive. The personal experience was good and kept my attention.</span>

                    <span>And that something is any mention of OT. I know that NFL (and even college) OT changes over the years, but Howie doesn't even mention it. It's almost amusing because for the "dummies" - well, we might as well assume after reading the book that there is no such thing as OT. It would not hurt to revise this book to at least state that at the end of regulation play, if the score is tied, the game goes into OT. No need to get specific (although what harm would that do?). An oversight on the publisher's behalf.</span>
