                    <span>This book does a decent job with the artistic approach to Fireworks, but it's real power lies in its technical explanations - how to use the automation and advanced development techniques for web graphic design. The author does a wonderful job of explaining some Macromedia mysteries, where certain features would otherwise not be explained. A good example of this is Macromedia's loose and changeable meaning of Alpha Transparency - This term can mean different things in different parts of the program, but it's not documented in the software docs. However, this book points this and other such idiosyncrasies out.
<br />
<br />The language is particularly good. The author seems to be in tune with exactly what you might get confused by and almost always takes great care to fill you in on the jargon or concepts. A couple of times he leaves you out in the cold, but only in one or two cases where the content is not critical. Overall, this is the best Fireworks book I've seen and I really hope they write a follow up edition.</span>

                    <span>In general computer books are not exciting read, but this book takes it to a new level. Poorly written without good examples. It talks about a function and what it does, but leaves you in the dark on HOW it is done. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book.<p>If I could of given it a 0 star rating I would of.</span>
