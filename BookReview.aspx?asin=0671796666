                    <span>In this book about Jordan I have always knew he was a role model to me ever since I was little. My father and I use to watch the games all the time, I was happy when they won. But as I got older I didn't watch the games that much, but I still liked him. For me I think I am similar to Jordan because we have the same mind because we like to score most of the points and keep the team on track. One thing that he hates the most is to lose and so do I because it makes me think I'm not doing a good enough job. Some of the other characters in the book seem to not care much about the games; they are Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant. During the playoffs, the Bulls were losing and they were screwing off during practice and Jordan didn't like that. I hate that too, but I say joke around at a certain time, but when it is time to stop and work, do so. I recommend everyone read this book because it tells you about how the ups and downs of a basketball star is and how it influences you to want to play.</span>

                    <span>Michael Jordan. You hear this name and you automatically know who he is. He is a star, a wonderful basketball player. This is a book about Michael Jordan, the rest of the Chicago Bulls, the coaching staff, and the owners of the Chicago Bulls in the turbulent 1990-1991 basketball season. In this book, the Chicago Bulls have to face their arch rivals, The Detroit Pistons many times through out the time of this book. The Detroit Pistons are also how the book got its name. The defense that the Pistons played was called the Jordan Rules. This book goes deep into detail of basketball. There is also a lot of language in it so if you don't like the cussing I wouldn't suggest that you read it because it does it a lot.<BR>I like this book a lot because I am a very big fan of Michael Jordan. He is one of most favorite basketball players in the whole history of the National Basketball Association. This book also goes into detail of the trading of players on the Chicago Bulls. Jerry Krause, who was in charge of all of this, was one of the rudest characters in the whole book. I guess you could say that he was the villain. This book talks about all of the Chicago Bulls. I takes you into the Game with all of the stars. To name a few.... Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippen, Horace Grant, Bill Cartwright, And John Paxton. It's a good book.</span>

                    <span>This is a GREAT book. It goes into detail about all of the players' lives and what they had to go through while playing with Jordan. You learn how much of a competitor Jordan is and what he thought of all the other players. Although this is Sam Smith's first book, it is still better than the other books about Jordan and the Bulls. I highly recommend it if you're a MJ or a diehard Basketball fan.</span>

                    <span>About as image conscious as the typical Hollywood megastar, Jordan always seemed to be managed by a closet full of PR handlers. Easily being the worlds most recognizable athlete since Ali and Pele, he was clearly as much a jumpshooter as a marketing phenomenon. There's a reason sneakers bearing his name still line store shelves. "The Jordan Rules" gets beyond the carefully honed image and presents Jordan as another superstar player (arguably the best ever, although the Big O with all his triple doubles could make a convincing case) who can be both generous and backstabbing towards his teammates and coaches. <P>His relationship with his brilliant head coach, Phil Jackson, makes for some of the most interesting reading and Smith brings a lot of the fascinating details to the table. Catching Jordan's ultra-competitive nature throughout, Smith wrote the type of book sports fans can truly appreciate for its candid look into the locker room. From the comraderie to the petty squables, "The Jordan Rules" is a terrific read, as are most controversial sports books that tell the truth.</span>

                    <span>With "The Jordan Rules," Sam Smith proves why he is one of the very best sportswriters in America. The book follows Jordan and the Bulls during their first championship season (1990-1991), before Jordan established himself as the most successful NBA player (in terms of championships) since Bill Russell. What is largely forgotten today is that in his first six years in the NBA was thought of as a selfish ballplayer who would never win a championship because he was not a "team player." Enter coach Phil Jackson, who in his first year would manage to convince his star player that in order for his team to win the championship, he would need to rely more on his teammates.<P>Great sports books are usually the case of the right writer (Smith in this case) being in a position to cover the right story at just the right time (Jon Krakauer's "Into Thin Air" is another example). That is certainly the case here. As a sports reporter for The Chicago Tribune, Smith had plenty of access to the team during that first championship run, and he interviewed all of the principals extensively. Fortunately, Smith pulls no punches. The book's title refers to the preferential treatment afforded to Jordan that was a constant source of irritation to his teammmates. Then-Bulls Center Bill Cartwright, for example, is memorably qoted as saying that Jordan is, "Maybe the greatest athelete ever to play any sport...He's just not a basketball player."<P>Overall, "The Jordan Rules" is that rare sports book that transcends the particular sport it covers and can be enjoyed by any sports fan.</span>
