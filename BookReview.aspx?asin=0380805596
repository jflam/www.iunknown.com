                <span id="Label1">Eighty-year-old George Castor promised he would never let his best friend Ralph die alone at the Silver Gardens Nursing Home--but Ralph passed on while George was away fishing. Distraught, guilt-stricken and seeking redemption, George buys a broken-down mansion in Looking glass, Oregon, paints it fire-engine red, and begins searching for other old folks to share it with him. Because George has made a new promise that will alter the course of the rest of his life. And, with the help of a miraculous old woman named Grace, he assembles a ragtag bunch of aging strangers, determined to make their last days on earth--and his own--an adventure.</span>

                    <span>For the first 50 or so pages, I was puzzled and uncomfortable with George's panicky reactions to some of the events in his unusual household of aged retirees. Suddenly, I realized George was desperately clinging to his new found "family" because of his paralyzing fear of dying alone, as had his dear friend. I could clearly see the action as scenes in a movie, and I was hooked with the story. (I began to visualize Ernest Borgnine as George, etc., and even wrote a letter to Mr. Borgnine urging him to read the book.)<BR> <P> For a first novel from one as young as Mr. Kleiner, I was touched by his tender handling of the characters, and impressed by his insights into their quaking souls and hearts. Wonderful work!</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful book! The characters are so real, I fell in love with them all. I laughed out loud many times, shed tears a few times, and didn't want the story to end. An excellent first novel--I can't wait for more from Mr. Kleiner! I would like to see Oprah pick this one for her club.</span>

                    <span>I really wanted to like this book and it sounded sooo promising.<BR>I love books about unusual people who don't do what is expected and strike out on their own for answers. But, there was never any satisfaction for the characters and me as the reader. I kept wanting George to find some peace, even if it was just the peace that comes from doing what's right for oneself. The book left me feeling like I had just enjoyed half a good meal and the rest of the meal was taken away. Satisfaction from completing the meal never set in.</span>

                    <span>Gregg is not only a wonderful author, but he is also my uncle. He is a wonderful uncle and when he first completed this book, I went down to his home, and stayed there for about a week at the time i was only 13 years old ( I think I was 13 somewhere close to that age anyway) I couldn't take my eyes off of the print. I loved the way the he described everything so clearly, that it was if you could really see the events unfolding in your mind. I loved how he made me laugh and he made me cry. I think it was a wonderful book, and I can't wait till he finishes another one. I love my uncle with all of my heart, and I don't just say that i loved his book because he is my uncle i say I loved it because i really did, and i think its time to read it again!!!</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book because I loved "Into the Forest" by Jean Hegland and was steered to this title. I was so disappointed. He writes like a Junior College Creative Writing student. The characters are all one-sided and the story builds to mediocre climax after mediocre climax. Save your money on this one.</span>
