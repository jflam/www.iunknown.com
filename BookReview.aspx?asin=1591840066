                <span id="Label1">Inside one of America's most remarkable success stories, from the bestselling author of <i>Jack Welch and the G.E. Way</i>. <br><br> Two of the toughest challenges for any company are leadership transitions and rapid growth. How do you replace an enormously popular and beloved CEO-especially one who started from scratch to create a national icon? And how do you maintain a rapid growth rate without losing the culture and focus of a small company? <br><br> Over the past ten years, since the death of the legendary Sam Walton, Wal-Mart has passed both challenges with flying colors. In 1992, it had revenues of $43.9 billion; now it's number one on the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies, with revenues of $218 billion. Sam Walton's successors have taken the company into far-flung new markets and new directions yet without losing the down-to-earth retailing culture that made Wal-Mart thrive in its early years, when its business model was truly revolutionary.   <br><br> Robert Slater, a highly respected business journalist and author, was granted unprecedented access to the company while writing <i>The Wal-Mart Decade</i>. He takes readers deep into the inner circle, where the big decisions are made about strategy and operations. And he weaves a fascinating, accessible story about the many challenges of the past decade and how Wal-Mart built on its founder's legacy to overcome them.</span>

                    <span>I had the privilege of meeting the author personally at his home in East Jerusalem -- he gave me a copy of this book as a parting gift, and I read it on a 11 hour flght to North America from Tel Aviv.  Of course, one views a book differently after a five hour in depth conversation with the writer, but understanding the writer's values and approach helps explain things.  Mr. Slater openly trades 'critical journalism' for access -- he is not out to do a hatchet job on his subjects; they know this, and thus allow him a closer peek at the inner workings of the business.  With this understanding in mind, if you are looking to validate the 'problems' of Wal Mart (of which there are many) you are likely to be disappointed; if you wish to see the world from the perspective of the Wal Mart executive team -- and then supplement it with more critical books -- you will significantly increase your understanding of this massive business, and its successful transfer to the professional executive management (with continuing family ownership interest).</span>

                    <span>This was an incredibly sophomoric book and a tremendous disappoinment. Although it gives a sanitized overview of Wal-Mart and its development, I personally believe the book worth reading about Wal-Mart, one which is balanced and looks at the pros and cons of an American triumph of commerce while giving an honest account of some of the techniques that made it possible, has yet to be written. All seem to come from the extreme left or right with an agenda to promote. As someone who lives and works in Bentonville and makes a living from doing business primarily with suppliers who answer to Wal-Mart, I am in a unique position to study the beast as well as my clients up close. I think what irritates people the most is that Wal-Mart has been very successful in presenting a persona as an "aw-shucks" company while behaving behind the scenes much like any other major corporation of its size and ilk. I laugh at the people who can't realize that Wal-Mart is appealing to the cycle of consumer evolution (when was the last time you saw a milkman delivering door to door? The business model simply doesn't work anymore)and don't realize that the greatest revenge against Wal-Mart isn't to prevent them from building a store, but simply not to use it after they have gone to the expense of building and stocking it. 
<br />Wal-Mart dosn't put small businesses out, rather most small business owners (of which I am one) don't understand it's their responsibility to stay ahead of market forces and consumer trends if they intend to offer a viable service and commodity in the marketplace.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed with this book. It has a reasonable overview of the history and growth of Wal-mart in the pre and post Sam Walton years. Unfortunately it takes a very high-level view (most of the figures it quotes can be gotten from the company's own annual reports or from other magazine articles), focusses more on culture (and even that is given short-shrift -- there is not a single dissenting view) than on business strategy or operational details. Perhaps this has been because the company is secretive, and perhaps by nature David Glass and Lee Scott (the Wal-mart CEO's that I assume were interviewed for the book) are low-key men -- but you get none of the retail, logistics, or IT-savvy insights that Wal-mart is "allegedly" exploiting to become the hypergrowth engine it is. Perhaps retail is all that the company purports it to be (sell product at value prices -- every day :), but I wish the author had peeked behind the covers and found a better story to tell.</span>

                    <span>This book is a public relations dream for Wal-Mart but a big disappointment for anyone who likes good, objective, analytical business reporting. It is obvious that the author became too enamored with his access to the current Wal-Mart management.  There is no balance in the book; it only presents the Wal-Mart view.  It doesn't really explain how Wal-Mart has grown since Sam Walton died.  It only recites "facts" - there's a lot of the "what" but there isn't a real probe of the "how" or the "why."  The topic of how Wal-Mart will continue to grow (or not) is fascinating - let's hope another author will tackle it.</span>

                    <span>Part 2 chapters 2-4 talks about Sam Walton (the founder) and how he started his retail empire. It talks a lot about him and how he managed Wal-Mart and his employees. In Part 1 chapter 1 it talked about where Wal-Mart is today. In Part 3 chapters 5-6 it talks about how the company followed Sam Waltons strategy after his deaf. Part 4 chapters 7-10 it talks about Wal-Marts growth strategy and how it went into different countries and  applying the Wal-Mart culture at each store. Part 5 chapters 11-13 talks about who defines Wal-Mart as in what other people think of the retailer and what the head leaders at Wal-Mart think and stuff like that. I don't know how else to say it. Part 6 chapter 14 talks about where the future will take Wal-Mart. Where Wal-Mart is headed. The best book to know about retailing. The best book on Wal-Mart ever since "Sam Walton Made In America" book. If you are interrested in Wal-Mart, retailing, or building a company or have a company of your own and need some advice on keeping a company strong this is a good book to read but I think the "Sam Walton Made In America" book is a better read. It talks more about building a company. This book pretty much talks about Wal-Mart after the founders deaf and how it kept up even a decade later. When Sam Walton passed away the company was worth 43 billion. <br>Part One*Wal-Mart Today<br>1 Celebrating in a Basketball Arena<br>Part Two*The Founder And His Legacy<br>2 The Man From Kingfisher<br>3 Give Me A Squiggly:Sam Walton's Culture<br>4 Avoid The Layers, Avoid The Frills<br>Part Three*A New Wal-Mart, A New Team<br>5 A New Management Team Follows Mr. Sam<br>6 A Strategy Of Growth<br>Part Four*Wal-Mart As A Growth Engine<br>7 The More Complex Wal-Mart Today<br>8 Applying The Culture A Store At A Time<br>9 Beyond The Seas:A New Outlet For Growth<br>10 Live Snakes And Turtle Races:Wal-Mart in China<br>Part Five*Who Defines Wal-Mart?<br>11 Mr. Logistics Takes Over<br>12 A Matter Of Reputation:Taking The Gloves Off<br>13 A Strategy For The Twenty-First Century: The New Openness<br>Part Six*Whither Wal-Mart?<br>14 Where The Future Will Take Wal-Mart<br>Acknowledgements<br>Notes<br>Index<br>Sixteen black and white photos are inside the book.
