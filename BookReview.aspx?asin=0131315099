Each chapter details all functions that are available and how to implement them.  The book is about 500 pages, but all chapters are useful.  You won't find any fluff in here.</span>

                    <span>This outstanding book integrates three treatments of the Standard C  library: The straight text from the standard, a commentary, and a prototype  implementation. All of these show Plauger at his best. <p>Even though the  implementation does not always look elegant (and unfortunately is not open  source), it provides a high quality implementation of each aspect of the  standard and is extremely instructive (I found the stdio formatting code  and the math routines particularly interesting).</span>

                    <span>Reference book for the C standard library which defines things like <signal.h>, <stdarg.h> etc. Every chapter deals with one C header file. It contains a lot of explanations, some extracts from the  standard and examples. One cannot possibly program in C without this book.</span>

                    <span>P.J. Plauger was operating at full-tilt when he wrote this excellent guide to the implementation and use of the C library. In particular, his treament (and history) of <stdio.h> is outstanding. Unfortunately, the Plauger of recent history is apparently being held captive by Microsoft. His "C/C++ User's Journal" is brimming with non-portable Windows topics of little value  to those interested in Standard C and, of course, the Unix platform...where C began. Plauger has apparently forgotten the roots of the C programming language. Nonetheless, this is among the five "must have" books for the serious C programmer</span>
