                    <span>The book, Seasons of Captivity: The Inner World of Pows by Amia Lieblich, recounts the experiences of ten Israeli POWs in Egypt captured during the War of Attrition. Absorbing and well written, this is one of the best nonfiction books I have read. Anyone who wishes to understand human nature and how adversity affects people should read this book. <P>The POWs themselves narrated the circumstances that led to their capture, and they even described their thoughts on the very moment they were ejecting from a plane, lying injured on the ground, and their transition from warrior to prisoner. The book also presented how the men were able to withstand the torture and interrogations, and how the POWs were able to cope in isolation, with all the filth and fleas around them. Later on, all the POWs were grouped together in one room and the book provides the readers an insight on how ten men from different backgrounds shared their world together in a crowded cell in an Egyptian prison for three an a half years. <P>The men also related the changes that took place in their lives upon their return to Israel and how they view their period of captivity many years later. <P>An interesting aspect of the book are the narratives of the spouses of POWs on how they lived on their own and how the imprisonment of their husbands affected their marriage. <P>Overall, I highly recommend this book. This is not just about the harsh experiences of men in a hostile environment, but it is also about hope, courage and survival.</span>
