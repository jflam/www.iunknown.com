                <span id="Label1"><div>A classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944--when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program--<i>The Road to Serfdom</i> was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.<br><br>First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, <i>Reader's Digest</i> published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.<br><br>After thirty-two printings in the United States, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher "revolutions" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.<br><br>F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.<br><br>On the first American edition of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>:<br>"One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay <i>On Liberty.</i> . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen."--Henry Hazlitt, <i>New York Times Book Review,</i> September 1944<br><br>"In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often--at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough--that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of."--George Orwell, <i>Collected Essays</i><br><br></div></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As all the previous reviewers of this book have noted, this is an historic and notable work. But as Hayek himself clearly says in the introduction (and in his now famous dedication of the book "to the socialists of all parties"), he wrote it specifically for early to mid-20th Century British labour enthusiasts to counter their preoccupation with central economic planning. As such, Hayek's thesis, that a socialist centrally-directed economy leads to oppression, either of the communist or fascist kind, is now largely taken for granted, not least because history has borne out his argument in large measure. So, if you are interested in 20th Century history, particularly western culture's thankfully brief flirtations with socialism at both extremes, then this book will be an excellent historical primary source.<P>As many authors and journalists have noted since the fall of the Soviet Empire, we are now all capitalists of some kind or another, and so while this book is an expert exposition on the dangers of central economic planning, it does not address the key issues in the current debate over the precise role of central government. Hayek is attacking central economic planning - the direction of when to sow and when to reap, in Jefferson's phrase - not central administration. Hayek is a libertarian, not an anarchist. Like Milton Friedman's "neighborhood effects", Hayek finds valid roles for central action (as distinct from purely economic planning) in regulating the actions of individuals and companies that are "harmful to the public welfare". For instance, in Chapter 5 of the book, Hayek rightly dispels the myth that monopolies inevitably result from the streamlining effects of technology, and replaces that fallacy with two valid reasons for their development: government protection and price collusion. Thus, Hayek recommends replacing public monopolies with strong anti-trust in support of the competitive price system. That would seem to be a valid and limited role for government.<P>As the author himself points out in the retrospective introduction to the 50th Anniversary edition, he originally saw this text as nothing more than diversion from his "more academic work", rather than as what it became - the first in a long and distinguished line of libertarian ideology. I do not point any of this out - that the book is a fine but dated critique of extreme central economic planning - to disparage the book, but I find that "The Road to Serfdom" is often quoted next to works of extreme parochialism and is done so to carry an ideological argument farther afield than this fine work can support.<P>Of course, the best recommendation is always this: read it and decide for yourself.</span>

                    <span>As I write this review, I'm saddened by the people I suspect should read this book but, for whatever reason, won't. After reading this book, I finally explicitly understand what I found troubling with socialism--it *requires* obedience to ensure adherence to the plan. As I read this book, I couldn't help notice the parallels between this book and "1984." Since that book was written in 1948, I suspect Orwell was directly influenced by this book. Furthermore, I found "The Socialist Roots of Naziism" a unique take on how socialism and naziism are brethren of the same cloth.<P>The only thing I found annoying were the periodic German and Latin idioms. This is an extremely minor complaint given the era as well as the intended (presumably academic) audience.<P>A final comment, Forbes' Ronald Bailey is quoted on the front jacket, "Nearly half a century ago, most of the smart people sneered with Friedrich Hayek published "The Road to Serfdom." The world was wrong and Hayek was right" If "most of the smart people sneered" then this book was truly a courageous and visionary work.</span>

                    <span>Hayek distinguishes liberty, or true freedom, from license and "serfdom." In the tradition of Adam Smith, he analyzes economic and political questions from moral and practical perspectives, with emphasis on individual liberty. His central conceit, that increasing government activity in the economic sphere would devalue individual dignity and stifle human progress, might seen overblown to some readers; it could be that the influence of this book on conservative political leaders and thinkers in the latter half of the American century may have corrected some of the impending problems Hayek foresaw. The Road to Serfdom is a pleasurable, thought-provoking read, persuasively written.</span>

                    <span>Hayek, the great communicator of libertarian thought, meticulously explains why every scheme aiming for an utopian goal through state power, whether it be the well-being of a "race" or the universal socialist Eden, _must_ end in tyranny.<P>At first glance, his analysis seems to apply to a bygone era, before "the end of history" where liberal democracy triumphs over statist terror. However, his words are as important today as ever - liberty is as threatened today by both the well-meaning and the self-interested. <P>The most interesting part of this book for me was his explanation of how Nazism, Fascism, and Communism are of the same cloth, not only in their effects, but also in their influences. Major figures in the National Socialist movement made their way there from a communist background, well documented in this book. <P>It is illuminating, and sad, how society still considers Nazism to be to the "right" of the political spectrum and communism to the "left", and therefore less evil than Nazism. This despite the fact that communism killed many more people than Nazism ever did. Compare only the 14 million Ukranians with the 6 million Jews, and then we have not even mentioned the Poles and the other statistics on the road to tyranny. <P>In fact, fascism, national socialism and communism are the same - they meet in the oppresion and killing of people. That should give pause to the left and the right today, but still they persist in their schemes to achieve their idea of "justice" at any cost - even if that cost is tallied in human lives. Killing civilians in Iraq is good for them - because their childrem might be free. Or, it is unfortunate that you will die because the FDA forbids you to try unapproved drugs, but, it is better for the other people, don't you see?</span>
