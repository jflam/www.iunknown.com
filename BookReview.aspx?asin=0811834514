More than an etiquette or personal grooming book, Better than Beauty tackles complicated social situations with delicacy: &#149; How to be kind to atrocious people &#149; How to avoid the gossip mill  &#149; How many drinks is too many drinks &#149; How to deflect unwanted advances from married men &#149; How much to tip &#149; And much, much more With good humor, authors Helen Valentine and Alice Thompson offer straightforward charm counsel, making it a cinch to win the admiration of friends, family, and suitors. Featuring original artwork, Better than Beauty proves that charm never, ever goes out of style.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. Yes, it may contain things that most would consider common sense. However, judging by the way many women act and dress today, this book is a gentle reminder of what being a "woman" is all about. It makes feminintiy fun again!!<P>I liked the advice on planning your wardrobe and the example they gave of a rich woman with plenty of expensive clothes but she didn't know how to "wear" them vs. the less than rich woman with inexpensive but well tailored clothes, who looked great. It's all about planning your purchases to expand your wardrobe and making the most of it, not how many clothes you have or how much they cost. <P>There are other cute little tidbits that make you think twice about your behaviour: such as...do you talk to loud? The art of "small talk/chit chat", what to tell and what not to tell. The importance of consideration, loyalty, sweetness and sympathy.<P>I'd strongly suggest adding this book to your etiquette book collection.</span>

                    <span>This book was originally published in 1938 and then again in 2002, but 90%-95% of this book's knowledge can still be applied today, proving that class never goes out of style. It is a fun read that reminds you of this fact with nice real life examples. You can obviously tell when some info may not apply. But most of the info is basic manner/etiquette type stuff.</span>

                    <span>This book was first published in 1938!!!!!!! The fact that it contains some outdated notions about body image and fashion should come as no surprise.</span>

                    <span>I think this book benefits already fashionable and charming people, rather than people who are in dire need of fashion or charm techniques. This book puts common sense and style together, which magazines and designers have yet figured out to do. I try to read the book every season, before shopping, in order to wash out all the nonsensical things magazines and designers like to tell you. Like 800 ways to make a Man Look at You!! OR Clothes, that make you stop Eating!!<P>This book makes you take a step back and re-evaluate your style choices. The best fashion book. Test of Time.</span>

                    <span>This little book cracks me up--love the retro look and read--but definitely not a serious 'how-to' for people seeking fashion advice. I have an original printing of it, and this reprint looks identicle--except the cover colors. Read it and you'll feel 1000% thrilled to be a chick of the '90s!</span>
