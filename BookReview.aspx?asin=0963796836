                <span id="Label1">The DietMinder is a deluxe food diary with plenty of room to record quantities and food counts (calories, fat, carbs, protein, etc.) of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. A special area for daily totals makes it easy to see at a glance how you are doing. Each "day" consists of two pages with space for exercise details, too.   There are other helpful sections in the book such as the Favorite Foods listing which provides food counts on over 100 common foods and has space to add your own favorite food information.  The Goals section of the DietMinder is also important. Here you can list your starting statistics, state your goals, and even paste a "before" picture. This is a great way to stay motivated! The DietMinder can be used with virtually any food or fitness program. It has been proven that keeping a food journal helps people focus and stay more committed to improving their eating habits. It really works!</span>

                    <span>I've always hated the idea of writing down my food intake and counting calories but this journal actually makes it a pleasure. Since I have gotten this book I am able to track every little thing which has been really great. Since starting this journal I have lost over 30lbs.<P>One aspect it provides is an incentive when I hit a plateau. Seeing how long it takes my body to acclimate to a lower weight makes getting over those plateaus just a bit easier. By tracking my progress in this much detail I can see where problems spring up and deal with them before they sabotage me. <P>Another plus that this journal has that I have not found in others is a space for fiber intake. As this is a very important part of my lifestyle change it has been a godsend.<P>While I wouldn't attribute my weight loss to keeping this journal, (that comes mostly from eating right and exercising) I will give credit to the designers for making it easy to use and a wonderful helper on my way to a healthier life. I will never be without one.</span>

                    <span>After giving birth to my baby I was committed to losing weight and becoming a stronger, healthier role model for my daughter. I read a great book, The Business Plan for the Body, and in it, the author wrote that most people fail on changing their eating patterns because they don't keep a food diary. He claims that until the routines of eating healthy are solidified, food journaling is key to success. I've done weight watchers and atkins and have never had great results. It has nothing to do with the validity of either of those programs, it's me! I cheat! For me, there's something different about writing it down. I feel more accountable. I've already lost 32 pounds and am more motivated and satisfied than ever before. This book is wonderfully organized. It has a place to write your long term goals, chart your long term success, and keep day to day track of your food and activity. Further, you can use only the parts of what works for your system, be it points, fiber, fat, carbs, or calories. At the end of each day, there's a place to circle whether or not you met your goal for the day; and I know this sounds SO first grade, but I'm always pumped to circle "YES"!</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure at what juncture I went from "Foxy" to "Boxy" but any delusions I might have had to the contrary were shattered when my teenage son quietly took me aside and whispered, "You're not wearing THAT, are you?"..."Oh...doesn't look good, huh?" "No, it doesn't." "I'm not that overweight!... Am I?"<P>Thus I started on the harrowing, fraught with temptations, Road to Recovery. Unfortunately, the Road was littered with diet books, diet plans, a lot of "I'll start Monday(s)" and a few too many candy bars. My 25 extra pounds wanted to stick to me like a bad hairstyle on a special day. <P>Finally, I realized that the only time I had any success in sticking to a diet was when I wrote down what I ate. But the 79 cent notebooks I used to record my daily food consumption always seemed to get lost after a few weeks and I would go back to my old eating habits. <P>Enter the DietMinder. Realizing that if I wanted to be healthy and lose weight I decided I needed to take more stringent measures. But I truly believe that "diets" don't work and the only sensible thing to do was to be sensible about how much and what, I ate. So after reading some of the other reviews here, I decided to order my own DietMinder. To make a long story short, IT WORKS! Here, at last, is a journal that gives you a permanent place to record what you eat, how much, calories, etc. There is a small, but certainly adequate, area in which to record what vitamins/supplements you take, the amount of exercise you do, etc. Without having to be fanatical, the journal offers a lot in the way of flexibility. You don't HAVE to write down how many grams of fat you eat or how many carbohydrates, but you CAN if you WANT to. You can record you blood pressure, your cholesterol, your measurements, etc., and there is a small "Favorite Food Facts" list in the back. <P>As of today, I am into my third DietMinder and it has been exactly six months since I started recorded what I eat. No special diets, just a complete awareness of what I am eating. The journal is just enough a reminder that I don't stray from writing down what I eat and gives you a psychological edge by making you aware whether you eating habits are healthy or not. [We all know that without some self-discipline that piece of cake you eat gives you an automatic excuse to eat everything because, after all, now you've blown everything]. The result is that, seemingly effortlessly, I've lost 21 pounds and can easily fit into Size 10 blue jeans (with the button, not the elastic waist)! <P>And to keep me honest, well, I anticipate buying many more DietMinders. As they say, try it, you'll like it.</span>
