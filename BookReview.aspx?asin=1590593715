                    <span>The author fills an important gap in writing this book. There are a lot of books about the programming language Python - good books and not so good books.  These books surely are scratching the topic of network programming.  But if you want to develop certain client-server applications in Python these books do not really help very much.
<br />"Python Network Programming" explains this topic in detail starting with quite basic things up to special applications. A certain number of examples completes this well written book.</span>

                    <span>This title accidentally popped up while I was searching for some book covering web programming in Python; bookmarked the link and went on with my quest. Later on, I found what I was looking for (Python Web programming by New Riders) and  decided to go back and glimpsed over the table of contents of the book that I'm reviewing now, "Foundations of Python Network Programming". Wow, what a surprise, I was really impressed by the wide coverage on network programming done by the author (even had some doubts at the beginning that this can't be done in a book with less than five hundred pages). Nevertheless, ordered the book and now I'm half way through it (the other book mentioned will have to wait :-). I can hardly think of a major topic about network programming, that is not covered in it, at least in some amount. Considering, otherwise vast area and complexity of network programming, this certainly is a great achievement by the author and a true testimonial on efficiency of Python language.
<br />
<br />Author has chosen a tutorial approach; quick introduction, example, commentary of the code, some more examples and comments, conclusion. No fluff and bluff.  On top of that technical reviewer has done a superb job, so far I didn't find any typos or non working code samples. Rare for a technical book nowadays but great for a change.
<br />
<br />I'm more or less python newbie with little or no background on programming with TCP/IP socket interface, so the first few chapters that are dealing with client/server sockets are more or less new to me (at least I know where to look up first if the need to program on this level arise), chapters covering programming different net clients are more familiar to me, and of the most interest, since this kind of stuff is more likely to cross my path. I think that intermediate level pythonists with some background on network programming and good skills to search the web for more in depth articles/documentation will benefit reading this book the most. Not to say that your Python library should be without this title if you're newbie like me,  on contrary,  you'll be glad to have this kind of a book at hand when you'll need it - and believe me you'll, sooner or later - just don't expect from a single source of information to become instant network hacker. 
<br />Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>For the time-crunched, in-need-of-a-quick-fix reader: This is an excellent, much-needed book. If you want to do network programming with Python or, for that matter, any scripting language (as many of the concepts here are basic, essential, and adaptable) buy this book and be happy. With clear code examples, concise text, and insightful attention to the needs of the target audience -- practical programmers in need of a quick intro -- John Goerzen dispenses with the dross and gives the reader a head-first survey of network programming.
<br />
<br />The book's title hits the target audience but doesn't, however, precisely characterize the thrust of the text. "Foundations" implies a broad structure on which to build and this book certainly addresses network programming in a broad sweep. Yet the book had a feel more accurately described as "learning by example" than a "foundations" approach might traditionally imply. Basic concepts are given a cursory overview, but if you wish to get to the nitty gritty details of sockets, protocols or network services then look for that sort of foundation elsewhere. Here you will, instead, get a few terms covered in just a few pages and then you're presented with working examples of Python code.
<br />
<br />By no means should this be construed as an overall weakness. This observation is only made in order to clarify Foundation's approach: quick and cut-to-the-chase. Chapters are short, averaging a little over 19 pages, and the overall feel is that of a "cookbook" with an emphasis on gentle explanation. If what you want is to get up and running, leaving small details for later if necessary, then you've come to the right place. But perhaps "Python Network Programming by Example", or "The Joy of Python Network Programming", would be more fitting.
<br />
<br />The author, who has been a member of the Debian GNU/Linux development team since 1996 (the Unix/Linux bias shows slightly here, with some space devoted to to inetd and forking), does the learn-by-doing reader a great favor by providing copious working examples of readily grasped code which cover straightforward solutions to typical problems or situations with an emphasis -- a very nice emphasis -- on error-checking and recovery from the various hiccups of network programming. Nothing teaches like good code with astute attention paid to explaining key concepts and usual corner cases, and this is the case here.
<br />
<br />The writing style is a little dry. That said, the prose is both clear and concise and does a good job of speedily presenting new, potentially tricky concepts, another notable strength. Chapters five, "Advanced Network Operations", and seven, "XML and XML-RPC", are both good examples.
<br />
<br />The first five chapters, which form the first section, "Low-Level Networking", get the reader started with sockets, servers, and DNS. These are probably the only essential chapters of the book, especially if the reader is new to these topics, in that they reveal Python's general approach to networking within the standard library. After that the reader would do well to, more or less, hop around among the remaining chapters as needed. Part Two covers Web services, with some nice coverage of XHTML and XML parsing. Part Three addresses E-mail services: MIME, SMTP, POP, and IMAP. Part Four takes a general shot at FTP, database clients, and (a very brief) chapter on SSL. Part Five is on server-side frameworks, covering a three items, SocketServer, SimpleXMLRPCServer, and CGI, all which come as standard modules, along with an introduction to mod_python, which does not. Part Six is on multitasking, lending an overview of threading and forking, and asynchronous communication.
<br />
<br />That's a lot. Some subjects, like SSL and async, can't be covered in a great deal of detail given the space provided, and if this is your first exposure to these topics, you'll be left wanting. But you will be effectively introduced.
<br />
<br />The Twisted Framework (http://www.twistedmatrix.com) is discussed in Chapter 12, IMAP, which is nice, and is touched on again in the final chapter on async. It would have been nicer to see some more Twisted coverage, since Twisted is one of the most elegant and distinctly Pythonic approaches to networking, but there's material available on the Web and, again, this gets you pointed in the right direction.
<br />
<br />The only final criticism that might be leveled about the book is that, at times, some of the approaches don't seem particularly "Pythonic". The database client chapter, for example, doesn't cover the common Python approach of operater overloading, such as overloading __getitem__ in order to wrap a SQL SELECT statement. In this and certain other parts of the book, if you are not new to some only moderately advanced concepts in Python, then the reader will be able to see where certain choices were made between the notions of "Foundations" (and how foundational to be) and "Python" (and just how pythonic to get).
<br />
<br />Criticisms aside, this is a fine book, and a fine complement to Apress's rather excellent "Diving Into Python" by Mark Pilgrim. "Foundations" fills a fundamental need for this information to be aggregated into a cohesive resource, and the book's no-nonsense, effective approach should win over both new Python converts looking to implement their first network client or Web site, or experienced Pythonistas who desire quick information at their fingertips. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I heartily recommend it.</span>
