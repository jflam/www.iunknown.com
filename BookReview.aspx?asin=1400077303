                    <span>Ron Chernow's Titan is a superb piece of biographical writing.  In the tradition of David McCullough, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and other distinguished popular historians, Chernow writes at epic length, yet never fails to entertain and inform.  Chernow's research is meticulous (never pedantic) and his writing is crisp throughout.  Though not a scholarly biography (no slight intended!), Titan is a richly detailed and sympathetic recounting of one of history's most fascinating lives.  A few years ago I saw Ken Burns'(?) outstanding documentary on Rockefeller, Sr.  In many ways, Titan reads like an extended gloss on the documentary: similarly voiced, similarly paced, equally evocative.  I don't mean to suggest that Titan is at all derivative, but rather that it reads with all the thrills, satisfaction, and fascination of a great documentary.  
<br />
<br />I was disappointed to reach the end of Titan, but am delighted that Chernow, besides being extremely talented, is also wildly prolific.  I've already picked up his Morgan, Warburgs, and Hamilton.  Can't wait to read them all and see where his interests lead him next.      </span>

                    <span>The University of Chicago and the Riverside Church are two institutions who came into existence through Rockefeller largesse.  John D. Rockefeller was a true force in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century America.  His strategic-thinking in the area of business was exceptional, his one-sidedness notable.  Not everyone considered him a force for the good.  He did not distribute money to his children upon their maturity, but kept them on allowances.  His daughters, Alta and Bessie, married cold, remote, self-absorbed men.  Standard Oil attained its peak influence in the 1890's.  
<br />
<br />Under Theodore Roosevelt Rockefeller's name became short-hand for corporate villainy.  Ida Tarbell began her series on Standard Oil in McClure's Magazine in 1902.  Ida Tarbell's series may be the most impressive thing about Standard Oil.  The rise of Standard Oil was based upon its relationship with the railroads.  There were secret kickbacks.  Rockefeller was both the brains of Standard Oil and a monarch of philanthropy.  Moving from one mode to another he experienced no self-dividedness.  Trying to square philanthropy with self-reliance, he contributed to education and medical research.  His work was influenced by the social gospel movement.  Frederick t. Gates headed the philanthropies.  
<br />
<br />In retirement Rockefeller devoted about one hour a day to philanthropy.  Winston Churchill felt that Rockefeller's endowment of research was a sort of milestone.  In 1907 Standard Oil received a record fine of $29.4 million.  Reporters saw in Rockefeller a poker face, but there was deep rage.  An appeals court reversed the fine and found in imposing the fine there was an abuse of judicial discretion.  During the 1907 Panic in October Rockefeller seemed civic-minded when he pledged half his wealth to stave off economic collapse.  
<br />
<br />Purloined letters of Archbold, Rockefeller's successor, concerning bribery resulted in scandal publicized by the Hearst papers.  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. was shocked.  He resigned from the Standard Oil Board in 1910. The company was dismantled in 1911 pursuant to a Supreme Court decision. Rockefeller brought an unprecedented scale and scope to the charitable trust.  He contemplated the formation of a giant foundation.  The Rockefeller Foundation was attuned to the optimism of the Progressive Era.  Initially the focus was on public health and medical education.  
<br />
<br />I have not sufficient space to outline for the reader the immense task undertaken by Chernow to set forth the social and economic context of Rockefeller's extensive business and charitable activities.         </span>

                    <span>I just got this book and am only 64 pages into it, and I already find myself ordering every book Mr. Chernow has written.  I've read biographies on Bill Gates, Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Donald Trump, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Clinton, and many more, but this is by far the best-written biography I have every come across.  This book is number 3 on my list of all time favorites right behind Atlas Shrugged and How to win friends and Influence people.  I strongly recommend this book.  It's been so interesting, that I find myself underlining passages on nearly every page.  Mr. Chernow is a superb author, who has an excellent grasp of his subjects.  This book delves into Rockefeller's character like no other book I've read, and paints an excellent portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of our time.  A must have for anyone exhibiting even the slightest interest in John D. Rockefeller.  </span>

                    <span>Most earlier biographers either demonized Rockefeller (Ida Tarbell)or glorified him (Allan Nevins); Chernow stays pretty much in the middle. Rockefeller, a pious Baptist, was ruthless in his business dealings, developing Standard Oil into a major world monopoly; at the same time, of course, he gave millions of dollars away in his old age. Chernow's book is exciting and superbly interesting. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>No doubt about it, the author did some very thorough investigation.  This very thick book takes you through the story of this very fascinting (and yet surpirisingly almost forgotttes) man named John D Rockefeller.  Most people now about the family and the anme, but few know about the man who really started the fiancial empire.  He was a clever businessman, a somnehawt bizarre person, very determined, and quite intellignet.  The book is good, but it is really long and detailed.  </span>
