                <span id="Label1">For more than twenty-five years, An Introduction to General Systems Thinking has been hailed as an innovative introduction to systems theory, with applications in computer science and beyond.  Used in university courses and professional seminars all over the world, the text has proven its ability to open minds and sharpen thinking.    <P>Originally published in 1975 and reprinted more than twenty times over a quarter century -- and now available for the first time from Dorset House Publishing -- the text uses clear writing and basic algebraic principles to explore new approaches to projects, products, organizations, and virtually any kind of system.  <P>Scientists, engineers, organization leaders, managers, doctors, students, and thinkers of all disciplines can use this book to dispel the mental fog that clouds problem-solving.  As author Gerald M. Weinberg writes in the new preface to the Silver Anniversary Edition, "I haven&#146;t changed my conviction that most people don&#146;t think nearly as well as they could had they been taught some principles of thinking.&#148;   <P>Now an award-winning author of nearly forty books spanning the entire software development life cycle, Weinberg had already acquired extensive experience as a programmer, manager, university professor, and consultant when this book was originally published.  <P>With helpful illustrations, numerous end-of-chapter exercises, and an appendix on a mathematical notation used in problem-solving, An Introduction to General Systems Thinking may be your most powerful tool in working with problems, systems, and solutions.</span>

                    <span>Weinberg distills the essence from von Bertalanffy's classic and manages to present it in a very accessible fashion.  The book has been out of print for quite a while so it is great to see a new edition.  The message and information contained in here, although originally published in 1975, is now more relevant than ever.<p>Weinberg covers many aspects of systems theory beginning with the main stumbling block with the present scientific paradigm:  the idea that the universe is mechanistic.  His treatment is much more general than Robert Rosen's in "Life Itself" but still conveys why the mechanistic notion is flawed.<p>He then outlines the general systems theory approach before leading into the idea that a system is simply a way of looking at the world.  He then outlines the principle of indifference.  This leads straight into two sections outlining various aspects of making observations.  Finally he discusses behaviour and then some general systems questions.<p>Throughout the book he uses many examples from disparate fields in conjunction with questions for further research.  It is great to see someone who doesn't preach systems but actually uses the ideas.<p>Definitely a must-read as we decided how to solve the myriad of issues before us.</span>

                    <span>In computing, a timeless classic is anything that is worth reading for any reason other than to obtain a historical context after five years. If that still holds true after twenty five years, then it is truly an extraordinary piece of work. That label applies to this book. It is not about computing per se, but about how humans think about things and how "facts" are relative to time, our personal experience and environmental context. <br>  Human thinking is a complex operation and that is the point of this book. The problems and examples presented are not those in computing, but problems in how we think about the world and how that world can be different from person to person. In many ways, Weinberg anticipates the development of the science of chaos, where small changes lead to disproportionate large changes. His example of the "small" change of a single character  is a classic. A man was considering the purchase of a piece of real estate, but when told the cost was fourteen million dollars, sent the response by telegram, "No, price too high." However, somehow a character was dropped, so the agent received the message, "No price too high", purchased the property and so a classic error was invented.<br>  Weinberg uses science and mathematics as the genesis point for most of his examples. The laws of thermodynamics, chance and simulations in state spaces are used to demonstrate the points. As someone with a wide background in science, I found his examples of how scientific thought gives us an anchor but yet alters over time excellent learning material. Thought problems are included at the end of each chapter and they cover many different areas. Some involve mathematics, others science and many could be the point of a vigorous philosophical debate. Together they form the best collection of thought experiments and points of contention that I have ever seen gathered together in one location. <br>  This is a book that is a true classic, not in computing but in the broad area of scholarship. It is partly about the philosophy and mechanisms of science; partly about designing things so they work but mostly it is about how humans view the world and create things that match that view. This book will still be worth reading for a long time to come and it is on my list of top ten computing books of the year.</span>

                    <span>If I had to select a book that has influenced my thinking most, it would be this one.  This book alone spurred my interest in Systems Research, and is one that I have gone back to re-read many times.  <p>Gerald Weinberg has  taken the essence of General Systems Theory and formatted it for the  masses.  His insight into the methodology, and his ability to combine humor  with explanation makes this a must-read in the field.  While many of the  examples are programming-based, that does not detract from the usefullness  of this work.  <p>The publisher needs to understand the importance of this  work, and put it back into print!</span>

                    <span>This book is a quiet little masterpiece, where its author shares his observations of his world in a personal way. With the same light touch, he also delves into the thought structures behind these observations.  This is practical scientific philosophy with a folksy, conversational, almost homespun, style that never gets lost in abstractions or strays far from living examples in everyday life. Its lack of academic bluster and techo-pomposity is refreshing and informal,  yet the insights have a power that cannot help but affect your own thought processes. An example ( for me) is the classification of all systems into three types: Determinate, Medium-number, and Statistical. This notion has proven to be fantastically useful over the years. Several other observations took some nerve to put into print. The net effect of the book is, at its end, also inspirational.  Here is someone showing all of us how we can deal with the big, bad world in a friendly, humourous, courageous, and empowered way.</span>
