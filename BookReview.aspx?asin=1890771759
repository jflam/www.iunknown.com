                <span id="Label1">Whether focused with intimacy on the unblinking and thoughtful eye of a mountain lion or on the moon that seems delicately balanced atop a distant ridge, Dennis E. Anderson lays before us an unusual bay that is full of surprise and unexpected delight. We immediately recognize the photographs in his book as truthful yet exotic at the same time. Individually they move or even startle. Together they present a Bay as no one person has ever seen it: from the deck of a boat or the seat of a small helicopter, from beneath the surface of the water or through the blades of marsh grasses, from dozens of angles and perspectives. As we move through the book, our senses are awakened.  <P>With intelligent and knowledgeable text, _Hidden Treasures of San Francisco Bay_ will enlarge our vision, expand our understanding and, it is hoped, inspire us with a desire to protect and cherish, to become caretakers of what is surely one of the great wonders of the world&#151;a wonder, it turns out, that we are just beginning to explore.</span>

                    <span>"The manner in which one sees or conceives of something," is a vision. Dennis Anderson's vision is colored by a deep and abiding love of nature's beauty. Dennis' vision is shaded by his understanding of reality. Dennis' vision is textured by love and pain, happiness and sorrow, in ways that few could appreciate. <P>Thus, Dennis' vision of San Francisco Bay is unique. That vision touches us deeply because Dennis' emotions are not hidden. He has opened his heart to you, knowing that by sacrificing himself to criticism, he can enable you and others to find the true beauty in the world that surrounds us all.<P>By giving close attention to the many people Dennis has included in his photography, you can see that these are the people who share his emotional ties to the San Francisco Bay. They tread the land and paddle the waters daily. They've seen it at its best and worst. They cherish the past and dread the future. You can read their emotions in their expressions.<P>Explore Hidden Treasures because you think San Francisco Bay is beautiful. Study the photography, because you love art. Keep Hidden Treasures close, and go back to its pages often; because a kind and gentle man has poured more than fifty years of experience into every photo. You will learn more about yourself as you learn more about the man behind the camera.</span>

                    <span>A fabulous book with a delicate appreciation for the San Francisco Bay. It makes you aware of the delicate balance between the people that live all around it - and the surrounding complex ecosystem that is trying to survive amidst it all. It is a reminder to open your eyes and pay attention to the beauty that so many take for granted. Let's hope that Dennis Anderson's visions make more people aware that we simply can't beleaguer the wildlife that was no doubt there long before man. He has a keen eye for light and colour. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>I just got through reading and looking at the beautiful photography of an area that I am very familiar with. Yet I found that I learned a great deal about facets of the Bay that I din't know existed. It is going to make some wonderful gifts for my family and friends. The views are spectular and Anderson has been able to catch the light and color so effectively.</span>
