                <span id="Label1">She's such a famous interior decorator she goes by one name: Clodagh. She designed Robert Redford's Manhattan townhouse and regularly revamps the offices of entertainment-industry bigwigs. <I>Total Design</I> introduces readers to her design philosophy--a highly ambitious and authoritative set of quasi-spiritual suggestions about space that  reveal why she's such a guru. In the introduction she writes, "Often when we contemplate a space and how it can be improved we begin with the material (What kind of flooring do I want? Should a buy a new sofa or re-cover the old one?) rather than the spiritual (How can this room help me live better? What am I not getting from my home that I could be getting?)." Incorporating ideas as varied as feng shui, aromatherapy, and color therapy, Clodagh resembles a New Age spiritualist--borrowing elements from various religions to form her own system. Her book is as much about quality of life as it is about what to buy, and much of her advice is indispensable: where to hang "provocative" artwork (in walk-by areas), what to do with "troublesome" windows that look out on the neighbor's house (replace clear with filtered glass), and how to contemplate your space so you understand its virtues. This is an ideal book for amateur designers or do-it-yourself types seeking serious inspiration.<I>--Emily White</I> </span>

                    <span>As a book by a high-end designer about her work this is a fantastic peak into her inner design thoughts. For the huddled masses who will never be able to afford such designs there is excellent general guidance in the extensive list of questions in the last section. As with almost all design books, there is no direct help with designing for a modest home. That is partly because the interior design profession, by its own admission, only reaches about 4% of their potential market, and that 4% rarely includes modest homes.<P>However, if you have the imagination and creativity required for interior design then this book will stimulate ideas for modest homes. If you don't have artistic talent then buy the book, hire a qualified designer, and point them to the photos you like. Most of the effects presented by Clodagh can be done inexpensively. You don't need to order a $17,000 couch to have a living room that fits your desired mood.<P>- jim</span>

                    <span>I agree with the author's premise and was looking forward to getting this book so that I could make the most of my home. Unfortunately, the examples tend to come from the Rich & Famous. The author name-drops and shows extremely expensive homes and furnishings. I'd like to see this author do the same kind of book showing solutions for ordinary American homes using typical American furnishings. I don't mean cheap. I just mean typical. If the author's answer is that the ideas can be "translated" easily to any budget or home, then why doesn't the author SHOW such translations?</span>

                    <span>If you can't get Clodagh for your project directly, you can still incorporate many aspects of her original and wonderful design style for your home. It's very well laid out with Clodagh outlining in clear detail how to approach every room and situation imaginable. The book is also filled with one gorgeous photograph after another of Clodagh's work. An original book from an original woman and a treat for the eyes and mind. Your home will be a happier that you got it!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>From the lush photographs, it's obvious that Clodagh's usual design client is not the likes of me (a student). The photos and text detail the author's design process for people such as Robert Redford and recording studio executives, who naturally have somewhat larger budgets than my own, and live in fabulous penthouses in Manhattan and have guest homes in California.<P>The photos of the homes are a bit intimidating, but the author's attitude is not. She seems to genuinely want every person's home to be as beautiful and functional as possible, working within the boundaries of location and budget. And even if your own preference is not for the rather minimalist, Zen-like look she favors, her design principles are adaptable to any style. <P>Toward that end, her workbook at the end of the book is great. It is basically a list of questions to ask yourself during the redesign process, and takes into consideration things like a home office and childrens' needs. I found it especially useful during my move to a new apartment. Asking these questions helped to solidly define what I needed in a home, and consequently narrowed down my choices to a manageable number.<P>My only minor criticisms are of the layout and the feng shui. The text is frequently interrupted with pages of lists and the author's thoughts on color, which makes for rather disjointed reading. And the author relies very heavily on feng shui, which is baffling is you're unfamiliar with it, as I am.</span>

                    <span>Clodagh's Total Design is more than just a design book. It's beautiful photography and inspirational instructions made me aware of the importance of feeling comfortable and calmed by my environment. The workbook in the back of Total Design was especially helpful in applying Clodagh's "Four C's" to my home. I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in design as well as those wanting to improve the quality of their surroundings!</span>
