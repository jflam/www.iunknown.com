                <span id="Label1"><I>Designing Active Server Pages</I> provides an important tool for  often-overworked ASP programmers: a set of techniques for making the wisest use  of the technology in a production environment. Targeting an audience of readers  who already are seasoned in ASP, author Scott Mitchell explores techniques for  producing "reusable and robust ASP applications."<p>  Presentation and example compose the approach here, with concise tables of  information and descriptions that make the book a fast read. Mitchell explores  the benefits of the VBScript 5.0 scripting engine, and illustrates how to  exploit the new RegExp object fully and build object-oriented code by using  VBScript classes--another welcome addition to the coding platform. ASP  programmers will find techniques for which they've been longing, such as  centralized error-handling pages and reusable database administration forms. <p>  Creation of and best practices for implementing COM components, useful standard  components (like the Content Linker and AdRotator), and third-party components  (such as ASPEncrypt and SA-FileUp) are discussed. <I>Designing Active Server  Pages</I> doesn't stop with mere descriptions of these components, but also  provides solutions for common needs, such as uploading files to binary fields in  Microsoft SQL Server and sending encrypted e-mail. <p>  With its advanced techniques and practical perspective, this book is perfect for  those who look to stay on the cutting edge of ASP programming. <I>--Stephen W.  Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Choosing a server-side scripting language  <li>Exception handling <li>Regular expressions <li>Building reusable forms  <li>Reusable database administration pages <li>COM overview <li>Lesser-known  Microsoft COM components <li>Important third-party COM components</ul></span>

                    <span>As a web developer, I've been using ASP for a couple years and would consider myself and intermediate ASP programmer. I've built up a collection of books on the topic, mostly referring to WROX books for their reference quality.<P>ASP isn't my primary function at my job, so I don't get to work daily on developing and using my skills. I've recently been looking to improve my ability in this area, and inject some new ideas into the way I accomplish things in code. This book was the perfect answer!<P>If you're new to ASP or programming, you'll appreciate the emphasis on structure and conventions. If you're experienced with ASP, you'll appreciate the ideas presented here. I especially like the work on code reusability.<P>This is definitely one of the best ASP books I've seen in a long time.</span>

                    <span>I have around 20 titles in my personal library which focus directly or indirectly on ASP. This is simply the best. It isn't an introduction to the language -- there are several good ones for that -- it is more about using sound program design methodology to accomplish some of the more complex tasks facing ASP programmers, such as content management systems, reusable forms, and eCommerce.<P>If you have any programming experience in other languages and are moving to ASP, get this book. If you are just learning what an Active Server Page is, then it is not for you, but if you plan to do anything more than fairly simple pages in ASP, get it, even if you don't think you're ready for advanced stuff. <P>Scott gives good examples, clear explanations, and lays out methodology that will help you no matter what your level of experience. It's one of the best bargains out there in technical books.</span>

                    <span>This VERY young author has done something seasoned technical writers twice his age have not often done: written an extremely useful, information and well thought out book, with plenty of implementable examples, and all in a book of less than 350 pages. It so often seems that these kinds of books suffer from "mission creep", and hence bloat into the 1500-page monsters we so often see. Because he was able to keep the scope of his task clearly in mind, he also provides a thorough "Further Reading" section at the end of each chapter, where he provides links to a number of on-line articles. (Yes, you could find these yourself, but how great that a professional in the field has taken the time to find them seek them out for you -- and I was glad all that extra stuff wasn't in the book itself.)<P>The one complaint I have is that the source code for this book, which you can download from the O'Reilly site, is a chaotic, inextricable mess of files with arbitrary names that are impossible to link to any specific examples in the book (I wouldn't mind that the file names are arbitrary, if he told you in the book which file a given example was associated with -- but no luck there). Really inexcusable.</span>
