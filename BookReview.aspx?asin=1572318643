                <span id="Label1">The first of the three volumes in this box set, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Language Reference</I> compiles all the language features of today's Visual Basic, from basic data types and built-in control types (their methods, properties, and events) to advanced material (such as conditional compilation directives). If you've ever had trouble remembering a string function or working with Visual Basic Variant, this first volume can help you get the right information fast.<p> The second volume, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Component Tools Guide</I>, isn't a dictionary, but an in-depth, useful tutorial to Visual Basic programming--and even to deploying ActiveX components, the technological heart of Visual Basic. After a basic tour of ActiveX controls, the text introduces each of the more than two dozen built-in ActiveX controls that ship with Visual Basic 6, from fancy widgets, such as the new DateTimePicker and Coolbar controls, to older favorites, such as the Animation and UpDown controls.<p> <I>Component Tools Guide</I> looks at the considerable support for building ActiveX components--ActiveX servers (in both DLL and EXE formats), custom reusable ActiveX controls, and even ActiveX documents (suitable for use inside Internet Explorer 4). This guide discusses support for Internet applications using Dynamic HTML (DHMTL), how to connect to data sources in ActiveX controls, and how to build server-side components for Internet Information Server (IIS). You can still create "fat clients," but this reference shows you the better way to develop with Visual Basic using ActiveX and the Internet.<p> The last volume of the set, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Controls Reference</I>, returns to reference mode with a convenient listing of the properties, events, and methods for more than two dozen standard Visual Basic controls, from user interface objects such as grids, list, and tree views to Internet transfer controls and those that provide database access. The book clearly explains each control's property, method, and event. <I>--Rich Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I've always enjoyed the Programmers guide's MS puts out for the dev tools. The recent one for VB6 is no exception. It's a very good book, written in a captivating way.<P>Sadly, the reference library is much different. I've had great difficulty staying focused enough to read through the component tools guide (volume 3). It's written in a very boring, and not very educational manner. The programmer's guide guides you through new concepts by having you type in examples you can execute. I think this is a good way to become a self taught VB programmer. The component tools guide doesn't work the same way. It gives you the same step by step instructions, but they are incomplete, and cannot work on their own. <P>Example (p854) : "2. In the Add HTML Template dialog box, select the HTML page you want, then click OK."<P>The programmers guide would walk you through creation of an HTML page that could become functional after this step. Instead the component tools guide gives you this step without any help on the HTML page that can be functional. Sure, a code example is included on the MSDN CD, but it doesn't have the same learning value if you don't create it yourself. Also, what good is this step 2 when you already have the code sample?<P>People who have learned from the MS programmers guides will probably understand what I'm saying here. Those who have not are probably lost.</span>

                    <span>Coupled with the Programmer's Guide, these are the best books a VB developer can own. Yes they are the online help files in print form, but some of us still like to hold a book, rather than read the computer.<P>They contain exhaustive information on EVERY command in VB6, ALL the standard tools that ship with VB6, and detail components like DHTML documents, ActiveX documents, ActiveX controls, and even (a little) IIS apps.<P>I am confused by some other reviews: mine have an index, everything is laid out in multiple font sizes and weights, and it's all very well laid out and easy to understand.<P>I have been developing with VB for over a year and a half and I still use these books on almost a daily basis.</span>

                    <span>This book is not at all intended to be a novel, its a reference. I will admit that this book is not ordered as would have thought, although there is some logical way to work with the book. This is a reference that I trust and use, I am one to stand up for this book, it has a lot of example code. I would hope that any intermedite programmer would consider this book, it holds a hell of a lot more example code than many others.</span>

                    <span>There is less information in this book than is supplied in MSDN help function. In addition it is presented in a far less ogranized manner. If you are buying this book to clarify or get an overview of commands, functions, objects etc. You will be disappointed. It's like a history book in alphabetical order. Rather useless since history happens chronologically. At least the MSDN help screens have a contents tab that lists the functions, objects, etc. This book does not. Page 1 starts first with the A's and the last page ends on the Z's. Virtually nothing before or after. Not even an index or a simple command overview (list of commands, objects etc). You better know what you are looking for before you open this book. Buy it and you will see what I mean.</span>
