                    <span>The book "I AM THIRD" written by Gale Sayers is the best autobiography I have ever read. This book is compassionate, emotional, and sometimes comic. It tells the story of a man with such love for a sport when a knee injury almost destroys his career and all the friends he didn't even know he had. One letter a boy wrote really touched Gale emotionally. Linda, Gale's wife, gives Gale all the support a wife could. In 1970 Gale was named the Most Courageous Player of the Year. This book also talks about the friendship between Gale Sayers and Brian Piccilo, both famous players for the Chicago Bears. Gale Sayers was a "great running back on the field and a great friend off the field" says Brian. The story includes the importance of faith in Gale Sayer's life. He concludes "The lord is first, my friends are second, and I am third." I recommend this book for any young football player who has BIG dreams.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books around. It teaches readers to try never give up, even if the future is bleak. It also deals with the sexual tensions of younger people and the problem of masterbation. But through the trials and tribulations, Gale gets over his problem and continues to live his life. This book sends a powerful message to readers and hits close, very close to the reader.</span>

                    <span>This review is on the book called "I Am Third". In this book it tells mostly about Gale Sayers' football career and some of Brian Piccolo's or Pic. The reason this book is called "I Am Third" is because he says that "God is 1st,my friends are 2nd,and I am 3rd". To understand this book you might have to know a little about football. If you like football stories I would reccomend you read "I Am Third".</span>
