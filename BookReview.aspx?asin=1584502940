                <span id="Label1">OpenGL is the premier environment for developing 2D and 3D graphics and game applications. The interface has been the choice of game programmers, primarily because of its cross-platform operability, but also, because it is constantly evolving to keep pace with hardware advances in the form of extensions. Until now, the game industry was lacking one single, concise reference to help make sense of the dozens of extensions available.  <P>The OpenGL Extensions Guide provides a valuable resource that concentrates specifically on the extensions most important to developing modern 3D games.  The book describes extensions in groups that modify or augment similar components of the base OpenGL architecture.  <P>Key Features: <BR>* Discusses all of the essential OpenGL extensions in detail and provides an invaluable reference tool to the OpenGL programmer <BR>* Each extension is divided into a discussion section and one or two reference sections named "New Functions" and "Extended Functions."  The "New Functions" section provides a detailed description of the new functions defined by an extension, and the "Extended Functions" section describes how existing OpenGL functions are augmented or modified by the extension <BR>* Concentrates on practical usage of extensions and discusses underlying mathematical details only where necessary <BR>* Discusses extensions sanctioned by the OpenGL ARB (Architecture Review Board), multi-vendor extensions, and vendor-specific extensions developed by Nvidia Corporation and ATI Technologies, Inc.</span>

                    <span>I've often been frustrated by the fact that it's often hard to find good documentation for OpenGL extensions. The information in the extension registry, as well as in the latest OpenGL spec (for extensions that have been promoted to the core) is generally intended for OpenGL implementers, not OpenGL developers, so there usually isn't much about how or why you would use the extension. Sometimes, you can find papers and demos from one of the hardware vendors, such as Nvidia or ATI, but more often than not, you're left figuring it out on your own.<P>So when I heard about this book, I was really looking forward to it. Given the high quality of the author's other works, I expected it to immediately take a place on my desk.<P>This book is essentially an expansion of the information contained in the extension registry. It's considerably more user-friendly, the explanations are more detailed, and it conveniently groups the extensions by their functional area. However, it really doesn't discuss how or why you would use each extension in a game or graphics application. Nor does it include any demos, or even sample code. These factors keep the book from being as useful as it could have been.<P>Overall, this is a good book, and it provides a great reference for the extensions it covers, but it could have gone farther with showing you how to use them.</span>

                    <span>Finally! this book is a long overdue alternative to reading the raw extension specs on opengl.org. It covers all of the extensions I've ever needed, and a few more that I didn't even know existed. The only thing I can complain about is that is doesn't have anything on pbuffers, but don't get me wrong, this book is nice and meaty and is a great resource for opengl programmers. Definitely recommended!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The reason why I only give this book 3 stars is that the book can only be used as a reference to OpenGL extensions. There is no demos or even source-code provided with the book, which makes the book extremely hard to learn from because you won't find any working code, just each extension described. Being an experienced OpenGL programmer this is not a huge problem for me, but since I believe many beginner OpenGL programmers find this books topic interesting, I thought I would warn you. Eric Lengyel is a great writer and his Mathematics for Game Programmers is a must-have. So before buying this book, please make sure that you are skilled enough to learn from a reference-book with no demos!</span>
