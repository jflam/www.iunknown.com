                <span id="Label1">Attain real solutions for current availability challenges. Based on a &#8220;DBA-centric&#8221; approach to High Availability, <i>Oracle Database 10g High Availability</i> concentrates on explaining Oracle Database 10<i>g</i> technologies and practices to database administrators, covering general availability, real application clusters (RAC), disaster planning and recovery, and distributed database solutions. Hardware and application needs are also taken into account. While Oracle Database 10<i>g</i> is the main focus, many of the options discussed are available in earlier database releases. Organized to provide conceptual understanding of High Availability, included are &#8220;HA Workshops,&#8221; step-by-step instructions to get you through certain implementations, plus real-world inspired case studies. </span>

                    <span>The writers like to subsitute the Oracle manual in OTN but make no difference . eg, I wanted to setup the Dataguard through EM10g Grid Control. In fact , the creation standby database wizard was filled of bugs and user can't make use of it till patching and huge manual works. It's no doubt that writers never tried on this features. The book is rather splotchy and winding.</span>

                    <span>Yes, Read this Book at least, twice. 
<br />
<br />Has steps linked to various chapters. 
<br />Reading, Second time will solve/Answer most of your questions.
<br />
<br />This Book is very good- I have implemented HA with RAC / DR - successfully many times.  
<br />
<br />On the scale 1-5
<br />
<br />RAC - 3
<br />Uses Oracle provided kernel (Linux) with firewire (storage) Architecture, for beginners it might be helpful.
<br />Missing GFS - Global file system implementation.  Can be used instead of ocfs.
<br />
<br />RAC - Oracle Installation - 4
<br />Installation, always read documentation from Oracle.
<br />
<br />Flashback - 3
<br />Since this is neat/new feature - need more explanation. Explains implementing Flashback, not much on administration of Flashback.
<br />
<br />DR - 5
<br />DataGuard - 5
<br />Very good steps and explanation - cannot go wrong implementing DR logical/Physical
<br />
<br />TAF - 4
<br />Good explanation of TAF - Yes you will be able to implement the TAF and load balance RAC env.
<br />
<br />ASM - 3
<br />This is a very powerful feature - Needs a separate chapter similar to DR/Dataguard.

                    <span>Three weeks ago I obtained a copy of 'High Availability with RAC, Flashback & Data Guard,' Oracle Database 10g.  I work in a support environment where we field questions on all of the topics contained in this manual.  The book has provided me with a clear and detailed  manual for some very sophisticated products.  The topics are explained in a thorough manner and pertain to subjects that are frequently queried about, such as changing the protection mode in data guard and adding nodes to an existing rac configuration plus of course many others.   The authors have provided lucid explanations of these topics and also have given a logical way to find the information when it is needed.  This book allows for the reader to use the information presented to better understand the software that makes up the Oracle High Availability array of products.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Early on in this impressive book, the HADBA Mantra, which states that "Availability is defined as much by end-user perceptions as by database realities.", sets the tone by offering what I think is a profound glimpse of the new world for DBAs.  If that mantra is true, then our profession expands beyond the normal bounds of I.T. and suddenly involves real aspects of business itself including management, politics and psychology more deeply than ever before.  <p>Thus this book sets a challenging goal for itself which I think it succeeds in accomplishing.  While 'holistic' may be an overworked term in our culture, it is exactly that - a holistic HA solution - which is needed to meet these nascent business challenges and that solution is what Hart & Jesse have written.  For example, the concept of incorporating aspects of performance tuning into the high availability view of the database is new to me, yet makes perfect sense.  I had always viewed these as separate and independent DBA functions.  <p>With each chapter, another brick is laid in what becomes a solid, highly-available wall:<br>RAC, Dataguard, Flashback Query, Rman Backup & Recovery, Streams - backed with the newest RDBMS features and performance tuning.  <p>The book is well written and has very helpful labs.  Understandably, it does not delve deeply into specific areas.  Had the authors tried to cover every minute detail, we'd all be lugging a thousand pounds of books between home and work.  At the same time, I think every topic is well covered and the depth of detail is good.  Frankly, when it comes time to implement something like Dataguard, I'll have 10 references, white papers, etc. on my desk.  This book is great for putting everything together under one roof and allowing one to see the big picture and how that picture is evolving.<p>As I get these features implemented, I expect to save a bundle on pager batteries!!!!!</span>
