                <span id="Label1"> BUILDING A PARTNERSHIP WITH YOUR BOSS      The Boss and The Assistant. It's a basic business relationship, and the structure is easy: The Boss gives orders, and The Assistant obeys.       But there's an alternative that's better for both assistant and boss, and it's called "partnership." In this eye-opening book, assistants learn how they can break out of old, narrow roles and enjoy working with a boss instead of for a boss. This change liberates creativity and self-confidence, and reveals hidden skills and interests. It also makes an assistant more valuable (and promotable) to the boss and the company. Readers learn specific techniques for how to:      **  initiate the transition to a partnering relationship   **  understand their boss' work style and adapt to it -- without losing their sense of self   **  become a proactive worker who takes responsibility for mistakes and credit for successes      JERRY WISINSKI (San Antonio,TX) is a consultant with expertise in interpersonal skills, assertiveness training, and team building. He served as Executive Director of International Trainers, Educators, and Consultants at Trinity University, and is the author of Resolving Conflicts on the Job (Amacom). </span>

                    <span>Being a corporate coach who specializes in the relationship between executives and assistants, I find this book very useful. While it is not the end-all, be-all solution, it is a perfect start to building a partnership. The book is easy to read with realistic tips; I give it to my clients to augment our coaching sessions. I especially like the stages of partnership model explained in the book. It builds on the basic stages of management and is useful for both the executive and assistant.

                    <span>This book is outstanding. I highly recommend it if you want to take your working relationship with your manager up to the next level. If you think you're working relationship is great now, this book can make it even better. I liked the way the author lists the steps in preparing this concept to your manager. It was easy to follow and really makes you put a good deal of careful thought in the preparation process. I also liked the idea of action items not just for the assistant, but for the manager too. Remember a good working relationship involves both assistants and managers. Just working through this process together improves the relationship. Luckily, my boss endored it!</span>
