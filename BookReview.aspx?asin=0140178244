                    <span>If you live in, or care about, the West, or California, or anywhere with water nearby, you need to read this book. If you eat produce (oranges, rice, almonds, etc.) that is grown with water from irrigation projects, or you live somewhere where hydropower brings you electricity, you need to read this book. If you're interested in environmental issues, you need to read this book. Reisner writes with a thoroughness that is destined to make this the definitive work on the Western water wars - for now. His style of writing is engaging, at least for the topics that interest you. The rest can be skipped without losing anything. He paints a history that is more social and political than "environmental" in nature. And perhaps the value is that he's painting a *history* - this is how we got where we are to day. What you, the reader, do with this knowledge is up to you. He's not trying to preach. This book is loaded with facts, is meticulously researched, and yet is not burdensome. Get it!</span>

                    <span>I first read this book during graduate school, in a class which covered many subjects in the natural resource management field as well as environmental-economic conflict. At the time, I knew very little regarding the West and its constant conflict regarding water usage and water rights. The book proved to be an excellent primer on the state of affairs regarding the history and present-day usage of water in the American southwest. It gives a remarkably thorough history as well as a very intimate portrayal of its author and his relationship to the geography about which he writes. Other books, as well, complement this one (e.g. "A River No More" -Friedkin). But, none really do so as gracefully as this. Two years after I finished this book, I travelled extensively throughout the West and visited (or, passed-through) many of the locations Reisner discusses in the book. Such an experience only reinforced the significance of the subject-matter and enabled me to appreciate the material even more. This book, most definitely, changed my understanding of the West and its water.</span>

                    <span>The work of a lifetime, Reisner's 500 page expose on the Western Water Machine will change the way any fist-time reader views 1)water 2) the federal government, and 3) the American West.<P>Reisner's book is of a rare breed: meticulously researched, written with craft and humor and a human touch, and altogether damning mjust by telling the facts.<P>In essence, and for a longer paraphrase look below, Reisner demonstrates that Los Angeles, California farmers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers and others worked togther to bend reality in favor of growth and living space. At some level this made sense. Hoover Dam, Reisner writes, helped to win WWII through its desperately needed energy production. However, at some point what was once needed became an imperitive for its own sake. Dams for the sake of building beautiful dams. Water projects for political legacy. Expensive water projects for farmers growing surplus crops. And then America gradually became aware that this Cadillac desert - an artificial oasis where the land once was dry - has come at a staggering environmental and recreational cost.<P>It's a book that open the reader's eyes and understand a bit more about how U.S.A. works, especially in the arid West.</span>

                    <span>This reader highly recommends this work to show the complexity involved in answering the question, "How much does a glass of water cost in the American Southwest "? The author wrote a well-researched book in an attempt to show the factors involved in answering that question. The author portrays a complex web of jurisdictions on the state local and federal levels that are involved in various projects. Every policy has its winners and losers. The book contains a little history of the Southwest, some personal interviews, many stories of the pork barrel politics involved to make sure the rest of the country buys into these irrigation and dam projects. This book will be an eye-opener for most Easterners in this country where battling over water rights is generally not on the local political agenda. A very rewarding book.</span>

                    <span>I picked up Marc Reisner's books after moving to CA recently from what I now realize is blissfully non-seismic and adequately-watered New England... This is a great history of man getting the (temporary) best of nature and whistling past the dam. The chapter on Bureau of Reclamation chief Floyd Dominy is worth the price alone: he is the type of headstrong, puritanical warrior (no exaggeration there) that American has produced in droves, yet he is virtually unknown now. The character profiles of John Wesley Powell and others are equally as good. I only wish that other historians had the sense of humor and irony that Reisner employs so well.</span>
