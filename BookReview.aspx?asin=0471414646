                    <span>Optimal Thinking is a superbly written book that offers fail-safe roadmaps to stop settling for second best in business, personal relationships, and life in general. The book is easy to read and the information is rock solid. The book shows you how to go beyond managing and improving emotions, relationships, tasks, opportunities, and results. You learn how to optimize them. I also recommend the "100 Day Optimal Thinking Audio program for Permanent results" for powerful action-packed personal and career optimization in an entertaining format. And if you have an opportunity to attend an Optimal Thinking seminar, don't miss it. You will welcome every situation as an opportunity to be your best!</span>

                    <span>I saw the author speak about Optimal Thinking on Bloomberg TV a month ago. I was captured by her fluent explanation of Optimal Thinking as the vehicle for our best self, and her definition of self-sabotage. I visited optimalthinking.com, bought this book, and wow -- I got more than I ever expected. I have lost 12 pounds of excess weight that I couldn't shed for over two years. I am giving my best at work instead of just doing enough to keep my job. I am guiding my son to give his best at school, and to accept that once he has done his best, he has earned the right to move on. I feel alive in the full sense of the word. Every page of this book is a gift. I especially enjoy reading about other optimal thinkers, and learning how they use Optimal Thinking in their daily lives. This book is for everyone but will be most easily received by those who want to rise above self-sabotage and mediocrity to give life their all.</span>

                    <span>As an executive coach, I understand why Optimal Thinking is overtaking defective positive thinking programs in large and small business. Optimal Thinking is a solid, universal concept for realists. This book clears up misinformation about positive thinking that confuses many people, and offers a valid solution. Optimal Thinking is easy to read, and shows you how to OPTIMIZE (instead of manage) any situation. The author provides roadmaps to follow and the examples are concise. Optimal thinking is THE necessary ingredient for personal and professional optimization.</span>

                    <span>Way too cliche' and fluffy. Typical bad "self help" book that give the truly valuable books a bad name. Full of scenairos like "she went on to become a successful actress" kinda crap that never say who the person was, or any proof this person ever existed to begin with. You wont feel any smarter reading this one, and will miss your $10 or what ever you paid for it.</span>

                    <span>A book that explains the power of negative thinking? By taking the self assesment tests in the first section, this book helped to re-shape my life. I have not always been an optimist in my thoughts, this book was written for people like me, realists. I enjoyed the chapter on limiting sub-optimal behaviors the most. Another similar book I would recommend reading is Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life by JoAnna Carey which is set up as a week-by-week action plan for getting more out of life.</span>
