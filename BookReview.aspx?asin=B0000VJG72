                <span id="Label1">Partly inspired by 1948's <I>The Big Clock</I> and its nominal 1987 remake <I>No Way Out</I>, the Denzel Washington thriller <I>Out of Time</I> is quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and his <I>Devil in a Blue Dress</I> director Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of "Dr. Phlox" on TV's <I>Enterprise</I> is vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, but <I>Out of Time</I> goes well with a big tub of popcorn. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>I thought this was a good movie, again not perfect or oscar material like some of other Denzel washington work, but still enjoyable. Washington is Cheif Matt Whitlock who at the beginning makes some very bad mistakes that come back to haunt him. As he and alex (eva mendes) were on the verge of getting a divocere, he has an affair with ex-girlfriend Ann (sanaa lathan who has been in flicks like (blade, love and basketball, and Brown Sugar). This was Matt first mistake. His second mistake was when Ann went to the doctor and supposedly has cancer, decides to become the beneificary for her life insurance policy. His third mistake was stealing money for a sting operation to help pay for Ann to have surgery. Chris Harrison (Dean Caine) who was a mean and suspicious husband used this cancer situation to his advantage and get back at Matt. How does he do it? Supposedly, the Harrison's house was set on fire and they were supposedly killed. Matt last mistake was when he and Ann were supposed to meet to pick up the drug money when over to the house, where some people saw him and believed he was the culprit for this act of arson. Just like the Negotatior (the movie where Samuel L. Jackson had to prove he did not kill his partner and find out who did), Matt was indeed running out of time before all sources were to point toward him. Of course his soon to be ex-wife who involved in the case. Matt found out some interesting things concerning Ann. He found out the doctor that she saw with him is not a real doctor and that her real doctors have reported that she has always been in good health. While Matt was at the station, he lied, evade and did everything a deseperate man would do to save himself. He does have a confortation with the fake doctor and does find the Harrisons. He then finds out what all was going on. Chris might have been behind the whole plan but Ann did some role in it as well. Alex ends up coming to the aid to keep him from being killed by both Harrison's and they do get back together. Overall it was a well told story and had some interesting twists and turns in the movie. Everybody played their characters really well. I think it's worth checking out!</span>

                    <span>I really wanted to like this movie---I even cut out of work early to see this movie, and well (sigh), here goes...<P>Matthias Whitlock {Denzel Washington--Training Day, John Q.} is the chief of police in small-town, who happens to be married and having an affair with his high-school sweetheart Anne Marei Harrison {Sanaa Lathan--Love & Basketball, Brown Sugar}, who is struggling with her own fidelity issues with an abusive husband, Chris Harrison {Dean Cain--host of Ripley's Believe It Or Not}, an former quarterback turned security guard who is bitter and strapped for cash.<P>One day, Anne Marei takes Matthias to the doctor where she learns she is terminally ill with cancer. Treatments are expensive and not guaranteed to extend her life. Whitlock decides to take measures into his own hands, and steal some drug money from a successful bust to help his lover.<P>On the night he is to deliver the money, Anne Marei's house has been burned to the ground, killing her and her husband!! Investigators suspect foul play and are looking for answers. To make matters worse, the lead detective is Whitlock's wife {Eva Mendes--Training Day}.<P>Now Whitlock, must solve this mystery and keep the rest of the force hot off his trail, before they discover the truth.<P>The movie draws you in without a problem, especially as Whitlock discovers some truths of his own. But it's the last 20 or so minutes of dialogue/plot that it all went downhill.<P>Overall, not too bad.</span>

                    <span>We start out with a small town cop(the Chief no less) cheating and drinkin hard as his divorce is pending.The beautiful babe he is cheating with is getting beat up by her old man, Dean Cain of Superman fame. He hates the husband but loves her body. His Ex is just as bodacious and Ill never understand why he left her. Any way nothing is really as it seems as the twists and turns begin. Soon he is framed for stealin 450,000 jack he was holding from a mob bust and the murders of his main squeeze and her hubby. Now he must become a player to fool his ex(a miami cop also) the C.I.A. and his own police force. How he does it is tricky and kinda unbelivable, but our hero is down wit it. The ending can be seen coming form a mile off but, after a film full of the two babes its cool. This film is rated 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>Out of Time is a strictly routine mystery movie, competently made but nothing more than that. It is what I think of as "sunny noir" - a standard film noir story taken out of the gritty city streets and moved to a sunny beach community. In this case, it involves Denzel Washington as a small town police chief whose estranged from his homicide detective wife and sleeping with his old girlfriend, who is in turn still married to her abusive husband. <P>When Washington finds out his girlfriend has cancer, and that the only treatment is an expensive experimental treatment in Switzerland, he steals some evidence money to help her. Then, she and her husband are apparently killed in a fire, but that quickly turns out to be a con. Suddenly, Washington is stuck in a perilous place; on the one hand, he must evade his wife, who is investigating the crime and on the other, he must retrieve the money (which the DEA wants).<P>As stated before, this is an utterly routine movie, with little to distinguish it from a dozen or more movies that seem to cover the same ground. Washington's performance is good but nothing special; the action scenes are only moderately exciting, and in general, the writing is bland, with no real plot twists (even the "twist" of the fake deaths can be seen a mile away). The scenery is nice, but any pluses from that are more than offset by the negatives of one character, a medical examiner who seems to be there for comic relief and just winds up disrupting the tone of the film. With nothing really good to distinguish this movie, I can only rate it a high two stars and cannot recommend it for any but the most die-hard Denzel Washington fans.</span>
