                <span id="Label1">The world of photography has been transformed by the digital realm; both professionals and amateurs alike are abandoning traditional film cameras for new technology.

                    <span>I have to wonder if some of these other guys who rated this book low are just computer geeks or what. I am new to digital photography having just bought a Digital Rebel and this book really opened my eyes to the possibilities of digital photography without having to wade through a big heavy book. Plus there are some National Geographic photographers who talk about their use of digital and that was very interesting. I have already put stickies in a lot of the book for favorite techniques that I want to work on.</span>

                    <span>I found this to be a very inspirational book. It really helped me understand the possibilities of digital photography and what was really important. There are so many people who know a little about digital photography but act like they are experts even though they give misinformation. I figure if National Geographic thought enough of this book to put it together and with the author an editor of big photo magazines, this should be pretty accurate. I thought it was. <P>The book seems aimed at people like me, photographers who want to master digital photography but don't want a degree in computer science. Plus there is some really great photography in here from some top digital photographers.</span>

                    <span>If you are thinking about buying a digital camera, or if you own one and know absolutely nothing about it, then this may be the book for you. If you already own a digital camera and you're looking to improve your photography skills, then you need something more advanced than this. This book only covers the very basics of digital photography.<P>The only section I found helpful were some of the tips and tricks cooncerning postprocerssing of images, but that alone would not warrant purchasing this book.</span>

                    <span>This book was rather disappointing to me. I thought that it would have good tips on how to take certain photos with a digital camera, like out side shots, indoor shots, back lit shots and so on but it had very little of any such advice. It seems to me that this book is more a sales pitch for digital cameras and their versatility. Unless you have no idea how to get started choosing a digital camera or how do use the 'digital darkroom' do not get this book. If you have a basic knowledge of digital cameras or own one all ready and have a basic knowledge of 'digital darkroom' software do not get this book you will all ready know everything that is mentioned.</span>

                    <span>Sheppard's book is a great introduction to digital photography, especially given his aim of treating the subject as the latest photographic technology, rather than something exclusive to the computer or digital world. The book is replete with examples of how digital cameras are expanding the possibilities for photographers and allowing them to ensure they're getting the shots the want. Central to Sheppard's treatment here is his discussion of the digital darkroom techniques. Sheppard correctly indicates that the digital darkroom should be seen as an extension of the traditonal darkroom, affording us new tools to try and achieve the results we are looking for. Instructively, Sheppard makes reference to Ansel Adam's works on prints as representing still many of the aims of digital darkroom work.<P>Still, the book seems only an introduction. There is very little in-depth discussion of the topics, so this won't be the only book on your shelf. But it certainly should be the first one you read before delving into more in-depth (and generally lacking in an overreaching artistic view) works on photography or digital darkroom techniques. In fact, this book would likely be best incorporated into National Geographic's Photography Field Guide -- with the digital sections hived off into where they are most appropriate in that general guide rather than simply having essentially a digital supplement to the series.</span>
