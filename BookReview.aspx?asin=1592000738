                    <span>If you're a beginning or intermediate programmer (with a year or less of programming under your belt), then this is the best, first Python book you can find. Not only is it the best intro to Python out there, but it's one of the best intros to programming in general I've ever read.<p>The book is clear, well-written and won't put you to sleep like many other technical books.  The author knows how to teach and keep things interesting.  And while the book is entertaining, it still covers the Python basics, including:<br>* Variables<br>* Branching <br>* Strings<br>* Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries<br>* Functions<br>* Files<br>* Exceptions<br>* Classes (including new-style classes)<p>But the book goes beyond the fundamentals to cover more advanced topics that most other intro to Python books don't, including:<br>* Program Design<br>* Object-Oriented Programming<br>* GUI Programming<br>* Multimedia Programming (including graphics, sound and animation)<p>If you're already a programming whiz, with years of coding experience and mutlti-language fluency, then this book may be too basic for you.  In that case, I recommend the Python Visual Quick Start Guide.  It's aimed at readers with a solid programming background.  And while it doesn't have extensive OOP coverage, it will get an expert programmer up and running with the Python fast.<p>Finally, once you've got some Python experience, I highly recommend Python in a Nutshell to take you from Python programmer to Python guru.<p>Hope this helps you on your Pythonic journey!</span>

                    <span>Michael dawson happens to get it. Not only the language he writes of, but the language he uses to educate. I am new to Python and this book really helped open the doors for me. Because of this book, Python is not  a huge scary beast... it's a friendly and helpful pet! Thanks for such a great read!</span>

                    <span>Have you wanted to try writing computer programs, but didn't know how to begin? Or maybe those huge, menacing looking tomes in the computer section of your local B&N store frightened the bejeezes out of you? Well, you may wish to take a serious look at the Python programming language. It is extremely easy to get started and there has been a huge community of on-line fans using it and helping each other ... Python is a great language to teach to school kids. It is also used by NASA, HP, Google and serious programmers all over the world.<p>This book is for the real beginner. If you know anything at all about python don't buy this book (consider LEARNING PYTHON, by Lutz and Asher). If you know something about programming, but nothing about python then don't buy this book (consider PYTHON CORE PROGRAMMING by Wesley Chun). If you are a Pythonista already, then stop reading. For all the rest of you I recommend PYTHON PROGRAMMING by Dawson. It will provide the most gentle introduction to programming in general, and python specifically, that you will find anywhere. Dawson is an excellent writer. This book is NOT the typical massive "programmer's bible," but rather, a slim primer - the basics. Dawson will take you by the hand and lead you down the garden path. Work through the easy exercises and play with the programs on the CD. At the end of the path you should be pleasantly surprised at how easily you learned the rudiments of a powerful computer language. You'll have all the knowledge needed to move on to Wesley Chun's enormous tutorial or the slim, but dense LEARNING PYTHON.<p>The book's cover says "for the absolute beginner" and I can't emphasize enough that this book is really for the programmer neophyte. I'd recommend it to any of my computer phobic friends. There is very little jargon; the reading level would be appropriate for junior high school students. I think Michael Dawson hit upon a real gem of a pedagogical idea: each major concept is introduced through writing a computer game. They are simple in concept and even simpler when written in python. He ends the book with an arcade shootem-up complete with animated graphics, sound effects, and music! The reader should by that point, feel comfortable modifying and adding to it. The book is nicely laid out and appears to have very few typos.</span>
