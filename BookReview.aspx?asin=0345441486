                <span id="Label1">Preeminent child psychologist, Michael Thompson is renowned for his  efforts to educate and assist parents with sons. First with <I>Raising Cain</I> (his response to  Mary Pipher's <I>Reviving  Ophelia</I> ) and now with <I>Speaking of Boys</I>, Thompson encourages  parents to help their sons develop the emotional intelligence necessary to  succeed. The book seeks to answer parents' questions concerning the complexities  of raising a boy in today's society. Every chapter introduces questions from  parents on issues like puberty, underage drinking, and increased violence in  schools, and in every instance the author responds with insightful and  knowledgeable advice. Chapters entitled "Speaking of Social Anger and  Aggression" and "Feelings and Communication--Is Our Sensitive Boy a Sitting Duck  for Bullies?" are particularly in tune with the apprehension parents feel when  sending their sensitive sons off for another grueling day at school.<p>  The key to raising a healthy son, says Thompson, is to help your boy attain an  emotional intelligence that will allow him to cope with difficult and  threatening situations. To accomplish this, parents need to nurture compassion  in their sons and try to avoid allowing them to become desensitized by the  teasing and pressure of others. Respecting your son's need to appear strong at  times and offering him a sense of safety when discussing emotionally revealing  subjects are two ways Thompson encourages parents to nurture their son's  emotional development. As anyone who is raising a boy knows, it's a job that is  never quite finished, and with this book, Thompson offers parents an invaluable  tool, regardless of their son's age. <I>--Dal Asher</I></span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very well written and interesting! I was hoping more questions would be about little boys, as we have a 7, 6, 4 and 19 month old. It covers a wide variety of topics, concerns and situations at all ages. I especially agreed with the sections and comment regarding teens and their "issues". The author seems to have a 'don't make too big a deal of anything' attitude. I liked that! Most of the teen stuff will blow over and the photos of your son with blue hair can be used as blackmail later!</span>

                    <span>By one of the authors of "Raising Cain", this book in the format of a series of questions and answers organized around central themes.<P>As such, it can serve as both a reference work to specific areas or a can be read as a single work.<P>The book deals with a wide range of issues in a candid, non-judgemental way.<P>And, perhaps, like Spock's or Leach's works about infants, it will serve to help orient adults in doing their best with their sons or the sons of others.</span>

                    <span>I buy more books than I find time to read them. Occasionally I come across a book that grabs my attention, hooks me in, and refuses to let me put it down. Such is the case in regard to "Speaking of Boys". I was spending time in the book section of a local Target store while my ll and 12 year-old boys were checking out toys and video games. The book's cover photo grabbed my attention. Flipping through the book and its questions, I found the presentation attractive, bought it, and began reading it during subway rides to and from work. I came to understand a lot of issues that I never fully comprehended as a twelve year old. I was surprised by some of the "facts" of teenage boys, such as how they view sex, why they feel a need to fight authority while needing hugs, when "wet dreams" begin and how to explain the phenomenon, etc. I have highly recommended the book to many. It's easy to digest, accessible to just about anyone, and oftentimes explains difficult issues with a touch of humor. Check it out!</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderfully engaging book. I usually struggle through the initial chapters (only) of the traditional "expert advice on child rearing" books which my wife is always plowing through. Thankfully, I had no such problem here. In fact, for once I was excitedly reading portions of the book to her. This book deals with everything from war toys to pre-teen sex to parents just letting go, with many stops along the way. Highly recommended for those who want answers to everyday boy problems, especially before we make them into bigger teenager problems. I even put down my novels and biographies for this one! It will make you laugh ... and cry.</span>

                    <span>Speaking of Boys is delightful to read, by turns funny, poignant, insightful, and informative. Michael Thompson clearly understands boys, but even more importantly, he understands the worries and concerns that parents and educators and therapists have about boys. If you enjoyed Raising Cain, as I did, you will like this book even more, because it is written in such an engaging style. I found myself starting by flipping around to the questions I specifically wanted to know about, and then just decided to read the whole thing, since all the answers were so fun and informative and at times, moving. If you haven't read Michael Thompson's other book on boys, then I'd suggest starting with this one, and moving on to raising Cain if you want more background and theory and in-depth clinical cases.</span>
