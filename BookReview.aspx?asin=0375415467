                <span id="Label1">What makes <I>DNA</I> different from hordes of competitors purporting to  help readers understand genetics is that it is written by none other  than James Watson, of Watson and Crick fame. He and his co-author Andrew  Berry have produced a clear and easygoing history of genetics, from  Mendel through genome sequencing. Watson offers readers a sense of  immediacy, a behind-the scenes familiarity with some of the most  exciting developments in modern science. He gleefully reports on the  research juggernaut that led to current obsessions with genetic  engineering and cloning. Aided by profuse illustrations and photos, Watson offers an enthusiastic account of how scientists figured out how DNA codes for the creation of proteins--the so-called "central dogma" of genetics. But as  patents and corporations enter the picture, Watson reveals his concern  about the incursions of business into the hallowed halls of science.<p>  <blockquote>After 1975, DNA was no longer solely the concern of  academics trying to understand the molecular underpinnings of life. The  molecule moved beyond the cloisters of white-coated scientists into a  very different world populated largely by men in silk ties and sharp  suits.</blockquote><p>  In later chapters, Watson aims barbs at those who are concerned by  genetic tinkering, calling them "alarmists" who don't understand how the  experiments work. It is in these arguments that Watson may lose favor  with those whose notions of science were born after <I>Silent Spring</I>.  Nevertheless, <I>DNA</I> encompasses both sides of the political issues  involved in genetics, and Watson is an enthusiastic proponent of debate  on the subject. The book accompanies a 5-part PBS series. <I>--Therese  Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>When Iam interested in a subject iam intensely interested and want to know every bit of information ABOUT THE SUBJECT. In the case of this book there is more history than information about genetics. I know there are many people who like the historical parts of scientific subjects so if your one of them i would reccomend this book. A more accurate title for this book would be "the progression of genetic research". If you want to know more about gentics and dna than the personal history of the author and his colleagues this book will not fulfill your expectations.</span>

                    <span>Overall a well-written book, but I wished Watson had shared with his audience his research findings on ethical questions of biotechnology, which his committee had posed in the Human Genome Project. It would be very interesting, to say the least , to view the conditions and sets of parameters under which the ethics are explored and questioned. To fully appreciating the merits and benefits of genetic research, I suspect that the ethical information would be helpful, to his audience, in weighing the pros and cons in the great genetic debate. Sometimes I sensed mixed messages on Watson's attitude, or his ethical ground on the use of genetic research. For instance, although I applauded Watson's stance against nefarious commercialization of human genes, or any life form for that matter, I became confused with his espousing the BT gene in reducing pesticide use, since he didn't seem too concerned with the adventitious spreading of genetically engineered plants into "wild" types. Indeed, the enterprise to "play with genes" can only bring up more questions for each one of us to face sooner or later in our life time, and by not sharing with his audience the findings of his research on ethics, Watson unfortunately performed a unsavory disservice to his audience. </span>

                    <span>This book is every bit as good as the other reviewers suggest.
<br />
<br />Although, I have not read other books in this field, I recognize excellent writing when I see it.  I am compelled to state that a reader looking to learn about this complex field need look no further than this book in order to get a comprehensive, authoritative and highly interesting account - one that is not afraid to confront some of the major and controversial views.
<br />
<br />A few additional comments:
<br />
<br />a. While written very well, the material is such that I found this book to be one that is best enjoyed in many smaller helpings
<br />
<br />b. It is one of the rare books that gets progressively more interesting, the further one gets into the book (somehow the topics are arranged that way) - patience and faith are strongly recommended.  As a last resort, try one of the later chapters - they can be read independently of each other for the most part.
<br />
<br />c. The arrangement may seem somewhat unstructured - have faith - there are so many aspects to this "field" - let the authority guide you.
<br />
<br />d. While some readers may question the authors opinions, I found them extremely well reasoned and articulated - even if they feel a bit uncomfortable to start with.  I saw no agenda other than the pursuit of science to benefit mankind.
<br />
<br />Overall, hats off - I am very thankful that there are people out there that do write about such topics that may not have mass market appeal.</span>

                    <span>DNA: The Secret of Life presents an overview of the development of genetics over the last hundred years or so and is written by none other than James D. Watson himself (corecepient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for the determination of the chemical structure of DNA).  Watson traces the roots of DNA and it role in science, medicine, business, and ethics.  He begins his story with Mendel and then the eugenics movement (a rather racist "pseudo-scientific" field).  Watson continues with his involvement in deciphering the structure of DNA and his later work on RNA.  Further chapters focus on the implications of genetically altered foods, on how numerous start up genetic corporations have profited from patenting genes used to produce disease fighting drugs, about how DNA fingerprinting can be used to both solve crime and identify previously unidentifiable bodies, and how researchers have used genetics to fight devastating disease like Huntington's disease.  The final chapters of the book deal with current issuses in genetics such as funding for research, ethical issuses involving unborn children with inheritable diseases, and a few words on stem cells and cloning.
<br />
<br />In some sense, this book is the "untold history of genetics."  It brings to light the tiredless work of numerous scientists that have shaped genetics into the fascinating field that it is today.  I found it interesting that such a myriad group of biologists, biochemists, chemists, and physicists jumped on the DNA bandwagon and discovered so much about this little chemical.  I found it particularly interesting because I read this book after already having taken a genetics class in college.  But do not be deferred if you have no scientific background whatsoever.  The book is fully acessable and intended for anyone even remotely interested in DNA.  While it helps to have knowledge of genetic terms, the scientific jargon in this book is minimal and each term is fully explained to aid in clairity.  
<br />
<br />The prose of this book flows very smoothly and at times you forget that you are reading a science book instead of a novel because the pages quickly fly by.  I found this rather surprising since I had previsously read Watson's famous book, "The Double Helix."  Although "The Double Helix" is an important book, its prose was at times slow, stunted, and far from captivating.  "DNA: The Secret of Life" suffers from none of those flaws.  With the help of coauthor Andrew Berry, Watson has written a book that is as full of life and surprise as its title suggests.
<br />
<br />My advice is that everyone should read this book no matter what there background in science is.  It is an important and enjoyable read that reveals how the chemical DNA is involved in all of the complicated intricies of life!  With the increasing growth of research in genetics, it doesn't hurt to learn some of the concepts about DNA that this book teaches.  That way, you can be truely informed about DNA, and this knowledge will allow you to form your own opinions about how DNA is used in society now and in the future.</span>

                    <span>The names of Watson & Crick are one of those things that just seems to stick in everyone's head no matter how little they paid attention in school (kind of like the term onomatopoeia) so of course seeing a book written about DNA by James Watson of Watson & Crick fame set alarms going off in my head.  I had high expectations of the book because of the author's intimate acquaintance with the subject but they were all surpassed and furthermore I was surprised by how enjoyable a read this book was and how nonthreatening Watson, along with his coauthor Andrew Berry, was able to present his subject matter.
<br />
<br />The actual science in this book doesn't really go on beyond what one would lean in a freshman college or an advanced high school biology class but in presenting the science embedded in it's historical background DNA: The Secret of Life allows the reader to look at it again with new eyes, showing them not as the establish beachhead we believe those areas to be today but rather viewing them with the novelty and excitement they were initially greeted by. 
<br />
<br />But the actual metabolic functions of life's most important structure, DNA, comprises only a fractional portion of this book with the majority instead devoting much of it to the questions that possessing such knowledge raises.  Genetically altered crops, reproductive implications, the question of `ownership' of sequenced genetic information-these are the true questions of the book. Watson, while possessing a very strong since of what he believe to be right and wrong in these different areas manages to be unambiguous about his views while at the same time not coming across as too much of a zealous so as to seem intractable.
<br />
<br />Not only is this a great book by one of the most known names in the biological sciences but it is also written in a clear and engaging style which makes it such a great retreat to sit down and read for an afternoon.</span>
