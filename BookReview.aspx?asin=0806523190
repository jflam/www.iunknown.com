                    <span>Every movie has some sort of "mistake" that was made during the editing process or during the filming of the movie and it just happens to make it into the finished product. It could be as simple as a character taking off his glasses in two shots only seconds apart, or as strange as the odometer in "Back to the Future" giving different (and impossible) readings in various shots. This is a book that covers these little flubs in the filmmaking process. <P>The authors' intent is not to point these out to show how bad these movies are, but rather these are the movies the authors love and have seen time and time again and it is these little things that they enjoy catching in movies. This book is not an exhaustive list of every movie mistake in every movie ever made, but it does cover a large number of movies, from the Matrix to Terminator 2 to Titanic to an old Abbott and Costello movie. The mistakes are numbered and the time (to the minute, but not second) that the mistake occurs is noted. The authors note which mistakes are ones that with just a little bit of research could have been avoided and which ones just keep happening over and over again. The book disproves some alleged mistakes on films, and also makes suggestions on things that do not quite qualify as mistakes, but don't make sense in the context of the film. <P>There is a companion volume out: "Oops They did it Again! More Movie Mistakes that Made the Cut" which covers more movies than were included in this volume, but this was a good book to see what sort of mistakes were made in the making of some of your favorite movies. There may never been an all-inclusive book, but this one is a good start. <P>-Joe Sherry</span>
