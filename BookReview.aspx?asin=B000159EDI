                    <span>This movie has a great ending. Typical moronic review by the Red Sox nation. The Yankees were "lucky". yeah, just like they were in '78, just like the Mets were in '86, etc. I've never seen so much hoopla about a team that didn't win ANYTHING, even its own division. I give them credit though, that celebration when they clinched the wild card was something, you almost thought they actually came in first. I look forward to hearing the exuses for the Red Sox inevitable failure this year.</span>

                    <span>It's a sad story and one that Red Sox fans are all too familiar with. It was a great season for the Red Sox, with a hearbreaking ending. But, we Red Sox fans are a strong willed and loyal group. We all know that the Sox are still the BEST TEAM IN BASEBALL.<P>This DVD has it all and really does provide a great perspective of the wild ride of the 2003 Boston Red Sox.<P>As for the many obnioxious Yankee fans who say they knew all along that the "cursed" Red Sox would lose at the end of the 2003 season, (cursed by Don Zimmer? You mean the guy who ditched the Yankees for Tampa Bay and hates George Steinbrenner? Give me a break!), not one of you were so high and mighty last October. You were all scared to death that it was over for your Yankees -- no more incessant bragging -- no more holding the "26 world championships" over every team in baseball. It wasn't until Aaron Boone, just like Bucky Dent - a low (no ) avg. one-hit wonder, took a lucky swing on the last pitch of the 11th inning of game 7 of the 2003 ALCS that the Yankees actually won. It's less that the Sox are cursed than the Yankees just got lucky, which ran out against the Marlins. I guess you Yankee fans have the best team $200 million can buy, but every true baseball fan knows that the best team of 2003 didn't win the ALCS. <P>In any event, the DVD is great. I highly recommend it to any true baseball fan. Congrats to Kevin Millar (No. 15) for the title and giving the 2003 Sox a rallying cry.</span>

                    <span>If your a true Yankee fan it is great to watch the faces of all the Beantowners...fill with hope as you know the ending...the ending that has repeated itself sooooo many times...knowing now that Boston added 1 more curses...the Curse of Don Zimmer. And as always the second best team that Theo can buy...finishes second. The Killer B's...Babe,Bucky,Buckner & Boone.How sweet it is!!!</span>
