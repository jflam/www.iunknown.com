                <span id="Label1">Gordon S. Wood's <I>The American Revolution</I>, part of the Modern  Library Chronicles series, is an erudite, concise summary of the events and  circumstances surrounding the seminal conflict, both physical and philosophical,  in American history. The Modern Library Chronicles are accessible-but-serious  works of scholarship, meant to serve as introductions (or refresher courses) on  large subjects for interested readers. <I>The American Revolution</I> is an  excellent case in point. Wood deftly describes seeds of the Revolution, most  notably disgruntlement on the colonists' part brought about by increasingly  maladroit and fiscally punishing British policies. He then follows the course of  actual warfare and its aftermath, most interestingly the fraught, bitter battle  to draw a governing blueprint for the new country.   <p>  Wood breaks little new interpretive ground himself, here, but as a synthesizer  (and amiable, skillful narrator/guide) he stands on high ground. <I>--H.  O'Billovitch</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  It is written by a professor at an Ivy League university (Brown), and yet from reading his book I am unable to determine his personal political leanings.  Either he thinks the same way I do, or he is that "rara avis", a historian whose only axe to grind is that of the search for objective truth about the past.
<br />
<br />He is a superb writer.  There is not a dull sentence in the book, and the narrative flows like a good novel.  It is a brief book, intended to be an introduction for general readers as part of a Modern Library series, and yet as a knowledgeable but non-specialist reader of the period, I learned something new on almost every page.  Professor Brown has made himself one with the Revolutionary era, and has at the same time cultivated the ability to describe it clearly to us moderns.  I suspect he is an excellent classroom instructor for freshmen students.  
<br />
<br />These quotations illustrate his insightful thought and graceful style:
<br />
<br />"... the Revolution was not only about home rule; it was also about who should rule at home."
<br />
<br />"The Revolution, like the whole of American history, is not a simple morality play; it is a complicated and often ironic story that needs to be explained and understood, not celebrated or condemned."
<br />
<br />Note the skillful use of the semicolon, the mark of a good prose stylist, and the concise expression of some very complex concepts in two brief sentences.
<br />
<br />In a few pages he discusses in a very lucid manner a number of very complicated subjects, for example, the conflict between Burke's theory of "virtual" representation and the experience of "actual" representation in the new frontier towns of the American colonies, the development of a new conception of sovereignty as residing in the people to explain the proposed Constitution of 1789, the commonality of ideas shared by the Puritans of the English Civil War and the American revolutionists of a century later, the basis for the continued and unique American belief that we are "exceptional", outside the mainstream of history, and uniquely chosen as guardians of human freedom.
<br />
<br />Wood delves rather deeply into the evolution of American religious belief and practice and its effect on American society in the post-Revolutionary era.  He also succinctly outlines the effect of the Revolution on slavery and women's rights.
<br />
<br />He devotes only 12 pages to The War of Independence, and yet in that brief space gives a surprisingly complete and detailed picture of the military, political, and diplomatic course of the war. His comments on the strategic problems of each side are quite incisive, and his narrative is much clearer than Higginbotham's, for example.
<br />
<br />The last chapters on the social and political changes set off by the Revolution are his best.  I'm not a big fan of the "new history" emphasis on social and economic issues.  I think history is mostly about war and politics, in that order.  But Professor Wood shows that my prejudice is absurd, that history is history, war and politics can't be separated from culture and money, and that it is all interesting.   
<br />
<br />He probably doesn't emphasize enough the origin of the problems in the Constitution that led to its ultimate failure in the crisis of 1860.  But that is a complicated subject, and he lays a sufficient groundwork for further study of that issue.
<br />
<br />The bibiographic essay at the end is superb.  
<br />
<br />I didn't notice any typos - apparently the publisher has corrected in subsequent printings the "Yorktown, Pennsylvania" error noted by a previous reviewer.
<br />
<br />Recommended without reservation.</span>

                    <span>This slim volume (just shy of 200 pages with a short chronology, a few maps and a bibliography) contains the essentials of the Revolutionary Age in America - the intellectual underpinnings of `republicanism', the increasing passion for independence after successive tax acts, the war itself, and the making of the Constitution.  As his account unfolds, Wood finds time to briefly cover early American art, slavery, manners, diplomatic maneuvers, and other social, economic and political aspects of this momentous period in Western history.    He sticks to the facts in this account, and avoids what he calls in the preface, "celebrating or condemning" the Revolution itself.  This book is best read if you want a quick precis of the Revolution, and if you are interested in further reading, you can consult his fine bibliography for other sources.  One line sticks in my mind from this book:  in describing the increasing passion for egalitarianism in the new Republic, Wood offers an outstanding one-line summary: "For many Americans," he writes, "living in a free country meant never having to tip one's cap to anyone."</span>

                    <span>This is a perfect book for those of us who have forgotten many of the specifics concerning the way in which America obtained its freedom.  Wood offers a concise summary of the main revolutionary events and also discusses the factors which proceeded rebellion.  This is not a book for historians but is an excellent introduction to the era.  Oftentimes we forget about the neoclassicism of the age and the way in which Rome and Greece influenced the political outlooks of the men who forged our republic. Wood's examination of equality and the philosophical influences that embody our state are quite enlightening.  I wish that this text were used in the schools as it would undeniably foster a high level of appreciation for just how unique the American form of government actually is.</span>

                    <span>What was the American Revolution?  While most people would probably identify the American Revolution with the American War of Independence, Gordon S. Wood sees it as something more: a complete change in the ideological and political structure of British America, from the Royal colonies of 1763 to the Unites States of 1787.  Within a single generation, America twice revised its views about the government and sovereignty.  <p>Wood does not disregard the material causes for independence, the interest groups and the petty local politics that fed fuel to the conflict between the colonies and the mother country, but his focus is on the ideological and philosophical issues - the British, who saw Parliament as the source of authority to all of the British Empire, whether the constituents voted for the MPs or not, and the Americans, who held to the principle of "no taxation without representation", and the ideology that contrasted liberty and self rule with the tyrannical power of the divine rights of kings.<p>With the deepening, crisis, the Colonists, although willing in principle to acknowledge that Parliament had the right to regulate external commerce and navigation laws "from the necessities of the case, and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries" (p.44), could no longer reconcile that view with the British all-or-nothing perspective, in which sovereignty lay within Parliament and Parliament alone.  The widespread violence and King George III's declaration that the colonies were in open revolt helped push the Americans into declaring their independence.<p>Under the Articles of Confederation, the Founding Fathers of the United States formed an alternative form of government to the Imperial system - no longer a centre and a periphery, but a collective of equal, cooperating states.  With the Northwest Ordinance, the Americans acknowledged the Western settlers as the equals of the thirteen original colonies.  Proportionally representative legislative councils were seen as the instrument of government, the protection against executive tyranny.<p>The failure of the all-powerful legislatives to adequately answer the needs of the public good, and the lack of cooperation between the states, led to another change in the American political philosophy.  Local legislative councils changed from being the ultimate expression of Public sovereignty, to one element in a complex national system, meant to keep checks and balances between the states and the Federal Union, and between the branches of government. The ultimate purpose was to keep sovereignty in the hands of "we, the people of the United States of America"<p>There is far more in Wood's book then I can do justice to in a short review.  But Wood's detailed investigation of the political and ideological aspects of the revolution means that much remains neglected.  The social changes of America are hardly more then alluded to, and the economic changes are never coherently explained.  The worst neglect, though, is the Military history aspects of the Revolution - the American War of Independence is dealt with almost entirely in about 6 pages.  Nor are the major personalities of the Revolution given due attention: Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Henry and Washington are mentioned but only in the context of their ideas or public actions.  There is only a single exception - Wood's short discussion of Washington's choice to re-enter political life and participate in the 1787 Philadelphia Convention.<p>In the past couple of years, I've tried to read three different accounts of the American Revolution, and have been unable to finish any of them.  Gordon S. Wood's short book is a fascinating read and a good introduction to the Revolution and to the changes it brought on America.</span>

                    <span>Wood has managed to capture the key events and personalities surrounding the causes, conduct and after-effects of the American Revolution in a succinct manner.<p>What I found most interesting was the specific details one does not frequent across except in upper-division history classes or scholarly articles.  For example the settlement patterns and growing populations on the "frontier" (Appalachia and the Ohio river valley in the 1760's) and the role this played in the growing scism between the Americas and Britain.  The importance and legacy of the Northwest Ordinances in the settlement and"opening" of the continent.  The British conduct of the war and the specific challenges they faced in fighting Washington (and Arnold and Gates).<p>For its berevity, it is a remarkably dense and readable book.</span>
