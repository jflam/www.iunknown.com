                    <span>I used this book for a class on coaching and developing employees.  There were eleven people in the class that read the book and each was very disappointed. The overall conclusion was that the author should stick to sports, as the attempt to link the priciples to business was too far of a stretch. We will not be using this book again.</span>

                    <span>We immediately liked John Whitmore's book on coaching for one simple reason: It admits right off that a coterie of charlatans have passed off their bogus "consulting" approaches as business coaching, thereby diminishing the credibility of the practice. But Whitmore does more than recognize the problem: He sets the record straight by providing a true definition, a working history and a psychological explanation of real coaching, which evolved out of sports performance enhancement. Capping off this overview is a comprehensive guide to practical coaching practices, complete with techniques that readers can adopt in their own careers. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all business managers, human resource professionals and, of course, coaches.</span>

                    <span>Highly recommend this book.  The author clearly explains coaching and how its correct use can impact both your organization and your success as a manager.  He gives plenty of facts and outlines for use.  A must  buy!<p>Also suggest a well-received book that espouses coaching and  leadership skills and responsibility in a unique and easily read way.  My  company uses it for leader development/training.  It's called  ""The Leader's Guide: 15 Essential Skills.""</span>

                    <span>'Coaching for Performance' offers insight into the techniques of successful coaching, covering well the subjects of motivation, performance, and goals. At times, however, it seems as though the author is talking down  to the reader; perhaps that is just the 'accent' of a British nobleman. The  writing also seems a bit like 'teacher talking' instead of heartfelt  sharing of life's experience. Nonetheless, the material is precise and  compelling. The text covers the coach/coachee relationship quite  extensively and is an excellent resource for managers and formal coaches of  the 'mentor' variety. Scant coverage is given to the particular coaching  needs of working groups or teams.</span>
