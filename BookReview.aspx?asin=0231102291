                    <span>The Big Cats by Alan Turner is a very thorough discussion of the cat family, past and present. It also sports illustrator Mauricio Anton's splendid sketches and paintings of various members of the family. Those of extinct cats bring them to life in a way that the usual drawings of the skull and skeletal remains cannot. There is a thorough discussion of taxonomy in general and of classification of cats in particular. Unfortunately while the drawings are wonderful and the information dense, the book is not light reading. It might be useful to the professional paleontologist or zooarchaeologist looking for a good overview of cat remains or possibly appeal to the dedicated cat lover, but I can't imagine settling in by the fire on a quiet evening with the book. Its most appropriate place might be in a school library for reference use by students doing classroom projects on cats, paleontology, biology, ecology, etc.</span>

                    <span><P>In<br>the current dino-mania, fossil mammals are overshadowed. Too bad;<br>there are many curious and wonderful creatures in the mammalian<br>lineage. Yet, few well-illustrated popular books on the subject<br>exist. Bjorn Kurten's _Before the Indians_ had blurry charcoal<br>drawings. The late George Gaylord Simpson was an authority on<br>prehistoric South American mammals, but little more than a doodler<br>with a brush. And Colin Tudge's wonderful _The Time Before History_<br>had no pictures at all. <P>So this book is most welcome. Mauricio<br>Anton is a gifted artist. Cats and catlike creatures such as<br>nimravids, homotheriums, saber-tooths, dirk-tooths, all seem to live<br>again in these color and b/w pictures. The only beastie which is<br>unconvincingly rendered is the poorly-known _Thylacoleo_, the<br>marsupial lion. <P>Through the reproductions and discussions of these<br>and other animals, one gets a lesson in how different animals adopt<br>similar body plans, based on their ecological niche. Large top<br>predators are robust, while middle niche hunters are more<br>gracile. Thus, we are told, _Thylacoleo_, the largest nimravids, and<br>the largest saber-tooths resemble lions, while smaller predators<br>resemble cheetahs and leopards. All in all, a must for big cat- and<br>paleontology- lovers, the latter who may be getting tired of<br>dinosaurs!<br></span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding book, hands down the best book of its kind I've seen. The text is very well organized and readable, both for the layperson and those with science backgrounds. It goes into enough detail to be comprehensive, yet in such a way as to make the material easily understandable and enjoyably read.<P>The illustrations are what really makes this book stand out above the crowd: they are always well drawn and detailed and pretty to look at, both functional and artistic. It really brings the subject matter to life, sort of like if you were able to examine the museum collection yourself, and then go on a prehistoric safari. If you have any more than a passing interest in cat biology, natural history, or paleontology, this book is a definite must have.</span>

                    <span>Anyone interested in Big Cats or Prehistoric cats should have this book as a great reference. It also shows readers how the extinct and living cats are classified. Provides information on individual speicies and has tons of pictures (colored and pencil) that are beautifully illustrated. This is definitly worth the time and money....so hurry and buy it now!</span>

                    <span>I strongly recommend this book for any student of mammology or paleontology.The text is very informative and easy reading. The illustrations are so good and elaborate that I suggest art students working in pencil buy this volume. Unlike some books showing only static lateral views, the illustrator has shown these creatures going about their daily lives. Hunting methods are dealt with in great detail. <BR>For book collectors looking for something different, this is it! For biology students and profs, what are you waiting for!??</span>
