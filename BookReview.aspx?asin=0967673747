                <span id="Label1">PRINCES: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE BEHIND THE VEIL IN SAUDI ARABIA describes the life of Princess Sultana Al Sa'ud, a princess in the royal house of Saudi Arabia. Hidden behind her black veil, she is a prisoner, jailed by her father, her husband, and her country.  <P>Sultana tells of appalling oppressions, everyday occurrences that in any other culture would be seen as shocking human rights violations: thirteen-year-old girls forced to marry men five times their age, young women killed by drowning, stoning, or isolation in the "women's room."  <P>PRINCESS is a testimony to a woman of indomitable spirit and courage, and you will never forget her or her Muslim sisters.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Sultana's story is amazing, sad, and shocking. She paints a picture of living in incredible wealth and opulence, never having to work, always surrounded by servants, the table overflowing with expensive imported food. And yet, the conditions of her life are far worse than any working girl in America. Sultana is a princess of the royal house of Saud, yet her life -- and the life of all Saudi women -- is totally controlled by men. <P>Saudi women are mere possessions of men, with no rights. In Saudi Arabia, women's births and deaths are not recorded. Their fathers and later their husbands can have them killed or locked up forever in dark and solitary confinement for behavior that is considered ordinary in most other cultures. As I read her story, it occurred to me that women in Saudi Arabia have the same position in their society as pets have in mine. Many people love their pets and lavish them with affection and good care. The same is true of Saudi men's behavior toward their wives and daughters, but, like our relationship with our pets, the men can really do what they want. If someone kills their pet, there is usually no consequence unless it was done in a cruel manner. But a woman who has been raped through no fault of her own (as happens in one of Sultana's stories) can be put to death for "lewd behavior" and the type of death does not even have to be humane. One of Sultana's friends was drowned in a swimming pool by her father, and another was confined to a "women's room" (no light or human contact) til her death.<P>Sultana is spunkier than most, actually tricking her husband and escaping with her children to London when he tells her he is taking a second wife. Oh yes, let's don't forget that abuse! Men can have multiple wives, and girls can be married off, often to old men, as soon as their periods begin. Most have no chance for an education, nor can they reject the husband selected by their father. And of course, they must be constantly covered from head to foot with an ugly black garment.<P>I found the descriptions of Saudi society most unappealing. We have here a people who do no work and retain for themselves obscene amounts of wealth, with which they do little but build huge palaces mostly decorated in poor taste. I wonder if Sultana could even survive as an American who might have to clean her own house, cook her own food, and work for a living. That would be a big change from having five palaces and three Lear Jets! The men usually don't bother to work either; they live off the oil money.<P>For a story eerily similar to Princess where the heroine actually does flee her homeland and become a working American, I recommend Mirage by Soheir Khashoggi. It's fiction, but the situations are very much alike, with Mirage also featuring a wealthy Muslim woman oppressed by men, but finally making her escape. That book, like Princess, is a stunner.<P>I know it's not politically correct to bring up the role of Islam in this abusive behavior, but religion is the justification for the Saudi treatment of women, and the verses form the Koran in the back of the book make it clear that Islam recommends harsh treatment of women in many circumstances. Certainly the Saudis carry it to extremes, but Islam is no friend of females. Neither is Christianity or Judaism, which are both male-centered, but I know of no nation that tops Saudi Arabia for abuse of women.</span>

                    <span>To start with I read the Arabic translation of this book when I was in Cairo last week. It was translated by "Hisham Yahia" and published in Cairo (ISBN 977-5185-24-6) Jan 1996. Now I bought the original English version to compare. I am a pediatrician who worked in Saudi Arabia for 5 years and I witnessed a whole lot of corruption and injustice there, including discrimination against women, rape of young kids by their teachers in schools, and severe violation to human rights everywhere there. Although the Arabic translation is not well written, I can say that the book is a good panoramic image of the Saudi live. This culture has nothing to do with Islam. It is meant to protect the rotten government. I witnessed myself a tragedy of an Egyptian family whose young child was raped, and because the criminal was a VIP. The father of the child was humiliated and "lashed" in public, as a punishment because he dared to file a complaint. I personally recommend this book to the American reader, and I hope many other books about the miserable live in Saudi Arabia would be available. When you read this book please keep in mind that all this corruption and injustice do not belong to Islam the great religion that is victimized there. Perhaps USA would change its policy, and start seriously to pay attention to the human rights in this country.<P>Friday, August 27, 1999</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Anytime I had a moment to read, I reached for this book and was absorbed by the story. I'm ready to read more books by Princess Sultana. <P>This is a fascinating first-hand look at what women have to go through and live under in countries where life is ruled by men. There isn't any way out of that life except by following or being forced to follow the cruel or oppressive conditions. <P>This book follows the princess from her girlhood to an arranged marriage and its consequences. <P>Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in women's rights, their lives and dark secrets in different countries.</span>
