                <span id="Label1">Besides being one of the most readable and understandable guides to the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) (and related technologies) ever written, Alan Gordon's <I>The COM and COM+ Programming Primer</I> also gives today's COM developer an up-to-the-minute guide to COM+, including excellent hands-on demonstrations of installing and deploying COM+ objects.<p>  The best thing about this text has to be the author's extremely engaging writing style and clear explanations of thorny COM concepts, like interfaces, GUIDs, and other nuts-and-bolts issues that help make Microsoft's component standard tough-going for beginners. An experienced educator, the author makes use of clear examples and analogies--for instance, describing COM as a "software bus" where components can be shared across applications and projects. If you've been baffled by other books on COM, this book's easygoing presentation may do the trick. It also helps that the text traces each slippery term in the Microsoft COM marketing arsenal. It shows how labels like "OLE," "COM," and "ActiveX" have changed over the years.<p>  After a comprehensive tour of the basics, <I>The COM and COM+ Programming Primer</I> turns toward distributed COM (DCOM) and then onto today's COM+. Several useful tutorials explain building COM objects using Visual C++, including using ATL wizards. When it comes to COM+, the text shows how built-in transactions, object pooling, and queued components can be used to create more scalable and reliable distributed applications. With plenty of screenshots detailing how to install and configure COM+ components, this book will let readers get going with COM+ in their own projects.<p>  <I>The COM and COM+ Programming Primer</I> shows how basic COM has evolved into today's COM+ standard--not by getting rid of the basics, but by enhancing an already capable component standard with new middle-tier resources. This title provides an excellent introduction to basic COM for anyone new to this standard, and provides the latest on COM+--which will help more experienced readers take their skills to the next level. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B>  <ul> <li>COM overview, advantages of components, COM as a "software bus," COM+ basics, and ActiveX and OLE  <li>Object design with COM <li>Interfaces and objects <li>Basic COM objects with Visual C++ <li>Using the Active Template Library (ATL) <li>In-process and out-of-process servers <li>OLE automation basics <li>COM callbacks and connectable objects  <li>Threading (single, multiple, and thread-neutral apartments)  <li>Distributed COM (DCOM)  <li>COM+ architecture and system services  <li>COM+ transactions, object pooling, and queued components  <li>Three-tiered applications in Windows Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA)  <li>Tutorials for developing and deploying COM+ components  <li>Interception  <li>COM+ events </ul></span>

                    <span>I have read many books on COM and COM+ and I would recommend this book as one of the essential books to bring any programmer into the world of COM and COM+. <BR>Perhaps, it's because of the authors background as a teacher, I don't know, but this book takes EXTREME care in the organization and progression and just as importantly in the source code that goes with it. This really stands out compared with so many of the other books I have come across.<BR>I could go on and on, but just to single out one source of praise, the author takes great care in telling the user how to set up the development environment. I have seen so many books that perhaps assume everything will work or that their readers are smart enough to figure this all out for themselves. <BR>It was published in 2000, and Microsoft is moving everyone to .NET, but I still believe this is valuable to resource every Microsoft platform programmer interested in making sense of COM, should have on the bookself.</span>

                    <span>I contacted Prentice Hall about the FTP site not working, and they fixed the problem promptly -- the code samples are now available.<P>I've looked at other COM books, and this may be the most useful one available. It contains plenty of practical examples, and is written with more care than most recent programming books. Perhaps as a result of the ridiculous pace with which new tools and standards are being introduced in these hectic times, there's a tendency for authors to rush to get their books on the shelves first. I'm happy to report that this book is not a rush job; it's definitely a keeper.</span>

                    <span>I think its an excelent intro to COM technology for those of us, who does Windows/C++/MFC/Win32 API programming, but haven't touch COM yet. Book is very clear written, easy to follow. Author illustrates each topic with short and simple example, yet good enough to understand whats going on. All sample projects are presented in "how-to, step-by-step" style.<BR>Certanly, this book is not for beginners - you must understand OOP, classes, threads, synchronization, etc.<BR>After this one, you will only need "Inside COM" or "Inside ATL" type of book! Good luck!<BR>P.S. Attention VB developers: this book is for C/C++ folks..</span>

                    <span>This book is beautifully written. Very clear explanations. A nice logical flow and obviously the author knows his subject well.<BR>However, the production of the book is awful. In the text there is code that is missing. In order to solve the problems in building the examples, I downloaded (ftp) the code from the book site. Some of the downloaded code refused to compile due to missing lines. When finally it compiled and built, it refused to run giving "Invalid class string" errors. It is such a shame that such a good book is flawed in this way.<BR>In spite of all this, the text is clear and explains the horrors of COM software well.<BR>I am glad I bought it.</span>
