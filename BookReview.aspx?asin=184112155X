                    <span>Very basic book on doing business via the web. This should have been released a generation ago when Amazon.com itself was finding its way. The new enterpreneur exploring online business is more knowledgeble than the informaiton and insight provided here and hence can disappoint reading it. It may be suitable for those who are hearing the name of e-business and trying to set up the business online for the first time in their country to know what happend when Jeff Bezos tried doing so for the first time in the history. Certainly this book is not for those who already heard about e-business.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Saunders has taken riding someone else's wave to a new low - two waves really.   The first is the branding and selling power of anything with "Amazon.com" on it.  The second is the hope that this book will follow in the footsteps of Robert Spector's, "The Nordstrom Way," in giving the reader some insight into the world's leading and most successful e-commerce enterprise.   Unfortunately, she fails to even remotely live up to either.  <p>The book is dry and completely uninformative.  Even worse, it's factually incorrect.  A couple examples (though there are many, many others):<p>According to Saunders,  Amazon.com set up shop in Seattle, Washington because Ingram is there.   Um, Ingram is in Oregon, not Washington.   What the heck is the Federal Trust Commission?  I think it's usually referred to as the Federal Trade Commission.<p>These two errors and the many others in this book have regrettably been printed before - usually in the popular press - which speaks volumes about where she got her material.<p>The book is marketed as an investigative look at the business model and "Ten Secrets" that make it work.  Considering the legendary secrecy surrounding Amazon.com's business and the supposed investigative nature of this book, I find it pretty amazing that she knocked it out without attempting to consult a single (current or former) insider.   But then again,  after the first two pages it becomes very clear that she had no intention of going out of her way.  The book itself is about as pure an attempt to capitalize on Amazon.com's success as could have been imagined.   Oh, and the ten secrets touted on the cover are actually basic common sense and obvious to anyone who visits Amazon.com on any sort of a regular basis.<p>If you're curious about Amazon.com, I say stick to Spector and read, "Amazon.com - Get Big Fast," (ISBN: 0066620414).  <p>Keep in mind that as of this writing, there really is no truly in-depth factual piece on Amazon.com and it's business model.  You can get more information about Amazon.com from the New York Times archives (online) or almost any Wall  Street analyst who covers the company.</span>

                    <span>It seems like more and more these days books are being written by horrible authors that companies could pick up off the streets and have them write a  book entirely about their company, but hide it as being a guide to  successful e-commerce.  If your looking at e-commerce, you don't just focus  on one "semi-successful business", you focus on the many  different e-commerce companies out there and you compare and contrast at  their success.  This book skims the surface on Amazon...but you are looking  for more.</span>

                    <span>When a publisher doesn't like your book proposal, the way they try to let  you down easily is to tell you it would make a good magazine article.  Why  would a publisher take on a book whose sources are newspapers, magazines,  and books from an author who tell us she doesn't like to buy books on line  from Amazon.com to write about a company that started as an on-line  bookseller?  Since you are obviously a fan of Amazon.com or you would not  be reading this review, my opinion is that you could probably write a  better history of the company and its success pattern than this book did  based on your own experiences with the company.<p>Given that everything in  the book was from public sources, I could not understand how the author  could call her points "secrets."  But here they are:<p>(1)  Understand e-commerce  (2) Build an entrepreneurial team (3) Focus (4)  Brand the site (5) Get and keep customers by offering value (6) Set up a  distribution network (7) practice frugality<p>(8) practice technoleverage  (improve your performance with technology) (9) constantly reinvent your  business model (10) add strategic alliances and acquisitions.<p>What does  that tell you that you didn't know before?  <p>On the interesting question  of whether Amazon.com will be able to sustain the cashflow losses, the  author says nothing other than that the harvesting period is still ahead.   <p>I compared this book to the book, Amazon.com, which had its own  weaknesses, and found that this book lacked an authentic voice of  reflecting what is different about the company it studies.  Where are the  anecdotes, the polls of customers, powerful material from message boards,  and quantitative analyses of what happened?  Even if Amazon.com executives  would not talk to her, you can certainly do better than this.<p>Oh, by the  way, the facts were not well checked.  Those I was familiar with were  usually wrong.  So you can't even rely on this book for baseline  information.<p>I can go on with more reasons not to buy and read the book,  but I don't want to waste your time.  You have better things to do.  <p>In  the same way that many Web Sites won't become valuable businesses, many  books about Web businesses aren't going to do any better.  Here is a fine  example of that observation.<p></span>
