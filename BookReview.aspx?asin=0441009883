                    <span>Merlin this time takes on his hardest task ever. Merlin has to hunt down the "Sord Of Arms." The "Sord of Arms" is a man that wants revenge on Merlin (reffering to the first book.) So the evil War Lord gives him sorwds as arms. The "Sord of Arms" is hunting down Fincayra's (island Merlin lives on)children hoping to draw Melin to him. Also at the same time Rhia (Merlin's sister) is trying to put an army of Fincayran's together, because at the longest night of Fincayra the Underworld gets close to Fincayra and is preparing to take over Fincayra to turn it to evil.</span>

                    <span>The ending is fairly easy to predict his choice if you have read "The Sword in the Stone". A great book however and plays on the other books in the series along with event in the story. Everything seems to all fit together and nothing seems out of place.The book shows his fears, how he faces some problems thrown at him and which ones he decides to deal with first and how. An interesting, i recommend it to Merlin fans.</span>

                    <span>Would you ever be able to unite almost every creature in the world within two weeks, while trying to stop an insane man with swords as his arms from killing innocent children, in an effort to stop the evil dark spirit lord along with his spirit army, or would you just give up trying?<p>	In T.A. Barron's fantasy novel, young Merlin must face unbeatable odds as he tries to unite all the creatures of Fincayra together. He faces many person versus self conflicts such as guilt, where he fails to do one of his duties. He experiences sorrow, when he must part with his true love. He must face the conflict of people versus people for the war to come. And he must face person versus nature when he must unite all of the independent creatures to fight a devastating war. And on top of all that he has to make the most powerful decision he will ever make.<br> <br>	To me this book was excellent, a real page turner. I really liked the way Barron used so much detail, it made it seem you right there with Merlin. You could listen to the birds or feel the misty air.  I also liked the way he surprises you around the climax, when he brings someone back into the story. The only thing I really didn't like about the novel was how short the end was. I think it could use some more length. Overall I loved the book. Barron's work was brilliant. I encourage all others who like magic and adventure try the Lost Years of Merlin Series.</span>

                    <span>This is T.A. Barron's final book in "The Lost Years of Merlin" series. It is a must read for any one who liked Harry Potter books or just like fantisies. "The Wings Of Merlin" have many problems facing Merlin such as the sword armed warrior "Slayer".With winter's longest night quickly approching, and the island's chances seeming slim, Merlin sends his shadow to the giant Shim who has to bring all the orphan children to the shore of the speaking shells. From there he will try to guide their raft through the web of spells and to the forgotten island. From the forgotten island Merlin must master leaping to get to the circle of stones before the longest night to either face a spirt army by himself or with all of the island at his side. The Terrains touch and the spirit army comes, then the evil Warlord himself comes through. Merlin then starts a battle full of magic with The evil Warlord.</span>
