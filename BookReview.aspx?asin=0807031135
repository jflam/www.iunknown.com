                    <span>One of the things I liked best about the Power of Their Ideas was the engaging writing. Meier writes as if whe is conversing with you. The development of theory backed with her personal experience and anecdotes from her schools make her ideas come alive. With relatively short chapters, each dealing with a major issue confronting public education today, and journal entries interspersed, the book is very accessible.<P>Easy enjoyable reading with powerful ideas. Meier gets one to think, as she must do for those who attend her schools. She engages you in her journey, without being afraid to show you where she has run into difficulties and where she sees no simple answers.<P>All in all this is a wonderful book for anyone who is interested in exploring what is happening and could happen with public eduction in this country.</span>

                    <span>I am a college student majoring in education and read this book for a class. I found the book very interesting and enlightening. It not only had many appealing profound statements, but several ideas that could actually be put to use. For the most part it wasn't a difficult to read. Sometimes I felt it was a bit dry and as if two people wrote it. From time to time, there were sections that I felt I needed to read twice to comprehend the thought behind the statements. This might have been due to me being a beginner in this field. However, it is a book I will suggest to others. I believe it should be required reading for my local board of education.</span>
