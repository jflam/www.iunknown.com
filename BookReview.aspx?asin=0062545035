                    <span>When I first read this, I was a young mother, working full time and trying to get a master's degree! This book became my "Circle of Quiet" where I could slow down and remember what was important to me. When it came out in paperback, I dipped into the grocery money and bought 10 copies and gave it to every friend, saying "You've got to read this." Madeline L'Engle's way of sharing the magic and mystery of everyday life probably saved my sanity. It was like having an older "wise woman" friend to go to. I've always been grateful she was there when I needed her</span>

                    <span>Madeleine L'Engle has the great and wise gift of addressing the questions of life in a way that makes everyone who reads her feel welcome in the conversation. Whether she discusses ontology or marriage or writing, she brings deep humility and the evidence of ordinary life to bear.<P>This first journal of the series she wrote at Crosswicks was very comforting. Like millions of people, Madeleine L'Engle became a childhood fixture of mine with the Wrinkle in Time series. Reading this book was like tea with an old friend, when perhaps the conversation goes a little slow, but you know you don't have to say anything to be understood.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book very much. I had been looking for a writer who treats the concept of kairos in a literary style. I have found her. Marguerite Yourcenar also works in the magic circle. Kairos is a commonplace of Renaissance thought, but it really began to take on a mythic quality in the Hellenistic period. The concept of kairos is found in Hippocrates, Isocrates, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, in old treatises on iconology, in dictionaries of rhetoric, and in the theology of Paul Tillich. Lysippos (Hellenistic) created a sculpture that was named Kairos, the youngest child of Zeus. Kairos appears as "occasio" in the Latin renaissance. It means "opportunity" or can refer to a special moment in time, an opportune moment. You are probably beginning to make the connections with the book. Kairos has always been a part of literature. It is a concept of time always used but rarely identified. L'Engle is just the writer to work out the theme. The Quiet Circle, as a title, is a perfect fit. Kairos is circular time, not linear. I can't imagine her calling the book The Quiet Line. It is so much easier for people to inhabit a circle than a line. <P>I disagree with the reviewer who says that L'Engle is doing what she preaches against. I think rather that L'Engle is using that other renaissance concept, 'sprezzatura'. Did people chastize Baltassare Castiglione the author of the concept of sprezzatura for expounding on the art (which is the concept of doing something without revealing your secret) ? Yes they have, and they always appear ridiculous. Those who enter a magical circle always need a guide, L'Engle is just such a writer.</span>

                    <span>After the first 1/4 of the book, I was unsure of where it was going. Then, after entering into "kairos" (as Madeleine refers to it as..the Greek work for time which means time not being confined) with the book, I found myself getting deeper and deeper into it. <P>The first time Madeleine really goes off and tells a story of her small town and the new couple that came in and "changed" things up a bit, I started to smile. I could relate...ever so much and this made me play out my own story as I read hers. I became so involved that I forgot the time, forget what page I was on and almost forgot that I was reading. That is where I first experienced kairos with "A Circle of Quiet" and thankfully, it was a transcendent moment at that.<P>I still am thinking of the title and wondering if that is wholly appropriate for a book like this. I'm not sure. I think it means something a little different to me....but again, this is subjective stuff and extremely personal. Anyone with an imagination alive enough will experience something deep and profound and beautiful and wonderful from this book. Anyone who lacks this, I would suggest rediscovering your imaginiation before entering into this book: truth is overflowing here, but when you don't believe in imagination, mystery and myth, it will be very hard to read this book and get anything out of it. :) <P>Thanks again Madeleine for a wonderful read; although it took me for a loop, I'm glad where I ended up by the last page.</span>

                    <span>This book is hard to pigeonhole. It's partly a journal of random thoughts, partly a retelling of some of the author's life experience. Much of the philosophy of life, ecology, relationships, and beliefs in God struck a chord with me. At times it dragged a bit, but overall it moved along at a comfortable pace. As previously described by others, it was like having a nice conversation with a friend (where you didn't have to talk, or interject a question or disagreement). One section in the end was annoying. She brought up a subject then decided to avoid letting the reader know what she was talking about (too painful to reveal). She hinted at an unpleasant life experience. Except for this, I'd give it 5 stars.</span>
