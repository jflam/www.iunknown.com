                    <span>Going through the contents and skimming through, I'm not sure how this book in any way relates to game programming.  It could be a great C++ book, but that's not what the title is about.  Some of the things it is suggesting break established paradigms of game developement.  It *may* help Windows based game programmers, but it sure doesn't cover any of the myriad of issue sin using C++ on a console such as the PS2, GameCube, etc....
<br />
<br />It seems like another C++ book.  Any thoughts on this?</span>

                    <span>I work as a programmer many years, and like many seasoned C
<br />programmers, I had a tough time to move from procedural 
<br />programming to object oriented programming and to do it 
<br />correctly! This book gave me the guidelines how to do it, and 
<br />am applying it in my software which is not game programming,
<br />as the tricks and ideas in the book are relevant for every
<br />C++ programming discipline

                    <span>I have to admit, I did *know* a good portion of the material covered in the book, but I can now honestly say I truly *understand* it.  As an industry outsider, looking to get in, its really nice to have so many concepts clearly and concisely explained, instead of just picking them up here and there.
<br />
<br />I have a collection of dozens of books on C++ and Game Programming, but its refreshing to finally find a work that explains relevant topics clearly without either going over my head or (to the other extreme) trying to sound too "hip" and coming across as amateurish.
<br />
<br />If you have a working knowledge of C++ and are looking to take the next step in applying your knowledge toward game-related concepts, this book is for you.  Don't expect to learn the specifics of AI or game physics, or the latest pixel shader technology, that is not what the book is about.  It covers the fundamentals of using C++ in game programming, and it covers them very well.</span>

                    <span>thats how useful i feel this book has been. i'm a games content coder, and this book has allowed me to expand on my base knowledge astronomically. if you already can code in c++, you just have no idea how it works under the hood, then this is the perfect book. it assumes you can code, it assumes you know the basics atleast of c++, and then it tells you exactly how all those wonderful features you use actually work. every chapter contains constant appraisals of the performance and efficency costs of every aspect of c++, the stuff thats really relevant for games coders.</span>
