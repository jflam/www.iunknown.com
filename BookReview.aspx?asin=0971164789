                    <span>I imagine the CD would have been just fine, but being more fond of my Macintosh than my Windows XP workstation, I thought I'd order up the online version of the FastTrack software.  DON'T.  Although it promises Macintosh and Linux support, the links to the Citrix clients are broken and their technical support admits that, yeah, maybe it doesn't work after all.
<br />
<br />So, the Windows Citrix client is fine, except it's a Citrix client and pretty slow.  While going through practice questions, the Citrix server became "unavailable" twice, interrupting my test pretty signicantly.  
<br />
<br />Online testing sounds like a good idea; but they don't have the technological expertise to handle it with this version.</span>

                    <span>While preparing for the PMP exam, I've used a number of question databanks software but the most helpful and the closest to the actual exam, was PMPFasTrack. No doubts about it. So from this perspective, using this software package will give you a boost of at least 60% increase in passing the exam. I should say that I've passed the exam on 17.02.2005 with as score of 183 or 91%.
<br />
<br />This software has 2 drawbacks though:
<br />
<br />1/ The price is a killer and it's definitely too high. This software it's not worth 300$, but if you really need the certification and are prepared to invest in it, then do it. Maybe your company would cover the costs!
<br />2/ I've bought the PMPFasTrack with only 12 days before the exam and started to use it intensively with 8 days prior to the exam. On a regular day, I would "consume" anywhere between 100 and 350 questions by testing either by knowledge area or process group modes. When you do testing over such a short period of time, in spite of the fact that there are about 1300 questions in the package, you get to know them all, which is a problem when you actually simulate your exam. In may case, I've consistently scored over 92% in the simulation exams, but the results are biased because you know the questions (at least you've read the questions before, if not remember the answer). I recommend to test your knowledge using other sources, such as the on-line testing ESI is offering or other software packages like PM Power Track from Management Concepts, in order for you to be able to correctly assess your knowledge level before going to the exam. If you use the software over a longer period of time, then you should not have this problem.
<br />
<br />For conclusion, despite the heavy price this package will dramatically increase your chances to pass the exam.</span>

                    <span>Here's my recommendation for passing the PMP exam.  You need this software, Rita's PMP Exam Prep book (also available on Amazon), and a copy of the PMBOK.
<br />
<br />Read the book and do the exercises, referring to the PMBOK guide only as directed or as necessary.  Once you've completed the book, take a simulation test in PM FASTrack.  It will identify areas you are weak in.  Go back to the book and study those areas again.  Take another simulation test and you will be ready for the real PMP exam.
<br />
<br />This is the strategy I used, and I passed the certification exam with ease.</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer:  I recently passed my PMP, and credit goes in large part to the University course I took prepping me for the experience.  I purchased Mulcahy's book and the FastTrack CD for additional perspective and to ensure my preparation.  I'd dare say that I passed the PMP 'in-spite-of' Mulcahy's book.
<br />
<br />Mulcahy's book is not a worthwhile investment, and there are many other better instructional sources available.  One does not need to succomb to Mulcahy's preachy sarcasm and condescention in order to have a solid study aide for the course.  The FastTrack CD, on the other hand, is a worthwhile tool if you want additional practice under the real-world conditions of the exam.  The simulation software is nearly identical to the format of the real test, and will give you a strong barometer of what you should expect on the actual exam.  This was entirely true for me to within 2 points.  
<br />
<br />I'd recommend the investment in this as a 'simulator only' if someone needs the practice and experience.  But based on her book, which at best is a very poor instructional guide, you'd do better taking the money you'd spend on the book and investing it in any of the numerous other resources available to recap those areas of weakness from the exam.  </span>

                    <span>I have bought lots of books in order to be prepared for the PMP exam. This CD, combined with Rita Mulcahy's book and the PMBOK, is the best combination I could find on the market. It forces you to think the "right" way and fully explains each answer to all the questions. Moreover, it is as close as possible to the real exam.<br>I do not regret the investment made, as I passed the exam on the first attempt.</span>
