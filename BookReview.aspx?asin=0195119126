                <span id="Label1">For the last fifty years, most popular and scholarly works have agreed that prehistoric warfare was rare, harmless, and unimportant. According to this view, it was little more than a ritualized game, where casualties were limited and the effects of aggression relatively mild. Lawrence Keeley's groundbreaking War Before Civilization offers a devastating rebuttal to such comfortable myths and debunks the notion that warfare was introduced to primitive societies through contact with civilization.  <P>Building on much fascinating archeological and historical research and offering an astute comparison of warfare in civilized and prehistoric societies, from modern European states to the Plains Indians of North America, Keeley convincingly demonstrates that prehistoric warfare was in fact more deadly, more frequent, and more ruthless than modern war. He cites evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world, and surveys the prevalence of looting, destruction, and trophy-taking in all kinds of warfare, again finding little moral distinction between ancient warriors and civilized armies. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he examines the evidence of cannibalism among some preliterate peoples.  <P>But Keeley goes beyond grisly facts to address the larger moral and philosophical issues raised by his work. What are the causes of war? Are human beings inherently violent? How can we ensure peace in our own time? Challenging some of our most dearly held beliefs, Keeley's conclusions are bound to stir controversy.</span>

                    <span>This amazing little book ( 244 pgs. including footnotes and index.) should utterly change the way anthropologists view man's prehistory and the remaining prestate societies in the world. Keeley thoroughly and meticulously documents that prehistoric warfare was in fact far more frequent and deadly than modern warfare between state societies. Keeley shows that prestate warriors often more than not held their own in battles against civilized armies and often defeated them. Their ultimate defeats at the hands of state societies were often more attributable to introduced diseases and the logistical superiorty of modern economies than to military strategy and tactics. One particularly illuminating passage involves a New Guinean tribal leader who after seeing an airplane for the first time, asked for a ride and then permission to take along some heavy rocks. These rocks he wanted to drop on an enemy village!! He had understood within minutes the military significance of aircraft that had eluded many generals and admirals for a generation. Some of the passages in the book make for gruesome reading, particularly the sections on cannibalism, enemy torture, and civilian massacres. Most importantly, Keeley documents how anthropologists have in his words "pacified the past" out of a sense of guilt over imperialism and the two world wars of the 20th century. He shows numerous examples of anthropologists and archaeologists grasping at straws to explain away unambiguous evidence of warfare at numerous sites in North America and Europe. He even points out as a young archaeologist that he also engaged in a lot of similar wishful thinking. This book should be required reading in anthropology classes throughout the world, but sadly it will probably be ignored because it challenges too many entrenched beliefs.</span>

                    <span>Although extremely poorly edited, this slim volume represents a revolution in understanding early human history. <P>The received wisdom in cultural ethnology is that true war was unknown to our species before the advent of so-called civilization. Not so; this book draws upon archeological and comparative ethnological data to show persuasively that bloody war has been a constant in human development up until the latter half of the twentieth century. Indeed, despite advancements in the technology of slaughter, and despite the cataclysmic events of the two world wars, on average the likelihood of death in battle has never, at any point in human evolution, been lower than during the current century.<P>Much of the book is dedicated to an analysis of pre-civilization battle tactics (i.e., tribal tactics as observed during the modern period, ancient descriptions of tribal adversaries, inferences from the archeological record), and of their comparison with the methodologies of modern warfare. Keeley takes great pains to "defend" pre-civilization warfare as equally deadly and even "total" as any modern campaign. <P>Overall, this is fine scholarship, and important reading for anyone seeking to understand human culture or the conditions of human evolution.</span>

                    <span>To my knowledge, no anthropologist today claims that war didn't exist in pre-state societies. However, the evidence indicates that prior to the advent of agriculture, it was a relatively rare occurance. Most of the author's examples of "primitive" warfare are from agricultural societies, and therefore not applicable.<P>The book is also full of mind-boggling distortions of the archeological record. For more on this point, I urge readers to see the review of War Before Civilization in American Anthropologist.</span>

                    <span>It has been some years since I read this book, but having come across it again by chance recalled the impact it made on my first reading. Forgive any flaws in my memory of the details, but this is what I have carried with me from "War Before Civilization." If you adhere to the concept of the 'peaceful savage,' the book may offend you. If you believe in a past 'golden age' where life was simple and carefree compared to the present, you will likely dismiss this book. If you think life now is harder and more dangerous than it was in the past, you will not get much out of this read. If you are sure that primitive societies lived long, healthy, safe lives in harmony with the environment and at peace with one another, then stay in your bubble and skip this book. Keeley does not carry the guilt many today feel regarding the destruction of "primitive" cultures and societies. Archaeology and statistics more than sociology and anthropology form the basis of Keeley's conclusions (if I recall correctly). To summarize: people are violent regardless of the era, and more so when resources are scarce, meaning modern technology makes more resources available now than were available 'Before Civilization.' Modern science allows people to live healthier and longer now than in the past - i.e. probably very few people died from Alzheimer's or cancer in primitive societies because hardly anyone lived long enough to acquire these diseases, regardless of what the causes today are (old age, diet, genes, pollution, whatever). Sure, more people today die in armed conflict than did 'Before Civilization', but as a percentage of the whole, the numbers today are no worse, if not better, than in the past. In addition, the losses today are more easily survived by the whole, as there are more people to start with in a modern society (which doesn't do the individual dead any good, but that's not the point). And while killing methods today are both faster and more efficient, healing and recovery from non-fatal wounds has also improved (e.g. gangrene vs. penicillin). Now if you were one of the people who survived broken bones, avoided impacted wisdom teeth or the need for a root canal, recovered from injuries, always had proper clothing and shelter regardless of the weather, had abundant and consistent nutrition without access to a grocery store or vitamins or your backyard garden, had no allergic reactions to anything, reproduced with ease, skipped any birth defects, resisted all those nasty viruses, bacterial infections, and festering wounds, then you might have lived long enough to meet your grandchildren. It definitely would have been a 'Golden Age' for you and you alone, but doesn't that same thing apply to any era? With that kind of good fortune, you probably would have been running things in a primitive society just by outliving everybody else. And while any complaints we today have about the imperfections of modern 'Civilization' may be legitimate, "War Before Civilization" makes it abundantly clear that, ultimately, complaining is a luxury.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The thesis of this book is that warfare has always been an aspect of the human condition, and that it was as frequent and as deadly in Pre-historic times as in recorded history. The book relies on two types of evidence: archeological, and ethnographic. Archeological evidence can attest to the existence of warfare, not the frequency, but the distinction is lost. Another distinction not properly made is between peoples who fight defensive wars and aggressive wars. Keeley devotes entirely too much time to arguing with early 20th century scholars, and the tendency of more recent scholars to ignore evidence in order to maintain that war was primarily a function of civilization. Ironically, Keeley frequently cites a study of Yanomomo Indians, discredited by Kenneth Good's wonderful book ("Into the Heart ...."): Good did not find the aggression his mentor had declared existed. Having said all this, if the reader is willing to skim at times, this is a very interesting book It provides insight into how war was waged, the causes of war, psychology of the peoples involved, and what warfare implies as regards the human animal. It adds to the discussion on wars between primitives and Europeans found in Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book ("Guns, Germs and Steel"). Keeley makes a fascinating contrast between Indian/White conflicts in the US west vs. the Canadian west, and the causes of this difference.</span>
