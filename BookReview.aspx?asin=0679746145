                <span id="Label1">In a dizzyingly short period of time, homosexuality has gone from being the love that dare not speak its name to the one that shouts it. Refreshingly, in this wide-ranging discussion of the moral and political status of homosexuals, Sullivan, the gay former whizbang <i>New Republic</i> editor, prefers the middle register. On the one hand, he shuns the liberal tendency to give gays victim status but, on the other, advocates the legalization of gay marriage because he views it as the public recognition of a gay's basic human right to fully love another member of his/her group -- a right that, Sullivan notes, even bigots generally grant those they hate.</span>

                    <span>In this book, Sullivan divides and defines the political views on homosexuality into 4 views - the prohibitionists, the liberationists, the conservatives, and the liberals (the other reviewers have adequately summarized the 4 views, so I shall not add my own). He goes on to posit his view that all public (as opposed to private) discrimination against homosexuals be ended, particularly in the areas of marriage and the military.
<br /> 
<br /> Sullivan mercilessly dissects the 4 different views one by one, pointing out their flaws and weaknesses and internal inconsistensies, and why they are all essentially untenable. I found his essay on the liberationists (if they would allow you to label them so) is particularly poignant and even brilliant. He also has good discussions and arguments on the other views, but due to the sheer amount of arguments (and arguments based upon previous arguments), some flawed arguments have slipped in, rendering his conclusions not as convincing as it would seem to an uncritical reader.
<br /> 
<br /> I feel that the book would have been a great one despite the weaknesses pointed out above, if not for the completely dismal treament on the prohibitionists, which I am about to highlight.
<br /> 
<br /> Sullivan rightly notes that the prohibitionists are difficult to engage as they generally base their prohibitionistic views on the authority of the Bible. He goes on to show why the Bible does not really condemn homosexuality as much as it seems to.
<br /> 
<br /> For instance, in p.27 where he deals with the biblical passage in Leviticus 18, claiming that the "abomination" in v.22 is more clearly translated as "ritual impurity". This interpretation is from John Boswell, who is hardly recognized as an honest scholar, and happens to be gay (and Sullivan fails to mention that fact). Anyone familiar with the biblical languages or the passage in question will find this interpretation impossible.
<br /> 
<br /> Sullivan (from Boswell) goes on to claim that the context in Leviticus shows that there are "identical provisions against eating pork or engaging in sexual intercourse during menstruation." I looked up the passage(s) in question, and found that Sullivan forgot to mention that the immediate context is actually a command against offering one's children to Molech (in Lev. 18), and incest (Lev. 20), and bestiality (Lev. 18 & 20). Look it up for yourself.
<br /> 
<br /> This is not just intellectually biased. This is dishonest.
<br /> 
<br /> But he's not done -- there's still Romans 1 to deal with:
<br /> "26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
<br /> 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
<br /> 
<br /> The book claims that the passage is not dealing with homosexuality per se, but heterosexuals who engage in homosexual behavior, against their own nature. Meaning that those who are "naturally" or born homosexuals are not condemned in this passage!
<br /> 
<br /> Simply ingenious, but completely warped. Are we to believe that Paul and his readers didn't know about the clear Levitical injunctions against homosexual acts? Any honest and unbiased reader without an agenda to justify homosexuality can never come to this interpretation.
<br /> 
<br /> Sullivan has good intentions in engaging the prohibitionist in argument, but doing so by misinterpreting their source of authority (the Bible) is poor argumentation and wishful thinking, and completely misses the point. Very disappointing.
<br /> 
<br /> Sullivan should have dealt with the real issue behind the prohibitionist ideal -- there is a fixed moral law set by God, and the Bible is God's revelation to man. Sullivan has failed to grasp this point, and thus completely misunderstands and misrepresents the core prohibitionist deal.
<br /> 
<br /> In as sense I am glad I did not give up on Virtually Normal after the dismal chapter on the prohibitionists (and rating it only 1 star), as the rest of the book was much better - thought-provoking and rather enjoyable (thus I give it a couple more stars).
<br /> 
<br /> My recommendation - read and enjoy the book by all means, but don't forget your pinch of salt.

                    <span>Homosexuality has been been getting a lot of publicity in the last few years - and even more so in recent weeks, with the election of a gay bishop to the Episcopal church, and the subsequent discussion of gay marriage.  With so much talk nowadays, it is important to be informed.<p>This book, better than any other, clearly and thoroughly outlines the four main arguments for and against homosexuality, and critiques their strengths and weaknesses in a prose style that is both highly personal and incredibly reasoned and intelligent.  The Prohibitionists are the one school that is the most decidedly anti-homosexual - seeking to either punish or "cure" gays and lesibans.  The Liberationists seek  freedom from social labels and conventions, but, like the Prohibitionists, do not accept the concept of homosexuality as a valid state of being - there are no real homosexuals, only homosexual acts.  Sullivan sees them as well meaning, but misguided.  The Conservatives believe that homosexuals are entitled to a certain amount of privacy and respect, but homosexuality is still a sin.  Homosexuals do exist... but they can't help it.  They still disapprove of homosexuality, just not necessarily homosexuals.  The Liberals also mean well, and struggle for the rights of homosexuals, but unfortunately blanket them in their larger agenda of "helping the little people", so to speak - well meaning, but sometimes a bit patronizing.<p>Sullivan does more than criticize, however.  He also finds merit in these viewpoints.  However, his major argument is that these views either need to be overcome or modified if homosexuals are ever going to have an equally accepted place in society.  He also offers ways to overcome these different biases.  In the place of these four prevailing positions, he argues for a politics that guarantees the rights and equality of homosexuals - without imposing tolerance.<p>This is an incredibly articulate and brilliantly written book for anyone wishing to know the real truth about a lot of the political and social ramifications concerning homosexuality today, written by a very intelligent man.  It is a book for anyone who wishes to sound intelligent and well-informed when discussing this often heated and increasingly important issue.</span>

                    <span>Author Andrew Sullivan's book is a breath of fresh air in the field of gay studies.  Mr. Sullivan present different viewpoints on the subject of homosexuality (Prohibitionist, Liberationist, Conservative and Liberal)   To present any argument you must understand the position of your opponent and I welcome the chance here ( in this book) to do that.<br>Not everyone in the gay studies filed has embraced the book and some have spoken very publicly against it, which is funny to me since everyone wants freedom of speech and equal rights, but how quickly we are to condemn those whose viewpoints do not reflect our own.  In closing Mr. Sullivan makes some valid arguments for the legalization of same-sex marriage, which he claims would not undermine heterosexual marriage, but may actually strengthen it.  Finally someone who commands that we think about ouselves and our culture, who does not give the reader a sugary sweet view of what the world could, should be like.</span>

                    <span>Andrew Sullivan has written a gem with "Virtually Normal." In these beautifully written pages, we find an author exploring- his goal being to understand first, question next- four explanations for and proposed methods of dealing with homosexuality. In the end, he finds all four lacking.<p>   The doctrines given treatment are: prohibitionism- being gay is a choice of deviance and as such should be treated as a sin, constructionism- gay is merely a social construction and there would be no 'homosexual problem' if we deconstruct sexuality, Conservatism- we should let people be gay but homosexuality should NEVER be encouraged socially. Finally we get to Liberalism. Perhaps Sullivan finds the most trouble here. The liberal doctrine states that as a persecuted group, gays should be tolerated to the point that if social coercion becomes necessary (through 'hate crime' legislation and the like), all the better. Through 'education' (resembling indoctrination) equality can be forced. Save for prohibitionism, I would agree that liberalism is the most dangerous of all.<p>   Although it will be obvious that Sullivan has a special distaste for liberalism, he finds serious flaws in each of the four doctrines for good reason. His conclusion breaks sharply with all of them,resembling more of a classical liberal (J.S. Mill) approach. Tolerance should be encouraged, never forced. Government discrimination is the evil, private discrimination will die in the free market because it is always inefficient. Sullivan then devotes time to gay marriange and military service, asserting- very correctly- that untill homosexuals can serve their country openly and marry legally, they will always be on unequal footing. If the potential reader has never heard Sullivan speak on these issues, she should not delay. <p>   His afterword is a much needed response to seemingly universal misunderstanding on his book. As he criticizes the four dominant views, he gets criticized by them in turn. Even the 'conservatives,' who as ironic as it is, were the group that his defenders were overwhelmingly from, misunderstood his arguments against liberalism as an affirmation of conservativism. Sullivan, if I had to guess, is a republican with a small 'r', i.e. he believes in a somewhat self governing republic. Whatever your views, this book will challenge, educate, and motivate you.</span>

                    <span>As much as I may try to sympathize with a fellow gay conservative, this book is poor.  It is certainly worse than usual for Sullivan (a smart and fairly good writer): it is flat and ideological.  Sullivan's tendency to vilify results in gross and uninteresting caricatures of his opponents: he sets up straw men in what he calls "prohibitionists" and "conservatives," instead of presenting their arguments in the best light, as they themselves would.  This might be a good Oxford debate trick, but it will not appeal to his best and most thoughtful readers.  Sullivan does not come to grips with the core of the case against gay marriage, and I think that is because he is strikingly deaf to what is at stake in marriage.  <p>For instance, Sullivan argues that "the openness of the contract" and the "greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman" result in a honesty, flexibility, and equality that would "undoubtedly help strengthen and inform many heterosexual bonds" (pp. 202-3).  To view this as a gain for the marital bond, let alone *only* as a gain, is to be blind to how much would be lost, blind to what is demanded by romantic love itself, and blind to the greater richness and happiness of a fully flourishing family life over the "network of gay friendship" with all its "flexibility" and "sexual candor" (p. 192).  It is to see "a gamut of possibilities from anonymous sex to bourgeois coupling"-and only that; it is a cutting off of the true range, of assuming that the range experienced in homosexual life is the range in life simply, and therefore not seeing the unfortunate but overwhelming limitations of gay life (p. 194).<p>In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness.  Sullivan acknowledges many of these things, but attempts to give them a positive spin.  For example, concerning the frivolity of gay life, he praises it for its "irony or exhibitionism or irresponsibility" and its insight "that some things lead nowhere and mean nothing" (pp. 204-5).  There is something to this, but it is a limited perspective.  From the point of view of someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities (--from my point of view), I disagree that something very good can be built on such things.</span>
