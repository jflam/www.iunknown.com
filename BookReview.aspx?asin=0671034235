They wrote a report on the sad lives of circus animals and discovered that the Glitter Tent Circus is one of the worst animal abusers of all. Mrs. Dawson is determined to give her students the happy circus experience she remembers from her childhood; she won't let Erin and David share their report or pass around a petition asking for a different field trip. Erin is determined to force Mrs. Dawson to change her plans...or she'll stage a sit-in at school. <P> Then Erin sees an even bigger problem: Lilly, a mistreated elephant, is about to be sold to a hunting park. How can she save Lilly before it's too late? It seems impossible! <P> Can one girl -- and a class of sixth graders -- make a difference?</span>

                    <span>This book is GREAT!! Saving Lilly is an excellent book for animal lovers. It is about a girl named Erin who wants to save all circus animals including an Asian Elephant called Lilly, from harsh whips, little food, and dirty cages. Erin and her entire class work very hard to help them. I love this book because it shows that when something bad is happening, and you don't like it, you complain about it instead of taking action! Somtimes in this book I felt like cheering on for Erin's class! This book has a great way of "hooking" you in.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books i've personally ever read. it's about two kids, Erin and David, who for TAG do research about lives of circus animals. They find a lot of them are cruelly treated. Their TAG teacher then plans a class trip to the circus. Erin and David find the circus their going to is one of the worst abusers of all! Then their teacher says they have to go. If you wanna know the ending, you gotta read the book. I recommend this book to everybody!</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book for animal lovers especially! I really enjoyed this book! I would recomend this book to any of my friends! Here are the main events in this book: There are two kids who are in a TAG class( which is for very smart kids). Their teacher assigned a project for them on the base of circus animal cruelties. Meanwhile in their classroom their teacher is planning a suprise feild-trip if they and their class reads 300 books by a certain date. When they read all the books they had to they found out where their feild trip was going to take place. Please read this book to find out who Lilly is and more!</span>
