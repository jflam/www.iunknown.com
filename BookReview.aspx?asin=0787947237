                    <span>Many who want to be skillful facilitators are in a way "misled" by consultants, trainers or books on facilitation in the sense that techniques and recipes are cited and taught.
<br />
<br />With many techniques and methodologies delivered, honest "facilitators" sense that they are not getting there - people do not get engaged, people among themselves are not connected.
<br />
<br />Roger Schwarz, in his book "The Skilled Facilitator" shows that there is more to techniques, theories and methodologies. The very thinking, motives or mental models of the "facilitator" is an important part of the chemistry of the whole group.

                    <span>The subtitle of this accessible guide to facilitation, "Practical Wisdom For Developing Effective Groups", accurately describes the book's scope and utility.  In four parts and thirteen chapters, Schwarz provides an overview, with countless meaningful examples, of how facilitators can most effectively help groups develop their capacity for improvement.  He distinguishes between two types of facilitation: (1) Basic facilitation, which aims to help a group "solve a substantive problem"; and (2) Developmental facilitation, which accomplishes basic facilitation while helping a group learn "to improve its process".  He argues that three core values underlie effective group and facilitator behavior.  The first is "valid information", which means that relevant information is shared by group members and that all groups members can validate and understand the information. The second is "free and informed choice", which means that group members define their own goals and methods of achieving those goals using valid information. The third is, "internal commitment to the choice", which means that group members take responsibility for their decisions by making informed choices based on valid information.  Using a basic or developmental approach, facilitators most effectively intervene by making explicit and modeling these core values. These values are maintained by a group agreeing and sticking to essential ground rules, which Schwarz lists on p. 75 and treats extensively throughout the book. <p>In the heart of Schwarz's book are seven chapters on intervening effectively in groups.  In those chapters, he advises the reader on, among other things, how to intervene, meeting management, group problem-solving, following ground rules, and dealing with emotions.  He closes with wisdom on serving as a facilitator in your own organization and on the facilitative leader. His opening sections on how facilitation helps groups achieve their goals and establishing the foundation for facilitation lay the groundwork for his later chapters. <p>In the opening chapters, he includes two models worth mentioning.  In his "group effectiveness model" (p.23), Schwarz shows how group processes (the primary concern of the facilitator) interact with group structure and organizational context to contribute to a group effectiveness.  Group effectiveness is assessed through three criteria: (1) The group's services or products meet or exceed the expectations of the clients; (2) The processes and structures used to deliver services or create products enhance the group's capacity to work together; and (3) The group's experience is satisfying, not frustrating, for the group's members.  In the second noteworthy model, Schwarz presents the "diagnosis-intervention cycle" (p. 68). In this cycle, there are three diagnostic steps and three intervention steps.  In the diagnostic phase, the facilitator observes behavior, infers meaning and decides whether to intervene.  In the intervention phase, s/he describes observations, test her/his inferences, and helps the group decide whether and how to alter behaviors.  Understanding and using these models are critical for effective facilitation.<p>For the would-be facilitator or group leader, this book provides exactly what the subtitle promises.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book because I needed to read up on how better to sell facilitation and exactly what facilitators should be doing.  This book explains this and more.  However, if you are looking for a simple overview of what a facilitator should, could and would do incertain situations, this is NOT your book.  If you are a manager trying to be a better facilitator, do not buy this book unless you want in-depth information.<p>That said, if you are a facilitator looking to improve your skills, combine theory and practice or simply go back to the basics of what makes some facilitators great, this is your book. <br>Also, if you are a manager who really wants to become an effective facilitator/mentor, this is your book.  But don't think that you can simply read the material and be more effective.  The ideas and theory will take practice.  Luckily, the book also gives many examples to make the ideas and theories practical and concrete.<p>As I said, I bought it to become better at selling professional facilitation.  It gave me that and much more.  I will keep it as an invaluable resource and make sure all of my facilitators utilize the practices described in detail.</span>

                    <span>Roger's book is a unique hybrid of theory, practical exercises, examples, and personal stories.  It works! The art and science of facilitation (to make easy or easier) is presented clearly, concisely, and completely. And, that is what I enjoyed about Roger's book so much. He gives it to you with "the bark on." He makes you aware of the good, the bad, and the ugly relative to the practice of facilitation.<p>I had used this book for several years in my work as a trainer, facilitator, and manager. Then, I had the pleasure to attend a workshop conducted by Roger. He lives what he teaches. While I was fortunate enough to have my company pay for the workshop, it is one of only three workshops I have ever attended that I feel like I would pay my own money to attend.<p>Keep this book nearby. It is THE best read on this subject out there.</span>
