                <span id="Label1">Dave Hemsath and Leslie Yerkes have long believed that work need not be  bland and boring, and that a fun workplace is truly more productive than a dull one. To  check their theory, they asked successful businesspeople worldwide if fun played a  part in their corporate culture--and, if so, how it was actually manifested in everyday  life. <i>301 Ways to Have Fun at Work</i> is their lighthearted compendium of the  most useful and creative replies.</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for those looking to break out of the everyday 9 to 5 routine.  It's packed with a lot of examples from big name companies that almost anyone can do with the right amount of creativity.  I highly recommend!!  Reading is not like a textbook or how-to manual.  It's an easy read, you'll be bummed when it's through!</span>

                    <span>Leslie Yerkies has an amazing way of putting things in perspective. I've seen her speak live, and it's even better. Both she and her book are inspiring and insightful. You'll never see things the same way again.</span>

                    <span>Dave Hemsath and Leslie Yerkes present hundreds of methods and activities that incorporate fun into your organization's work: hiring, training sessions, meetings, communications, awards, and team work. Dedicated to "fun-loving people everywhere," this happy, easy-to-read book is clear and cheerful. The authors humorously present their "Twelve-Step Method to Fun." They suggest that you use it by incorporating one step a month for a year. The information presented can be used as a "quick read" for corporate ideas, or as a reference book for training program organizers and for personnel or staff development programs. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to CEOs or personnel directors looking for ways to boost company morale, or to staff members who want to make their work environment more pleasant.</span>
