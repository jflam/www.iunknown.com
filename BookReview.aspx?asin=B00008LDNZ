                    <span>the other reviews you'll read have more them amply discussed the actors, the music and such so I just wish to comment on what Otto Preminger brings to a film.  
<br />
<br />Two scenes come to mind in this film.  Both long shots.  Actor in the background, alone.  The camera slowly pans down and there we see (gasp!)  the top of a chair! or, in the second scene, we find a vase full of flowers in the foreground.  Neither of these two items would get even a snicker in today's blood thirsty movie audiences but in the hands of a master, they are terrifying.
<br />
<br />A classic of mood, shadow and tension.  This is a movie of studied suspense.  Should be required for all film students.
<br />
<br />You're going to love this one!</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Gene Tierney is so beautiful, but Dana Andrews is so hot.  He's the perfect hero in this classic film noir.  The extras are awesome, especially the Biography special for Ms. Tierney.</span>

                    <span>Released in 1944 to great popular and critical success, "Laura" was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, won for Best Cinematography, and solidified Gene Tierney's status as one of Hollywood's great stars of the 1940s. Based on the novel by Vera Caspary, "Laura" is a murder mystery revolving around the love of several men for its title character, the beautiful, enigmatic Laura. The film is often, though debatably, considered film noir due to its cynical characterizations and narrative structure, although it is not especially pessimistic and lacks the distinctive visual style of many classic film noirs.
<br />
<br />We are introduced to the mystery by Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a wealthy middle-aged columnist known for his acerbic wit. Laura was his protégé and, in his view, his creation to whom he was devoted and from whom he expected the same. Waldo has just learned of Laura's murder, and police Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) has come to interview him. Det. McPherson and Lydecker then visit Laura's Aunt, Mrs. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson), who happens to be very close to Laura's dandyish fiancé, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). All of these people had motive to murder Laura, and all seem very capable of it. McPherson appears stoic and disinterested in anything but business, often to the consternation of his suspects. But as he reads Laura's private diary and correspondence and stares at the portrait in her apartment, McPherson becomes enchanted with her memory, perhaps in love with it. And then his investigation takes an unexpected twist.
<br />
<br />Much of the credit for elevating "Laura" from a clever murder mystery to a great and memorable film goes to the sharp, evocative dialogue. The three murder suspects  -Lydecker, Shelby, and Ann- are shamelessly selfish, but remarkably conscious of their own characters. Lydecker says, "I'm not kind; I'm vicious. It's the secret of my charm" and declares, "In my case, self-absorption is completely justified." Shelby describes himself: "I don't know a lot about anything, but I know a little about practically everything." "I can afford a blemish on my character, but not on my clothes." Lines like those could sound campy, but these great actors deliver them flawlessly. They entertain the audience with clever banter while providing complex motivations behind each man's relationship with Laura. Dana Andrews impresses as a man who seems incapable of loving a real person, but who is infatuated with a ghost. Like the others, he evokes a intriguing mixture of sympathy and revulsion. In an interesting role reversal, Laura has concentrated her energies on her career, while her suitors are preoccupied with their lifestyles. Between Gene Tierney's star power, Otto Preminger's direction, Samuel Hoffenstein's script, fabulous supporting performances, and David Raskin's score -which produced a hit song, "Laura" is as captivating today as it was in 1944.
<br />
<br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): This is a quality print of the film, and the disc is loaded with features: 2 biographical documentaries, 2 audio commentaries, 1 deleted scene, a theatrical trailer, and the option to watch the film with a deleted sequence of Laura's transformation into a stylish society woman in tact. The 2 documentaries are "A&E Biographies". "Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait" (45 minutes) includes interviews with Tierney's ex-husband Oleg Cassini, sister Pat Byrne, and daughter Christina Cassini, among others. It follows Tierney's life from her birth in Brooklyn in 1920, to her success as one of the most popular actresses of the 1940s, through her marriage to designer Oleg Cassini and her struggles with mental illness in the 1950s, her retirement from acting and remarriage in the 1960s, until the end of her life in 1991 at the age of 70. "Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain" (45 minutes) discusses Price's nearly 60-year acting career, which included 100 films and nearly 2000 television appearances, and his avocation as a collector and promoter of fine arts. It traces his life from his birth in St. Louis in 1911, through his varied Hollywood career before turning to horror films, his final films and plays in the 1980s, to his death in 1993 at the age of 82. Includes interviews with Price's biographer Lucy Chase Williams, daughter Victoria Price, actress Jane Russell, among others.
<br />
<br />The two audio commentaries are both good. The first is by film professor Jeanine Basinger and composer David Raskin, who composed "Laura"'s score. These were apparently recorded separately, but on the same track. Basinger provides scene-by-scene analysis and commentary on the actors, characters, dialogue, directing decisions, and technique. Raskin comments on the score, but  unfortunately we rarely hear the music on the commentary track. The second commentary is by film historian and author Rudy Behlmer. He discusses the evolution of Vera Caspary's novel, would-be play, and this film in detail, based on information from drafts of the script, interviews he conducted with the principle creative persons, personal correspondence, and studio memos. He starts with Vera Caspari's idea for a story in 1939 and goes from there, eventually discussing the details of the film project. This commentary doesn't correspond to the scene we are looking at, but it is packed with interesting and probably hard-won information. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.</span>

                    <span>The opening credits of Laura are superimposed over a painting of Laura, which displays her alluring beauty--beauty many men desire, but never conquer.  It also offers a more ominous thought of jealousy, as many could do something very stupid during a moment of intense jealousy.  This is followed by a statement by infamous writer Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), "I should never forget the weekend Laura died...and I, Waldo Lydecker, was the only one who really knew her and I had just begun to write her story when..."  This statement is accompanied a low lonely flute and string music that augments the foreboding atmosphere in the film, and it carries a promise of further threats and suspense.
<br />
<br />Death has come to a young successful woman who has climbed the social ladder of success in a rapid manner.  This young woman was Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) who someone shot in the face with a shotgun.  The murder brings the audience into a dark and sinister atmosphere, much in the spirit of true film noir, as all the main characters are also suspects to the grisly murder of this once stunning woman.  Even the police cannot evade the audience's suspicions as the investigation unfolds.  However, only one thing is certain, someone pulled the trigger of the shotgun that departed the late Laura Hunt from this world.
<br />
<br />Briefly after Mr. Lydecker's initial statement to the audience the investigation begins and he is interviewed again by the police, as Mr. Lydecker volunteers to follow Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews).  The film quickly moves to introduce the audience to other suspects, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) and Mrs. Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson).  Mr. Carpenter was suppose to marry Laura the following week while Mrs. Treadwell used be Mr. Carpenter's personal benefactor and much likely more, which is revealed through the information that is provided.  Despite the introduction of these suspects the audience cannot eliminate the possibility of someone else being the murderer.
<br />
<br />In the true spirit of film noir Laura continues to haunt the audience, as the murder turns into a study of the upper-class.  These characters display the bad side of humanity, where greed, jealousy, vanity and more begin to create strong undercurrents that pull the story in different directions.  This diverging effect keeps the audience focused on the story, as it helps generate more suspense through the viewer's oblivious notion of who the murderer could be.  All characters have skeletons in their closet, which furthers the confusion of the identity of the killer.  To top the whole thing off the director Otto Preminger throws an unexpected curveball that will make the audience more intrigued by the story.
<br />
<br />Laura brings the audience an excellent film noir, which keeps the audience guessing until the identity of the killer is obvious.  A great deal of the film's success could be added to the cast's wonderful performance that enhances the apprehensive atmosphere, but it also rests within the mise-en-scene, music, and direction of the film.  The atmosphere is crucial for the film, and Preminger generates this cinematic milieu from the beginning, and it does not let go until the audience has left the darkness of cinematic experience, which leaves the audience with some thoughts to ponder.</span>

                    <span>Others before me have done a splendid job of describing the features and picture quality in this long-awaited disc. They're right, and the movie, of course, is superb. But has anyone else felt there might be a few minutes missing, specifically from Waldo's opening flashback regarding Laura? I seem to recall this went on longer, with him describing Laura's enviable fashion sense, etc. Perhaps I'm wrong about this missing piece, but I have a memory of a longer version, and I believe the laser disc has these extra few minutes. Their loss doesn't significantly harm the experience of the film, but I wonder if Fox might consider looking into this. Most people, it appears, have loved the DVD, and overall, it's great to see this film available, in any form. Fans of Gene Tierney should rush out to pick this up. She's lovely in it.</span>
