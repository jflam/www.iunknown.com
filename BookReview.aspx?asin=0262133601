                <span id="Label1">"Statistical natural-language processing is, in my estimation, one of the most fast-moving and exciting areas of computer science these days. Anyone who wants to learn this field would be well advised to get this book. For that matter, the same goes for anyone who is already in the field. I know that it is going to be one of the most well-thumbed books on my bookshelf." -- Eugene Charniak, Department of Computer Science, Brown University  <P>Statistical approaches to processing natural language text have become dominant in recent years. This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications.  <P>More on this book</span>

                    <span>My professor chose this book for a undergraduate course in Statistical Natural Language Processing and as a student I found it to be a great learning tool. It gave sufficient background in statistics and language so people with little background in this areas can get up to speed quickly. <P>Lots of interesting assignments are proposed at the end of each chapter, and while some of the questions are rather vague (particularly with respect to the data they are refering to at times) they can be good starting points for further discussion or projects.<P>As a student, I give this book an A+.</span>

                    <span>There are lots of books (and even more junk email) with titles like "Get Rich Quick". On the surface, this book is the exact opposite: a scholarly, scientific text aimed at comprehensive, accurate description, not at commercial hype. But if someone told me I had to make a million bucks in one year, and I could only refer to one book to do it, I'd grab a copy of this book and start a web text-processing company. Your return on investment might not be $1M, but this book delivers everything it promises. For all the major practical applications of statistical text processing, this book accurately and clearly surveys the major techniques. It often has pretty good advice about which techniques to prefer, but sometimes reads more like a catalog of listings (this reflects not on the authors' failing, but rather on the field's immaturity).<P>It's worth comparing this book to the other recent NLP text: Jurafsky and Martin's. (Disclaimer: I worked with them on the preparation of their text.) Jurafsky and Martin cover much more ground, including many aspects that are ignored by Manning and Schutze. So if you want a general overview of natural language, if you want to know about the syntax of English, or the intricacies of dialog, then Jurafsky and Martin is for you. But if your needs are more focused on the algorithms for lower-level text processing with statistical techniques, then Manning and Schutze is far more comprehensive. If you're a serious student or professional in NLP, you just have to have both.</span>

                    <span>If you can only own one book about statistical NLP, and the choice is down to this one or Jurafsky and Martin, choose this one. The mathematics is little more rigorous, but by no means daunting, and the exposition is clearer than J&M.</span>
