                    <span>In an age when no one can be critical of anything regarding religion, this book is a refreshing eyeopener. The books I have read in support of Islam have consistently ignored or explained away the horrendous human rights abuses in the Islamic world. If American Society treated women or any ethnic group the way women are treated in the Islamic World, we would be crucified for our abuses of human rights. However, whenever anyone points out the treatment of women in Islamic Society, the critic is accused of ignorance or bias. The abuse of women is so deep and opressive that many, if not most women in these countries buy into their own subjugation. It is clear that the fundamental flaw in Islam is the reliance on what Islam allows women. As Islam was created of, for and by men, the implication here is that women are only allowed in Islamic Society those rights some men somewhere allow them. Until humanity, and especially women understand that no one has the power to grant equality and human rights to women, but can only take away their rights, as women are entitled to all the freedoms that men now have, and men do not have any right to limit these human rights.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book, despite the fact that some sections are extremely sad. It's a powerful, riveting read, and extremely well researched. The author engages the reader in way you feel as if you are right there yourself talking to these women. It was obvious that Goodwin was able to develop a great deal of trust and rapport with the women she interviewed. I was also impressed at the variety of people she spoke with in countries that frequently have strict censorship. The book includes interviews with educated elite women to the impoverished illiterate, from conservative to liberal Muslims, and the author didn't just confine herself to the Arab Muslim world, but included non Arab-Muslim countries.<P> Having read the original version of the book, I still found it extremely helpful to go back and read the updated version, which has just come out, especially in light of 9/11, and the recent U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Price of Honor raised my awareness and understanding significantly of a part of the world we in the U.S. tend not to know a great deal about.<P> Equally important is the fact that the author is very respectful of Islam. I now understand why their faith is so important to Muslims, and just how integrated it is in their every day life and politics.<P> The book is an astounding tour of a large swathe of the Muslim world; the comparison within and between and among the different countries was fascinating. I highly recommend Price of Honor.<P> I am not sure, however, why Amazon continues to promote the older version of the book, while making potential customers search for the recently updated version.</span>

                    <span>While women can be mistreated by individuals in any society, Islam, at least extreme Islam, sanctifies the systemic abuse of all women.<P>"A man loves first his son, then his camel, and then his wife" <BR>Arab Proverb <P>This book, written in 1995 by Jan Goodwin, describes the sometimes gruesome position many women find themselves in just by living in many predominantly Muslim countries. It lays out a theory wherein the rising popularity of militant, extreme, Fundamentalist Islam is the main reason for the deterioration of the rights of Muslim women, as these Islamists increase they're power base at the expense of women's rights. Goodwin goes on to say that there is little or no basis in the Koran (the Islamic Holy Book) for the deteriorating position of women in many Muslim countries. The scope of women's disenfranchisement varies from mild to severe from country to country as Goodwin addresses conditions in the ten countries she visited. It also varies according to the beliefs of branch of Islam to which the woman's family belongs, Fundamentalist being the most oppressive. She also describes how this creeping tide of militant fundamentalist Islam in a danger to mainstream Islam and moderate Muslims. Though life in moderate or mainstream Muslim societies is very hard on most women it borders on slavery under extreme societies. <P>"There is no fun in Islam" <BR>Ayatollah Khomeini <P>In the Peoples Islamic Republic of Iran, Khomeini lowered the marriage age for females from eighteen to thirteen (ya hear that Jerry Lee), but permitted girls as young as nine, even seven in some cases to be married if a physician signs a certificate agreeing to their sexual maturity. (pedophilia heaven). However, to the Ayatollah's credit, he drew the line at seven, stating that it is forbidden to have sex with girls under seven! <P>"If a man and woman are alone in one place, the third person present is the devil" <BR>Prophet Mohammad <P>"Under the law as it stands in Pakistan, women who have been raped can be charged with adultery or fornication. The proof required for zina (sex outside of wedlock including rape) is that there be four Muslim adult males of "good repute" present who can attest to the act of sexual penetration. No male witnesses of good repute, of course, are likely to stand and watch a rape in progress without trying to stop it. And because of this requirement it becomes impossible to punish the rapists. Instead the victim is prosecuted. Her legal complaint of rape is considered a confession of illicit sexual intercourse." <P>"The majority of Muslim women find their lives controlled by their closest male relative. They are the daughters whose future marriage partners continue to be determined by their fathers. They are the brides who must be virgins on their wedding nights in a culture where, if they are not, honor killings are common and often carried out by the girls own brothers" <P>Muslim Irony <P>Fundamentalists restrict women from working, leaving the house unescorted and unveiled, being clergy, driving, reading the Koran, marrying an infidel, going to school after the sixth grade if at all and more. <P>The Irony of this treatment is in this Quote: "Such restrictions on women are necessary. They are to protect women's honor and they are also a symbol of our enormous respect for women"<P>CONCLUSION<P>This book and several others like it document the ugly, onerous, abhorrent living conditions perpetrated on many Muslim women by Muslim men in the name of Islam. In fairness, The Author has on numerous occasion stated there is no basis for this treatment in the tenets of Islam. In Islam, especially the fundamentalist version religion is power. The Clergy gain power by elevating their male adherents, as do the adherents, over the females. They also gain power by espousing enmity toward a common enemy as Khomeni did toward the U.S. This is the politics of Theocrats. (The last three sentences are my observations) <P>As for the book, I highly recommend it. It's 358 pages is well written, easy to read, compelling and chuck full of insights. The author, Jan Goodwin, did a tremendous amount of research, visiting and living in some ten countries, interviewing hundreds of, sometimes shy and reluctant, women to publish this very comprehensive book. Many of these women gave interviews, even though it endangered them. A couple observations I came away with is that the exception of Saudi Arabia, the holy seat of Islam, the quality of women's living conditions increased with the wealth of the country or in large countries the area. Also it seemed to me that for the average Muslim male, appearances took precedence over the welfare of his womenfolk. <P>There are so many other things I would like to bring out, like how many Muslim women are malnourished by getting only leftovers, while doing three times the work of her counterpart but you really need to read the book.</span>

                    <span>I was required to read this book for a geography class. At first I found it difficult to read. But as time went by, it began to be more interesting. I do not judge people based on religion because I come from a mixed religious household. It was difficult for me to understand what the difference is between a Muslim and Islam. Are they one and the same? Just as christianity has different degrees of severity, so does Islam. However, when one reads this book, they must understand that not everyone was interviewd. It would be impossible to do. It does discuss the higher class women and the torture they have gone through; the country's economic status- which does lead to education and/or health care quality; but also discusses the lower class as well- those in poverty or homeless. It does give a very good picture of what goes on over there and makes me feel better that I am here. However, if a person is raised in that society and is unaware of other options, how are they to know anything different. I understand that this is not how the Muslim religion really is, just as I understand that not every Arab is evil.<P>Enjoy the book- but remember the difference.</span>
