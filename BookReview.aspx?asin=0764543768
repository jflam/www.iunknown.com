                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>    <p>    If you want to use Visio to create enterprise software, this is the book for you.    <p>    The integration of Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect and Visio for Enterprise Architects provides a formidable tool. Visio offers powerful diagramming capabilities, including such things as creating UML models, mapping out databases with Entity Relationship diagrams, and aiding the development of distributed systems. Its integration with Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect means that C# or Visual Basic .NET code can be generated from the UML diagrams, and Visual Studio .NET projects can be reverse engineered to UML models.    <p>    For the developer already familiar with UML and looking to get the best out of Visio, the Visual Studio .NET and Visio for Enterprise Architects combination is weakly documented, and the quality information needed to realize the time-saving features of Visio just does not seem to be available, until now.    <p>    This book presumes that you are already familiar with the basic concepts of UML notation &#8212; this book will <b>not</b> teach you UML. Instead, this book will take you forward into the Visio environment, showing you how to make the most of its software related features.    <p>    <b>What does this book cover?</b>    <p>    In this book, you'll learn how to     <ul>     <li>Diagram business components in Visio     <li>Generate code from a UML model     <li>Reverse engineer Visual Studio .NET projects into a UML model     <li>Reverse engineer into a UML model without source code     <li>Document the project with UML and Visio     <li>Design distributed applications with Visio's diagrams     <li>Work with Entity Relationship database modeling, and round-trip engineering for database design     </ul>     </span>

                    <span>There are better books to train developers in individual skills - UML, Visio, dot net.  But this book does a nice job tying them altogether - it won't teach you how to model, etc. but does a very good job in applying and integrating all the skills.  There are some annoying typos, but no showstoppers.</span>

                    <span>I do not think that the title of this book is appropriate. The book is about UML but i question the professional bit in the title. The writing is okay but you can tell that different authors worked on the book. Had the book been a little more coherent I would have opted for 4 stars.</span>

                    <span>It is a total mystery to me why this book was written in the first place. From UML standpoint it covers only very basic scenarios. From software perspective it does not cover topics like "..how the hell do I specify .Net attributes and do not lose them in reverse engineering..." or "...why C# documentation is totally incompatible with what Visio produces...". The only thing this book teaches is how to do basic operations, which you probably can figure out on your own after 2 days of pocking around. DO NOT waist you money (I would use 0 star option if it was available)</span>

                    <span>In the best... excuse me---worst tradition of WROX this book is yet another example of incoherent fragments and inconsistent writing. The reason I broke my rule and bought a WROX book is because there's hardly any (if any at all) decent documentation on Visio and it's *real-world* applications by and for developers. No, this book is not a complete waste of money, but it could be a thousand times better. Read on.<p>The funnies thing about this book is that right from the outset one of the authors promises that the book would cover *one* and only one real-world solution as opposed to other books who feed you different examples all the time. I read this book from cover to cover and yet... every chapter laid out a different example! ? Note to authors: can you guys at least talk to each other? Let along sync up content. <p>As far as editing goes... Was there editing done at all? You'll see a number of annoying typos and strange grammatical errors. I also found errors in a few diagrams which is worse than typos. <p>Chapter 1 starts off with a brief introduction and overview of UML and its basic concepts. It's neither comprehensive or clear enough for beginners, nor is it useful for those who are not new to UML.<p>Chapter 2 is a nice "tour of Visio" even though they messed up a couple of diagrams so don't count on their accuracy. Very much for beginners.<p>Chapter 3, "Diagramming Business Objects" is worth the money you paid for this book. <p>Chapter 6, "Documenting the Project" is totally out of place. It goes back to the basic UML diagram, and whoever wrote this chapter, drew the diagrams in a pretty unorthodox way. A bizarre chapter to say the least.<p>Chapter 8 is another reason you might want to own a copy of this book. It presents a short yet informative introduction to ORM, creating a database from a model and reverse engineering an existing one.<p>To sum it up, two stars for the effort and *some* useful content. To those who wrote Chapters 3 and 8 thank you. Other than that---a very sloppy job by WROX yet once again. Not worth the money at all.

                    <span>The book starts out ok, and at first you are told that the examples in this book will all be related to the same business so that the reader can understand the progression.  The author also boasts that this book unlike most others will use references to the same business model for the entire book.  Yeah Right!!  Then the next chapter, most likely written by a different author starts using a completely different business model for his examples.  Every other chapter continues to change the business model in order to present the subject matter.  Not only is this very confusing, but sometimes the authors refer to parts of the book that don't even exist.  Its like parts of the book were accidentally left out.  Arrrrr!!!  Then to top it all off there are tons of spelling and grammatical errors that could have been caught by simple proofreading.  The solution to this problem, and I hope someone at Wrox is reading, is to not have more then one author write the book.  Wrox does this all the time with their books.  That's why most of their books suck!  I should have learned my lesson the last time I read a Wrox book, but the only reason I bought this one is because there is nothing else available on the subject matter.  And can you believe that they have a cover price of $59.99 for this garbage.  I am never buying another Wrox book again.</span>
