                    <span>How can one describe William Carlos Williams, a great brilliant writer. His words are so in depth and so meaning and can relate to any particular situation one might be in. His use of language is superior above others. Not until recently did I read something of his in a collection of poems that I had borrowed, and I saw one poem that stuck out to me. This poem is called Romance Moderne. This is a truly excellent poem and led me to be such a great admirer of William Carlos Williams. I've borrowed his collection of poems almost a thousand times from the library, and I still haven't finished reading all of his poems. It takes a necessary amount of time to soak in his words, and with such a great number of poems, I'd like to soak them all in, thus I will be buying the book for myself to have.</span>

                    <span>how do you discuss 23 years, the last half of a great poet's long career, in such a short allotment of space. you really can't. i will say that some of his better works is in the first volume. that isn't much more i can say than pick up his collected works.</span>

                    <span>Whew, check out that list. & I bet you haven't read half of them even if you are a Williams fan via his selected & Pictures from Brughel. <BR> <BR> This is the development of Williams' daily art, punctuated by an occasional masterpiece or near-surrealistic gemstone. Someone once asked John Cage, "With your methods, couldn't anyone compose music?" Cage replied, "Yes, but they don't." With Williams, it almost seems that everyone did. Williams, like every really fine poet/teacher I've ever met, was better at setting examples than at methods. He learned as he wrote, & I suspect his talk & his letters had a great deal more influence than his occasional stabs at poetics.<BR><BR><P>Williams stripped down American poesy & reconstructed it as a form of talk, which it had been all along beneath Whitman's yawping & Dickinson's obsessive editing & Frost plodding heavily though New England snow five steps at a time. Uncle Bill just didn't know any better. He didn't know he was supposed to be a somebodyelse; maybe a Stephen Benet, a William Vaughn Moody, an Edwin Arlington Robinson. Poor Bill. <P>This is roughly the first half of The Doc's amazin' journey. You'll know if you need it. Any intelligent poet friend will love it as a gift.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Williams was not trained as a poet, unlike the case of Pound (his friend) or Eliot (his "enemy"). He was thus fortunatrly refrained from any academic formula that might prevent one from being a great writer. Emily Dickison was that way made a great poet as was the case of Williams. But instinct and high sensitivity can provide one with fleeting inspiration for writing poetry usually of short piece, instead of "long-winded" ones. Paterson has some technical flaws. Yet taken into seperate parts, it still destinguishes itself. One doubt whether these poets can be great novelists at the same time. Writing novels needs more knowledge in composition, needs "operations" on the skills. In this sense, Williams and Dickinson differ from Eliot and Pound.</span>

                    <span>The overall strength of Williams' work lies in his power to summon image from where there was previously nothing. <P>Forget about the conventional tactics of poetry (meter, rhyme, etc.). Williams effectively occupies the outer regions of the land which is not prose. His power always properly lay in the simple yet vivid images (visual, aural, tactile, etc.) behind the words.</span>
