                <span id="Label1">Leigh Montville's <I>Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero</I> is the definitive biography that baseball fans have been waiting for. Montville, who was a sports columnist for the <I>Boston Globe</I> and then a senior writer for <I>Sports Illustrated</I> is an admitted Red Sox and Williams fanatic, and his passion for his hero rings clearly from every page, along with his clear baseball expertise. But Montville does not hide Williams's flaws. The young Williams was temperamental and justified bad behavior with batting prowess that could excuse just about anything. Quick to anger, "the Kid" had a gift for foul language, too. <p>  Montville's study offers insides accounts of Williams's obsessive development as a hitter and his constant struggle to perfect his swing (mistakenly called "natural" by sports writers with little understanding of his extensive preparation). The chapter on 1941, perhaps the greatest year in his career, draws on research and interviews never before published. Montville lets whole passages stand uninterrupted--from Williams's manager, Joe Cronin, from his teammate Dom DiMaggio, and from other players and baseball officials who tell the story of Williams's quest for a .400 batting average. The tale of the final day of the season (when he refused to be benched and went six for eight in a double header to jump from .39955 to his final total, .406) is as pulse-pounding as any thriller. <p>  Alongside its essential focus on Williams's baseball life, the book also delves into his military service during both World War II and the Korean War, his passion for sports fishing, and his commitment to helping children through the Jimmy Fund. Finally, Montville devotes a chapter to the controversy after Williams's death, exposing the back-and-forth among Williams's heirs in the bizarre decision to freeze his body in a cryogenic warehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona. <p>  Montville's biography makes a good case that Williams was, if not the greatest hitter ever to play the game, certainly among them. For his focused, scientific approach to hitting, Williams is unmatched in the history of the game. His life, marred perhaps by a temper and occasional immaturity that soured his reputation in Boston, is one of true sports greatness. Early in the book, Montville argues that Williams is less appreciated today than he might be because he played out most of his 19-year career in the era before televised highlights. But with Montville's efforts to capture first-hand accounts of Williams's achievements, The Splendid Splinter's legacy is assured. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I></span>

                    <span>I enjoyed Leigh Montville's account of the life of Ted Williams. He was a remarkable baseball talent. It is clear from the biography, that you wouldn't have wanted to be married to him, but he was a good friend and tried to do right by his children, belatedly, but at least he attended to them. He lived an active life and I think even the most casual fan of baseball would be interested in this book for Williams was quite the character. At 500 pages it seems a bit overdone but for the ardent Ted fans, no doubt, it wasn't nearly long enough. I have read a number of sport bios in the last few years, this compares to the Namath bio in  compelling life events. Both colorful and gifted-never dull-and that makes the read, that much more fun.</span>

                    <span>As a Yankees fan, I try create an unbiased atmosphere buy reading about other teams and people who are not involved with the Yankees. In doing this, I'm able to gain a much greater appreciation for baseball as a whole and the different eras of the game. In fact, I think I've read more about the Red Sox than the Yankees.
<br />That said, Montville's biography is a very well detailed, in-depth look at the tragic hero that is Ted Williams. As a Yankee fan, I certainly don't idolize old Teddy Ballgame. However, I can see how this book can both tarnish a wide-eyed Williams fan and further create the Spledid Splinter's legend. At times, Montville creates a perfect hero for baseball fans everywhere. A man who has all of the qualites and traits of an All-American athlete. And then there are times when the author lets you in on the low points of Williams life. By the end of the book, every reader will have a greater appreciation for Ted Williams the athlete an softee and will lose the rose-colored glasses that caused he or she to look at Williams in a very sympathetic and loving manner.
<br />Montville phenomenal and mind-boggling research will have you wondering if he had followed Williams around since conception, but it will also bore you at times. Part of the books charm is the fact that it covers every aspect of Williams' life, however, it will sometimes drive you insane. I found myself having to reread chapters on his military service because I wasn't able to give it my full attention the first time (eyes closing, snoring, etc.).
<br />Overall, a great effort by Montville and a quick read for 550 somewhat pages. A good book, but not the kind you will want to read over and over again. Then again, I'm a Yankees fan.</span>

                    <span>This is a decent bio on Ted Williams, but it really falls apart in the end.  The author seems intent on demonizing John Henry, William's son, and he spends too much of the book on Ted's sad final years and the bizarre situation after his death.  Had the book focussed more on his prime baseball years it would have been much better.</span>

                    <span>Ted Williams was a crude, vulgar, womanizing, reluctant father who would give you the shirt off his back if he saw you were cold. At the end he was exploited by his son and wound up a late night comedy joke in death.  This is not some cotton candy or tear down the icon report on his life, Leigh Montville presents Ted Williams in all aspects of his life on and off the field.  An engrossing read!</span>

                    <span>Ted Williams was the greatest hitters in baseball history.  But there is so much more to him than baseball.  Leigh Montville's biography is comendable on many levels, though far from perfect.  Four and a half stars would be more adequate rating than I gave the book.  Still the book is worth the price.
<br />
<br />The books starts out jumping all over the place, making the story hard to follow.  But once it begins the chronological story of his life, the book is well written.  Montville plainly writes of  the childhood neglect that influenced Williams life.  The absence of his parents is largely the reason he behaved so immaturely early in his career.  He was not used to living with rules, so the structure of professional baseball was an adjustment that caused a talented player to spend an extra year in the minors.  Ted's only focus was baseball during his youth and career.  He always picked people's brains, learning from anywhere  he could about hitting.  His dedication made people take notice.  It is also how he developed his philosophy of hitting.  Winning triple crowns and hitting .400 were among his great achievements.  He would have hit .400 more than once if batting average were figured as it is today with sacrifices and walks not hurting the average.  John Wayne was an actor, but Ted Williams lived the role.  He served his country during World War II and the Korean War.  Had Williams not sacrificed those years for his country, we would surpassed Ruth's home run record and no doubt other records as well.  Yet he is still recognized as the greatest hitter in baseball history.
<br />
<br />During his career the media gave the public the impression that Williams was a bad apple.  But during his late career and in retirement, the public saw otherwise.  Williams did have a foul mouth.  His works of charity tell where his heart was.  Knowing the good human being he was, it is unfortunate to read how his final years were spend.  The way his son manipulated him is beyond shameful.
<br />
<br />Despite the somber note most biographies end with, Montville had a different approach.  He ended the book with an epilogue that is a collection of humorous antidotes with Williams as the star.  It is wonderful that the book did not end on the same note as Ted's life.</span>
