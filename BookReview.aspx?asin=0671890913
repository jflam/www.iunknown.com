                <span id="Label1">A true classic of World War II history, <I>The Longest Day</I> tells the story of the massive Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Journalist Cornelius Ryan began working on the book in the mid-1950s, while the memories of the D-day participants were still fresh, and he spent three years interviewing D-day survivors in the United States and Europe. When his book was first published in 1959, it was tremendously successful, establishing many of the legends of D-day that endure in the public's mind. Ryan was enormously skillful at weaving small personal stories into the overall narrative, and he would later use the same technique to depict the airborne invasion of Holland in <I>A Bridge Too Far</I>. Not only is <I>The Longest Day</I> a pleasure to read, but subsequent historians, dutifully noting its accuracy, have relied heavily on Ryan's research for their own accounts. In short, the book is a "must read" for anyone interested in the D-day invasion. <I>--Robert McNamara</I></span>

                    <span>I'm usually very interested in books when the subject is the Second World War. Mostly what I read are books of fiction, dealing with certain aspects of this time period, such as Ken Follett's "Eye of the Needle", Robert Harris' "Enigma", etc. Actually, "The longest day" is the first non-fiction book on WWII I've read. So, what was I expecting? Detailed and technical descriptions of the battles, positions, and so on. What I got was much better.<P>Ryan's research was tremendous. He was able to interview not only veterans of the Allied forces, but many german officers as well. So, instead of a pure technical account of D-day, Ryan could get lots of personal histories of what happened to many of american, british, canadian and german soldiers during June 6, 1944. What's best, Ryan doesn't treat the germans as human monsters, nor the Allied as super-heros. Ryan's vision of the soldiers during the D-day was just what most of them were: men fighting for what they believed correct (of course, Hitler is depicted in a lightly different way). <P>The book is divided in three parts. The first one, "The wait", is about the preparations and struggles to get operation Overlord ready in time for launch in the right day. The second, "The night", is about the nocturnal part of the operation, the parachuters, submariners, etc. And the third part, "The day", is about the fight in the five Normandy beaches (Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold) that would mark the beginning of the ending of the war for Germany. <P>An important historical lesson, obrigatory for everyone who wants to understand what really happened in WWII, this is a short and direct book, easy to read and to understand. Great.<P>Grade 9.3/10</span>

                    <span>This is a fine, fine read that lives up to its reputation as the classic account of D-Day--and also as a truly riveting read. For a treatment of the strategy of which the Normandy landings were a part or for what came after (or, for that matter, before) June 6, 1944, you'll need to look elsewhere, for Ryan focuses on the sixth itself and discusses strategic elements virtually not at all (except for some tangential remarks on Germany's strategy for defending occupied France). But at the level of the soldier on the ground, in the thick of battle, this is great reading.<P>Ryan breaks his book down into three parts: "The Wait," "The Night," and "The Day." The first part details the day or two before the invasion, during which the tense Allies finally decided that the sixth and not the fifth would be D-Day and during which things worsened for an already unprepared German army (such as Rommel's departure from the front for a visit home). After something of an anti-climax on June 5, when the landings were pushed back a day, events accelerate rapidly. After midnight on June 6 ("The Night"), paratroopers land behind the beaches. The Germans were surprised, but the Allied effort was confused and scattered since many paratroopers missed their drop zones by as much as miles.<P>Dawn brings even greater surprise to the German leadership in France, most of whom believed the invasion would come at Calais, when they spy the massive invasion force with its thousands of vessels off the coast at Normandy. Americans land in the west at Utah and Omaha, while British and Canadian forces land at Sword, Juno, and Gold in the east. Classic episodes ensue at Utah, where resistance is light and troops under Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., move inland to meet up with airborne soldiers. Much bloodier combat took place on Omaha, where many Americans fell. Omar Bradley was on the verge of pulling back from Omaha and re-directing troops to Utah when men of the 1st and 29th Divisions finally gained a foothold and began to break down the Germans' fortified positions and pillboxes. Meanwhile, to the east, British troops are led into battle by bagpipes and achieve successes.<P>Portrayed mostly through the eyes of the troops, Ryan's account is gripping, engaging, exciting. For the most part, he follows the American-British-Canadian offensive, but he also gives attention to the German defenders (including a particularly interesting account of a company inside a pillbox). Ryan captures the confusion on both sides and conveys that things soon fell into place for the Allies while the Germans seemed to fall into greater and greater disarray. It would be a long fight--another eleven months--until Germany fell, but that struggle began on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944: the longest day.</span>

                    <span>Mr Ryan does a masterful job of telling the thrilling and personall story of the "day of days" June 6th 1944, the allied assault on Normandy by the British, Canadiens, and Americans. I read the book when I was in high school many years ago and it was just as enjoyable when I re-read it recently. The story of the greatest amphibious assault in the history of the world as seen through the eyes and memroies of so many men on both sides make it a book that can not be put down. As we celebrated the 60th aniversary of this world changing battle that was the beginning of the end of Nazi Europe this past June it was only fitting that we read this classic tale again. Oh yes, it is still better than the movie.</span>

                    <span>In the entire breadth and length of world history, few events stir the imagination and possess one's profound interest like World War II. It is probably because, had it not been a so tragic and so real of a war, it would have made for tremendous cinema. Never in this world's history has so much been at stake in an armed conflict; and never has there been a war with so many highs and lows, with mind-boggling twists and more drama and tension than 1000 movies. The early tragic days of war, like Germany's 'blitzkrieg' (lightning war) assault on France were tempered by the minor miracles such as the dramatic Allied escape at Dunkirk. The unstoppable force of Rommel's AfrikaCorps conquering of North Africa was soon offset by Britain's dramatic victory and El Alamein and General Patton's dogged quest to push Rommel right out of the African continent. These two examples barely scratch the surface of stories in just the European Theater of World War II (Japan's Pacific War is a whole different set of drama and heroics). <BR><BR>Noted historian, Cornelius Ryan, tackles one of the most ambitious, daring, and momentum-shifting operations of the entire war, the massive Allied invasion of France on June 6th, 1944: D-Day! It had been more than four years since the Germans viciously evicted the Allies from the European proper during the brutal conquering of France. It had also been more than two years since the United States had gotten involved in the war. Yet, despite the length of time and numerous operations (including the conquering of Fascist Italy), the Allies had yet to set foot back on Hitler's 'Fortress Europe'. Aside from a failed Canadian invasion attempt to Dieppe some time earlier, no attempt had been made to retake the land and open a second front against Nazi Germany. Finally after months, of planning, the Allies were prepared for begin that 'day of days' when the final step towards freeing the world from Hitler's tyranny would begin.<BR><BR>Ryan brings and ingenious gift of storytelling in recounting the tales of the men who planned and the men who fought in this decisive battle. Instead of attempting a dry, academic narrative, Ryan focuses on the personal battles of the men in the conflict. He ranges from expressing Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower's apprehension and distress over green lighting the mission after having already postponed it once to the fear of the paratrooper who was forced to play dead while he hung from his parachute canopy off a church steeple while German bullets peppered the air around him to the hope of a French family as they realized what was happening and that one day their teenage daughter would end up marrying one of the liberators. The account of how Hitler's advisors refused the believe that this was the true invasion and declined the wake their leader from his nap to get orders lest they feel the Fuhrer's wrath is also vividly depicted. "The Longest Day" is full of rich stories like these. <BR><BR>Ryan breaks his script down into three distinct sections: The Wait (dealing with the preparation and first postponement of the invasion), the Night (dealing with the pre-invasion paratrooper mission to secure bridgeheads and neutralize German resistance to the coming land attack), and the Day (which deals the actually assault). Unlike some historians, Ryan gives a fair and balanced of all the participants involved in D-Day. While British Glider Troops captured crucial bridges that nullified the German counter-offensive potential, Ryan also gives due to the American airborne assaults by the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions. While most of history recalls the bloody price paid by the American soldiers on the sands of 'Bloody Omaha' Beach, Ryan does well focus recognition the dramatic obstacles and astounding accomplishments of the British forces at Gold and Sword Beaches and the Canadian contributions at Juno Beach. <BR><BR>D-Day was the most dramatic military operation in terms of manpower, complexity, and risk ever attempted up to that point. While the war would still drag on for almost a year following the success of this invasion, it was clear to many, including the illustrious Rommel, himself, that Germany's last best chance to end the war on favorable terms was over, and it was just a matter of time before the Third Reich was brutally wiped from the earth. Thanks to Cornelius Ryan, all history buff and casual history readers have, in "The Longest Day", an historical document allows us to never to forget how these men, to quote Lincoln, "laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom".</span>

                    <span>Often the term "classic" is thrown around in the literary field without much regard to the real breadth of genre and writings, and is thus cheapened in use. When one describes Cornelius Ryan's "The Longest Day" as a classic piece in the WWII genre believe it. Such a term is NOT hype when used in the same sentence with this book. So many things about the "The Longest Day" make it truly a classic: First, Cornelius Ryan is a Master storyteller. Certainly it helps that Ryan was a war correspondent who experienced life in the combat zones of the ETO! Ryan's writing style is lilting and fun, his writings are easy reads yet full of historical depth. Sure his books are "popular" reading not simply deep academic works, but they ARE important contributions to the historical literature. Second, the story is simply one so compelling that even the best novelist would have a hard time toping. By combining writing talent with a great human story, "The Longest Day" represents literature at its best - in any genre. Third, historical content - the story told in "The Longest Day" - as just mentioned - is so compelling that it need not be, and was not, embellished to make it readable. Ryan has done the hard work of culling documents and interviewing numerous sources to gain factual clarity. Again, it is clear that his time spent as a correspondent helped his fact gathering abilities and thus contributed greatly to the success of this book. <P>If you want a story of D-Day that covers THE DAY (and a few proceeding and following in much less detail) from both sides of the fence, Allied and Axis; from the air, sea and land; from perspective of Coastguard Coxswain to rifleman on any one of the beachheads to a German artillery officer caught in the midst of the greatest show of democracy to Generals running the show, this is the book to start with. Great depth and broad breadth! As the 60th Anniversary of D-Day approaches why not pick up a "classic" to get a feel for what the Greatest Generation gave to the world on June 6, 1944. Five stars, two big thumbs up.</span>
