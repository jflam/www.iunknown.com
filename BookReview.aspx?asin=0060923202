                    <span>This is an excellent anthology of sacred prose. Stephen Mitchell was very ecumenical and egalitarian in his selection process. Such a lack of bias is clear evidence of his own enlightened understanding where the universality of truth is concerned. No one, no cult, no philosophy, no religion, has a patent on the ultimate source of being, on God. All anyone can do is say what God is like, not what God is. No one knows God's name. "I AM THAT I AM", the self-existent one. Exodus 3:14. The bits and pieces of the whole that is contained herein is a tasty feast for the hungry heart. A veritable smorgasbord of heavenly and earthly delights. A little Heraclitus, Plato, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Rumi, Eckhart, Dame Julian, Blake, Seattle, Emerson, Einstein, and so many others. A portion of the Upanishads, the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Hermetic Writings, the Diamond Sutra, and what we have hear is truth, truth, and some more truth. If you can't handle truth don't read this collection of writings, it may just enlighten your mind. Personally, I can't get enough wisdom. 
<br />
<br />Sampler: 
<br />
<br />Ramana Maharshi:
<br />
<br />"If the mind is happy, not only the body but the whole world will be happy. So one must find out how to become happy oneself. Wanting to reform the world without discovering one's true self is like trying to cover the whole world with leather to avoid the pain of walking on stones and thorns. It is much simpler to wear shoes".
<br />
<br />Dogen:
<br />
<br />"Gaining enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon doesn't get wet; the water isn't broken... The whole moon and the sky are reflected in one dewdrop on the grass".
<br />
<br />Einstein:
<br />
<br />"A human being is a part of the whole that we call the universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a prison to us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for only the few people nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living beings and all of nature".
<br />
<br />Rumi:
<br />
<br />"The Love-Religion has no code or doctrine. Only God".</span>

                    <span>I found this book on accident several years into my journey, and found it to be a most intriguing work. If you already claim to know the truth, the whole truth, and everyone else falls short, this book will no doubt offend your sensibilities. However if every day is a learning experience for you, and you listen to the " still, small voice within", you will no doubt recognize the transparent thread which connects all the passages in Gods love. No matter how many times I read and reread it, as my perspective grows, so do I find new teachings to inspire and motivate me.</span>

                    <span>I read this book about ten years ago, when I was searching for truth.  This book did little to help that - I can remember nothing of value from this book.
<br />
<br />If you are searching for truth, read the Bible.  It is truth, and nothing will come close to it.
<br />
<br />Also, for an easier read than other translations, check out the NIV version.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Calvin</span>
