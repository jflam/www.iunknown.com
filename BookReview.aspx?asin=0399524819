                    <span>This is really a very book that overcomes an all too common presentation flaw:<P>Why is it good: The Mental Edge provides the clearest and most comprehensive program for developing metal training routines that can/will improve performance. And if you are good at some endeavor - you have already learned the base skills needed -- from there on it is mental. Again, of all the books (too many) on trying to understand and develop procedures .. this is the best<P>The all too common flaw: The constant digressions regarding annecdotes and exhortations of "you can if you only believe." The content is great but in many cases the presentation would embarrass Shirly McLain.<P>Nonetheless, I would encourage anyone with a sports objective to read (grit their way through). The specific recomendations are again the best compilation and application of mental training I know of</span>

                    <span>I am a magazine journalist and athlete, and write primarily about health and fitness--to the tune of about 40 articles a year. When I found this book I immediately decided to pitch a feature story on these techniques because they are DIFFERENT. There is so much out there on mental training that basically says, "Strive for excellence." Yawn! HOW? This book shows how. It covers a couple of basic concepts, visualization and positive self-talk, but delves into other techniques even I had not heard of. And I've interviewed many other trainers, coaches, etc. like Ken Baum. I think that's why such a top athlete like Karch Kiraly subscribed to these methods. The author's ideas called "Success History Search" and "Performance Cues" have been extremely helpful to me in the gym. When you write about fitness and work out all the time, it can get boring--but these ideas helped me break a plateau and move to an even better level of fitness.</span>

                    <span>I play tennis and I've read the other books mentioned along with this book and the old stand by, "Inner Game of Tennis". <P>This book blows the others AWAY!<P>It is simple to read and easy to follow. I couldn't put this one down the first time through it! I am now going back through it and highlighting all my favorite exercises and examples.<P>The other books are dry and hard to follow. Why go dry if you can have USER FRIENDLY?!?!?<P>This book is better than any book I've read on the mental side of sports INCLUDING those that are sport specific!<P>Buy it and you'll be glad you did.<P>P.S. Write in for the stuff in the back of the book too!</span>

                    <span>Probably the best of the mental training books I've read, but I don't really think the "program" is the most clear written out there. It just doesn't seem a whole program is necessary for this stuff to work likes it's supposed to.</span>

                    <span>The Mental Edge is a great book. I couldn't put it down, even though I am very busy. Aren't we all! I bought the book because I thought it would help my 16-year-old son who plays football and rugby. However, after reading just the first chapter, it became clear that the book is not only relevant to all athletes, it is also relevant to anyone who wants to do better in achieving any goal. Great book! Thank you, Mr. Baum</span>
