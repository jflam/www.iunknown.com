                    <span>Readers interested in historically authentic renovations or new construction of colonial, federal or classical revival style houses will not find much of interest in this book. The houses and furnishings pictured for the most part present eclectic blends of contemporary and historic styles. I would describe many of the "colonials" pictured in the book as postmodern eclectic. A number bear no recognizable relation to the colonial style. <BR> The text is typical of what you would see in popular shelter magazines like Southern Living or House Beautiful: pleasant, generally informative and upbeat but not very detailed, and of little interest to more advanced readers.<BR> One should examine this book in a store rather than buying it online, because the content suggested in the title is not what the book contains.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I are in the process of turning our little ranch into a classic center hall Colonial. This book has been such an inspiration, in both text and pictures. The details are superb and the author shows so many variations that we can pick and choose what features we like (and can afford!) while knowing we are still sticking to the traditional style. I would reccommend this book to anyone interested in have a modern "historical" home.</span>

                    <span>A wonderful reference book for anyone contemplating a remodel or a new house with colonial styling. The photos are first class, and the text is conversational while providing real information grounded in history. A book to pick up again and again for inspiration. Classy!</span>

                    <span>Most home design books use lots of visuals and minimize on the text. "Colonials" has so much more. It's actually a pity that the title directs one to a particular era or style, because this book is a comprehensive compendium of design, renovation and construction ideas that apply to a much broader design style than simply Colonial. <P>This is a design book where the text is important. There are highlighted features where the author gives informational snippets about everything from variations in roof design to conservation and wetlands, and even hints on lighting; all useful whether you're building, renovating or remodeling. Far more than a coffee table book, this book will get dirty from hands-on use!<BR> <BR>As a collector of design and remodeling publications, this one gets my highest recommendation.</span>
