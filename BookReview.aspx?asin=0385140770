                    <span>I hunted for a book exactly like this after reading two titles (Deep Atlantic, Monsters of the Sea) by Richard Ellis. I was looking for something that would, like Ellis, recall me to my sense of wonder. This book can do that to some extent, but it's got a major flaw: a great deal of the information in it is simply out of date. It's especially flawed for marine biology; the supposed senseless ferocity of certain creatures reads like a 1960s children's book you found in the library. I'd recommend this to a person who wants a collection of classic sea yarns and who isn't especially sophisticated as a science reader.</span>

                    <span>This is a compendium of short stories, articles and tid-bits with the ocean as their common theme. Anybody who is interested in the sea in either fact or fiction will love this book. I only wish that they would publish it in a hardback edition as it is a book which has become a personal touchstone, not just to me but to anyone else I ever gave it to.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the most read book in my personnal library. If you love the ocean you will find this book very informative, containing information on just about everything from weather, to pirates, to who was the first to discover the "new world" (yes this is a disputed topic, think about it why do we live in "America" not "Columbia" and what about those wily Vikings what role did they play?). I often refer to it when I hear something referenced on "Discovery Channel" or "History Channel". Although some sections are little out dated today, it was only published 18 years ago! Most of the information is still relevant today. Not only is it full of information it is well written and easy to read. Picking this book up is not like grabbing an encyclopedia and finding a new subject, it was actually written to be read for pleasure not just information. Like i have already said if you love the ocean you should purchase this book imediately. (my apologies for any spelling errors above, but orthography is not my strong suit)</span>

                    <span>I bought this book on my second trip while commercial fishing on board the crabber/tender "Katrina Em" in Kodiak Island Alaska. The year was 1995, I have carried this book with me wherever I go and have never been bored with it. I have re-read some of the stories over and over again over the years and they have never ceased to run my imagination full of adventure and admiration for some of it's characters. Sometimes I wished to have contribuited to this collection of adventures with one of my own, but I yet have to match any of them.</span>
