                <span id="Label1">This unique book brings together information for creating a beautiful, soulful, and spirited home. Nicole Marcelis offers advice on such popular spiritual techniques as feng shui, color therapy, aromatherepy, space clearing, and symbolism. Her guidelines provide practical ways to combine these elements in order to create a home environment infused with intent. These combinations--or "templates"--reflect what readers most desire in their lives, whether it be romance, prosperity, intuition, or balance.</span>

                    <span>Chapter Two of this book made the purchase worth every penny. Titled Getting Clear About Home the author hits the nail on the head when she notes that the cleaner and more energetically clear our homes are the easier it will be to craft or create an environment that truly supports us. That its like beginning with a clean slate. She notes "Home involves purging your environment of all things that are physically emotionally and practically meaningless or obsolete and then physically cleaning and energetically clearing your home, which is referred to as space cleaning."<P>She then goes onto say in Decluttering that "Vital to getting clear about Home and creating sanctuary is one simple truth: to become clear you must completely declutter your environment. In America especially, where vigorous consumerism is typical, people own a lot of stuff. It is not uncommon for people to rent storage units for their excess things, or live in large houses to accommodate it all. This kind of accumulation is not only a financial drain, but also a drain on energy and spirit".<P>I loved the entire book because she doesn't leave a stone unturned. On page 16 she addresses in thoughtful detail the whole issue of clearing out gifts that are often given to us by others, out of pure obligation, and that we have an obligation to ourselves to speak up and request either no gifts at all or at least be honest enough somewhere along the path of life to let it be know what things we like and actually use, be it cream coloured candles or gift certificates or simply a home cooked meal.<P>Chapter Four was and is helpful to us since we are in the process of designing what we call a Danish Zen home that will be small compared to most American homes (under 1200 sq. ft) with efficient use of space. Thus her beginning chapters of cleaning and decluttering lends itself well to this chapter which is all about energetic design. She does a good job of discussing Feng Shui and the subject of colour.<P>Chapter Fourteen titled Intention is good since the author reminds the reader that throughout the book she refers to the power of our own intention in creating our lives and that the adages of we are what we eat, think, read, do is what it is all about. This may seem over simplistic but the author is 100% correct when she reminds us that what we are is what we become in all areas of our lives. <P>Needless to say the book is so full of realistic and useful information that will make your home and life more complete and whole and happy that I could spend an hour sharing everything she said that has changed my life for the better (and it was good to begin with) but I suggest you invest in a copy for yourself and discover that the book will be one that you pick off the shelf and read and re-read often.</span>

                    <span>Even though I found Nicole's book under the Feng Shui titles here, on amazon.com, I wouldn't say it had much to do with FS. It's nevertheless great! <BR>She states at one part that everything within the book is supposed to deliver a message of Love, and this is exactly what you get. Grab a cup of delicious tea, put on some nice music, burn some insense, and sit in your favorite armchair or couch - and start reading. You'll find a lot of thought-provoking ideas and reassuring advice and even if you're not going to start rearranging your entire Home, you'll definitely find some peace of mind. Undoubtedly worth reading in these fast, stressful days of ours. <P>Thanks, Nicole!</span>

                    <span>...for all the gifts of this book I now want to give. I read this through in one sitting this evening and honestly feel as though the information it so gently yet passionately shares can change my home and my life, as incredible as that sounds. If the home is the last refuge in our frenetic world, this is the book to show you how to make that home a harmonious, loving, and sacred sanctuary.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book! It is so easy to use and warmly inspired it makes you want to know the author. If you're pressed for time, you can go right to the section that tells how to create the ambiance you want, but you'd miss some of the warmth and loving spirit this author brings to her work. First time through it is well worth reading from front to back. Later, when you just want to create a certain effect in your home, you can go right to that section and dig in. This is an incredibly useful and well-organized book, and the information is simple, accessible, and beautifully written.</span>
