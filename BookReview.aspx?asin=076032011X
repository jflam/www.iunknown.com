                    <span>I have been a biker and raised by bikers since I was knee high to a coke bottle, I can say that out of the whole crowd of puffed up halfwit wannabe bandwagon ridin talentless hacks, billy, and inidian larry were some of the only real people. People you can party with, people that respect our code. I like billy as a person and his book is damn good to. If you want to know about joe everyman biker who made it big this is the book for you. Two big thumbs up.

                    <span>Cool book to flip through for great photos of bikes, Billy, his wild times, his shop, etc...but also a great story.  He talks about his childhood, his business, his love of riding and building, his respect for other builders and their influence, etc.  Interesting life and an interesting book.  Stylin' design too.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book mostly for the great photography, never expecting such an interesting story. I thought it would be another celebrity talking about how great he is. Instead I find one of the most candid, honest self reflections I've ever read. Billy lays it all right out there for the entire world to see. He doesn't hold anything back, the good, the bad, or the ugly. Reading this book, I felt like I really understood what a television celebrity goes through. Great job, Billy!</span>
