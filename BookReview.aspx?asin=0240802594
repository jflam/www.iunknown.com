                    <span>The Variable Contrast Printing Manual is a wonderful reference book for those photographers that want to control the photographic process from exposure to printing. It explains the main features of variable contrast print materials and describes the best processes to get great results from the material. I especially like the chapter on split printing. Mr. Anchell has taken a rather complex subject and made it very comprehensible. Definitively a must have for every darkroom enthusiast.</span>

                    <span>I could have written this book, but I am glad Anchell did it and did it so well. There is an introduction for beginners here that is just enough to set them off on the big adventure. There is some well presented thought on advanced techniques that will keep the advanced cases focused on the essentials and help expand their skill.<P>The author touches on how and why various approaches to Variable Contrast work and why you need to know. He compares the most readily available materials and suggests where they should be used.<P>He gives some direct and pragmatic recommendations about development and fixing. He also presents some practical examples of how to use multiple filter techniques where appropriate. He discusses pre-exposure and some other tried and true techniques that help manage contrast.<P>This book is a very good top-down, goal oriented approach. It is easy to read and remember because it never gets wound up in technique for its own sake.<P>If you are already competent this book will keep you moving in the right direction. If you are not yet competent you will have no excuses after you read this book.<P>This author needs a better publisher. I'd like to have an edition with test negatives and a coupon for a discount on the next edition. A better publisher could make this book a classic, must have.</span>

                    <span>This book is useful if you are trying to dig deeper in your understanding of how Multi contrast papers work, however given the explosion of digital and inkjet printers in recent years, I wonder how much longer this excellent book will remain relevant?</span>

                    <span>I bought and read every page of all three of Steve Anchell's black and white photo information books: The Variable Contrast Printing Manual, The Film Developing Cookbook, and The Darkroom Cookbook. Why? Because he gives a mix of an historical view plus tells what to pick of the best current chemistries. He does this without bogging down in the actual complexities of a college chemistry course keeping it at a usable technicians level. Since he also tells you why you are using various chemicals or paper his books do not dumb down but instead give you fascinating useful information. Anyone serious about darkroom work will appreciate his insights and commentary about chemistry use. He lists so many historical and current B&W chemical formulas and their use that any B&W experimenter will find the books useful.</span>
