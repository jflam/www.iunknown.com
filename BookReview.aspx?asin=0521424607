                    <span>Richard White should be awfully proud of himself. Using a close examination of a particular time in a particular place, he manages to open one's eyes to an entirely new way of thinking about the long term dynamics of human interaction that we call "history". Works like these are the fruit of all the painstaking hard work that American historians have been contributing over the last one or two generations. The studies of gender, environment, disease and race might seem like annoying "political correctness" to the close-minded, but when divorced from ideological polemics (pro or con) they have proven to be goldmines of fresh perspective. This book is an elegant example of what can be achieved when the primary evidence is reassessed in the light of this new spirit of inquiry.
<br />
<br />Amply supported by a wide selection of primary sources, White plunges into a detailed dissection of the course of history in what the French called the "Pays d'en haut"--the roughly triangular territory bounded by the Mississippi, the Ohio and the Great Lakes--from the establishment of French hegemony to the defeat of Tecumseh at the hands of the United States. Characters, landscape and events are vividly drawn, but underlying it all is White's astonishing theoretical angle: that the various participants--traders, chiefs, colonial officials, missionaries, prophets, warriors and women--were forced to continually construct the rules of a common game that their respective cultures and traditions were inadequate to navigate by themselves. Of course, neither Europeans or natives discarded their cultural baggage wholesale--rather, they raided each other's ideologies and practices for tools they could use for their own purposes, refashioning them into novel combinations and thus a new "culture". Under White's sharp lens, activities and categories which might seem unambiguous--"murder", "trade", "prostitute", "father", "metal tool"--are shown to actually be embedded in a kaleidoscopically shifting galaxy of symbols, mutually forged, mutually apprehended (and misapprehended) by the resourceful women and men of the "middle ground". White carefully traces the strategies of exploitation and survival mediated by French, Algonquin, British and Iroquois participation in this new world--scenes of sickening brutality, unexpected mercy and clever dealing merge with those of day-to-day business and coexistence in a vast mural that rings as true as any history I've yet encountered. I am eager to see how this brand of method and insight will be employed in other histories.

                    <span>Anyone who has attended an academic history conference in the last five or so years already realizes the impact that this densely-written, but provocatively argued book by an historian of the American west has had on  the study of American history.  For both good and ill, White's central  thesis -- that Indians and Europeans in the Great Lakes region created  together and sustained an elaborate system of cultural and political  contact that endured for centuries based not on mutual understandings, but  mutual MISunderstandings, often deliberate ones -- has come to set the tone  for the most recent studies of cultural encounter and creolization in the  New World.  Indeed, White's "middle ground" bids fair to assume  the blanket hegemony exercised over the American historical imagination a  decade or more back by the idea of "republicanism."  And, not  without cause: White's book is in many respects a stupendous achievement --  exhaustively researched, laser-subtle analyses, and ambitious in scope.  What weakens the book is White's tendency to often assert the existence of  a so-called cultural "middle ground" between Indians and others  in advance of the evidence he presents.  The "middle ground" is  too often presented as a given, one that can act as the explanation, rather  than as the hypothetical that it actually is, the actual subject that  should be under investigation.  This said, the influence of this book will  be felt for years to come.</span>
