                <span id="Label1">The films from IMAX have come to be known for their cutting-edge cinematography. They don't disappoint with <I>The Living Sea</I>, an Academy Award-nominated documentary exploring exotic marine locales. Using dizzying aerial and time-lapse footage, they provide underwater imagery usually accessible only while wearing fins and a mask. From heavy-surf Coast Guard drills off the coast of Oregon to jellyfish in Palau to North Atlantic humpback whales, veteran IMAX cameraman and director Greg MacGillivray takes viewers on a vivid journey into some of the world's most breathtaking environments and shows us some of the rarest and strangest marine life. Ten years from conception to finished product, this documentary's intended message is the importance of protecting the "world ocean" by displaying its wild beauty and diversity. <p>  <I>The Living Sea</I> does an excellent job showcasing the more visually satisfying aspects of the sea (standout footage includes schools of jellyfish performing a graceful migratory dance and a giant cuttlefish changing brilliant colors for the purpose of camouflage), although ultimately it fails to shed much light on the hows, whys, and urgency of marine conservation. However, despite the short running time (unfortunately characteristic of IMAX productions) and a soundtrack that only true Sting fans will fully appreciate, this film proves to be a remarkable treat for the eyes and is sure to elicit heartfelt <i>ooh</i>s and <i>aah</i>s from anyone who loves the sea. <I>--Ed Noble</I></span>

                    <span>One of the best IMAX videos available. Great visuals. Great sound (thank you Sting).<P>If you're fortunate enough, watch this on widescreen TV & crank up the surround sound system & enjoy. And thank you DVD producers for making this with DTS.<P>Most enjoyable moments (no order):<P>* Everything on Palau<P>* Migrating jelly fish (also in Palau)<P>* Watching a cuttlefish change color to camouflage itself while moving<P>* Coast guard boat going through horrendous ocean waves.<P>Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This is an educational film which also has hypnotically beautiful visuals and a lovely score put together by composer Steve Wood that includes a lot of music and vocals by Sting, as well as having Meryl Streep give us a stream of information in her well-spoken narration.<BR>It documents the sea and its creatures, and also how people connect with it, either for pleasure, commerce, or survival. We get to see the Coast Guard boat traveling through 15 foot waves, some outstanding surfing footage, and how the inhabitants of the West Pacific island of Palau interact and respect the water that surrounds them.<P>One one level one can use this film to learn some facts about the ocean, and on another, one can sit back and enjoy the wonderful cinematography. Fascinating parts include the jellyfish in Palau, the Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute showing us a Siphonophore, which is about half the size of a football field, and visible through their underwater probe, and of course, the whales !<P>The film is 40 minutes long, and the video contains a 27 minute "Making of" documentary, which has interviews with Producer/Director Greg MacGillivray, among others, like photographer Howard Hall describing the difficulty of filming in water.<BR>I found this documentary particularly interesting, and think it deserves 5 stars, because it gave me knowledge I did not have before, and the filmmakers made some painstaking efforts to bring it to us, like the timelapse photography of the tides. It was nominated for a 1995 Best Documentary Short Subject Academy Award, and seeing it is definitely time well spent.</span>

                    <span>I originally saw this IMAX movie in Hawaii, at the Polynesian Cultural Center 3 years ago...and bought the soundtrack, always hoping to get the DVD. Much to my amazement, the movie was included for my PC as one of the features for Windows XP. Anyway, the music, narration, and footage is breathtaking, I left the IMAX theatre feeling physically off-balance because of the motion of the seas and the ocean, and so moved by the magic of it all that I was teary-eyed the rest of the day. I ended up at Sunset Beach on Oahu's NOrth Shore that evening watching the sunset and had the beach to myself. It is one of those days that you will never forget in your lifetime, it is still so vivid, and watching this DVD brings every cell in me back to The Living Sea and the beaches of Hawaii. Absolutely moving and breathtaking...even when watching on the small screen vs. the IMAX screen. You will not be disappointed!</span>

                    <span>The Living Sea is supposed to be one of the most important films on the vast blue realm, but it was a disappointment when I viewed it. It does not have very much sea footage. In fact, a single episode of Secrets of the Ocean Realm contains more underwater footage than this! If they wanted to stick a scene on the Coast Guard, surfers, or lore like that in the movie, the film should be called "View of the Coast Men", or "The Amazing Silver Surfers" instead of "The Living Sea." <BR> The title very much deceives a lover of the ocean. You expect it to document some battles between a Fringehead fish, or Hammerhead sharks, or anything, but basically all that is astounding about the sea in this movie is the swarm of jellyfish, which adds in another star out of two. Still not quite worth it. If you want a cool epic video truly on the ocean buy "The Blue Planet" series or "Secrets of the Ocean Realm" volumes. You have the right to disagree, but be assured that you WILL see better films.</span>
