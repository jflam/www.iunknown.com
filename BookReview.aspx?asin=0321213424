                    <span>I got this book because it was I think one of the first ones out there. Sometimes that worries me about computer books because you know they were written on testing software that isn't complete, which can mean the book has a lot of problems. That didn't seem to be the case here though, apart from some minor issues like typos and stuff. <P>This book had a lot more in it than I expected. I have seen other tutorial books that only cover Flash and really basic ActionScript. But this book had a LOT in it for a beginner book, and a ton of ActionScript! And by the end it all made sense to me, which I was surprised about. If you are considering getting this book, I really recommend it. You will be taught in an excellent way, easy to follow and understand plus there is supporting material.</span>

                    <span>This book seems like a great fit into my learning curve. I really like how easy it is to follow along with and tells me exactly what to do. I'm using regular Flash MX, so I'm happy that I can use the book without upgrading like the other couple books I bought. I hate not being able to follow along and get all confused just to find out I have the wrong Flash or something. I'm only about 3/4 way through the book, but I am very happy with how things are working out. You start out by learning the easy things like graphics, simple animation and so forth and progress through to easy ActionScript, do some things with it and now I'm going through the harder ActionScript. That is intuitive to me, which compels me to write the review. This book is perfect for me starting out with Flash for the first time because I was just plain confused trying to find online tutorials that never spelled it out clearly, and the other books I have that are pretty confusing to try and find what you need. Good work! I finally feel like I'm learning something.</span>

                    <span>As I expected from most "training from the source" books, it covers most of the basic ingredients in flash; hence, it is comprehensive for beginners and intermediate users. However, as mentioned in some other reviews, the instructions are not consistent. The numbered sentences in bold often give the reader an overview of what one is about to do, even if they sound like they are giving the reader the actual instructions (correcting this redundancy may shorten the book, and lower the price!). The succeeding sentences then give step-by-step instructions on what to actually do. In some instances, however, the sentences in bold were the instructions themselves. Consistency would have made everything clearer. Moreover, some explanations and instructions were a little vague--which file, layer, or frame was I supposed to be working on? At other times, library or stage items were missing after being asked to open a particular file. It was quite confusing. I honestly think the book needs a 2nd edition.</span>

                    <span>The book made for easy reading, and I was able to knock it out in just a few days. The biggest problem I had was the inconsistent way of how the step by step instructions work. At the beginning of each step, they have a "summary" of what you are going to do in bold, then it proceeds to give detailed instructions on how to do it. For the most part, this holds true, but sometimes, the instructions picked up from the bold part, having expected you to have performed that already??? Also found several invalid references to variables.. and other mistakes, such as telling you to add labels to specific frames, before telling you to add keyframes at those positions. It had the feel of a step by step book, that nobody bothered taking the time to test before publishing. Other than that, it was an okay book, and had a realistic in depth example to work with and build upon.</span>

This book has great supplement(CD) and examples but it was really hard for me to understand things. I hope author revise this book carefully and make it more understandable on next edition. I don't want to recommend this book to any beginners.</span>
