                    <span>This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you would like a good MSMQ reference buy Designing Applications with MSMQ by Alan Dickman. It is not perfect but is the most comprehensive text on MSMQ that I have read so far.</span>

                    <span>I started MSMQ a month ago and found this book quite useful for novice like me. It starts with concepts and them implement it in the following chapters.<P>Sometimes find it a bit hard to follow as the steps are not given in full.<P>Does not include info to set up the MSMQ environment properly as this is also very much helpful for beginner.<P>Conclusion : 3 stars book. Could be further improved.</span>

                    <span>The first chapter serves as a precursor to the remaining book. It details the features, functionalities, and benefits of message queueing. The book gives the reader a solid foundation on message queuing in which to build upon. It is easy to read, with examples throughout. It successfully conveys the power of message queuing in an enterprise environment, where it's role is paramount. Now, we are ready for the second book to take us farther into distributed applications as a business solution for complex integration issues. We can expect the sequel when? :)</span>

                    <span>Overall I thought this book explained key topics of MSMQ very well. The book starts with a simple example, then devotes about 7 chapters to slowly building a fully functional MSMQ application explaining every step along the way. The problem? One word - typos! The book is VERY hard to follow in some places. When entering code examples, the book does not tell you what module you're entering the code into. It has the tendency to start a module, start a new module, then go back to it later. At one point, I couldn't figure out where the code was supposed to go, so after downloading the code from their website, I figured out they had started a completely seperate application and not told us! Also there's some generally bad programming practice and typos, stuff that should've been caught by the editors.<P>It's really a shame because I think the book has a lot of promise for future printings, but it's in SERIOUS SERIOUS need of editing. Wait for the next edition.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is reasonably good for a complete novice but: 1. All the examples are in VB, no C++. 2. Very introductory. Much more info can be found on MSDN. 3. It focuses more on workflow design than MSMQ per se.</span>
