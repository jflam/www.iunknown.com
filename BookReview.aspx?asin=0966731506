                <span id="Label1">Put the most irresistible French food on your table every day--including those mouthwatering rich sauces--and still lose weight! Bring home the flavors of France, from simple bistro fare to that of elegant gourmet restaurants--you'll be amazed how quick and easy these exciting dishes are to prepare. Broccoli quiche, eggs in aspic, coq au vin, filet mignon in barnaise sauce, sea bass in mustard sauce, lobster americaine, crepes Suzette...the list goes on and on....  <P>You'll learn why French cooking is the basis of all great Western cuisine today, why fat-free doesn't work, why people binge, how and what to order when you go out. You'll learn how to prepare meals from the quick and easy to a romantic diner for two to a Sunday Feast!  <P>You'll have over a hundred recipes to choose from--all authentic--some written especially for the book by nine Michelin starred chefs from France.  This is not a quick-weight loss fad diet, this is a way of life.  Don't just read about "the French paradox," become a part of the excitement. It has worked for me, and I know it will work for you!</span>

                    <span>Some people who read cookbooks on how to eat imagine that all you have to do is read the book and the fat will fall off. Not so! Others are looking for the pill or system that will turn them magically into the what they wish the mirror would reflect. This is not possible either. However, what is possbile is to learn what others have known that works for them, the French. This is a lifestyle that, not is neither a crash diet nor a magic pill. Neither is this a system an excessively low calorie or low fat diet such that one cannot stay on it for life. <P>The author has defined how to achieve what the French have been doing forever--eating well, looking well and feeling well. This book is not filled with a lot of complicated straegies, but rather reads more like a fun and often times funny, travelogue through France and many of its great restaurants. I thought the photographs that accompanied the information and the recipes added a lot, I only wish they had been in color. In addition, the author's love of food and cooking comes through and is well balanced with his medical backround.<P>The book has really changed my life--I now enjoy eating and over a period of four months have lost the 30 pounds that have been hanging around my middle for too long. I have even made plans to visit France as a result! My friends have noted that my cooking style improved and asked for the secret--several received copies of the book for Christmas.</span>

                    <span>"Secrets of the French Diet" allows me to lose weight and entertain in a style that disguises my need to be calorie conscious. My friends have have marveled at my dishes and have expressed concern about all the weight they may be gaining as a result of eating my food. <P>The recipes and directions are easy to follow and most items are at hand in a well-stocked pantry. The recipes allow for experimentation with dinner parties and simple and quick home meals. <P>The travel area of this book allows memories of past travel and future places to visit with no airfare nor culinary surprises.<P>My suggestion would be more pictures of finished dishes to allow for presentation ideas and platters or serving dishes. With pictures of the finished product you know even you can cook as the French do.</span>

                    <span>One of the gifts I received for a recent birthday was Secrets of the French Diet, by Robert Ziff. In this day of low carb and other silly diet books, it is a pleasure to read one with good recipes that are not terribly difficult to prepare. As opposed to what some other reviewers have noted, I like to have an idea of the calories in a recipe so I can "tweek" it accordingly. Certainly the pictures in the book are rather mundane--perhaps a future one will have pictures in color that are more tantalizing.<P>I've tried some of the recipes on my weight-conscious family and friends and pleasantly surprised them with the taste and aesthetics of the food. I think this book is great and would recommend it to anyone who likes to cook and either lose weight or just eat healthy and tasty food!</span>

                    <span>I have been reading other books on the french way of life and eating, such as Will Clower's "Fat Fallacy" and Anne Barone's "Chic and Slim." This book goes a lot against what I have been reading in other books. Such as the calorie counting Ziff suggests. <P>Also, he promotes the use of artificial sweetener and I even saw where he suggested a low-fat or low-cal salad dressing if you do not like traditional oil-and-vinegar vinegrette. Most low-fat or low-cal dressings you find on the supermarket shelves are loaded with chemicals, sweeteners, or added perservatives that are not good for you. You should make your own dressing at home, which would be a healthier alternative to supermarket dressings. <P>The pictures were all black and white, mostly of him or a lady eating at various restaurants. The sparse pictures of actual food dishes were lackluster and not appetizing at all!<P>In general, this book is very contradictory to others I have previously read and confusing! I submitted a return request today for my copy and will be receiving a refund. Don't waste your time with this one!</span>

                    <span>What a disappointment this book turned out to be. I've been reading many books on the subject of "how" the French eat, not just "what" they eat. The French don't bother with counting calories, yet this book is heavy on the calorie counting. Many of the charts in this book look like something from the 70's or 80's. I doubled-checked the copyright date, as I thought this book surely must have been written in the 80's. Nope, 1999 is the date. The pictures of prepared recipes are in black and white and do NOT look appetizing. My book is being sent back.</span>
