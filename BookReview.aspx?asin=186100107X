Using a video rental store as its central case study, this tutorial takes you through the design philosophy and actual implementation of a real-world application using Visual Basic 6. Along the way, author Rockford Lhotka discusses other Microsoft tools, such as Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), and Internet options using Active Server Pages (ASP) and Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Authoritative, yet not overwhelming, this is a great single-volume introduction to serious enterprise development using the latest in Microsoft tools wired together with Visual Basic. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>When I first read this book I loved it. Nothing of the kind had shown VB developers how to write large distributed apps before. Now that VB .NET is out, however, this book has become a lot less useful and given the direction of the outside world, I think it may be time to move on. I hadn't found any other books to fill the gap for the longest time. I tried "Building Distributed Applications with Visual Basic .NET" from Sams, which was terrible. However, I recently stumbled across a couple of truly great books. First of all is MS Press "Microsoft .NET Distributed Applications" which is fantastic!! The architecture advice and case studies are on a par with this book in the .NET world, and I can't recommend it enough. Another solid (but more technology-specific) book is Advanced .NET Remoting on APress. After reading these, I'm never going back to VB!</span>

                    <span>First of all, this book is a great buy for a VB beginner and it offers few great tricks to handle business objects in VB. For myself, I've learned much from this book (even I've read many VB books). However, things I noticed while reading, this book has bad layout and presentation of code examples. Also, Author seems to have a grasp from the subject, but he falls down with repetitive writing which results to 'fat book'. Applying the summary of 'Code so far' instead of partial code examples, this book would have been much better. Finally, this book is not a reference book; if you want to learn business objects, you have to sit down and concentrate to keep up with author's subject.<p>If you want to learn the basics of business objects, buy this one. If you want to find a reference book or more professional approach, look for something else.</span>

                    <span>What a great book!<p>The title should actually be, "I Can't Believe I Was Able To Program Anything Without Using Class Modules".  This book is really about back-end programming.  It's about writing a DLL that abstracts what you want to do from the nuts and bolts work of actually doing it.  And the best thing about it is that the components you write are COM compliant so they can be used with basically any language; specifically I've used them with ASP and ColdFusion.<p>Imagine writing an ASP page like this to update someone's salary:<p>   <% set objStaff = server.createobject("MyCompany.StaffMember")<br>   objStaff.beginedit<br>   objStaff.load 10<br>   objStaff.Salary = 60000<br>   objStaff.applyedit<br>   set objStaff = nothing  %><p>Notice that there's no database code, no business logic, no MTS stuff, no nothing.  All of these things get encapsulated in a DLL so that the front-end programmers don't have to worry about them.  They just create an object, do stuff, and kill it.  If that StaffMember was a non-manager, the DLL could be written to raise an error if the salary was over a certain threshold, or whatever.  It's up to you, the back-end programmer, and it's not possible to bypass the business's rules by forgetting to include the logic in the GUI.  Also, this is great if you are selling your app to a customer, because your code is compiled and can't be "stolen" or modified.<p>The book got a little bit confusing to me at times in chapters 4 and 5, but I hadn't touched VB in about two years since an intro college class, so that may have been to blame.  Also, it was more like "Where are we going with this?" rather than "What's going on?".  However, if you struggle through to chapter 6 or so, you will have an "A-ha" moment and then it will all make sense.  Believe me!<p>I now feel like a VB 6 Expert from reading this book.  It goes deeply into Debugging as an added bonus, and I don't really know how I got along without the "Immediate" window for so long.  Also, VB components are so much faster and more reliable than writing (and re-writing) your business rules in ASP code.  Your web apps will stop sucking and start being fast and reliable.<p>I whole-heartedly recommend this book, and I can't wait for the VB.net update.</span>

                    <span>As a beginner to business objects, I found some of the material beneficial.  Not to say that what i found was not of great value and therefore making the book overall worth keeping.  It was simply a needle in a haystack of overly complicated topics that could have been stated more simply.  Such a nice table of contents (perhaps over extended in the middle to end too)  is deserving of better work.<p>I admit i have not read the entire book.  But who has the time to read an entire book of this length?  I read it as I have all of my other 30 or so and had more trouble linking the different parts of the book together than i should have.  I would almost recommend reading this book front to back sequentially, which is frustrating.<p>I have never purchased a CS book before with code in each chapter that did not function.  This author certainly did not outdo himself in that respect.  So, at the end of the chapter and the end of the day, you can download his code and it will not function as expected; If it functions at all.  Even more bothersome is the inexcusable errors in the 'functioning' application.  For a book praising robustness, it is quite watered down.  <p>In closing, chop the book in half, eliminating all of the redundant chatter, give it functioning downloadable code, and call it a beginning book on business objects.  This book could have been much better but is still worth looking at, maybe buying; be sure to test drive first though.</span>
