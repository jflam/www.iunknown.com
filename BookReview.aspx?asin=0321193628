                    <span>It appears the author has no idea what is going on with concepts of PLs. For example, he doesn't even touch on the ideas of follow sets and predictive parsing. His coverage of BNF and EBNF is light, at best, and it seems this topical coverage permiates the whole book. 
<br />
<br />As any CS student or educator knows, "Concepts of" books tend to be dense and difficult to read. This author attempts to make the material more readable at the cost of detail. Unfortunatley, the detail he leaves out is necessary.
<br />
<br />I would also argue that the author doesn't have a strong understanding of PLs. The concepts he presents toward the begining on PL evaluation are incomplete. He doesn't fully express all of the important criteria in language evaluation.
<br />
<br />Overall, if you are looking for a brief, topical INTRODUCTION to programming languages, this may be the book for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.</span>

                    <span>This is very interesting book in which you can find interesting information about history of programming languages, as well as most relevant consepts used for building language compilers. 
<br />
<br />The problem of this book is not in the matter that is presented in the book, but in the way it is presented. The biggest problem is in the typos and mistakes made in the text. It is strange that this 6th edition of the book contains so many typos and mistakes. 
<br />
<br />Regardless the drawbacks that are said before, I recomand this book for buying. Anyone who is interested in programmming and programming languages will surely find interesting information in this book.</span>

                    <span>I agree with most of the other reviews (good and bad), but I think it really needs to be mentioned that this book is just *full* of typos and bugs. I've never read a computer book or a so-called textbook with so many mistakes. I would recommend against using this book for teaching until they come out with a new edition that is proofread a little better.</span>

                    <span>This book will not make you understand the basic ideas behind programming languages, and you won't be able to shy away from math as Sebesta's book does. For that, you will need other books.<br> This book, however is useful inasmuch as it provides a survey of some programming languages. However, it is heavily biased towards imperative programming languages. Even here the balance is wrong, with a lot of Ada and Pascal. IIRC, he forgets to mention Forth, which is old, but a totally different way to program than the other languages.<br> On the other hand, anything he has to say about any other type of paradigm will be, probably, wrong. For instance, his description of  Lisp remains in the 1950s ("interpreted, everything is a list"). He entirely ignores the Common Lisp Object System, which is by far much more advanced that your staple "OOP" language. The Smalltalk environment he shows is Smalltalk-80. Meaning: the environment used *then*. His description of Functional languages is a joke. So one gets the feeling he doesn't know what he is talking about. And he doesn't.<br> He missed a lot of development that went on in programming language research and their implementation.<br> He can't get right new developments in programming except things that are mainstream. In the new edition, he approaches Java, as if garbage collection, object orientation and bytecodes were something new (Smalltalk, Common Lisp almost 20 decades ago). If he's missed all that, let's not even begin to talk about the very new breed, like fast-compiling functional languages (Clean, OCaml), languages that allow reflection and metaprogramming (e.g., Maude), languages built for distributed programming (Oz, Erlang), etc.<br> If you buy this book, it should be only for the value of having a rather general, limited, historical overview of some programming languages. If you really want to learn about the ideas behind a programming language, you should read Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (the classic, now updated), and  Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming (the "new" classic).</span>

                    <span>This book doesn't do much for the student...  What good are exercises without answers?  A strong glossary also would help infinitely.  You do need a great deal of prior experience in C based languages to really benefit from the examples.</span>
