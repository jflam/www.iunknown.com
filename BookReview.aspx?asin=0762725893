                    <span>Traveling The Lewis And Clark Trail served as our family "bible" for retracing the Lewis and Clark trail (July 2004).  While we had several guidebooks, we constantly asked "What does Julie say ... ?"  Her recommended itinerary was very useful and served as the starting point for our planning.  Overall, we found it very clear and accurate.  While the book does not focus on "roughing it," we were especially pleased with the coverage of camping and hiking options along the trail.  
<br />
<br />We enjoyed having Julie along.  (She was voted honorary member of the family.)
<br />
<br />With Julie and a copy of Lewis and Clark's journals, you'll be ready for your own Journey of Discovery.

                    <span>Now in an expanded and updated bicentennial edition, Traveling The Lewis And Clark Trail by travel author Julie Fanselow is an invaluable and "user friendly" resource that modern-day enthusiasts can use to retrace the route of the two famous early American explorers commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson after acquiring the Louisiana Purchase from the French. Filled with from cover to cover with authoritative information concerning activities, attractions, recommended itineraries, maps, black-and-white photographs, and more, Traveling The Lewis And Clark Trail is a comprehensive and enthusiastically recommended guide for any vacationer seeking to retrace footsteps of Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and their companions.</span>

                    <span>As others have noted, a well researched and well organized guide. There's now a competing publication endorsed by Stephen Ambrose, whose book "Undaunted Courage" sparked renewed national interest in Lewis and Clark. After browsing that one, published by Montana Magazine in a magazine format, I can report that 1) it has advertising, and 2) it omits details found in Julie Fanselow's book. Stick with Julie. <p>I do hope she has an updated edition in the works for the upcoming Lewis and Clark bicentennial. A few points of information need to be added or changed to keep pace with developments. For instance: starting in 2003, access to the Lolo Motorway, the L&C route from Montana to Idaho, will be by permit only.</span>

                    <span>A friend and I did the L&C trail last summer. We took this guide and some others. This was *by far* the best guide. We literally would not have been able to find some sites without it. We came to trust its advice so much that we consistently asked each other what "Julie" had to say about various parks, campsites, etc. I can't imagine doing the trail without this book.</span>
