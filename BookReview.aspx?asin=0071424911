                    <span>I coach volleyball and am not even particularly fond of basketball, but I found this book to be incredibly worth reading.  Wooden may have coached athletics, but the lessons he shares from his own experiences trancend sports and touch on any undertaking.  This book will be a permanent fixture in my library.</span>

                    <span>What many of us never quite realized is that Wooden was also a great player in his day; only one elected to Hall of Fame as both.
<br />
<br />One can surmise that much of what carried him to fame at UCLA was already picked up in his early days in life, as student, son, player and then coach in high school.
<br />
<br />His faith in the Lord and reading Bible daily was inspirational as well.
<br />
<br />Lessons taught by him to his players were not just about b-ball, but about life.   The foreward by Bill Walton exudes this, and one can see how easy it was for his players to play for him.
<br />
<br />Great read to be re-read.   Youngsters should read this.</span>

                    <span>I recently heard an interview with John Wooden and was amazed at the sharp mind and dizzying intellect of the now 93-year-old former coach.  Thirsty for more of the Wizard of Westwood, I picked up "They Call Me Coach" on my next trip to the library.  Although an interesting read, I think more recent books by Mr. Wooden may have been better choices for my first selection.  <p>In memoir style, Wooden recounts the lessons of his youth and how they shaped his moral fiber and were essential foundations for his coaching style.      Coach Wooden outlines his pyramid for success, something all motivators of men should study.   He also shares some of the wonderful philosophies with which he guides his life.   <p>The one problem I had is that the book is now more than thirty years old and seemed to be written for an audience in 1972.  Wooden spends chapters discussing his "recent" teams that featured many players long forgotten.   But his thoughts and ideas are timeless and will be worth reading today and many years from now.</span>

                    <span>John Wooden was an inspiration to his players over the years.  Now with this book, he is an inspiration to us all.  His talent, his players, his faith -- all played a role in their success, and success to him was measured more by his young men than by any trophy case.</span>

                    <span>This book show the Wizard of Westwood's life and accomplishments in an interesting manner. I was surprised at how devoted he is to the Christian faith. The "Pyramid of Success" would be helpful for all of us. I have always been a UCLA fan because I lived in LA and I highly reccomend this book.</span>
