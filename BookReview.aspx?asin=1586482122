                <span id="Label1">A shocking true story of contemporary slavery: a young girl, snatched from her tribal village in Africa, survives enslavement in Sudan and London before making a courageous escape to freedom. <P> Mende Nazer lost her childhood at age twelve, when she was sold into slavery. It all began one horrific night in 1993, when Arab raiders swept through her Nuba village, murdering the adults and rounding up thirty-one children, including Mende. .<P> Mende was sold to a wealthy Arab family who lived in Sudan's capital city, Khartoum. So began her dark years of enslavement. Her Arab owners called her "Yebit," or "black slave." She called them "master." She was subjected to appalling physical, sexual, and mental abuse. She slept in a shed and ate the family leftovers like a dog. She had no rights, no freedom, and no life of her own. <P> Normally, Mende's story never would have come to light. But seven years after she was seized and sold into slavery, she was sent to work for another master--a diplomat working in the United Kingdom. In London, she managed to make contact with other Sudanese, who took pity on her. In September 2000, she made a dramatic break for freedom. <P> <I>Slave</I> is a story almost beyond belief. It depicts the strength and dignity of the Nuba tribe. It recounts the savage way in which the Nuba and their ancient culture are being destroyed by a secret modern-day trade in slaves. Most of all, it is a remarkable testimony to one young woman's unbreakable spirit and tremendous courage.</span>

                    <span>In Slave: My True Story, Mende Nazer's spirit echoes that of Sojourner Truth's during her journey from slave to freedom fighter. The singular difference in their heroic efforts is the span of more than a century. One would like to believe that humanity would choose to eradicate slavery everywhere, but Nazer is living proof that the horrific institution is thriving in the new millennium. Nazer, only in her mid-twenties, has spent more than half her life enslaved - held captive against her will by her own countrymen. Her escape to freedom was largely a stroke of luck but she took it as an omen to tell the world about the widespread slave trade in modern day Sudan. Her book is an international bestseller in Europe and she hopes its launch in the US will bring about awareness and more supporters.<P>Nazer's autobiography is told with a child-like voice that conveys innocence and honesty. Told chronologically, it begins with a happy, carefree childhood with her family in remote Sudan. She shares tribal traditions, wonderful family memories, and her perspective of the Arab and British influence on her people. She also covers the painful aspects that address female circumcision, poor health care provisions, and infant mortality. Her childhood is interrupted around 12 years of age (as the Nuba tribe does not record birth dates) when she was abducted and raped in a violent Arab raid on her village and sold into domestic slavery in Khartoum. There she was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused continuously for eight years serving as housemaid, car detailer, laundress, cook, seamstress, and 24-hour nursemaid; never receiving a vacation or any other compensation. Sadly the same tactics used during the ancient slave trade are still employed today. Equally effective are the perpetual impoverishment and loss of any familiarity. Although several opportunities for escape were presented over the years, Mende became too brainwashed and fearful to take advantage.<P>Mende eventually came of age, started to attract the attention of adult male visitors to the household, then was "traded" to a family in London. She eventually escaped and was granted amnesty within the UK with aide from fellow Sudanese and British supporters. One of those supporters, Damien Lewis, is the co-author of the novel. Both he and Mende dedicate their time and resources supporting human rights organizations and government assemblies. She has since learned that her parents survived the raid and are alive near her village and communicates with them periodically. Unfortunately with her sensationalized trial, publicized battle for political asylum in the United Kingdom and the release of the novel, came noteriety that prohibits her from returning to the Sudan. Thus Mende's ultimate plea for the abolition of slavery everywhere is coupled by a simple desire to see her family again.<P>This is a book is a testimony to a young woman's outstanding courage and unconquerable spirit.<P>Phyllis<BR>APOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club</span>

                    <span>When I bought 'Slave' I just thought it would be a fun read that I could put down and pick up anytime, but it ended up only taking a few hours because of the intensity of it and the none-stop action. It's about Mende Nazer, her life as a slave, and her struggle to freedom. Reading about slavery and the abuse that came with it horrified me to the point I couldn't put the book down until finding out whether she gains her freedom or not, and for that matter, even lives or not Mende spent most of her life as a slave and even now still hasn't fully adapted to a world of freedom, although it's only been a few years.<BR> <BR> As Mende struggles through every day life, which is basically chores and beatings: mental, physical and sexual, she always finds something to bring her back to a good, peaceful place. Whether it be thinking about her Nuba tribe, which was her home for only about 12 years, and village stories, or even the masters kids which are the only people who treat her nicely and equally. In fact, they are the only people who even recognize her as a walking, talking human. As she talked about her life I realize that other slaves had/have an even worse life than she. Mende had a big advantage over many of the other slaves because she could speak some English already and was older so she had more good memories to hang on to. <BR> <BR> While reading this I thought of all the times I got mad over doing laundry or getting hurt in a fall, but this was nothing compared to Mendes world. When first getting her period she didn't know what was happening and had no-one to help and guide her on this important new stage in life. And when a little boy tripped her and she fell, dropping some glasses on the way, she wasn't scolded like many of us would be; she was beaten and put to blame. There are so many slaves in the world today but many people just pass it by or are oblivious to it and even those who do know don't educate others. . Until reading this book I could honestly say I would be in the category of 'oblivious people,' but now I understand much more about slaves and there lives from getting captured to brutal beatings from there "masters." <BR> <BR> 'Slave' gives a voice to all those who had none and were being held captive. It is an up-to-date account of a girl who lost her freedom and her strain to get it back. It opens your eyes to the world of slaves, slave trade, and the authenticity of it all. 'Slave' is an eye-opening book that you won't be able to put down.</span>

                    <span>Most of us associate slavery with the days of the American Civil War. Yet, in many parts of the world today, slavery isn't dead. In this novel, we meet Mende, a young Sudanese tribal girl growing up happily with her family. The first third of the book explores Mende's childhood among her tribe, the Karko of the Nuba Mountains. Then one night, everything changes. Her village is attacked by Arab raiders. Huts are torched, men killed, women raped and children rounded up to be sold off later as slaves. Mende is among them. We see how Mende struggles to survive as a slave girl and horrors she was forced to go through. Eventually, Mende travels to London as a slave, where it is that she is finally able to make a break for freedom. While Mende's first hand account is great, describing a young woman's life as she matures from a child to an adult under horrible circumstances, something I disliked about this book was that towards the end, Damien Lewis seemed to take over the writing and this made it seem less personal. Also, because of Mende's age at certain points of the novel, I feel like some spots were not as detailed as later chapters. These two minor gripes shouldn't deter you from reading an unbelievable story of a resilient young woman.</span>

                    <span>I thought that Slave was a very good read, because I enjoyed it and couldn't put it down, which to me makes a good book. I would recommend this book to anyone, it is the compelling story of a girls struggle to survive in a world of modern day slavery, being deprived of seeing her family for 8 years eventually overcoming the abuse and humiliation of being regarded as dirty, and diseased. Beaten and starved, Mende Nazer makes her escape, and tells her brave tale.</span>
