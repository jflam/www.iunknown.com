                <span id="Label1"><P> Dereck and Beverly Joubert have lived among lions for most of their adult lives. Few people anywhere are on such intimate terms with these awe-inspiring creatures, and fewer still are the naturalists who can claim to have seen, let alone shared, their nocturnal forays. For unlike their East African cousins, the great cats of Savuti, a remarkable natural enclave just north of Botswana's Okavango Delta, do almost all of their stalking and killing at night when the moon is just a sliver in the sky. <P> Over a hundred breathtaking full-color images captured by Beverly Joubert's ever-watchful camera represent not just superb wildlife photography but a priceless record of a little-known natural phenomenon. They create a portrait of the Savuti lions at rest, at play, and on the shadowy hunts that end in a sudden, explosive kill, offering a rare glimpse of the lithe power and ruthless beauty that have mesmerized humans for millennia. Dereck Joubert's detailed and engaging text documents years of observation, providing invaluable insight into the biology, behavior, and social structure of an elusive species; at the same time he brings to life the individual animals the Jouberts came to know so well: Maome, the matriarch whose clan played together every evening; Ntchwaidumela, the bold and unflappable male who defied a charging elephant; Sequela, the old exile who returned to spend his last days with his pride, and many more. <P> Last but by no means least, <I>Hunting With the Moon</I> is a chronicle of human dedication, a deeply personal account of a couple who have devoted their lives to understanding and protecting the magnificent beasts who prowl these pages in all their majestic grace. It's an extraordinary book, filled with stunning images, fascinating facts, and vivid anecdotes -- a once-in-a-lifetime chance to enter the enthralling, unforgettable world of lions in the wild.</span>

                    <span>An excellent book with some marvellous photographs. After all those years in Savuti I would have thought that they perhaps would have had a greater understanding on the politics of lions and hunting? I spent twenty seven years there, I can remember an Africa with a lot more Cheethas, Leopards and other cats, in the days before "everyone wants to see a lion". Now the over population of Lions is having adverse effects on the other predatory cats. Well, Lions is their passion, so theyre understandably biased, but all in all - a great deal of effort and hard work has gone in to producing an otherwise very enjoyable book</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the best I have ever read.Extremely detailed and imformative,with excellent photography,I read it from cover to cover,every single word,without putting it down once! But then again, lions are my passion,so I suppose I'm slightly bias. For anyone even remotely interested in wildlife,this book is a must. No bookshelf is complete without it. Hunting With The Moon has some clear messages.How much longer can we tolerate the shooting of prime adult male lions for sport?For every male lion shot,effectively between 5 and 14 lions actually die.I personally think this is terrible,and I am glad people such as Dereck and Beverly Joubert make it their business to do something about it.</span>

                    <span>No nature video collection is complete without at least two or three of the Joubert's works on the wildlife of Botswana, and this book complements their video work wonderfully.<P>The major focus of their work has been the elephants and lions of Botswana, but the book is a good overall view of the wildlife of the Savuti area. Fans of the videos will enjoy the memories they share, such as their agonizing but ultimately correct decision to let Tau the cub fend for himself and the day they gave Ntchwaidumela his name. <P>It is not always an easy read. Their subjects have not always fared well - in particular they painfully inform us that all but one of the adult male lions in their study group, including the five who starred in their two lion movies, have since been killed by hunters. Their annotated field notes, "The African Diaries", also in print, is largely about how this situation has forced them to take time away from behind the camera to be active in politics.<P>But this work is largely about happier days and the making of some classic videos. The still photographs within make this book worthy of becoming a classic itself.</span>

                    <span>This book is a joy to browse through, to read and to admire the photographs. Every page shows the author's passion towards the lions of Savuti, a magical and wild place in Northern Botswana. Derek and Beverly Joubert spend years in that place filming and photographing lions and other denizens of this wilderness. The book is proliferated with exceptional photographs of lions interacting with other animals. We see lions hunting, resting, playing and communicating with each other. There is a series of unique photographs portraying lions killing an elephant calf. There is a great photograph of a running lioness during a hunt, an aerial photograph of a running buffalo herd. I can go on and on. You get the drift. The text is interesting and at times seems almost poetic. "Hunting with the Moon" is one of a few must-have books for a true lover of African wildlife. In other words, great book!</span>

A must read for all wildlife lovers.</span>
