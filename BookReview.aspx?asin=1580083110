                    <span>This book holds true to its title. This no nonsense book gets straight to the point on how to unfold your mind and let loose your creativity. This book WILL start to help you think out of the box, to use an old cliche.
<br />
<br />Full of great examples and tests along the way that will teach you the process of unleashing your creativity. It contains fascinating historical facts on the great genius of the past, from Newton to Einstein, and how some of their inventions came to be, and their methods used to achieve them. Though chances are we will never come close to the creativity that will compare to the great ones of the past, but it will add and alter your thought process for the better, as it has mine.
<br />
<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.

                    <span>This is one of the most enjoyable as well as one of the most informative books I have read in recent years.  This book examines the creative process as illustrated by the thinking strategies employed by creative geniuses throughout history in the sciences, arts, and industry. The book enlightened and inspired me to become a proactive thinker. The book helped me understand what creativity is and how I can be more creative in my business.

                    <span>I've been looking for years for the right book that would provide practical advice that is historically founded.  This is it. Michael provides the techniques with the histories of the techniques as to how geniuses have profited from them throughout history. This is, without question, the best book on creative thinking that I have ever read. Bar none.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Michael Michalko' companion volume to 'Thinkertoys' is highly recommended. The author hosts a guided tour through strategies and tactics designed to challenge, and ultimately enlighten us all. There are relevant examples and illustrations. There are cogent observations from the creators themselves. And there is much, much more. This book can be properly viewed as a paradigm for creative thinking.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I have read many books on creativity and creative thinking techniques. "Cracking Creativity"is not only the best book on creative thinking I have ever read it also has research that clearly explains the thinking strategies that the creative geniuses throughout history used to get their ideas. After explaining the strategy, Michalko provides practical creative thinking techniques, based on the strategy, to help you generate the ideas you need. It's fantastic. I am just reading it for the second time. I would highly recommended it to anyone who wants or needs to become more creative.</span>
