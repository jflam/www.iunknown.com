                    <span>let me first say that readers of the first three krenov books should NOT expect this book to be the same. whatever reason krenov wrote this book (explained at the beginning of the book) is not as important to me as what i actually use this book for, which is inspiration. It also gives me a goal to live up to, a self goal to make furniture at such a high level of refinement. This book contains many many beautiful examples of selected work from krenov and his students, all finely crafted. to me these examples that krenov have chosen from his students' work are in a sense extensions of krenov's own work - interpretations of his style done in comparable quality. there is also some text if you value the insight and opinions of krenov. that's pretty much what the book is: lots of examples of fine work, text with insight and opinions. stuff like this from a master craftsman such as krenov is, to me, invaluable.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">A bless for Krenov readers</div>

                    <span>Krenov books are almost perfect , but they have a substantial imperfection in having most of the pictures black and white. This last book corrects this imperfection offering superb color pictures of superb work. Magnificent examples of craftmanship, wise thoughts, and a contagious love for working with wood. A must for Krenov readers.</span>

                    <span>This book is quite different from Krenov's other, often intensely personal books. His motivation, in large part, is to make the case for his student's furniture, and only by extention his own work, and methods of work. He is concerned that the market hasn't a place for such work, and he hopes to make a place for it through this book. Krenov's previous stance in the Impractical Cabinetmaker, wasn't concerned with lack of viability, but the market has changed, and his students aspirations have apparently influenced him.<P>The last book Krenov published prior to this effort was Worker in Wood in 1981. In the intervening time, a great deal of his efforts have been spent establishing the Woodworking program at the College of the Redwoods in California. When I first heard that Krenov was writing another book I had hoped he would bring us up to date on his approach to woodwork, twenty years later. It is clear when you look at some of his recent work that it is quite different from where he was 20 years ago. It is also clear that some of the techniques then used have changed. It would be fitting if rather than the older books simply being republished, he could bring his many admirers up to date with a new volume.<P>While this book is well done, and shows many handsome photographs, there isn't much new. Many of the pictures have appeared previously in other publications, and the text, while powerful in places, is scant. It is rather like a catalogue to an exhibition. A dialogue between Krenov, his star pupils, and potential purchasers of their work.</span>

                    <span>As usual Mr. Krenov's books are wonderful reading. His insites into craftsmenship are the best. In addison to his wonderful words are all the beautiful pictures of his and his students work. This is a book that no Krenov fan should be without.</span>
