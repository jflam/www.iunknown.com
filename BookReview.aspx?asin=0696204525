                    <span>I used this book to plan my own kitchen and it helped me avoid mistakes.  I was very tight on space in my kitchen/dining area, therefore every inch counted.  It gives great guidelines for minimum space requirements. For example, it tells you how much space is needed between a wall and a table;  how much space is necessary for each person at a table; how much countertop space should be left by the refrigerator or near the cooktop; how wide an island should be; how much space is necessary for the aisle in a kitchen so 2 people can work, etc.  <p>Also included is assessing your needs  and taking an inventory of your current kitchen which I found useful.<p>Other sections such as choosing fixtures and appliances or selecting materials weren't as beneficial to me personally, but overall I would highly recommend this book to someone planning their own kitchen - it gives some good solid guidelines and things to consider when planning a kitchen.</span>

                    <span>If you are beginning to think about remodeling your kitchen, read this  book first!  This book takes you through the basic steps of redesigning  your kitchen, covering options for design, layout, storage, and appliances.   The kitchens pictured are stunning, and run the gamut from Parade of  Homes/celebrity level to actually affordable.<p>I was able to see some  wonderful options that are realistic, along with a couple dream items I may  splurge on.  While I have bought other design books and magazines since,  this is still my favorite.  It made me excited about remodeling!</span>
