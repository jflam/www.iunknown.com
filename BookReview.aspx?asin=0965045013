                    <span>Can you improve yer motorcycle riding skills by reading a book? No doubt about it.<p>Keith Code is founder and director of California Superbike Cornering Schools and has published a number of books on the subject of racing motorcycles on speed tracks. Although most of this book's focus is on handling race bikes, only the last two of its sixteen chapters are exclusively dedicated to racing.<p>The book concentrates mostly on better controlling your speed while maneuvering your bike over varying racetrack conditions.<p>As you'd expect, there is a major emphasis on turning: getting through the turn with increased mph and decreased time spent in [the turn] and [maintaining] adequate control of the bike. <br>Code's overall approach to improving riding skills is to define the basics, and then to investigate the decisions you must make to ride well.<p>He uses a great analogy: Each person has a fixed amount of attention while riding a motorcycle. This is represented as a $10 bill worth of attention. If you spend five dollars of it on one aspect of riding, you have only five dollars left for all the other aspects. Spend nine and you have only one dollar left, and so on.<p>The aspects of riding he talks about are things like:<br>Road characteristics: Constant-, increasing-, and. decreasing-radius turns, crested turns, series turns, positive- and negative-camber turns, and road surfaces.<p>What you do: Riding is one thing; riding plus being aware of what you are doing is quite another. Making an effort to look at what you are doing while you are doing it.<br>Your own evaluation of what you just did and what just happened: Things that can be thought over and changed if necessary.<p>I like his teaching strategy. After isolating several specific principles, concepts, and techniques, each subsequent chapter effectively builds on what was previously presented to the point that if you didn't understand the concept and haven't yet experienced it, <br>you'll want to get back on the road and try it out, read the book some more, then evaluate what you understand.<p>The books's worth buying.</span>

                    <span>This book puts many techniques familiar to experienced riders in a technical context such that it becomes easier to improve your riding and analyse and change bad habits. New riders will gain an enormity from reading it too. It is highly recommended to take the knowledge learned from these pages to a track and apply the techniques in a safe yet challenging environment. <br>If you have the patience to stay with Mr. Code's oblique approach to the subject you will learn not only a treasure trove of techniques but also the fundamental tools of analysis to be able to continue improving on your own.<p>Get this book (or Twist II) and revisit it again and again, you will probably never need another text on riding.</span>

                    <span>For people who have no experience in riding, reading this book may be helpful since it shows the basic ideas of riding with pictures.  However, once you started riding, almost all things mentioned in this book will be understood/felt via little experience.  I will recommend saving your money and take your bike to the race track a couple times after you ride for 6 months.  You will learn a lot on the race track in a safe manner; you also learn how well your bike can handle those turns you think it can never make.</span>
