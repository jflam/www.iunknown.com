                    <span>Don't let the fact that this is ISA System Architecture deter you from reading this book. Although the ISA BUS is seldom used, the Legacy devices/functions are still in use today.<P>This book was Very useful to to me for gaining a base level of understanding system architecture. In general, the PC architecture builds upon it's predecessor. This book will give you the foundation needed to progress to the next level and so on.<P>It is important for me to note that there appear to be two (2) distinct writing styles in this book. One of the authors explains in great detail before and during a subject and the other is somewhat vague at times in defining and explaining his subjects.<P>However, regardless of the two writing styles, If you bring your thinking cap, scratch paper,and a desire to learn, this book will teach you what you need to move forward.<P>I Highly recommend this book.<P>It should also be noted that the reader should have a GOOD understanding of PC's from an integration,troubleshooting, and repair standpoint. (A+ certification knowledge)OR experience in Assembly/ 'C' language. This will make it easier to understand and put you in the right frame of mind.<P>Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Just completed the book. Excellent coverage of the ISA Bus -- from the hardware as well as software point of view. <BR>Book also covers the peripheral support chips (8237,8259, etc) that are attached to the Bus -- as well as the operating <BR>modes of various x86 processors.<P>Definetly geared towards Operating System Developers.</span>

                    <span>I like this book since it covers the ISA bus in a very compresive way. It is a good book on computer architecture since it descibes how the CPU attaches to the bus, and what gets attached to the bus. the authors descibe the evolution of the bus by discussing how the CPU (286,386,..) attached to the bus evolves. i like how the book is organized... you dont have to go searching all over the place for information. everything is presented thoroughly and without convolution so that you dont have to start with the first chapter, or, when you refer back to the book, you dont have to read a bunch of other chapters.</span>

                    <span>The examples and explanations of why and how the ISA architecture functions in a standard PC were a great help for me. As the book progresses, one can appreciate the complexity of the ISA architecture, yet I didn't get "lost" from chapter to chapter. Without this resource, I probably wouldn't have been able to complete a major design project and graduate from college.</span>

                    <span>This book is good for people who do not want to delve into the hardware level very much but still want a summary overview of how the ISA bus interacts with different components on a PC. I bought the book thinking it would present more hardware solutions on interfacing but was sorely dissapointed in the lack of real world examples. It is a so-so refrence book with enough good info for me to want to keep it.</span>
