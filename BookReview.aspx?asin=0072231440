                    <span>I recommend this book without hesitation.  I bought this as a complete beginner and it has shown me in easy steps how to write effective VBA code. Plenty of worked examples to follow and copy in - I liked this because it gave me something to build on and showed very effectively how the structure of the code worked. Everything is explained well and the chapter structure has been carefully constructed so that  it all follows on from each other. The examples have something for everyone and go from simple stuff like code to transpose a selected range of cells in one click to code to auto total rows and columns of a selected matrix of numbers in one click.  Very useful on a spreadsheet.</span>

                    <span>This book isn't particularly good.  It feels as if it were written without a lot of thought.  The first 13 chapters are a cursory review of VBA; the examples in Chapters 20-41 are mostly trivial.  Many of them could be done faster and more efficiently without resort to VBA.  You would be better off with another book such as Walkenbach's.</span>

                    <span>I have found this book extremely useful.  As someone with a little programming knowledge already I wanted to find out more about how to program Excel.  I was very pleasantly surprised both by how flexible the Excel language is and what a good investment this book is.  I have been amazed at how quickly I have been able to grasp the subject.  There is a good balance in the book between the theory and the examples and I did not find it heavy going at all.<p>Best of all the book is the right size to take to the office for easy reference. The book is written by someone who obviously uses Excel VBA day to day and has included plenty of practical examples.  I always thought that Excel was just a spreadsheet package but I now have reasonable understanding of the power behind it.<p>I have just completed my first application and am very proud of it!!!</span>

                    <span>This book has opened up a whole new area of Excel for me.  I can now do anything in VBA code within an Excel spreadsheet!  My friends at work have become impressed with my Excel code.  Recently, my boss was given a spreadsheet with similar information on 50 sheets within one file and he wanted to see it all on one sheet going downwards.  Within 15 minutes I was able to produce VBA code to do this transition - he was over the moon!<p>I work in accountancy so I use Excel spreadsheets very frequently.  However, I had only been able to record macros and did not have any understanding of how they worked.  This book has taken me from the very basics through to some very complicated code and creating a professional add in file.  I found everything was well explained and plenty of working examples were used.  It shows how to build GUI interfaces which look really professional.<p>It describes the Excel Object model in very good detail - I have now realised that the object model is at the heart of the code and you need a very good understanding  of this in order to start writing code for Excel. Two chapters are devoted to this.<p>There are a huge number of tricks explained in this book some of which could be described as hacks.  I found out how to copy and view a hidden worksheet which was password protected simply using commands in the object model.<p>This has certainly whetted my appetite for Excel VBA</span>
