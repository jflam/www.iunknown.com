                    <span>"Get Big Fast" is the story of Amazon.com's inception and rise to e-commerce supremacy, as told by business reporter Robert Spector. This book seems to be intended for students of business or perhaps budding entrepreneurs. It offers very little analysis, but Spector gives us the facts -or at least some of them- of how the Internet's first store came to be its biggest. This is a Who did What When and Why of Amazon's first five and a half years, 1994-2000. The story starts before that, though. The first three chapters follow Amazon founder and president Jeff Bezos from his youth in Texas, through a successful career in the vicinity of Wall Street, to Seattle, where Amazon would be born. The remaining eight chapters trace Amazon's growth from the Bezos' garage, to makeshift offices and crowded warehouses, to Amazon's current residence in the lovely PacMed Tower, from 4 employees to 7600 on three continents. There is a list of "Takeaways" at the end of each chapter, which reiterate the chapter's major points and Amazon's strategy during that time. Since Jeff Bezos, et al created new technology as they were building a multi-billion dollar business, "Get Big Fast" discusses the creation of Amazon's web site and it's features, in addition to logistics, finances, and personalities. Since I spend a lot of time on this web site, I would have liked a more in-depth history of its features, but given that Robert Spector is a business writer and not a software developer, his slant is understandable. More analysis of Amazon's decisions in the context of retail sales would also have been welcome. But the fact that Amazon was a pioneer business model that many hailed as proof positive of the New Economy does make comparisons to other businesses tricky. As I write this, Amazon.com is nearly twice as old as when Robert Spector wrote his book. But much less has changed in the interim years than in the first five. "Get Big Fast" is a solid primer on Amazon.com's inception and growth, and therefore a foundational piece of e-commerce history.</span>

                    <span>The most telling detail on Amazon in this book was on page 132: When publishers and authors asked Bezos why Amazon.com would publish negative reviews, he (said) Amazon.com "was taking a different approach, of trying to sell all books...the good, the bad, and the ugly...doing that, you actually have an obligation...to let truth loose.'"<p>Whichever publishers and authors those were, they epitomize the sort of thinking that a new business model sweeps away. When someone responds negatively to their product they seek to silence that person. Failing that, they repackage the same product. If that doesn't work, they rename the product. Then they present the product in a different size. Anything, abosolutely anything, but listen to the customer who gripes.<p>I don't think Spector grasps the depth of this change. When Amazon gives a forum to ordinary people to speak where previously only "professionals" could, that's as profound a shift as from monarchy to democracy.  Giving equal space on the electronic bookshelf to an arcane book on geology and a convenience store bestseller is as revolutionary as Martin Luther's 95 theses getting equal billing with the pronouncements of the pope. In terms of sales, if I can buy what I want instead of just what the "professionals" want me to buy, I'm going to buy more.<p>Most of the other factors in Amazon's success have been done before: hiring smart people, working long hours, providing great customer service...but no other retailer ever had a selection larger than the Library of Congress. And no other retailer ever gave customers around the globe a public forum for feedback. I would have liked to have seen more on this unique aspect of Amazon in GET BIG FAST, and less of the sort of business school platitudes that make up the "Takeaways" sections at the end of each chapter.</span>

                    <span>I love the book. Though not bought at amazon. :< The story of how a not known internet company to a successful and real big one. How the company relied on open source and slowly as it get bigger used more commercial software. It describe how a man vision can come true by believing. Truly amazing book, I like one part of the  book which says 'How do Amazon review this book for themselve?'. It's a good read</span>

                    <span>While many who are reading this review are probably interested in the website story, this book is probably not the one to read.  The author did not have access to Jeff Bezos and many other key players when writing this book, and the lack of first hand information shows.<p>It reads like a detailed, outsiders view of the history of the company. This happened, then that happened, then the site did this other thing.  There is very little discussion of *why* these events and actions were important. And most importantly, very little context as to how the site changed the face of internet commerce.<p>This book is certainly not the definitive work on [site], which is still to be written.  A better (and funnier) look at the internals of Amazon can be found in "21 Dog years - Doing time at Amazon.com".</span>

                    <span>As a recent graduate in computer science last year, the book serves as a ray of hope in the so called "twilight of the dot com" days. I used to hear and read about these stories as an undergrad student. By the time I graduated and set my foot in the market, I saw people looking at IT as the 21st century Babylon - a boom of yesteryears.<br>The book outlines the insight Jeff had when he decided to quit one of the most sought after jobs and start a company in his garrage. It also revelas what made him think of books as the hottest item he could sell on the internet. The book tells the story of the internet big bang and Amazon.com's role in it. I would recommend this book to all the people who would like to discover how one man's foresight of the then upcoming internet revolution paved a way for many other startups.<br>In particular, I enjoyed the history of all the features (wish list, listamania, saving users session, etc) which we see on the amazon.com website today.<br>I would recommend Po Bronson's books to the readers for similar literature.</span>
