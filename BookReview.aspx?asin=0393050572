                <span id="Label1">There's no shortage of good Shakespearean biographies. But Stephen Greenblatt, brilliant scholar and author of <I>Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare</I>, reminds us that the "surviving traces" are "abundant but thin" as to known facts. He acknowledges the paradox of the many biographies spun out of conjecture but then produces a book so persuasive and breathtakingly enjoyable that one wonders what he could have done if the usual stuff of biographical inquiry--memoirs, interviews, manuscripts, and drafts--had been at his disposal. Greenblatt uses the "verbal traces" in Shakespeare's work to take us "back into the life he lived and into the world to which he was so open." Whenever possible, he also ushers us from the extraordinary life into the luminous work. The result is a marvelous blend of scholarship, insight, observation, and, yes, conjecture--but conjecture always based on the most convincing and inspired reasoning and evidence. Particularly compelling are Greenblatt's discussions of the playwright's relationship with the university wit Robert Greene (discussed as a chief source for the character of Falstaff) and of <I>Hamlet</I> in relation to the death of Shakespeare's son Hamnet, his aging father, and the "world of damaged rituals" that England's Catholics were forced to endure.  </p><I>Will in the World</I> is not just the life story of the world's most revered writer. It is the story, too, of 16th- and 17th-century England writ large, the story of religious upheaval and political intrigue, of country festivals and brutal public executions, of the court and the theater, of Stratford and London, of martyrdom and recusancy, of witchcraft and magic, of love and death: in short, of the private but engaged William Shakespeare in his remarkable world. Throughout the book, Greenblatt's style is breezy and familiar. He often refers to the poet simply as Will. Yet for all his alacrity of style and the book's accessibility, <I>Will in the World</I> is profoundly erudite, an enormous contribution to the world of Shakespearean letters. <I>--Silvana Tropea</I> <p>  <p clear="left"><p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <B>Interview with Stephen Greenblatt</B> <br><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/artists/greenblatt-stephen.t.jpg" align="left">Stephen Greenblatt shares his thoughts about what make Shakespeare Shakespeare and why the Bard continues to fascinate us endlessly.</span>

<br />
<br />This extremely well written book, by Harvard University Professor, editor, and author Stephen Greenblatt attempts to explain "How Shakespeare became Shakespeare" (the book's subtitle) by filling in the knowledge gaps that are unknown about his life. 
<br />
<br />Greenblatt explains: 
<br />
<br />"This is a book...about an amazing success story that has resisted explanation: it aims to discover the actual person who wrote the most important body of imaginative literature of the last thousand years...it aims to tread the shadowy paths that lead from the life he lived into the literature he created...[literature] so astonishing, so luminous, that it seems to have come from a god and not a mortal."
<br />
<br />How does Greenblatt propose to do this?  Answer: Through rational speculation and conjecture.   Greenblatt explains this more eloquently:
<br />
<br />"There are huge gaps in knowledge that make any biographical study of Shakespeare an exercise in speculation...[since]so much...from [his] life [is uncertain]."
<br />
<br />The author's speculation considers the time in which Shakespeare lived.  Thus we learn much about Elizabethan England and Elizabethan theatre during the time Shakespeare lived (April 23, 1564 to April 23, 1616).  Greenblatt takes the facts that are known about Shakespeare's life (which are minimal) and when factual gaps in his life do occur (there are many), the author fills these in with rational speculation.  The result is a possible profile of a person called William Shakespeare.
<br />
<br />Greenblatt considers the few facts known about Shakespeare's parentage, birth, early life, marriage, the "lost years" (from 1585 to 1592, there are no official records of Shakespeare) and the "London years" (no one knows exactly when he moved to London or how he supported himself when he first got there) and knits them together through speculation and conjecture to form a coherent story.
<br />
<br />The latter half of this book seems to lose some focus.  Greenblatt at this point analyzes some of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets in order to gain clues as to exactly who Shakespeare was and what was going on in his life.  (He wrote 39 plays that scholars know of between 1590 and 1613 including a play that was lost and 154 sonnets.)  Here, Greenblatt is assuming that art imitates life and that Shakespeare did indeed write the works attributed to him.
<br />
<br />For the most part, Greenblatt looks in detail at the plays written during Shakespeare's greatest period (1599 to 1608).  Some of these plays include the following:
<br />
<br />"Twelfth Night," "Hamlet," "Othello," "Measure for Measure," "King Lear," "Macbeth (my personal favorite), "As You Like It," and "Antony and Cleopatra."    
<br />
<br />Greenblatt's analysis is well done and interesting.  For example, I found the conjecture of exactly who the great comic character "Falstaff" was based on extremely interesting.
<br />
<br />Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets.  (A sonnet is a highly structured poem with 14 lines and a specific rhyme scheme.)  Of this total, Greenblatt looks at 36 or about 25% of them.
<br />
<br />I felt that Greenblatt was reading too much into these plays and sonnets.  (This is very easy to do.)  As well,  I felt he was straying too much off his main theme of attempting to determine who Shakespeare was.
<br />
<br />This brings up the question: can only those who are very familiar with Shakespeare's plays and sonnets read this book?  No.  Greenblatt gives enough background information so you don't have to be familiar with Shakespeare's works.  However, it would enhance your enjoyment of this book if you are familiar with some of them beforehand.
<br />
<br />This book contains two, four-page inserts of 12 pictures each.  Many of these are in color.  I found these pictures interesting.
<br />
<br />A problem I had is with this book's subtitle (stated above in the first paragraph of this review).  I think it should more accurately be "How Shakespeare POSSIBLY Became Shakespeare."
<br />
<br />Finally, I recommend the following book: "The Friendly Shakespeare" (1993) by Norrie Epstein. It also gives tidbits about Shakespeare not mentioned in Greenblatt's book.
<br />
<br />In conclusion, can I state with certainty that this is an accurate biography of the Bard. No.  But I can say with one hundred percent accuracy that this book gives some fascinating insight into whom possibly William Shakespeare was and possibly how he became who he was!!

                    <span>This is one of the best books that I have ever read on William Shakespeare. Greenblatt uses the plays combined with the snippets we know from the bard's past to create an astonishing biography. 
<br />
<br />Greenblatt is an entertaining writer who clearly knows the plays inside and out. He has drawn from extensisive analysis of the text to create a complex and thoroughly convincing picture of the great writer. This is a great book and should be read by anyone with more than a passing interest in Shakespeare.
<br />
<br />I was particualry impressed with his chapter on Macbeth which drew up on its links to the Gun powder plot and beyond. He places Shakespeare as a man of his time whode writing transcended it.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Greenblatt's "Will in the World" is an unusual but well-written and very effective biography that seeks to place the Bard in the context of his times.  Acknowledging up front the paucity of surviving details about Shakespeare's life, Greenblatt starts with known facts about the world in which the playwright lived and works inward.  Geenblatt examines such events as the fierce conflict between Protestants and Catholics over religious faith, and by reasonable and plausible logic, links the impact of these events to the known facts of Shakespeare's life and work.  Out of this interplay emerges a revealing portrait of Shakespeare as a sensitive but clear-eyed and ambitious man.
<br />
<br />Greenblatt wastes no time on the long-running academic controversy over whether Shakespeare actually wrote the plays attributed to him.  Greenblatts seems confident of the authenticity of Shakespeare's authorship.  He brings out that in a world without copyright restrictions, Shakespeare, a gifted writer, was free to follow the custom of the times of borrowing liberally from the works of other playwrights and authors.  At the same time, Greenblatt highlights Shakespeare's very original contributions.  In Greenblatt's view, Shakespeare overcame a relative lack of formal education through a remarkable ability to learn from his own experiences and those of others.
<br />
<br />This is a book for the reader already familiar with Shakespeare's work.  Greenblatt refers frequently to Shakespeare's plays and poems in a manner that assumes prior knowledge on the part of the reader.
<br />
<br />This volume is highly recommended to the serious student of Shakespeare's life, to include the nicely concise bibliographic notes at the end.  This volume will also appeal to the casual fan of Shakespeare's plays, who for the investment of a little time will learn a good deal about the context in which they were written.</span>

<br />Greenblatt stretches the limit in speculation. Virtually every other sentence begins with a qualifier like "perhaps." While I was reading this book I was dazzled by Prof. G's hand-is-quicker-than-the-eye dexterity. After finishing it, though, I realized that I'd actually learned very little.
<br />
<br />As an interesting scholarly speculation, this book is of some importance to readers of WS. Certainly it is not suitable as a first biography for novices. It's a pretty easy read; do it for fun, not profit.</span>
