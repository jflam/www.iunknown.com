                    <span>This book offers a clear view of the embedded system design process. If you are a newcomer, it can help you clear up the mystery and it is a easy reading. If you have been through a embedded project from ground up, this is not the book for you. Even though I like this book, it lacks of depth and the text closed up in a hurry. </span>

                    <span>Good for beginners. Really valuable if you are out of college and in need of directions in this field. The references in the end of each chapter are quite useful. It will give you directions but do not expect any deep/serious discussions about the topics it is supposed to cover.</span>

                    <span>Very good to learn the embedded system world for the new comers.<br>If you have some experience with project management and know what are the differences between MCUs and development tools, then it is no need to buy it.</span>

                    <span>This book provides introduction to many important aspects of embedded systems design. Disappointingly, in many parts of the book, the writing is quite incoherent and lacks proper organization of thoughts. The author may be a good engineer but certainly not a good writer.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I was tempted to give this book two stars because the topic is excellent, however Berger falls short of the mark. The book is aimed at beginners (quote: "A complete discussion of <X> would quickly drive all but the most dedicated readers into 'geek overload', so I'll end my discussion here."), but fails in that endevour by providing a patchy and incoherent text. The book is sprinkled with insights from "In the Trenches" which makes you doubt that he's actually ever been there.</span>
