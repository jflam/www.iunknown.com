                    <span>Having recently passed 70-310, I found this book to be exceedingly helpful in cementing certain .NET distributed concepts for the exam-- meanwhile, related MCAD/MCSD study guides like those from Sybex and Microsoft (?!) came up short...
<br />
<br />Chapters 1-9 of this book provided clear explanations and working examples for 70% of the content I encountered on my recent exam, while topics covered equally well in Chapters 11-15 accounted for the remaining 30%. Even Windows Services can be found about mid-way through Chapter 7.
<br />
<br />If you are keen on moving into distributed .NET programming and/or preparing for 70-310 (like me), I would highly recommend this book. I would not have earned my MCAD credential without it...</span>

                    <span>Solid information for those interested in building N-tier architectures in a Microsoft world.  Great stuff on how to build business objects -- I haven't found much on Microsoft object caching except in this book.  Sadly, MS hasn't gone as deep as JBoss, BroadVision or similar products but this book helps fill the gap.</span>

                    <span>This book won't tell you every single thing about .Net Remoting, Web Services, Com+ or Message Queueing, but since it gives you a lot of info on all those techs and a lot of others it's the perfect book for people who plan on creating Distributed Applications.
<br />I have read it full now and it helped me a LOT in my work. I work as an application developer at a bank and I'm supposed to do the company workflow system. It has to be very scalable so I needed to build a distributed architecture. This book helped me building this architecture and getting it approved by the board.
<br />
<br />Great Book!</span>

                    <span>While this tome does have some useful information in it, the reader would be better served by reading a single case study in which the reader actually learns how to produce a real-world solution. This book attempts to provide coverage of a wide range of topics in a disjointed and rambling fashion. Heavy on theory, light on application, the reader is bored silly after the first hundred pages and is referred to Microsoft's website for case studies worth anything. The title of this book (and the reason people buy it) is very misleading. A more accurate title would be something like "A sampling of distributed application technologies -- past and present." This book has a purely academic tone to it. The bottom line is -- theory won't put bread on the table, unless of course you are a writer or a professor. Good luck.</span>
