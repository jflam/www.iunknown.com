                <span id="Label1">Growing up in a bizarre cave-dwelling cult in Colorado, seven-foot, eight-inch Maurice "<b>Slo-Mo</b>" Finsternick knows nothing about the NBA--that is until the day he's discovered and becomes the hottest sports icon in the country.<br><br>This uproariously funny satire of pro sports is Rick Reilly at his very best. The bestselling author of the classic <b>Missing Links</b> has delivered again with this dead-on tale of "<b>Slo-Mo</b>" Finsternick, a genius player with a patented thirty-foot hook shot. Eventually, though, <b>Slo-Mo</b> begins to move away from his kind, truthful, polite, and self-effacing ways and gradually learns to behave like a famous athlete. Can the big man's innocence survive the charms of the big show?<br></span>

                    <span>If there were ever a "Forrest Gump" of the sports world, it's Slo Mo. I overheard Rick Reilly talk about this book on the Jim Rome show and purchased it a month later. A lot of the stories are based upon true NBA stories that Reilly had heard, and he didn't need a shoe horn and mounds of super glue to fit them into the short NBA career of Maurice Finkerstein, better known to the world as "Slo Mo."<P>Forget the fact that the real characters involved have never been affiliated with the team (Charles Barkley, Bryant Reeves and Phil Jackson aren't associated with Houston, Vancouver or Chicago/LA like they were in real life), it's a great read from start to finish. The first 2/3rd of the book based on funny stories... and the last 1/3rd you don't want to put the book down.</span>

                    <span>This is, especially in the beginning parts, a very funny book.<BR>There are many "put it down and laugh out loud" statements.<BR>It is clear that the author is very familiar with the NBA. I believe that sports fans will enjoy the book a lot. That said the plot of the story is just so weird. The main character, Slo-Mo, is extrememly naive, to the point of absurity. Also, the story turns kind of dark at the end. Overall, though, a fun read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the untrue autobiography of Slo Mo, a boy who grew up underground in a cave as part of a strict religious cult where he was not aloud to journey to or mix with the outside world. Being extremely tall meant he was really unsuited to cave life and the elders and other cult members didn't really want him around so he was often punished and spent his time shovelling human waste. <P>One day the septic pipes clogged up and the cult was forced to allow an outsider plumber in to repair them. Upon seeing the freakishly tall Slo the plumber handed him a basketball and wanted to see him dunk it. Having never seen one before Slo couldn't perform this task but hid the basketball from the man so he could play with it later to relieve boredom. He becomes a crack shot and when the plumber returns to fix the pipe again he knows he can make some serious cash off of Slo and since the cult doesn't really like Slo they have no problem with him going and playing basketball for a hefty commission on his payments. <P>Slo isn't that up to date with the world so this book is sort of a Forrest Gump joins the NBA type thing. His naivety is sometimes stretched beyond plausible limits in some cases but it does help the book flow along. You don't have to follow the NBA (I don't) to enjoy this great book. If you don't take it too seriously you'll really enjoy this light, fun read.</span>

                    <span>A hillarious story of nieviety in the NBA. This young man has no idea about anything but somehow manages to make it through. I'd say it should be made into a movie, but that wouldn't do the story justice. A must read.</span>
