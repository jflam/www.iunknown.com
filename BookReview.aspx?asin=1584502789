                    <span>I suppose this book would be good for those wanting at best a cursory glance at the world of AI (I applaud the author for the breadth of material covered), but for those looking for any practical grounding into AI, this book falls sadly short. There are examples in each chapter, but it seems that what theory is explained is just barely enough to get you by to understand them. <P>I though the book would be more in-depth. Plus there are several annoying math slip-ups.</span>

                    <span>This is a basic overview of AI programming with a focus on applications. I commend the author for his efforts, but still recommend AI Game Programming Wisdom instead.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed working through this text, but not without some re-visiting of my calculus classes and trigonometry brush-ups.<BR>All in all a very good book, and also a great Graduate level reference for the inner workings of actual Artificial Intelligence algorithms.<BR>If you are well prepared, this book is to the point, and well worth the read. Prepare for a visit to College-level Physics theorems, as many algorithms given require a working knowledge of the advanced principles of the science.<P>Hope this helps-</span>

                    <span>Re the comments below, I contact the publisher on the Internet and ask if they had a erratum sheet. In less than a day, a copy was sent to me, and they also have those sheets onsite for most of their publications. Additionally, a second edition was released in October which corrected the identifiable errors. A class act in my opinion.</span>
