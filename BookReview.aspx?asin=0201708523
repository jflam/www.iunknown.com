                    <span>The difficult thing about this book for me is that I do hope that I can avoid C# all of my life and C# and C++ are given about equal time throughout this book.  As the author points out on page 561, "C# is a wonderful language, but it often leaves you wondering if you can do more, and when you discover that you have reached the limits of the language, you realize it is time to get back to C++."  Haven't we had enough of Visual Basic, and Java?  Now C#?  Why not C++?  Why do we have to wade through explanations for both C# and C++ on every subject.  If we spent as much time on a real language like C++ as we have spent over the years becoming multilingual we could be C++ masters.  I always remember that, other things being equal, faster is better.  And I have never seen any other language except Assembler come close to the speed of execution of C and C++.  This book would be better if it were two different books - one addressing C++ only and one addressing any other would-be language.<p>In the Summary of Chapter 7, Mr. Grimes states that "All in all, C++ is the language for .NET development, and I hope that you, like me, will recover from a brief flirtation with other .NET languages and return to the best language for the job: C++."  <p>In Chapter 8, Application Development, Mr. Grimes elects to disregard his own advice and gives every single example in C#. How quickly hope for a return to sanity was dashed!</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of both the DevelopMentor series (from Addison Wesley) and Richard Grimes' previous books, so I was very anxious to read this book. It was all the more disappointing, then, that I didn't particularly like it.<p>Mr. Grimes' previous books were very straight-forward and task-oriented. I'm constantly lending my copies to other programmer's to reference how to implement something in C++/COM. This book is not task-oriented (not that there's anything wrong with that). However, it didn't really work for me as a theory-oriented book either. Often, it seems to dive down into obscure detail on some feature that I didn't feel had been adaquately introduced. I would have preferred shedding some detail on some of the more obscure topics in favor of more complete examples.<p>I managed to make myself read the first 500 pages or so (always thinking that things would become better in the next chapter), but it was like pulling teeth. Finally, I set it aside and moved onto a different book (the excellent "Essential ADO.Net").</span>

                    <span>This is a gem of a book that is packed with insights not readily found elsewhere. Chapter 3 ('Context & Remoting') perfectly distills the subject in about 90 pages with clear code snippets. Chapter 2 on the FCL was well done (over 120 pages) with good code examples. The chapters on VS (IDE) was not extraordinary but acceptable. The frosting of the book was Chapter 7 on Managed C++, quote "It is time to return to my true love, C++". Ditto.</span>

                    <span>The book really comes from the perspective of a Win32/C++ developer.  I would not recommend this book, unless you have come from this background, or really want to understand some of the internals of .Net (and are really willing to spend some time in it).  It also only really covers Visual C# and Visual C++.Net (managed and unmanaged).<br>   Overall it is a quality book that offers a lot of insight into the world of .Net.  It requires one to read it a few times through to really get the details as Grimes has a tendency to dig deep into details that may not make sense at the time.<br>   The organization is fair but could use a lot of work as the chapter layout seems a little disjointed.  There could also be many more examples in the book.  The book provides an adequate number of examples, but could use more.<br>   The first few chapters really spend a lot of time digging into the framework.  Many times Grimes leads one deep down a path (such as boxing and unboxing) and others he refers to another chapter later (such as exception handling etc).   It's a decent overview of .Net but requires one to read it over a few times.  Many times it delves into the inner workings of .Net that might not be easy to grasp the first time through.  <br>   The second chapter starts looking at the framework classes, and gives a healthy overview of .Net's offering.  Chapter 3 gets into .Net remoting and context.  Overall I think chapter 2 and 3 are probably the best of the book.<br>    Chapter four concerns itself with COM interop and COM+.  This chapter is a good overview of what was done before and how it works in .Net.  It is a necessary chapter, but I for one kinda glossed over it.  The price of interop tends to be fairly high and to be avoided wherever possible.  I think this is a great chapter, though, as I am sure I will need to do this at some point and this will be a good reference.<br>     Chapters 5 and 6 concern themselves with Visual Studio .Net and how to build applications.  Pretty good chapters, especially if you have not become familiar with the IDE yet.  The section on tools and external tools are very important.  <br>     Chapter 7 is all about Visual C++.Net (managed and unmanaged).  I think this is really a highlight as there are not many good books on Visual C++.Net.  Grimes does an excellent job of describing the enhancements to Visual C++ and some features that have been widely ignored (ATL Server and Visual C++ unmanaged).<br>     Chapter 8 provides an excellent overview of application development.  Unfortunately the book does not cover ADO.Net or ASP.Net, but it makes up for it by covering many tricky areas of development like localization, and logging mechanisms.<br>     Chapter 9 covers debugging.  I wish this chapter was actually longer, but It does a good job of showing debugging techniques for .Net.  This chapter is an absolute must read for any developer, as debugging techniques can not be over stressed.              <br>    Overall I think the book is very detailed and it should be in any serious developer's library.  This is definitely not a beginer's book and does not cover many aspects of .Net development that are almost essential.  Windows Forms, Remoting are covered lightly but really almost requires a book in and of itself to describe it correctly.  I recommend this book, but be careful to do a self evaluation before you dive in.  I have seen many senior developers read this book and not understand any of it.  It is very clear about it's target audience being of a Visual C++ background, and it is not lying.  I think it provides the best book for introducing those developers into .Net.  Hope you enjoy this book, too. -- Reviewed by Mathew U.</span>

                    <span>Updated Review:<br>After a year of programming real world projects with .NET, I had to change my opinion on this book. As the author acknowledges, there is ALOT of existing C++ code and libraries. Trying to port existing code or using Interop techniques is not always the best solution. I'm glad to have a reference to Managed C++ that helps me compile C++ solutions to .NET(I would like to see a tiny bit more on mixed mode, c runtime linking, and C++ idioms that Just Don't Work). I still believe this is not the simplest book for learning C#, but those books have become a dime a dozen. This book is one you'll be glad if you need to using existing software.<br>Original Review:<br>Ok, I'm a C++ developer that has a hard time stomaching what MS has done to my beloved language. However, I am very interested in the .NET initiative( and C# ) and wanted to get the perspective of a C++ expert, especially one with a COM background. I read this book and found it quite good, except for the examples in "Managed C++"( in which there were many ). Granted, I was warned, but seeing C++ twisted like that reminded me of Bilbo's line ...butter scraped over too much bread... . The "Managed C++" examples were truly distracting. The author had to explain why the plumbing overhead, we learned to detest in COM, now exists in every line of code in "Managed C++"( my words, not his ).</span>
