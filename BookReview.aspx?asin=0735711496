                <span id="Label1">If you're looking for a book to help you climb the Flash learning curve, this is not it. If you need help navigating the Flash interface or learning how Flash's tools work, do not buy this book. Nonetheless, if you have anything to do with multimedia design in general and Flash as a tool in particular, do not hesitate to buy <I>Flash deConstruction: The Process, Design, and ActionScript of Juxt Interactive</I>.<p>The owners and designers of Juxt Interactive, one of the best Flash design studios in the world, have taken the time to craft a book that succeeds on two levels. First, the book is a prime example, from cover to cover, of innovative and inspired design. Each page, image, section, and sidebar is thoughtfully laid out and concisely written.<p>Second, and unique to this book, we are given a peek behind the curtain to see how large Flash projects are handled in a multidesigner environment. Example scripts, tutorials, and how-tos based on experience make for fast learning and worthy reading. Many examples are taken from real-world projects, and there are chapters devoted to such important topics as Flash content management, innovative ActionScript navigation, and the Juxt Interactive process. Sprinkled throughout are interviews with top Flash designers, a list that reads like a Who's Who of Web design: Hillman Curtis, Fred Sharples, Josh Olm, Glenn Thomas.<p>There are no flaws or drawbacks to this book save that it isn't for the beginning Flash user, but even that isn't entirely true. All beginning Flash users ought to have this book, even if they may have trouble understanding it--the images, interviews, and examples are inspiring and exciting. From all viewpoints--design, aesthetics, layout, and instruction--<I>Flash deConstruction</I> transcends the software and medium it discusses and exemplifies the quintessential book on design. <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>This is one of those cases where the fluff and hype outweighs the content. Had I checked out the sites desconstructed in this book before ordering it, I would not have purchased this book. I was not impressed by the design and coding, and I found their attempts at deconstruction rather shallow. Several key flash files were omitted from the books' download page also.</span>

                    <span>Aside from starting a small Internet adventure and shooting it to world wide fame in just a hand full of years, the guys at Juxt Interactive have written a book chock full of wonder-us delights. Though they claim the primary role of their Flash deConstruction book is to look at ActionScript, anyone buying this book will get far more than they bargained for.<p>Juxt demonstrate their processes of design and workflow in approaching real world application development. A look behind the scenes into their infamous Juxt Interactive site, with a tutorials in how they implement their design, and script of key sections of the site, is a real eye-opener to anyone who owns a copy of Macromedia Flash.<br> <br>One of the great things about Flash deConstruction is the fact that many of the real world projects  contain what Juxt describe as 'hacks'. These 'hacks' detail problems they have found with ActionScript when implementing projects on different platforms and gives detailed pointers how to overcome them.  In my opinion this is what separates Flash deConstruction from the rest. How many other ActionScript books tell you about the development<br>glitches you are liable face?<p>Although this book, with the design fused in Juxt's innovative way, has a section for beginners, you need to have a decent working knowledge of ActionScript to get the best from it. It is a book of techniques for the developer to use and build upon, not a promo about Juxt.</span>

                    <span>I am always interested in studio process books. It's good to learn from the real pros that are out there everyday doing and living what we all are trying to learn. I think that this book is well designed, very informative and highly articulate. Juxt has done some amazing work, and learning from their process and hearing about what goes into large scale, fun, interactive web sites was interesting. I recommend this book to other designers I know.</span>

                    <span>For an art type of site and to show creativity it is very good.  My interests are commerical applications and it isn't good.  They go to some depth on their business processes but their processes aren't optimized.  Probably better business processes than most design companies and wonderful that they described them.   Serious creative talent there.  I wasn't impressed with their portfolio of sites but my portfolio is worse.  You get what comes in the door and that rarely shows your potential.  We would really have a feast if Terra Incognita or Second Story Interactive would write such a book!<p>- jim</span>

                    <span>This review is ment to be a warning for people who consider purchasing this book. DO NOT get deceived by few positive reviews!!!<br>Actually, THERE IS NO DECONSTRUCTION OF JUXT WEB SITE in this book. At least not in the fashion that I expected.<br>I expected, besides other things, specific instructions on how to build the movie clip architecture of the ENTIRE Juxt site (nesting symbols of different content within another and distributing them on the site with tips why it is done so) and the COMPLETE action script of Juxt web site.<br>Instead of that the hole book is general talk and description of Juxt`s process of creating web content. The author gives you only the IDEA of how something should be done not the specific steps of building Juxt`s web site.<p>Let me illustrate my thoughts for you with few lines of text from within the book (it`s maybe not right but I feel readers diserve to know what they can expect):<br>"4.3.1 ORGANIZING ARTWORK IN FLASH<br>Now that the file (or artwork) is in Flash, it needs to be further organized. The symbols are moved to levels, and the movie clip structure is ready to be built. It`s much easier to break apart a symbol than to make a group into a symbol after it has already been tweened several times.<br>Freehand, as drawing tool, deals with objects. In contrast, Flash deals with more wet, or editable, elements. We use the term "wet" because these objects are like wet paint on canvas that can be painted on and rubbed off. Freehand objects come into Flash as groups of wet elements. The groups might deceivingly feel like a symbol, but they aren`t. They lack the small crosshairs that indicate the center point of a symbol. It is important for you to get used to this to avoid creating unnecessarily heavy files.<br>It`s good to get into the habit of creating symbols out of everything and moving elements to their appropriate layers for animation once the Freehand file has been imported to Flash."<p>Believe it or not, this is ALL you get on building the structure of the Juxt site in Flash!!! You are left alone with file imported from Freehand and you are expected to create the symbols and movie clip stucture of the site by your self. Plus the action script, of course! Action scripting of some isolated elements is described, and having only that as help, you are supposed to figure out how to script the entire site. Hello!!! I am not a beginner, but I am not sure what is the best and most efficient way of doing that!!! I purchased this book hoping it would show me how to do it!!! What a mistake!!!<br>On top of that, there is no FINAL ".fla" file(s) of the site provided for download, with movie clips in place and action scripts assigned to them, for sake of deconstructing the site by your self.<br>What did I pay for?! To read how the author is proud to have Hillman Curtis for his friend?!<br>By the way, more than 70 pages is wasted on interviews and transitions between chapters!<br>This book is the worst purchase I have ever made!!!<br>You might try with "Macromedia Flash: Art, Design + Function", by Mighty Assembly.</span>
