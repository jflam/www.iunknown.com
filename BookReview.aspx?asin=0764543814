                    <span>M. Kay is  savvy fellow, very careful formulation with excellent examples. I recommend though buying the XSLT 2.0 book, as the present XSLT 1.0 is essentially included in the latter. Every chapter has: "Whats new in XSLT 2.0" so the XSLT 1.0 programmer gets more look-ahead info. NB XSLT 2.0 runs till now only on the author's parser. Although I had no previous XML experience this book was the most helpful of the three other books I bought. Its the only one I still use as reference. There was no question that the book could not answer until now.</span>

                    <span>This book has helped me out of a jam more often than I care to remember. If you are stuck with programming with XSLT, you should take a good look at this title. It guides you through the language and even provides you with insight into how processers actually process XSLT templates. A good book, but only for experienced programmers.</span>

                    <span>XSLT is almost the official programming language of XML - in fact, it uses XML as its representation. Given the importance of XML, XSLT is going to be a critical tool at anyone's workbench sooner or later.<p>XSLT is also a hard language to work with. That's where this book comes in. When I needed to write an XML-based application of my own - one involving DocBook, HTML, and XSLT itself - XSLT was the natural choice, though a daunting one. Using only this book, I managed to pick up the XSLT programming model (hint: there is almost no such thing as flow of control) and get the job done. Kay's discussions of XML name spaces and other basics were part of what got the job done right.<p>This book should be on the shelf of every serious XML programmer. I don't know whether a programming beginner would get the full value from it, but experienced readers will find it dense, well-organized, and above all helpful.</span>

                    <span>Great book. Can't believe how much work was put into it. Seems to have a usefull, concise example for every problem I've encountered.  Useful as a reference as well. I wish more technology books were like this. Book is appropriate for beginners and experts alike!</span>

                    <span>This book is a challenge, but once you understand the fundamentals, the beauty of XSLT starts to emerge. All of the recursion, immutable variables, predicates, and patterns start to make sense. After a week with Kay's book, you'll be pretty durn handy with just about any XSLT-related task (except maybe complex grouping... give that two weeks). XSLT is a fascinating language, and for a thorough understanding of it I suggest Kay's book, above all others.</span>
