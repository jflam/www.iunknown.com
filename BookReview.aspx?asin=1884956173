                <span id="Label1">Forget everything you've heard about the travails of the freelance writer. In <I>Damn! Why Didn't I Write That?</I>, Marc McCutcheon contends that "you can learn the trade and begin making a respectable income much faster than most people think possible." To illustrate, McCutcheon lists 17 pages of bestselling titles, including <I>Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance</I> (150,000 copies sold) and <I>Golfing</I>, a humor book (525,000 copies sold). McCutcheon himself wrote a few well-chosen titles and claims to be "easily support[ing] a family of four, working part-time." How? Think <I>niche</I>, says McCutcheon. Think <I>backlist</I>. Think about perennially hot topics like dieting/weight loss, relationships, parenting, health, low-fat cooking, sex, spirituality, money/finances, cats, career and leadership, and computer and Internet. McCutcheon is quite helpful about things like contract negotiation, agents, proposals, and promotion. He also confers a real can-do attitude on his readers. "In the corporate world," he says, "tall, beautiful people rule. In the writing world, even Yoda can climb to the top of the success ladder." <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent resource for people who want to write their own book, but are not sure where to start.  The author gives many examples of successful books written by ordinary people.  He provides a "great idea book checklist" to follow and speaks to the reader encouraging anyone with dedication and determination to write their own book. 
<br />
<br />The book provides assurance, has questions to answer, gives successful checklists, supplies websites to visit for more research and a "grab bag of tricks" to promote great writing.
<br />
<br />I refer to this book almost daily for direction in writing my book and have outlined it for easier reference.  That's why I highly recommend it and gave it 5 stars.

                    <span>McCutcheon opens by claiming that "nonfiction books are the most likely to bring the largest rewards for the least amount of struggle and heartache." He then gives eighteen pages of book titles (far from boring to read!) - but why? As a selection of the hundreds of titles that have sold from 50,000 all the way up to 83,000,000 copies. And yes, CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE SOUL is on the list, but so are many titles that may surprise you. 
<br />
<br />This book got me excited. While reading it, I jotted ten nonfiction book ideas inside the front cover. The author has given the tools to take each of these ideas through the crucible and decide whether they're truly worth developing. 
<br />
<br />McCutcheon also tells you how and where to research your nonfiction projects and how to put rejection into perspective. He gives his own personable slant on those familiar big issues: how to write a query letter and a book proposal; how to negotiate for better royalties; understanding the author's bundle of rights. 
<br />
<br />Author of the classic best-seller ROGET'S SUPER THESAURUS and other nonfiction titles, McCutcheon is a high school dropout with the writer's lifestyle we all dream of. I guess that says it all about this book!</span>

                    <span>I had an idea buzzing around for a non-fiction book, I wound up buying "Damn! Why Didn't I Write That?" as the title grabbed my interest and I needed more information on writing proposals.
<br />
<br />I stayed up all night reading this engaging book.  The next day I began hashing my proposal out, following the wisdom and guidance found in the book.  Six months later and I've just been offered a contract from McGraw Hill! I think that speaks volumes!
<br />
<br />This book will inspire you!  Marc McCutcheon offers all the tools, motivation, and information needed to get started.  It's no mystery that you have to add the "ideas",the writing talent, and the perserverance, but the rest of what you need, will be found in the pages of "Damn! Why Didn't I Write That?" 
<br />
<br />Thank you Marc McCutcheon for producing such a quality book!

                    <span>Sometimes a book is great because it's well-written, organized, clear, and/or comical. This book is all of the above. But in my opinion, what sets it apart from all the other good books on writing is Marc McCutcheon's personal touch. <p>This is one of those books where the author's personality really shines through. I loved it from the minute I skimmed through it in the bookstore, and straight through the 3 or 4 times I've gone back to it over the last few years. The reason that it's the only writing book I've bought instead of just borrowed from the library is simple: Marc McCutcheon has achieved the essence of what I would one day like to achieve for myself.<p>You might be wondering what that is, exactly. It's the freedom that comes from working for no one but yourself, and living your life in a constant state of creative expression. All you have to do to see that Marc McCutcheon has reached this point is read his dedication:<p>"To all the kids on Hamilton Street who have drawn me away from the confines of my office to play whiffleball, break up fights, shoot hoops, check out salamanders,...apply bandages, build snow forts,...and provide endless excuses not to work when I didn't want to anyway..."<p>This is the kind of life that being a successful writer can  afford. There are many books that show you how to get there, but this is the only one that also reminds you why you're doing it in the first place. When you're swimming in rejection slips, uncertainty, and more than your fair share of disappointments, what you need most is NOT a how-to book, but something to remind you what you're working towards. This book is that something.</span>
