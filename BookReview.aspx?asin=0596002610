                    <span>This is a well written book that provides an easy and fast start to using the UNIX X Windows & terminal shells, printing, using the Internet for web browsing, email and file transfers. The use of examples, screenshots and illustrations together with a step by step list of commands to do throughout the book prove to be a very valuable feature for the UNIX beginners so they could better understand what should happen and appear when they click or type something. It also covers problems and errors a user might encounter and gives some useful information why they got that error and how to deal with them.
<br />
<br />This book is not too comprehensive, you will be able to start with using UNIX quickly and easily but on the other hand, the descriptions for most of that commands are too brief to be able to do advance things, thus you still need to consult the documentations and man pages of the command you will encounter.
<br />
<br />This is a good first book for UNIX beginners. New UNIX Users should go deeper by reading other inroductory books like Sams Teach Yourself UNIX in 24 Hours or The Complete Idiot's Guide to Unix. Experienced UNIX users would find this book too basic and should read a more advance book for systems administrators like the Essential System Administration and UNIX System Administration Handbook.</span>

                    <span>This book elucidates the fundamentals of using the UNIX operating system by using examples - and it is not too comprehensive, which means you will be able to stark working with the OS quickly and easily. 
<br />
<br />On the one hand, this book teaches how to use the UNIX operating system in a brief manner from the ground up. Although if you
<br />are used to UNIX OS, this book provides some useful tips that
<br />you may not be aware of. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you are a truly experienced UNIX OS user, you will most likely find this book too basic and uninteresting.
<br />It does not cover advanced topics but focuses on the fundamentals from a user's perspective. 
<br />
<br />Thus, this book is definitely for you if:
<br />
<br />1) You have not worked with the UNIX OS before
<br />2) You have only novice experiences from the OS
<br />
<br />The book is NOT for you if you:
<br />
<br />1) Have used UNIX for quite a long time
<br />2) Want to elaborate on more advanced topics
<br />3) Want low-level explanations of how an OS works 
<br />   (e.g., processes, kernels, data structures)
<br />

                    <span>Every UNIX Admin Group Should Have One... To loan to users<p>You are perceived to be a UNIX guru. People regularly come to you with great deference to ask you for advice and help. Someone apologizes for his/her lack of knowledge for the third or fourth time and asks about a basic command. You grab a thin book from the shelf. "Take a look at this book", you say, "You probably know most of what's in here, but maybe some of it will help you. Just give it back when you're done." With relief he/she clutches the book and thanks you several times. He/she almost bumps into your neighbor's cubicle wall as he/she walks away reading this book... <p>Buy this thin book and this may happen to you. Well, the first part you'll have to manage yourself, but no self-styled UNIX novice has been ungrateful to borrow this book. Anyone seen as a guru will find that this book will pay for itself as a time-saving loaner. <p>I must say, that perception plays a great deal in this case. The book is amazingly thin and sports an O'Reilly animal on the cover. Anyone in corporate IT will associate this book with the O'Reilly books the in-house experts have on their shelves. I have another book that I feel may be a bit better for UNIX beginners, but given a choice, people will grab this one. <p>One can't help but notice sections that are probably unnecessary for computer-savvy UNIX beginners, such as "working with a mouse" and the description of a directory structure. But these sections are brief and clear and the authors move on quickly to UNIX-specific items such as "Redirecting I/O".<p>I definitely prefer "UNIX: Visual QuickStart Guide" from Peachpit Press, so I'm compelled to give this book less than a perfect score. I must admit that people who borrow this book seem much more enthusiastic when they borrow it than when they return it. But they also seem ready to move on to heavier books, and that's well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>I remember my first look at a UNIX terminal. A little '%' with a flashing cursor. I don't remember how long I stared at the little prompt not knowing what to do. Then I pressed some keys and things became much worse.<p>Now I'm surfing around dizzying hierarchies of file structures, able to get to the root and back again and make and edit text files. I bite my thumb at weird commands that used to seem as comprehensible as medieval scholasticism.<p>I wouldn't have been able to accomplish any of that without this little book that's as intimidating as a ladybug.<p>The most difficult part of the book, in fact, is actually finding a UNIX environment to log into. If you're not at a University or a fairly good-sized corporation (and if you don't know UNIX they won't let you near a command line anyway) you may wonder where to go. Linux, in most cases, is a good substitute; or check the web for free UNIX (or Linux) shell accounts. Combine your new-found account with this book and UNIX will no longer be a gut-wrenching incomprehensible monolith.<p>Don't consider yourself an expert, however, and don't stop there. UNIX may not be as difficult as some like to think it is, but it's also not easily mastered. Take this book, digest it, then move on to bigger tomes (there is no shortage of tomes in the land of UNIX, as you will find).<p>Lastly, the owl on the cover rules.</span>
