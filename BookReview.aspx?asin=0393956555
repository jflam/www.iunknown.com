                    <span>I liked this book. It details the history of the USA in pretty sensible chronological order from 1900 to 1920, with good description of the events during those momentous decades.  It is pretty balanced, and should not offend anyone with biases one way or the other.  The author is an authority on the two dominating figures of those decades, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, and I read his dual study, The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, on October 7, 1995, with much appreciation.  Cooper writes in a clear style, and even tho this book read like a college textbook, hey, it is fun to read a college textbook on such interesting subjects as this book deals with.  A good and worthwhile book.</span>

                    <span>I was required to read this book (it reads like a textbook)for an American history class I was taking in my sophomore year, and I love the book. Cooper integrated various facets (political, social, military, and cultural history) into a solid and interesting read. It can be a little dense at times, but it is a very good beginning for those interested in twentieth-century American history.</span>

                    <span>I had to read this book for my US History,1914-1945 class, and I have to admit, I am quite pleased with it. It was well-organized and gives an in-depth look into the Roosevelt and Wilson presidencies. This book is a must for anyone interested in 20th-century American history.</span>

                    <span>These years at the beginning of the century seemed so intense.  A good read when reviewing this century that (almost) was.  The author tries to write a comprehensive look at everything that was happening in the US at  the time, from fashion to politics.  However, make no mistake, the author's  favorite topic and more richly covered is: politics.  There are references  at the end on the amazing amount of literary work of the era, which is  tantamount.  All in all, a very good introductory to that time and age, and  a very good starting point for a researcher in the world of those years.</span>
