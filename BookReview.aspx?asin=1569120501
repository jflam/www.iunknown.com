                    <span>Arguably one of the best coaching books on the market. This is a must read for anyone involved in marketing, public relations and management. The book really simplifies the process of coaching, something that can be quite diffiucult.</span>

                    <span>I was a top-rated executive coach in a Fortune 100 company. But reading and applying the wisdom and knowledge contained in this book has taken me to an entirely new, more powerful level of coaching business owners and executives and helping them achieve dramatic breakthroughs in amazingly short periods of time.  It's clear that these authors are master practitioners of their craft.  Theirs is not an academic or psychological approach to coaching, but rather a powerful, pragmatic set of insights, experiences and applications.  Whether you are thinking about coaching as a profession, or trying to improve your management and mentoring skills, this is the single best resource you can find.</span>

                    <span>I purchased many books on coaching when I was first considering the option of starting a coaching practice.  Fortunately I happened upon Coach Anyone.  This was the ONLY book that provided practical, how to step-by-step approaches to not only setting up a coaching practice, but to actually coach others.  Coach Anyone is the one book that I use continually, a true reference manual, with impactful, easy to follow tools that keep the coach and the client on track to achieving the desired outcomes.
<br />
<br />Written in practical and easy-to-follow language, the authors provide a roadmap that is powerful, yet simple.  There are many forms and checklists that support the coach such as the DreamMakers/DreamBrakers, and also challenge the coach to self-assessment in order to avoid mediocity.
<br />
<br />Coach Anyone is the best investment you can make.  The model, which can be applied to all aspects of your business and personal life, is sure to pay for the book many times over!</span>

                    <span>I've participated in all types of trainings and read a tremendous amount of literature on making a difference in organizations and businesses.  This book by far is one of the most practical in the application of many of those theoretical models.  It takes the mystery out of affecting change and "out of the box" results whether you have been coaching for decades or you are a new entry into the world of coaching.  Bravo and thank you for a seemingly simple roadmap that offers an unending depth of work for a lifetime career!</span>
