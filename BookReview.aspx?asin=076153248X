                    <span>This books is great for girl coaches from new to experienced.  It is for the coach who wants to learn how to coach basketball the right way. I am a coach and have three daughters and I would hope that any coach that teaches any of my children would have at least a working knowledge of the information in this book. It is an easy read and a good reference book.</span>

                    <span>The author expertly guides the reader through the entire coaching process.  Not only the sport and the basics, but also the the most important parts of coaching youths: planning, preperation and Parents!  I am also impressed with the in-depth examination of the differences of coaching girls and boys.  I definately recommend this book for new coaches of girls.</span>

                    <span>This a very good basketball book for new, aspiring or even coaches with 2-3 years experience ... even if, like me, you are just a parent looking for ways to help your daughter take it to the next level. ***Especially good for fathers or male coaches looking for insights into how to be most effective with the young, female player!*** If for nothing else, the chapter highlighting the differences between the youth male and female players made this purchase well worth the price. Now I know how to better "reach" girls in *any* sport -- especially my own. The other coaching tips and drills were icing on the cake. Let me know if the author ever publishes a sequel!</span>
