                    <span>As a first read on web services this was not bad. It is a passable reference as well.<p>The book starts with a summary of the technology and a brief overview of the component technologies - XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI - and how it fits into the .Net framework .A large section is devoted to .Net Remoting followed by more on consuming and updating web services and clients. There are ample examples of the design and coding of simple to moderately complex web services. While I noticed the usual mistakes and typos in a book that was probably rushed to meet demand for .Net literature, none were overly distracting or confusing. The book concludes with some case studies and more examples. <p>While it is not really necessary to have a knowledge of C#, the reader should have a good grounding in object oriented programming languages and some knowledge of COM or RPC wouldn't hurt. I see this technology as the successor to COM (the fact that Don Box was involved in the SOAP standard definition reinforces that idea), perhaps even finally living up to the dream of plugable code modules. I could see using this as the text for teaching a web services class. P-)</span>

                    <span>This book is not organized at all. There are allot of code examples but they are totally useless. Since one can not really run any of the examples because they are not organized into applications and one can't really follow which part does what and which part goes after which. And I have successful 10 years of experience developing web and client service apps. So this book was waste of time and money for me.</span>

                    <span>If you want to get the understanding of .NET Remoting, this is the right book.<p>XML Web Services with ASP .NET are quite easy to build, so, this book doesn't looses too much time on it.<p>If you want to learn only ASP .NET web services then you can try other titles that covers only this.</span>

                    <span>To really understand Web Services and Remoting requires hard work, but if you take the time and don't give up, this book will give you a solid understanding of the subjects, especially Remoting. Not only the basics but also advanced techniques. I've read the book a couple of times, together with Professional ASP.NET Web Services, and written the code examples, so now I'm doing my own projects with both techniques and feeling confident with what I'm doing. But it takes time!</span>
