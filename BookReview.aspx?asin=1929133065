                    <span>Against the advice of the other reviewers, I bought this book anyway. I'm square in the middle of the intended audience: I want to build a custom bike from the ground up, and I have extensive mechanical skills. In fact, I learned more from the most recent issue of "Hot Bike" than from this amateurish piece.<br>It's shallow, disorganized, and frustrating because it could have been so much more. In addition, it badly needed someone to proofread and edit it. Remus has to be the king of the run-on sentence. Don't waste your money.</span>

                    <span>This book has very little to do with building choppers other than assembling a motorcycle on a purchased prefab frame.  What a waste of money.  Remus should write a book describing how to turn an existing bike into a chopper.  This book is little more than a list of suppliers.  All of this info can be found in a $... magazine without spending $... for the book.<p>My advice... Keep on Looking!!</span>

                    <span>If your looking for a book to teach you how to assemble a kit bike...this is it.  It doesn't offer much help for someone looking to build their own bike from the ground up.</span>

                    <span>If youre planning to BUILD a chopper from scratch, this is a pretty useless book. But if you are planning to buy all the parts over the counter and assemble a kitbike by yourself this book will probably be helpfull. It contains some good information (for the novice) about rake and trail, but that information is availible from almost all choppershops on the net today. This is only MY opinion, im sure there are some people out there that find this book helpfull!</span>
