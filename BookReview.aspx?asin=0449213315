                    <span>I am very familiar with the pain of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia for I suffered from these maladies for several decades. During those years of suffering I underwent treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, and hypnotherapists. I took various prescribed medications and read many books, of which this was one of the best, but still I experienced little relief. And then, after I began taking a daily supplement of chelated magnesium for another seemingly-unrelated ailment, for the first time I began experiencing significant diminishment of anxiety. There seemed to be no explanation for this wonderful change until the publication in 2003 of the book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean. In her wonderful book Dr. Dean reveals that a major cause of anxiety and panic attacks is deficiency of magnesium and that magnesium deficiency is quite common in the U.S. Therefore, I beg all sufferers of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia to purchase and read The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean and try the magnesium supplementation which she recommends. It may change your life as has changed mine.</span>

                    <span>Lucinda has a radio add that offers a free tape. I called for the free tape, & was subjected to the most high pressure sales attempt I've experienced in quite some time. They practically insisted I go ahead & order the whole program under a "money back if unsatisfied in 30 days" attempt. I told them 3 times & quite clearly NO! They hung up on me... <p>To my way of thinking, the majority of her callers are already depressed and/or anxious, and to treat them this way is unethical. What if I was suicidal (I'm not)? This could have been the final straw. When you market to depressed people, this needs to be considered.<p>Based on this, I'll never read another one of her books. This one was a complete waste of my hard earned $$, & I'll not buy, read, or recomend any of her products.</span>

                    <span>I was impressed with this books approach to working through anxiety or panic attacks. But, I didn't find anything of noteworty exception to distinguish it from other books dealing with this subject. <p>It is also a fairly 'quick' read....which, for anyone dealing with this type of issue, really should spend a little more time on. I felt like it was best served as an 'airport read; it's style just didn't lend itself to the thorough examination one struggling with panic attacks should invest in. <p>Again, well-written and easy to understand...but I don't see this as a 'life-altering' read for anyone dealing with these issues.</span>

                    <span>In June, of this year I had become very stressed and I had a lot of things going on and started to feel dizzy, an almost out of control feeling. I just couldn't explain or understand what was happening to me.  I kept going to the doctor he told me to go see a therapist, I have too much ANXIETY,he said.  I had this book on the shelf, this was not the first time he told me I suffer from Panic Attacks but I wouldn't believe it, I thought to myself there has to be something wrong with me, not me I don't have ANXIETY, not PANIC ATTACKs, me? Well as I started reading this book all the feelings I had were THE PANIC ATTACKS.  I continued to read the book and it was like a miracle for me, it takes a little time, but so worth it, I know what I have and I work through it, this is a good book I wish I read it earlier...</span>
