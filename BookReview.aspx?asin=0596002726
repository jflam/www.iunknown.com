                <span id="Label1">The Linux operating system has made a lot of progress in the past few years, and <I>Running Linux</I> has progressed right along with it to remain the single best general-purpose book for curious computer users who want to install, use, and enjoy Linux. The team of authors present a text that's simultaneously detailed and readable. Coupled with an inquisitive and capable reader, that's a recipe for success with the world's most popular open-source operating system. This new edition adds coverage of the GNOME desktop environment, the Apache/MySQL/PHP server suite, and the Postfix mail transfer daemon. It also covers core capabilities and behaviors of Linux through kernel version 2.4. There's better coverage of network security (including firewalling and ADSL link configuration), and coverage of how to set up audio-related hardware and software.<p>Perhaps best of all, this book conveys a sense of the "Linux attitude" as the authors see it. Linux, they say, is largely about experimentation, research, trial and error, and participation in a community. This comes in welcome contrast to books that focus on recipes (follow these steps to accomplish A; do these things to make your system do B). Though the authors of this book provide lots of how-to information, it's always presented with an eye toward further exploration. In explaining how to build the kernel, for example, the authors provide six concise steps as a reference, but then go on for several pages about designing makefiles and how to deal with error messages. This book's a treat. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Assuming you know next to nothing about Linux, socially and historically as well as technically, this book teaches you what you need to know to make the operating system meet your desktop and server computing requirements. Coverage takes you from preparing to install Linux (in a multi-OS environment if you wish), continues through system administration and the most useful applications (like TeX and Internet clients), and proceeds to cover programming tools and server daemons (notably Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The coverage is mostly generic, but peculiarities of Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian get attention, too.</span>

                    <span>The world of Linux is pretty deep and rather disorganized, so as a newbie I was overwhelmed by the amount of resources that will sure help me in the end but did not give me a clue where to start.  After all, Linux is not Windows, which all the dummies in the world use.
<br />
<br />Running Linux was a very helpful resource for me to get started with almost anything that I know about Linux today.  Of course it is impossible for a book like this to be truely comprehensive, and nobody should expect that.  It is very hard to go for breadth and depth at the same time when there are hundreds of distributions that are different enough that they have their own how-to's.
<br />
<br />What really helped me in this book were rather shallow yet to-the-point references to more in-depth resources about a vast array of essential subjects on how to maintain a Linux box.  In the end, you *have* to read distribution- or tool-specific README's or how-to's, so getting the pointers to where I *should* look for really made it easy for me to explore more.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book if you wish to go into Linux and already know a bit about how computers work.</span>

                    <span>This book is supposed to serve as a reference, something you keep on your desk and refer to when you want to tweak the desktop settings, make an adjustment to your sound setup, change your boot manager, etc, etc.
<br />
<br />It's not.  Avoid this book.  It is incomplete and shallow.  If you need help with your Linux installation, get "Linux in a Nutshell" from the same publisher.  It is a vastly superior book.  Or just Google for a solution to your question/problem - your chances of success are much better.
<br />
<br />The money that I spent on this book was pretty much wasted.</span>

                    <span>I bought this along with "Linux in a Nutshell" when I decided to look into Linux. I've got a 20+ year background with Unix. I'm sorry to say I never found this book useful! Between my experience and the modern Linux installers (I've got Mandrake) this book is redundant. That hasn't been true for the Nutshell book.
<br />
<br />I gave this book two stars because for beginners it offers a decent introduction to Linux.</span>

                    <span>If you already know a little bit of Unix or Linux or other Unix-variants, this book is way too "introductory" for you.  It covers stuff like how to login and run ls, cp and mv.  As another example, see the section on backing your computer.  It talks about using find and tar, but nothing about dump and restore  and backup strategies.<p>Overall, too much scratching the surface and not enough in depth information for real Unix users.</span>

                    <span>Not good at all. This book will teach you to do things but not figure out anything, it will teach you to do the most basic tasks but leave you dry when it comes to actually doing anything not covered in the book. Consider this book giving a man a fish instead of teaching him to fish.</span>
