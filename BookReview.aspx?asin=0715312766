                    <span>One of the very few books I bought just by looking at the cover (don't you agree the cover is very appealing?) and I'm glad I'm not disappointed (and in hard cover too!), the images are bright and colorful, less focus on flora but it's okay, the techniques are fairly the same. <P>Much of the technical info can be found in basic photography books but Paul has emphasized certain points for macro work so it can actually double up as one to a certain extent. In fact the chapters are laid out much like a basic photography book.<P>Simple to understand and yet detailed enough to keep advanced amateurs reading but to really duplicate the efforts one really needs to have the luck and patience. In fact some of the images are micro techniques already.<P>Unfortunately it did not really enhanced my knowledge on macro (I give 5 stars for the superb presentation and usefulness to a beginner). If you want more technical info on macro like mixing accessories, then read up John Shaw's Closeups in Nature instead. This book is more focused on flora and is also excellent in its own right.</span>

                    <span>If many hold that John Shaw's Closeups in Nature is the Bible, then this is an excellent compendium to it!<P>I found that this book is pegged at the intermmediate to advanced amateur level. The pictorials are lush and the explanation simple, yet giving reference to the more complicated concepts which was what I was looking for.<P>The pictures are an inspiration - making me want to go out and put in practice what I have learnt. This is the ultimate test of success in any book. Some excellent examples of this come from Art Wolfe, John Fielding, George Lepp ...<P>If I were asked to name 2 books that top my list (and I have bought or looked through almost all there is - since this is my passion!) which speak of macro, I would name John Shaw's and this one!</span>

                    <span>Every page of this book offers good advice and useful tips. While Mr. Davies uses Nikon and Olympus equipment his techniques and suggestions are not brand specific. I could easily identify the equivalent equipment offered by the manufacturer I prefer (Pentax). Before I even finished this book I had tried several of the techniques Mr. Davies demonstrates. I was surprised at how simple taking sharp macro images could be, even using equipment I already had on hand, when following the steps in this book. It is the best specialized photography book I have read in some time. It is now on my reference shelf next to Clive Nichols' Photographing Plants & Gardens.</span>
