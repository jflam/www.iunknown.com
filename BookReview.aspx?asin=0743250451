                    <span>LESTER BANGS: One thing that really f-cked me up at Creem was that I got caught up in the whole idea that Lester Bangs was this thing, this idea. I call it Hunter Thompsonism. It's when you pay more attention to your image than you do to your work. And that destroys your writing. Hunter Thompson's never gonna do anything good again as long as he lives. I don't think anybody really cares about his drug habits.
<br />
<br />JIM DEROGATIS: I just finished The Great Shark Hunt.
<br />
<br />LESTER BANGS: What did you think of it?
<br />
<br />JIM DEROGATIS: It was good but he pats himself on the back a lot. He's become a stereotype, a cliche.
<br />
<br />I vas dere, Chahlie, when THE GREAT SHARK HUNT reared its semi-redundant head in 1980. It was a pathetic water-treading stopgap excretion. Thompson started spiraling down the self-congratulatory toilet in 1975 when he said: "I am one of the best writers currently using the English language as both a musical instrument and a political weapon." He also proceeded to bore everyone to tears with his indefatigible ham-fisted portentousness. Given a choice between 2 recent literary corpses, I value Hunter far more than I value Saul Bellow. Even though Hunter quickly degenerated into showbiz buttholery.

                    </div>
                    <span>The best thing about The Great Shark Hunt is that you can pick it up, turn to any page with a subheading, and start reading.  An array of various published articles and personal opinions, the book is a compilation of Thompson's work previously aired in the likes of Rolling Stone and (the now defunct) Scanlon's magazines. 
<br />	There are not many journalistic stones left unturned by the author, the fields covered here including sport, travel, politics, music and the San Francisco hippy movement.     
<br />	For those not yet familiar with the term `gonzo,' it is a style of reporting pioneered by Hunter that has the author living and breathing the piece and experiencing the subject first hand.  His second book Hell's Angels is the best example of this, when he spent a year hanging out with, and was eventually almost beaten to death by, the notorious biker gangs of 60s northern California.  
<br />	Divided into three sections, The Great Shark Hunt builds with articles from his early days as Air Force newspaper reporter, then onto his period of sports coverage, to his venomous obsession with the abominable Richard Nixon.  No expletive is left unused, and anyone foolish enough to piss Dr Thompson off is given the pen-lashing of a lifetime.
<br />	Nixon's Watergate scandal in particular strikes a chord with the author, and for anyone wishing to discover more on the incident, this is a good place to get educated in humorous, digestible chunks.
<br />	For me, the section of articles written during his tour of South America held particular fondness, as I'm travelling through there this summer.  As well as his travelogue that he sent back to the magazine, also published in this section are his private letters to his editor at the time.  His growing intolerance to the food, climate and people of the area are first-class travel writing: 
<br />
<br />Lima, Peru.
<br />"Things are not good here, my man.  I'm unable to leave this goddamn room on account of I'm too weak from some kind of jungle fever.  The street outside is full of thugs drunk on pisco, and some bastard has been throwing rocks at my window all night.  If I hadn't sold my pistol I'd go down there now and crack off a few rounds at his feet."
<br />
<br />Drugs (including alcohol) were a major influence on Thompson's life, something that he nearly always used to a positive effect.  This is not to say he was unhealthy or any kind of deadbeat (in fact he swam every morning for hours at a time, in whatever part of the world he happened to be), but rather gained him an even wider cult following.   Thompson maintained that it was ok to do drugs, but there was a definite divide between use and abuse.
<br />Also brought into the fray here are Oscar Acosta and Ralph Steadman.  If you have read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (if you haven't, you should) or seen the film, Acosta (played in the movie by Academy Award winner Benecio Del Toro) is the character alongside Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp), described as a `300-pound Samoan' by Thompson.
<br />This was a profile Acosta was furious with, and subsequently led to an attempt to sue Hunter for defamation of character.  Acosta hung out with a bad crowd and vanished - presumed murdered - some time after the book was released.  
<br />Ralph Steadman is the artist behind the sketches in Las Vegas and many of Thompson's subsequent publications.  His art is as way out as Hunter's writing, a twisted collage of grotesque caricatures and splash art.  
<br />One hilarious recount of Thompson and Steadman's drunken attempt at vandalizing a yacht is absolutely hysterical and leads to Steadman fleeing back to his native England vowing never to see Thompson again.
<br />The Great Shark Hunt is not the easiest of reads in parts, mainly due to the fact that Thompson goes so deep into the politics of the time, and name-checks those involved in specific incidents, that it is impossible to stay with the drift.  My advice would be to skim-read the middle, political section articles until you find a piece that interests you.   
<br />The style is always there though: passionate, scathing and down-to-earth.  His suicide earlier this year was met with a reaction of sadness, but then people remembered that the man was not only as mad as they come, but was also a legend that lived life to the full and on the edge.
<br />Ralph Steadman sums it up nicely: "He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment. I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable."
<br />The man may be gone, but his books are plentiful and in shops and libraries worldwide.  The Great Shark Hunt is an excellent place to start for those new to his work, and an essential publication for those in the know.  
<br />Please, please do yourself a favour.

                    <span>With the passing of HST, there is sure to be a surge in sales of his many books.  The Great Shark Hunt is a good start for anyone.
<br />
<br />Thompson wrote plenty, and for plenty of sources.  Shark Hunt collects various articles and opinion pieces that he penned for obscure publications like Scanlon's to the pieces for Rolling Stone to the Sports pieces he contributed here and there.
<br />
<br />The result is the 'gonzo' style--insertion of the author into a story, often with copious amounts of chemicals, though this is often not the focus, as some may believe.  
<br />
<br />There is a straightforward honesty and curiosity in Thompson's writing that is still fresh.  He is able to look at everything from politics to the hippie movement to the Super Bowl with his irreverant eye, and an excellent bull radar.  He talks with people from all ends of the spectrum, and we often get lucid pictures of the way things are amidst the alcohol, the acid, and the general gonzo antics.  
<br />
<br />A good book to pick up, beginning, middle, or end.  Probably the best compilation, as it covers the formative gonzo years from the mid-60s on, covering plenty of Nixon action, hippies, sports, more politics, etc, etc.
<br />
<br />Thompson was an excellent writer, deserving of far more credit than the literary establishment is likely give him even in death.</span>

                    <span>I know Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the "Great Work" for which he will be forever remembered and deservedly so. However, Shark Hunt is a kind of Penguin Reader of the Essential HST and as such is the indespensable survey of the glory years. 
<br />
<br />I read this six or eight times between the ages of 19 and 22. If you have a brain ripe for warping, crack this one some time. </span>

                    <span>The Great Shark Hunt is one of the best books I have ever read. Thompson's writing style and political beliefs just makes you never let go. He's so unpredictable; you'll be very impressed as you start to enjoy the way he writes. The metaphors and phrases that he uses make him so much more unique then any other writer. This book is very straight forward but keeps you hooked. When he describes our former presidents, it really makes you think about a lot of things. He makes you wish that you could be different, and have a different attitude towards everything. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys foul language and funny stories about one of the craziest men in the United States. His stories are just outrageous and unbelievable, but it's all true. This book has inspired me to just take life by the horns and never look back. So whenever your in a book store look around and check out this book, you may like it or you may not, but it wouldn't hurt to spice things up a bit and take a crazy trip into Hunter S. Thompson's head. I sure enjoyed the trip, you should too.</span>
