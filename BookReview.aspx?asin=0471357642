                <span id="Label1">There are no two ways about it with Jack Trout. Either you've got a product or service that you can say is different, or you don't have much at all. In today's global marketplace and at its lightning-fast rate of change, there's no point in inventing and presenting a product only to sit back and hope that consumers everywhere will discover its greatness. It's not simply about what you or your product can do, it's about what you do differently from everyone else. Coauthors Trout and Steve Rivkin say it all in their no-holds-barred title, <I>Differentiate or Die</I>.<p>  A disciple of the marketing guru Rosser Reeves, who introduced the concept of the "unique selling proposition," Trout relays his vision of what can help you differentiate in blunt, tell-it-like-it-is prose. First he breaks the bad news that product quality, advertising creativity, price advantage, and breadth of product line are rarely successful ways to differentiate your business. Consumers expect the best quality, he says; they don't think it's a bonus. In the same vein, your competitor can slash prices just as quickly as you. After dismissing these common marketing techniques as futile, Trout concentrates on which differentiating ideas will set you apart from the pack: Being first (and staying there), owning a discernible attribute, having a heritage, becoming the preference of a particular consumer group, or even being the most recent arrival in a product arena are just some of these useful differentiates. Though the book's fast and quippy narrative style may leave some readers looking for more substance behind his adamant assertions, Trout's recommendations act as inspirational spurts of energy. A slim manual packed with punchy points, <I>Differentiate or Die</I> won't take you long to read but could make a lasting--you guessed it--difference to the success of your business. <i>--S.&nbsp;Ketchum</i></span>

                    <span>Differentiate or Die is a great book providing that you haven't read prior books written by Jack Trout - Marketing Warfare, Positioning, and The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing to name just a few. I really loved the book, because I really to enjoy reading Trout's work, but I must admit - it was a little repititive. It is worth the read - do yourself a favor if you don't think you are up-to-date with the term differentiation and are not aware of the outcomes of companies which do and don't have it (you could probably have a pretty good guess by the title though!).<P>What stood the hair on the back of my neck up was when Trout and Rivkin put down the 'you must differentiate' professor of all time - Michael Porter - in the 2nd page of the Preface. Allow me to quote - "Harvard's Michael Porter, for example, does talk about the need for a unique position, but he never offers much help on how to be unique. Instead, he talks about strategic continuity, deepening strategic position, and minimizing trade-offs. And he talks to any competitor who will pay his fee. Nothing different." This got me going. This really got my veins pumping in unison with my heart which suddenly seemed to be beating faster than ever. And yes, it was only the second page.... So, despite the fact that it was kind of similar to previous written books, and used basically the same examples - I read on.<P>I learned about the concept of the USP, and how the choice we have now is different from the choice we would have had many years ago. I learned about many things that aren't really a differentiating idea - for example - creativity, price, bredth of line. Following that Trout explains things that are differentiating steps - attribute ownership, leadership, heritage, hotness - etc. Thats the basic outline of the book.<P>All in all though, an interesting book to read - that really has woken me up to realize the fact that we must be different in this day and age. Ohhh, and also - another thing that I did like was some of the stats that they used. I wish they'd say according to who - or state a source. But anyway - I really think it's interesting. Have a read - you'll know what I mean.<P>Cheers, Vaughan</span>

                    <span>Trout's book builds on Rosser Reeves' premise in his 1961 book REALITY IN ADVERTISING about the unique selling proposition. (Trout acknowledges this and dedicates the book to Reeves.) Trout's book essentially is Reeve's Trout's thesis is basically Reeves's but with new examples. That makes for not a lot of startling revelations here. In short chapters, Trout distinguishes differentiating factors (such as being first, leadership, market specialty) from stuff that falls outside of such factors, like creativity, price, and quality. Trout makes the argument that fast growth can be a wicked distraction and get in the way of successful differentiation. But while he trots out some examples of this (ESPN's rollout of other cable offerings, for example), there's nothing here that makes a compelling case about why fast growth and differentiation can't go hand in hand. Fast growth can be a distraction from any aspect in business; the trick is to figure out how to manage it. That's not something that you'll get here.</span>

                    <span>I read this book as research for my undergraduate dissertation. It is a really good light read, easy to understand with interesting and funny examples. I particularly like the fact that it is not too academic, its more of a practical understanding of the need for differentiation and the way companies have achieved (or not) differentiation. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject area. It is a light, enjoyable read.</span>

                    <span>Even though Jack Trout has tried to illustrate his theory by many diverse examples, moslty those examples have been obvious.

                    <span>This book is largely a restatement of Trout (and Ries) previous assertions that brands have to stand out, get noticed in a world cluttered with brands. That's fine. Where this book goes wrong is when it flogs the old idea of having to have a unique selling proposition or 'competitive advantage'. This is a tiny part of real world marketing and competition.<P>Most brands are highly similar to competitor brands, or with differences too subtle for buyers to care about. And much of competition is about staying similar to competitors.<P>Yet without being perceived to be much different brands still survive and even thrive. Consumers aren't looking for different, they are looking for a brand they know is good (enough). They have lives ! The marketing battle is to get into the consideration set.<P>Like other brands this book sells because many people have heard of Jack Trout and because it doesn't say anything different. If it was really different from other marketing books/magazines and told marketers something different from the accepted gospel it wouldn't sell so well.</span>
