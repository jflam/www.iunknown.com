                    </div>
                    <span>First, I agree with the many reviewers here regarding being amazed at the many factual errors in this book. (Any halfway decent knowledgable golf fan could have edited this in one sitting.)  Irwin, Casper, Tiger, Ballesteros, Faldo etc. all had their records misrepresented in the pages (i.e. both Faldo and Seve had identical records on the PGA tour, which is 9 wins if you count their British Open wins, or 6 wins if you count only American wins. Johnny claims that Faldo had the better record.) Also, in his section on the best of today's players, he of course talks of Tiger, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Mike Weir, even Sergio Garcia and David Duval (??), but neglects to talk about Vijah Singh !!  That was an annoying ommission that I couldn't understand.  But all in all, if you can somehow ignore these amateurish mistakes, this is an interesting golf book from a former Hall of Famer turned great announcer who isn't afraid to give his opinion.  He gives a good argument as to why Tiger will NOT break Jack's record of 18 majors, and that might be worth the price of the book.  He also gives a decent analysis of the best dozen golfers he's ever seen up close (from Jack to Lee to Seve to Lanny), and THAT might also be worth the price of the book. And he gives a good analysis of the best golf courses he's played (and why Shinnecock is even better than Pebble Beach.) And he also has a good chapter on chocking, and names names (i.e. Tom Kite, Mark Calcaveccia, Greg Norman, Hale Irwin, Seve Ballesteros, even Lee Trevino.)  I liked the book a lot, and if not for the stupid factual errors (and ommission of Vijah) would have given it 5 stars.   </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>An interesting read, and precislely the kind of from-the-hip commentary you would expect from Miller.  But the book is also an editorial mess.  Sloppy, sloppy sloppy.  Aside from a variety of sentences with missing words, the book at one point reports that Hal Sutton played a Ryder Cup match against himself! Mickelson's career earnings are variously reported at "$23 million" and "roughly $25 million" and the citations come only 10 pages apart from each other. How hard is that to get right? 
<br />
<br />Miller also repeatedly contradicts himself.  In an early chapter he calls Woods "the best player the world has ever seen."  Later he says of Nicklaus, "I remain firm in my belief that he is the best who ever lived."   Which is it?  By the way, still later Miller lists "the five greatest players who ever lived," and Woods is not included.  
<br />
<br />It's fine to shoot from the hip, but in the context of a book, where you have time go back and edit, there is no excuse for such a shoddy display.  Plus, how much credence can you give to a writer who thoughtlessly contradicts his own strongly-stated opinions and doesn't take the care to fix sloppy errors prior to publication?  It shows a lack of the regard for the reader.  
<br />
<br />I can only imagine the harsh criticism Miller would dish out to a golfer who conducted himself in such an unprofessional manner.  It seems the sign of an unhealthily inflated ego to take pride in doling out no-holds-barred criticism of others, while holding oneself to the most meager standards.  
<br />
<br />He labels his "friend" Jay Don Blake a "mediocre" player and suggests he really isn't trying hard and is taking advantage of the Tour's exemption system at the expense of hungier, more deserving players.  He no doubt considers that admirable straight talking.  But he takes huge offense to minor comments made at his own expense.  Miller relates how Azinger once called him a big "moron," and then later playfully recanted, saying he had been misquoted and had really called Miller a big "Mormon."  Miller is greatly offended by this, calling it "blasphemy" and a "joke about my religion."  How is playfully refering to a Mormon as a Mormon either blasphemy or degrading to Mormonism?
<br />
<br />Miller has tons of interesting things to say about golf and golfers, but giving your readers a book with numerous errors and irreconcilable contradictions is arrogant and shoddy.  One can't help but wonder whether there may be lots of other unstated errors underlying the opinions he offers.  Does his ego get in the way of his ability to hold his own work up to the same strict standards he unhesitatingly (and insensitively) applies to his own peers?

                    </div>
                    <span>Miller exudes his passion for the game and his creative touch with it.  I really enjoy his uncanniness to give titles and such that add such fun to golf advocates, e.g. calling Seve "Golf's Greatest High-Wire Act" or likening playing Faldo to a python slowly squeezing the life out of its victim.
<br />
<br />His passion pours forth in opinion after opinion about courses, players (notice Arnie not included), rules, junior golf, etc.  His concern over such as Tiger's swearing after a bad shot is admirable, and his overall enthusiasm for other players is refreshing.  
<br />
<br />He was a terrific champion, and relates much of the foundation coming from his father, and his thoughts on parents applying it to their children.
<br />
<br />A great read which is not diminished at all by a few overlooked editing mistakes.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>What good is a golf book that you can't believe what you are reading? Prior to this golf book I didn't realize the extent of how utterly full of hot air and of himself Johnny appears to be. One outright false statement in the book, on I believe page 224, states how Johnny won the San Francisco City Amateur Championship, the biggest amateur tournament in the country. False, he never won the tournament. I'm sure he laments not winning the tournament of his hometown, but that does not change the fact that he didn't win the tournament. Why he feels the need to fabricate titles is something he should do some sole searching for. Golf is afterall as much or more about truthfullness and honesty as it is any other aspect of the game.
<br /> 
<br /> Johnny also states that Tiger Woods has back problems and that back injuries are the "dirty little secret of the PGA Tour". The problem with this statement is that I recently heard Tiger say in an interview, that he has never had back pain except for when he grew four inches when he was 16-years-old. Elsewhere in the book when talking about conditioning, he stated that Billy Casper would only shake hands with his fingers and not his hand, because he claims Billy would not grip anything harder than his golf club for fear of throwing his body out of balance. Come on now, who opens Billy's pickle jars for him? Another secton of the book that stood out was how Johnny was telling how great a golf broadcaster he is. He gives a whole new meaning to the saying, "you've got to be cocky to be good". Even the title of the book, "I Call the Shots", suggests he is full of himself.
<br /> 
<br /> My comments are derived from reading about 20-25 pages of the book at the bookstore. I can only imagine how long my review would have been if I had read more. The book should have been placed in the fiction section.</span>

                    <span>Miller rates a par for the book (if that's damning by faint praise, so be it) but the ghost writer, editor, and publisher should get a DQ (disqualified) for the effort. The misprints, factual errors, bad grammar, and typos detract to the point of cancelling out anything good Miller says. I wanted to like this book because Miller himself is so likeable and his TV commentary is so good,but thanks to the poor production value it's as hard to enjoy as a triple bogey. For instance,two questions: did Seve win three times on the PGA tour(pg 202)or six times(pg 203)? And how do you hit a ball with the clubshaft perpendicular to the ground? To do that, it would have to be dangling from your hands like a plumb bob. Maybe Johnny can demonstrate that during the rain delay at the British Open.</span>
