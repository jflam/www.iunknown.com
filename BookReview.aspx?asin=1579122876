                    <span>I picked up this book a few months ago... If your interested in the grave sites of celebrities, or famous people in general... I highly recommend this book... Has very interesting bio's on some of Hollywood's most famous entertainers and in some cases grave site pics too... Also has bio's on famous criminals, sports athletes, writers, etc etc etc... Also lists if the person was cremated, or buried which is very helpful... And in most cases offers detailed directions to the cemetery where the notable is buried... There are two thing's I'd like to see more of in future editions of this book... And that is more grave site pics and more photo's of the people in the book... But all and all its a very good book and well put together too...</span>

                    <span>I've been interested in the gravesites of the famous and infaamous for a long time and I've often been disappointed that I've not been able to find such sites. But, what Tod Benoit has compiled is absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure how he did it, but he provides exact step-by-step instructions to going to the cemeteries, and then the actual gravesites, of these folks. <P>It may be true, as other reviewers have pointed out that there is an occasional lapse when Tod discusses the biographical info of each person, but I think that's to be expected when you're talking about the bio's of 500+ people. Anyway, I certainly found no alarming errors in that regard.<P>Besides, I bought the book so that I could find famous graves and, in the regard, the book is without equal. I can't say enough about it. It's really cool, he's done a great job in a subject that should've been covered many years ago. You will dig it too, I'm sure.</span>

                    <span>Just received the book from Amazon today, and while I enjoyed the Intro section, I was very disappointed after reading the first entry, Kurt Cobain. I then started to skip around and found more errors in other entries. I also find it hard to believe it left out Layne Staley, who died in 2002. I can kind of overlook the book being too narrow and a hardcover (which translates as pretty heavy to hold while reading and impossible to take along on trips) but easily verifiable mistakes on well-known people concern me as to how accurate the info is on the rest of the people.<P>Also, as someone who spends a lot of time photographing cemetery statuary, I was pretty disappointed there weren't more pictures in the book. The book was reasonably priced, especially for a hardcover, but I'd have been happy to have paid more for it if it had contained more pictures. I hope if the author compiles the other several hundred sites he mentions he's researched that he include pictures and make it a paperback; that would be enough to entice me to take a chance on purchasing it, after reading the current book.<P>Just a few of the mistakes noted:<P>Major mistakes in Kurt Cobain's entry: 1) he did not have 50 Rohypnol's in his system during the Rome incident; the report from the Italian doctor and the news reports containing his comments clearly show the doctor stating that there was no evidence to show he took that many and that it was clearly an accident; 2) Courtney did not check Kurt into Exodus rehab; she left for CA several days before Kurt did and he checked himself in; 3) the Vanity Fair article didn't accuse Courtney of taking heroin, Courtney admitted it during the interview with VF; 4) Kurt wasn't depressed prior to his death; he gave numerous interviews stating he was the happiest he'd ever been, that his chronic stomach pain had been taken care of, and his own lawyer (who also said on tape that Kurt was not depressed) and Courtney both admit Kurt was filling for divorce; 5) when Kurt's body was discovered he was easily recognizable as his face was not destroyed; they fingerprinted him as part of routine procedure, not to identify him.<P>Major mistake in Errol Flynn's entry: Flynn died of a heart attack, brought on by his excessive lifestyle wearing his body down, while in Canada. He was selling his boat, the Zaca, and had just completed the sale, said he didn't feel well and went to lie down. That's in no way a dubious circumstance and it's well documented how and where he died.<P>Mistake in James Dean's entry: 1) Dean bought the Porsche he died in the day before he shot his last scene for Giant (see Bio/Timeline at http://www.jamesdean.com/index2.php).</span>

                    <span>I came across this wonderful book while 'googling' on a name of a newly met acquaintance. I enjoy books very much, though generally read novels/fiction/literature from Booker, Pulitzer, or National Book Award lists. I was captivated by the praise for this one book, so much so that the original google search was lost while reading through accolades for _Where Are They Buried?_ After surrendering to the advice of others to read this one, I now encourage others to pick this book up. <P>Well worth the praise it is! While I don't feign an interest in cemeteries or resting places, this book is much more than that. The synopses of the hundreds (literally 450+) of people included in this book are fascinating, educational, and remarkable. Thus far, I've not found the book to lack any noteworthy soul I've looked up. It is truly as enlightening as it is engaging. It's an education in famous folk: I had no idea I knew so little about so many commonly known personalities until I read this book. The author, Tod Benoit, doesn't just focus on where the person is buried and how they died (though these particulars too are included in detail), but provides witty and insightful summaries of their lives (e.g., why they are included in the book in the first place). Mr. Benoit has not only done his research but he is clever, has style, and writes with a sometimes droll/sometimes dry humor that is very appealing. The writing is erudite; Mr. Benoit writes as eloquently about artists and authors such as Michelangelo, Truman Capote, Robert Frost, Salvador Dali, Margaret Mitchell, and Charles Schultz as he does about famous sportsmen, rock /music stars, and movie greats like Humphrey Bogart, Carole Lombard, Elvis, Duane Allman, John Coltrane, River Phoenix and Bette Davis. (There are so many people included in this one book; I'm surprised that the publisher didn't separate this out into multiple volumes.) In many of the synopses, I felt I was treated to a candid, perceptive discourse on what it was about these personalities that made them famous. <P>Mr. Benoit also shares with the reader tips on finding and visiting those to whom you'd like to pay your respects. (The preface and closing remarks emphasize the genuine compassion and dedication to the subject that the author feels toward his subject and that he willingly shares his knowledge with the reader.) I have learned so much from just flipping through the book and reading wherever the page opens; though it should be noted that the book is indexed by both name and geography so that you can find all the famous people buried in your own backyard! <P>I highly recommend this book. It's fun, interesting, and full of things you won't learn from reading the Booker or Pulitzer Prize winners (or even from reading People magazine). It makes a great gift too - it can hold the attention of all sorts and from all walks of life. Everyone has a little curiosity about the famous and infamous!</span>

                    <span>This book is packed with information and it's the most interesting read I've found in a long time. The author makes it easy to find all the cemeteries and exact grave locations of hundreds of celebrities, plus his sardonic wit and amusing writing style entertain. Tod has really gone out of his way to unearth (no pun intended) many nuggets of our heroes - and anti heroes! I love it!!</span>
