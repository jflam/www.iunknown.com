                    <span>This book is only useful for those who want a very basic introduction to the Mahabharata, and only want to invest a minimum of time doing so. This book will give the reader the basic outline of the Plot, but does not dwelve into the many important Philosophical portions of the Epic, and the "outside stories". The book is well written. I like the style of R.K. Narayan. As an introduction this book is much better than that of Buck, not only because Narayan is a better writer, but because he had a better knowledge of the Epic, Hinduism and Sanskrit Literature. <p>If you must get an introduction, I recommend the one by C.V. Narasimhan, which based on selected verses, and  brings the reader much closer to the Mahabharata.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for those who do not know Mahabharat story. The reason it is good for the beginners is that it is concise and flows through the subject quickly. So it would be a good book for new readers who can quickly get a sort of overview of Mahabharat.<p>If you already know Mahabharat plot and story, try and get a little advanced book.</span>

                    <span>This shortened prose version of the Mahabarata by R. K. Narayan presents the engaging adventure of the five Pandava brothers' efforts to reclaim their empire.   The story itself has nearly everything anyone could want in a good book: edge of your seat action and edge of your mind inspiration.   In addition to celebrating the Pandavas' super-human strength and feats of daring, the book also catalogs many types of human relationships: mother-child, sybling-sybling, husband(s)-wife, king-courtier, mentor-apprentice, even writer-reader.....    Long after you finish reading this book, you'll be realizing why Hindus recognize it as one of their two most sacred books---it's got everything!   And yet it rarely stoops to the level of being preachy.  (Narayan also has a shortened prose version of the other sacred Hindu book---The Ramayana.)</span>
