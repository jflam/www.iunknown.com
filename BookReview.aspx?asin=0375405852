                <span id="Label1">George Soros was once described as "the only private citizen [of the U.S.] who has his own foreign policy." In this penetrating biography, Michael Kaufman explores the multifaceted life of a man who instead describes himself as "a financial, philanthropic, and philosophical speculator."<p>  Like Intel chairman Andrew Grove, whose memoir <I>Swimming Across</I> touches on some of the same territory, Soros grew up as the scion of a Hungarian Jewish family, many of whose members did not survive the Holocaust. Inclined toward philosophy (a field in which he sometimes writes even today, though many philosophers wish he would not), Soros escaped to England, and later America, and put his sharp mind to work making a huge fortune. Not content to live a leisurely or unexamined life, Soros put more than $1 billion to use in bettering the lives of citizens of formerly totalitarian regimes--and even in hastening the end of dictatorships around the world.<p>  Former <I>New York Times</I> columnist Kaufman delivers a respectful account, closeted skeletons and all, of Soros's life and work, and his book will interest a wide range of readers. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I> </span>

                    <span>The book basically divides Soros' life into three phases:<BR>1. Childhood survival against the Nazis in Hungary during WW II<BR>2. Financial successes and philosophical failures<BR>3. Philanthropy<P>What I found puzzling is how much of the text was spent on Soros' philanthropic activities. They deserve a significant portion of the text, but well over half of the text is devoted to this. I would have been interested, for example, in seeing some experts from Soros "Burden", and trying to understand a bit better what issues Soros was trying to describe in his own book, but could not. <P>Having said all this, this was a well researched, well written, well referenced biography. This is not a trading book, and those seeking trading advice should look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>A book written in a flowing, readable style, well researched and full of information, even for one who has read Soros himself. Indeed too much was dedidicated to Soros' misguided charity but then, Soros himself would rate that as his most important activity.<P>As an observer, I came away with the portrait of a tragic figure. A man who has done what Freud termed "identification with the oppressor". Expelled from Hungary and humiliated there, the first country to received huge sums of his money was Hungary. Other countries with equally rich antisemitic pasts receieved no less. Another way explain this would be as what is termed in Anthropology, following Marcel Mause in the Spirit of the Gift, "inflicting gifts" or giving to humiliate.<P>I kept thinking while reading the book that a man who made most of his money within walking distance from Harlem should look in his own backyard for noble causes first. And talking about his own back yard, isn't it pathetic that he never gave anything to his own people?<P>And yet, the boyish smile of the man is endearing and heart warming and even heart breaking. <P>And again, the writer, a pleasure to read.A minor technical detail: he should have given his manuscript to a native Hungarian speaker to edit the spelling and also to tighten some of the explanations which refer to the lnaguage or the culture or the country. (I am just being pedantic here, I know)<P>Though not new, read it if you have not done so yet.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed. Even if you do want a book about Soros' personal life, the presentation was boring. It was doubly boring for me because I was hoping to learn something about his financial history. There is Shamefully little of that in there. Even the 1/3 of the book entitled "Making Money" was not about that. There are enough uncritical biographies written about his personal life. When is someone going to write a critical account of his financial history? That is the interesting part. There is the story. Too much about his philanthropy...this book had an agenda.</span>

                    <span>Kaufman (New York Times journalist) chronicles George Soros's life and wide-ranging accomplishments as creative hedge fund manager, destroyer of foreign currencies, innovative philanthropist, and promoter of open societies and democracy. The author traces his youth growing up in Hungary, hiding from the Nazis, taking a degree at the London School of Economics, and working in London at an initial salary of seven pounds a week. Soros departed to America at 26 for a job on Wall Street with a five-year plan to accumulate $500,000. By 1973 he left his lucrative Wall Street position to set up Soros Fund Management and attracted wealthy investors. Every $100,000 invested grew to $353 million by 1998, and the value of his Quantum Fund reached $6 billion. In the 1970s Soros commenced philanthropic activities, strongly influenced by the "open society" ideas of Karl Popper but motivated somewhat by the reduction in estate taxes. Kaufman describes the foundations and Open Society programs Soros established in Eastern Europe, China, Russia, the former Soviet republics, and the US. See also Robert Slater's Soros (CH, May'96). This biography of the remarkable life of an eclectic billionaire is recommended for public, academic, lower-division undergraduate and up, and professional library collections.</span>
