                    <span>Mention "Oregon" and the average traveler thinks of Crater Lake, the Columbia Gorge, and miles of trackless evergreen forest. The more seasoned may be familiar with Newberry Volcano, Mount Hood, and the Oregon Dunes along the Pacific coast. But there is much more, and this is the book to show it to you, give you good directions, and explain why the secenery looks the way it does. Once you read this book, even if you never get there, you will know why Oregon is the Unknown Gem of the West.<P>The writing is clear and concise, and the routes along which the reader is taken are well chosen. Photography is black and white, and this detracts a bit, but is easily overcome.<P>Oregon has more geologically recent sites of volcanism than any other state in the Lower 49, and you are directed past many of these. So for anyone into volcanoes, as I am, the book is a must. The various volcanic processes and minerals that formed thse features are excellently explained.<P>The book also addresses Oregon's many spectacular canyons, as well as its matchless seacoast, its waterfalls, and its sand dunes. Virtually unknown facts, such as the largest U.S. meteorite being known, but not found, near Port Orford, are brought to light, along with a thousand other facts of the same genre.<P>I would be remiss if I did not praise authors Hyndman and Alt, along with Mountain Press, for this fine book, and others of its kind, covering other states, mostly in the West. All are highly recommended, and will make any tourist's time more well spent and enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>A nice addition to anyone's geology library. Alt and Hyndman cover every corner of Oregon, and explain the major players in the shape of the landscape clearly and succinctly, as well as local aspects of geology. There's the added bonus of being able to jump in the car and find what they've written about as they provide regional maps, indicating formations, special interest items and more.</span>
