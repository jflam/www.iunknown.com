                    <span>It's a good book for learning the very basic things about Perl, if you are just starting with programming languages, but it's too basic for those who already are programmers in other languages such as C.
<br />Most of the book's content is covered more in-depth during the Programming Perl's first chapter.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book but its NOT for someone who is completely new to perl and programming.  This book assumes that you already have some experience programming with another language.  I finished reading this book in two weeks.  While reading I could feel for that person who is totally new to programming and is trying to understand some of the concepts that are explained.  The book has few examples and does not walk you through from step 1 each time a new concept is introduced.  It expects you to take all the knowlege from the previous chapter and carry it to the next and again to the next which I think would be pretty difficult for a person who has never programmed before to do.  For example the simplest but most important $!/usr/bin/perl.  The book only mentions this in the intro chapter and you never see it again for the remainder of the book.  My suggestion would be first to read Perl How to Program by Deitel, then Learning Perl, then the Camel.  The cookbook can wait.  It will be awhile before you will need that.</span>

                    <span>I have read some of the other reviews. I beg to differ with some who say that you must be a Unix hacker to use the book. You merely have to be a programmer. This book is great.

<br />This sentence from the book's Preface should be posted prominently on the product purchase page. "Although you don't need to know a single bit about Perl to begin reading this book, we do recommend that you already have familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, subroutines, and arrays, and the all-important 'editing a source code file with your favorite text editor.'

                    <span>I read this book a while ago although I havent played in Perl for a long time this is a great book. If your on a linux/unix based system its even better as I feel its aimed highly towards it since a lot of examples are based on *nix programs such as grep, awk. 
<br />
<br />I had experience with PHP, so learning the first few chapters were extremely easy (and even without it the text is easy going so it doesnt push you too quickly), it doesnt go over the top by trying to teach radical things like OO and also has a few commonly used Modules you can use.
<br />
<br />One good explained topic was Regular Expressions. Ive always found them hard even for a simple expression, however my understanding has greatly improved although I still consider myself a novice with it, it does get explained extremely well.
<br />
<br />Overall this is a good book, I didnt find any typos too my knowledge and all the examples that I did worked. Some of the exercises were quite hard though.</span>

                    <span>Un libro excelente para los que no conocen Perl y quieren dar sus primeros pasos en el.
<br />No diría que es un libro para programadores principiantes, sino que es para programadores medios o avanzados que nunca han visto ni programado una línea de Perl.
<br />El libro está diseñado como si fuese un tutorial paso a paso, donde va introduciendo los conceptos principales del lenguaje. Está muy bien redactado y es fácil de entender. Por supuesto, algunos puntos los pasa muy por encima, pero, teniendo en cuenta que es una gran introducción, al finalizar de leer el libro, el lector estará capacitado para adentrarse solo en el mundo de Perl.
<br />Ideal para diseñar un curso, prácticamente tenemos redactadas las clases una por una. (Los autores vuelcan su experiencia de los cursos que han dado, y los que siguen dando).
<br />Recomiendo, una vez terminado y entendido el libro, que se pase al libro del Camello (Programming Perl).
