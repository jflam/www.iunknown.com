                    <span>This book had some nice ideas in it, but as a first time coach for young swimmers, this book was not terribly helpful to me, since the whole book is geared towards coaching adult swimmers. It covers just about everything else to do with coaching, but not in terrific detail. All in all, it's ok, it has good ideas in, and is probably good for a first book for an adult coach, but you will need more.</span>

                    <span>This is NOT a useful book for coaches, although it can be helpful for people without a coaching education or a good swimming background. Unfortunately, this book lacks every form of depth and I don't understand why all the reviews until now were extremely positive. Dick Hannula was a great coach, but this isn't a great book. I guess the readers were lead by pride instead of objectivity.<BR>Coaching Swimming Successfully has an attractive title, but is somewhat misleading. While reading, you do get some new thoughts about coaching, but it will not make you a coach successfully. <BR>The book is written with a first-person narrator and would be more interesting if it wasn't, since you will get annoyed after a while by every self-glorification of the writer and his successes. Besides, it's mainly focused on the American swimming school (planning and preparation, club swimming vs. high school swimming, yard pools, etc.) and it lacks some ability for extrapolation for other swimming countries. <P>The 'Coaching Stroke Technique' part is redundant if you are a qualified coach and you still have your textbook from the course.<P>The book is easy to read, gives some new thoughts and can therefore help you coach more successfully, but it is too superficial and limited for a swimming coach.</span>

                    <span>Coaching Swimming Successfully is a great book! It is a book that you will refer to again and agian. The advice is timeless!<BR>I recommend it to all swim coaches. If you are a new coach, get it early so that you have time to truly follow some of the suggestions!<BR>This is an invaluable tool!</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book in desperation. I had tried many books on swim coaching and many were out of date, simplistic, and outright useless. In Coach Hannula's book, I found a work that was worthy of it's title. Mr. Hannula has extensive knowledge of his subject and it shows in his writing. Mr. Hannula dots the book with useful and sometimes amusing aniqudotes. This book can help beginning to advanced swimmers and coaches.</span>
