                    <span>I'm a 21 year old African American woman and I picked up this book at my campus bookstore. I started reading it and could not put it down. I had been looking for something that I could relate to and this was exactly the book. It took me through a range of emotions and eventually brought me to a better place. It was like I had lots of aunts, cousins, grandmas, and moms giving me advice. I'm buying one for all of my friends this Christmas.</span>

                    <span>A beautiful, oftentimes tear-jerking compilation of some of the most poignant personal essays of black women's triumphs over life's tragedies and the things that make them appreciate life and give them a reason for living.  This book will definitely encourage all of us to believe that things will only get better with time for no pain lasts forever if we truly believe.<p>I highly recommend it!</span>

The two essays that most stand out for me is To a Son of a Dear friend by jean Buchanan, it's the sad letter to the author's late best friend's son about growing up with his mom. I am just tryin to live Holy by Pamela Shine is about a 40 year old virgin tryin to find love. I think everyone will love this collection of essay, and relate.</span>
