                    <span>Although I do not own a copy for myself, I intended to purchase it. The pictures are wonderful and there are a myriad of products. But, while browsing through a copy at my local bookstore I realized that the items pictured where not exactly my taste. The fixtures and furnishings are definitely modern, but tend to have an extremely hard edge. I love contemporary interior design, but something a little softer, a little less abstract. If you are interested in that end of the contemporary spectrum, then go for it. If you are like me, you may be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>This book is a valuable resource like a previous reader stated if you are redoing a home, or if you want some ideas on innovative installations of materials, but being that I was thinking with a mind of an architect, when I first read this title I thought I would literally see some construction details of some of the more innovative ideas (what materials were used, what thought went behind the design, etc.). Instead, I got some pretty pictures and lots and lots of names of manufactuers, businesses, and architects. A bit disappointing, but a good book to have either way.</span>

                    <span>If you are marrying or changing the concept of your home decoration, this book should be the first guide you should be counting on. I am marrying in 5 months and when i first saw this book at my friends house, i said "ok, my house is going to be like this" And i came home and ordered this book from amazon.com. This book, you can look and inspire for the rest of your life.</span>
