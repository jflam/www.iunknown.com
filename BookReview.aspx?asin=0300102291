                    <span>Edelman uses overly complicated language to describe consciousness. He repeatedly uses abbreviations C and C'. To stand for the underlying neural process of consciousness. Furthermore, he would have us assume that consciousness itself, actually did nothing, but it is the neural substrate ( of consciousness) that does the work for consciousness. That is basically saying anger does not cause, or help in causing, me to hit someone. It was all the neuron's fault. In my opinion, Damsio's series of books does a lot better in every aspect of explaining consciousness including:
<br />1. explaining the purpose of consciousness
<br />2. why it evolved
<br />3. future implications in the scientific study of consciousness

                    <span>Don't look at the back cover! This is not a book for a lay reader unless you have the unabridged copy of Dorlans medical dictiionary.
<br />Gerald Edelman did a supper job on mapping the brain and its "residential" activities, but was very sparce with his discourse on consciousness.
<br />Gerald and his ilk are somewhat like Mr. Goodwrench: The can describe every aspect of the automobile and then forget that in order for this beautiful car to run, it needs a DRIVER!
<br />Gerald and his buddy William James will never 'quantify" the mind unless they conceed that a higher force overlays the brain and is not a microscopic "homunculus" but a macrosopic "entity" that is contiguous back the big Bang.
<br />Wider than the sky is mandatory reading for all of us who are Mind-mind and not Brain-mind scientists because it validates that we may have a chance to show that the mind is separate from the brain/body.  Gerald: The mind is not like a computer - it invented the computer!
<br />You did a good job and wider that the sky is now in my library.

                    <span>A reference conspicious in its absence is "Consciousness Explained" (1991) by Daniel Dennett.  Edelman rejects the serial-computer explanation of mind, but he agrees with Dennett that to be conscious of consciousness requires language.  Edelman's embracing of the TGNS puts him more in the camp of Paul Churchland, who also is not mentioned, but who advances a parellel-processing view that Edeleman is close to holding.  Dawkins, in "The Ancestor's Tale," points out how memes called out very subtle differences in the genes that make brains and subjected these brain differences to natural selection.  What roles do memes have in producing consciousness at both levels?  If you found this book helpful, do yourself a favor and read Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea."  </span>

                    <span>Exploring the mechanisms of being human inevitably leads us to the mind and its workings.  Gerard Edelman has engaged in making those discovery journeys for many years.  His stack of published works must stand many centimetres in height.  Yet he has been able to distil all that accumulated material into a brief, highly informative book well designed for the general public.  That is a stupendous task, yet he's achieved it admirably in this excellent book.  In this presentation of human consciousness, Edelman sweeps away much of the mystery.  There have been many books attempting to explain our perception of the world.  A number of them actually result in a more obscuring than enlightening presentation.  Not so in Edelman's case.
<br />
<br />Using an Emily Dickinson poem to establish the framework for his thesis, the author declares that consciousness resides in the physical brain.  We must understand how that developed, Edelman asserts.  The answer, of course, lies in the evolutionary development of the human brain and how that led to our version of consciousness.  He stresses that we must not discount the cognitive abilities of other animals.  Theirs hasn't achieved the complexity of the human mind, but there are countless hints from theirs as to how ours works.  The development of human consciousness is a process, not something granted to us.  Much of the process occurs in early life, but whether increasing or growing impaired with age, the process never ceases.  Given that condition, Edelman rejects the proposition that the brain is a computer, a structure far too rigid to be equated with our form of consciousness.
<br />
<br />Building maps of the brain has been one of science's lengthy undertakings.  As details of where brain functions are located emerged, understanding their links to the body grew.  Edelman is quick to point out those "areas" are dominated by identified functions, but far from limited to them.  The brain is a highly integrated signalling network - Nature's supreme multi-tasking device.  Edelman uses a shorthand term TNGS [Theory of Neuronal Group Selection] to explain the networking process.  Some shorthand is required in explaining a system of millions of cells with trillions of connections.  The appropriateness of Dickinson's aphorism becomes clear as Edelman details the operations of these extensive networks.
<br />
<br />The book is assertedly Edelman's.  While he doesn't declare that all the findings on brain science are his, neither does he acknowledge who provided the foundation for some of his insights.  References are almost all to William James, American founder of cognitive studies.  His "Bibliographic Note" is a clear compromise between a full reading list and a teasing call for further reading.  He provides an excellent Glossary, to which the new reader to this field should turn at the outset.  A number of representational diagrams are provided to enhance the text.  In all, Edelman has accomplished his intention - to describe the underpinning of human consciousness in a way we all can comprehend.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]</span>

                    <span>This book is either unremarkable or remarkable, depending on wether you have read Edelmans previous work or not. It is unremarkable to those familiar with Edelmans work because this is nothing more than a short and very simple summary of the theories explained more throughly in his earlier books. It is quite remarkable in that Edelman manages to condense all of his ideas (spanning the neural darwinism trilogy, Bright air, Brilliant Fire, and the superb A Universe of Consicousness) in 120 or so pages. For those who simply do not have the time to work over those other books, this is a grat option, not to mention for the lay reader, and those unfamiliar with neuroscience or philosophy. However, the ideas in question all manage to be more appealing and convincing when read in these other books. I do recomend this book strongly.
<br />
<br />Now, inasmuch as this book is just a compendium of Edelmans theories, I will not comment on them, since I did that on reviews of his older books. The theory of neuronal group selection (Darwinian processes in neuronal plasticity), and his theory of consicousness (the remembered present and the dynamic core) are important players in the consciousness debate, without a doubt. 
<br />
<br />But Edelman also tries to do some philosophizing. This is something scientists studying consciousness tend to do often on their newer books. And it is also the part of these books that open new points for discussion in the consciousness literature. And Nobel prize or not, he does not do it well. Let me explain.
<br />
<br />Edelman tries to advance a bridging principle to his neuronal theory of consicousness. That is, he tries to explain the precise relationship of neural states (N) to consicous states (C). And unfortunately it all amounts to a very Searleian property dualism. N entails C, but it is not identical to it, and further, C is and cannot be causal, while N can. Edelman is right in that this is a closed version of materialism. No non-physical properties are claimed to exist. But the relationship is still probematical. 
<br />
<br />First, there is the very real threat of epiphenomenalism. Edelman denies this, but he is after all claiming that C states are actually epiphenomenal, by his definition. N is not, but C is not identical to N, but entailed by it. Now if liquidity is entailed by the structure of H2O for example, and it is, then it makes sense to say that liquidity itself may have a property that water does not. Liquidity may be uncausal, while water can be causal. But this claim is nonetheless false. Liquidity is causal. It makes water behave in certain ways. So, even if we grant, that if C is entailed by N, means that N can have properties that C does not, this does not guide us to claim which properties these are. That is, Edelman needs other reasons to convince us that C is not causal just because it is entailed by N, that is actually causal. C could be like liquidity. C could be causal, and entailed by N too. N could occur without it causing something that C would cause if it was present, even if C could not be present without N, which is my reading of the use of ¨entail¨. So nothing edelman says has a bearing on the causal status of C.
<br />
<br />Edelman sort-of anticipates these arguments, but only claims that the ideas ¨C can occur without N¨ , ¨C is causal ¨, are contradictory. Thay are, only if one takes as undeniable his definitions of ¨entail¨, and his ideas of the relationship of C and N. Edelman assumes he is right to prove he is right. The epiphenomenalist considerations I wrote of, are a little shaky, however. But Edelmans position falls fast when other more mysterian arguments are noted. If C is only entailed by N, but not identical to it, then it is very much logically posible that N could exist without C, and everything in the neural economy be identical. Edelman argues against this possibility, a posteriori, by pointing out that evolution made the relationship between C and N necessary. So his idea is that because N and C evolved, yhey are so related, not that because they are so related, they could have evolved. This is again assuming he is right to show he is right.
<br />
<br />One could continue endessly. What makes some N entail some C and not another? If N entails C, would a minimally and disembodied N still entail a full C? If C can be caused, why can it not cause back? Any philosoher could come up with his own objection. So in conclussion, Edelman is on the right track, but as lost as many a scientist as to how to intellegebly bridge the neural states to the conscious states. Maybe philosophers will be essential to the search for the neural bases of consicousness after all.
