                    <span>I just bought this book last night, and am half way through reading it already. It's an excellent book for the amateur to advanced photographer who hates to read lengthy dialog, but wants to learn some quick tips and tricks on how to improve their photography. Even applies to more advanced photographers - especially those who are coming off of "film" and going "digital". <p>It has tips and tricks for every aspect of digital photography -- from setting up your equipment, to taking better pics, to storing and printing them. <p>It assumes the reader has access to Photoshop Elements (as opposed to a complete version of Photoshop), which is nice. It has clear and high-quality photos to support each lesson. Most lessons are 2 pages (a couple are 4 pages), so it's a very quick and easy read. Love it!</span>

                    <span>The only thing I didn't like about this book was that the first page of the photoshop section says "This section requires familiarity with basic Photoshop Elements commands; to learn these commands see "Teach Yourself VISUALLY Restoration and Retouching with Photoshop Elements"   If you haven't read that book, this section might not make a lot of sense.   It is full of great tips, ideas that are very helpful.  It doesn't go into great depth on subject matter but is good for a beginner.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book.  I recommend it for beginners, and for mid-level digital photography enthusiasts that are having a hard time absorbing all of the technical jargon.  I have my mind so full of computer jargon that it seemed there was no place left to "file" the lingo for my somewhat serious photography hobby.  Each page has equal amounts of text AND example photos with explanation, and all IN COLOR.  I'm not sure how others feel, but I can't read a book on photography that doesn't have pictures, or where the photographs are in black and white. (unless black & white photography is the subject of course)  This gave me a new way to look at things, corrected some very big misunderstandings, and definitely made a BIG difference in the quality of my photographs.  I use a professional digital SLR, and the hints and tips in this book have been keeping me interested and busy for more than two weeks now.  You won't be disappointed!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book not knowing what to expect from it..impulse buy.  There was this book and another on Photoshop Elements 2.0 by the same author/company.  But I figured it is more important to learn to take good/great pictures first then learn how to fix any errors or adjustment in pictures.  Completing the book I am very happy of the purchase and the style it was written with color pictures step by step so you don't get lost.  In fact I'm going to buy the Photoshop Elements 2.0 from the same company because I like their five star visual learning system.  This book is not for the advanced photographer but but for the beginner to intermediate it is EXCELLENT.  Well priced too!!! :)</span>
