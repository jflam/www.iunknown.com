                    </div>
                    <span>I bought this book as easy reading for a trip to Europe, lots of trains, time to get into a no-brainer kind of account. This is the tales of two very rich, very spoiled guys who decide they will ride from London to New York and see how the other half lives.  What they give, through the efforts of a good ghost writer, Robert Uhlig, is the almost verbatim account of their  much hyped tv series for Bravo also titled the same.  Ewan moans and whines throughout the entire trip about missing his wife and family, who seem alittle dependent on daddy to make their day, while Charley Boorman  manages to find his routine of bikes and more bikes rather shallow.  These two manage to diss most every situation until they encounter people in lands where their priviledged lifestyle, bikes, and camping equipment are so far above the standards of living that it is obscene.  At the UNESCO sites of children afflicted with radiation poisoning from power sites blown up twenty years before, to the little kids of the sewers, where survival is left up to fate, the pair of Ewan and Charley finally grow up, long overdue after their mid-30s life crisis.
<br />
<br />A means to make money for two who seem to be aware they are taking advantage of the situation and complaining about how guilt ridden it makes them feel while raking in the bucks, the two should be less overt and more grateful they have the cushy lifestyles that permit them to cruise the worst roads on BMW's donated for their use.  As if it cost them any money, this is capitalism at its worst, yet McGregor makes his trip seem as if it was a world-saving event "for the kids."  Horse-pocky! </span>

                    <span>I picked up this book from the local library with an open mind, not really sure what to expect. I think this is the key in reading a new book - other reviewers here (-ve posters) may have specific expectations, and failed to accept it for what it is.
<br />
<br />I did not expect this book to move me in tears, nor do I expect a manual on adventure riding (or how to become a millionaire). I was just curious about what these 2 actors did, how they did it, and some ideas of what they had to endure along the way.
<br />
<br />I find this book easy to read, entertaining, and most of all, it has motivated me to ride a motorcycle again after 20+ years. I am enchanted by it, and may just take up long distance touring eventually.
<br />
<br />I got what I needed out of it.</span>

                    <span>I normally do not bother writing opinions. You dont know me, my outlook, or how I relate to you.. so what is my opinion worth?
<br />But after reading the slew of negative reviews I was enticed to add  my .02. This 'review' will actually be more of a scathing critique of previous feedback than a true review of the book (which I do own and read), but the book review is in there.
<br />
<br />If a person does any amount of online research, such as reading the description of this book before buying it, you will realize it is two fairly well known people taking a trip across a vast distance.  Just this fact would inform most intelligent people that an A-List actor and a well-to-do buddy (d-list actor?) would not be loading up 2 mopeds and heading into the wilds without some support.
<br />
<br />People get hung up on the description of around the world.  
<br />They said 'AROUND THE WORLD",
<br />- not 'touching every continent', 
<br />- not 'around the world by equator
<br />- not 'around the world by your definition.
<br />They said they went around the world and they did.  They took a route across the Northern Hemisphere that allowed them, with the exception of oceans, to travel by land around the world.  They even made the choice to arrive farther west to the US than they needed to.  They also chose not to stay strictly to the rail system from Eastern Russia through Manchuria.
<br />
<br />You also need to accept they will have some sort of support, and accepting they will have some level of support, it was refreshing to see that it was really only 2 Chase vehicles and a Camera-Man also on a bike.  The chase vehicles were not super-duper mega prepped uber-vehicles, they were pretty much off the shelf SUVs that also proved their worth in the environment that these travellers undertook.  If anyone has watched even one or two episodes of the current crop of reality automotive shows (overhaulin, biker build off, monster garage, american chopper, etc.) on TV, you will notice that those single 1 hour shows have WAY more technical support that these two guys had. They have a bazillion cameras, chase vehicles, and often a helicopter to boot.... all in the US, on pavement, sometimes when it rains, but often they trailer them when it gets to that point.
<br />So give these two guys some props.  Amatuers with little true MC experience, 2 chase vehicles, and a camera man.
<br />
<br />People complain about sponsored vehicles.  Petty.  
<br />Sure, they are rich, but rich does not always = willing to throw my own money down when someone else will pay.  Otherwise they would = poor.  Would any poster here choose to NOT accept corporate sponsorship?
<br />ANYONE, would accept free rides over some they had to pay for themselves.  They just had the clout to get it done. And while they wanted KTM, BMW was nice enough to pony up.  
<br />
<br />People get tired of the whining in the book...
<br />I found it refreshing.  they did not excerpt only the glossy, happy go lucky, make me appear loveable to promote my marketability, parts. They presented themselves as they were; uncomfortable, tired, haggard, testy, and a wee-bit irritable at times.  They presented themselves as people, not glamour queens.
<br />(an aside.. while I hate the show, I like that Paris Hilton and Nicole Ricthey are willing to try something embarrassing in "The Simple Life"... they certainly dont need the money either)
<br />
<br />And I guess lastly in terms of critiques, people keep commenting they thought it was going to be like (insert name of previous marathon adventure MC stories here).  Well, it wasn't.  I/We appreciate that you did not find it to be like what you thought it might be, but that is not the fault of the book.  that is YOUR fault for making an incorrect assumption.  Dont reduce your rating on the book because you were wrong.
<br />
<br />ok.. so what do I think?
<br />- I think it was a great, fun, read.
<br />- It was not a grass roots book, but as another responder listed there are a number of other resources online and in print that I will chase down now that my adventure interest is piqued.
<br />- It was not perfectly written, but that lends some credibility to the fact that it is 'their' story, not some market media mock-up to enhance their saleability.
<br />- I am looking to get back into local touring and BMW did a good thing in risking their reputation with their bikes.  I'll be considering them a lot harder despite their extra cost.
<br />- I can not wait for the American DVD release.. I ALMOST am willing to order the UK version, but not quite.
<br />
<br />* If you like reading about people taking on a challenge that 99% of the rest of the riders in the world would never even attempt, let alone accomplish (even with support), then pick up the book and enjoy their adventure. 
<br />* If you are a true 1%'r who will scoff at their nice new bikes, their support, and their complaining, then please save your money for your own adventure and come back to link to YOUR adventure so we can all read it as well.
<br />
<br />(side note.... RoadRunner Magazine [ http://www.rrmotorcycling.com/ ] is running a great storyline in their magazine about a couple who are solo'ing (supportless) around the southern hemisphere. It is also a great story to keep up on.)</span>

                    <span> This was a complete dissapointment! i am addicted to travel, i love bikes and i even liked ewen mcgregor before this. i had easy rider aspirations set aside for this book, but gave up on page 105, after not being able to tolerate any more of these two moaning gits whingeing and their unadventurous outlook towards travel.
<br /> The fact that they employed an office load of people to look after them, had state of the art gear, GPS, had contact with officials along their route as well as an accompanying team of doctor, mechanic, cameraman and producers, kind of detracts slightly from any form of real experience. This would not be the case if they had set out to make a documentary about the cultures and people of the countries they visit, however they are too consumed with themselves and their petty quarrels to really engage the reader in any sense of travel.
<br /> This was one of the worst books i have ever read! just dont bother with it. ultimately it is just a banal account of two actors on bikes, written without creativity or flair, and ewen mcgregor just keeps goin on about his stupid i-pod!
<br /> As an englishman, i would appreciate it if any foreigners would refrain from judging me and my fellow countrymen by these pampered, self obsessed, drab faux-adventurers.</span>

                    <span>I didn't read the book but am interested in doing so after watching these WONDERFUL episodes.
<br />I figured I'd read what everyone has written on this but after the first 4 of 5 dreadfully lengthy negative posts, I stopped reading.
<br />Since I actually saw the show and know what it's about, I'm just going to rely on the Obvious that I will like this book because it's the same journey as the show.
<br />You all need to stop your whining and negative talk.
<br />I'd love to do what these guys did. the adventures they had, the people they met.   Yes they did have support vehicles but they didn't ride with Charley and Ewan. They only met up at borders where entering countries may become difficult seperately.  Yes they did have people to work on their bikes when they needed it, but it wasn't anyone from their group. they were locals of the towns they were visiting.
<br />If you were on a journey like this and your bike broke down, would you just say Hmmm, I can't have it fixed or it will pamper my experience because I didn't do it myself? or would you get the bike fixed so you can get on with the trip which is the whole point. the breakdowns were just obsticles, the same as the mud holes and road conditions. THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THEIR TRIP, To experience all there is to experience in the 20,000 miles of journey they are on.
<br />
<br />For those of you who actually know what they're talking about and know what they're interested in, Please watch the DVD (Should be available in USA on Feb 15th from what I've seen. I'd recommend the book but I haven't read it YET. But I definately will.  
<br />I was amazed that two actors that COULD be living pampered lives with the money they make in movies, etc instead decide to go on this long trip without Plans to stay in hotels and such each night. Plans to be part of the elements around them. Yes people along their way offer food and shelter for them, but why turn it down, it's not like they were just laying back and relaxing. They bust their buts riding all day and Naturally need sleep, if you're offered a roof over your head for the night by people that you meet along the way, why turn it down? I mean, meeting people and seeing sights, etc is the purpose of the trip.
<br />
<br />I apologize for this being so long winded, but I don't want people to be mis-led by the negative posts.
<br />thanks for listening, Enjoy.</span>
