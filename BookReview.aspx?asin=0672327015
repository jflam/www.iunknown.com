                    <span>  A great deal has been changed in Acrobat from version 6 to version 7. These changes now allow you to treat PDF documents as dynamic entities that can be marked with secondary insertions such as comments, bookmarks and multimedia files. It is also possible to treat a PDF as a web page, where executable Javascript code can be inserted. PDF files can now also be used to create presentations, where the pages are treated as a sequence of slides. This book demonstrates these new features and is the fastest way I have seen to learn how to carry out these operations. 
<br /> It is now possible to insert security features into PDF documents and many options are available. You are not limited to password protecting an entire file, it is also possible to password protect particular features of the file. There are several different security permissions available, where it is possible to allow different read/write permissions. A document can also be assigned a digital signature, and all of these options are easy to do. 
<br /> Each of the steps is demonstrated in a series of sequential images that are easy to follow. A list of numbered textual segments accompanies the images. One feature that most people will really appreciate is the ability to preflight a PDF, where you can test your PDF against a set of rules. Acrobat has a set of 50 preset profiles that can be used, for example the document can be tested against rules for newspaper articles and ads.
<br /> In reading this book, it was clear to me that Adobe is poised to become the tool of choice for creating fundamental web content. Now that you can insert links to other pages, insert multimedia content, include Javascript, apply security features and include more accessibility features it is very powerful. This book is an effective learning tool, efficient and clear presentations make it well worth reading.</span>
