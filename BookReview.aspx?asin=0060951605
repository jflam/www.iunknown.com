                    <span>I found this book to be very helpful in understanding panic and it helped me to realize the key to recovery--FACE THE FEAR (symptoms) and stop trying to run from it.  The fear of the symptoms and the constant running from them is what perpetuates the symptoms and fears.  The book I found the most helpful was Dr. Claire Weekes' book, "Hope and Help For Your Nerves."  It was written in the late 60's but it described EXACTLY what I have been experiencing and explained it fully.  She also tells you how to overcome this condition successfully.  
<br />
<br />Both of these books tell the truth though, which is...NO, YOU ARE NOT GOING CRAZY--your nerves are just over-sensitized and they need to be re-trained.
<br />
<br />GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS.</span>

                    <span>I am very familiar with the pain of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia for I suffered from these maladies for several decades. During those years of suffering I believed that my problems were purely mental and underwent treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, and hypnotherapists. I took various prescribed medications and read many books such as this, but experienced little relief. And then something wonderful happened: I began taking a daily supplement of chelated magnesium (for a different ailment) and shortly thereafter experienced a significant diminishment of anxiety in addition to cure of the ailment for which I had originally taken the supplemental magnesium. There seemed to be no explanation for why taking supplemental magnesium caused this wonderful loss of anxiety until the publication in 2003 of the important book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean. Early in her book Dr. Dean reveals that a major cause of anxiety and panic attacks is deficiency of magnesium and that magnesium deficiency is quite common in the U.S. Therefore, I beg all sufferers of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia -- whatever else you may do -- please purchase and read The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean and please try the magnesium supplementation which she recommends. It may change your life as it has changed mine.</span>

                    <span> Ill sum it up quick, the more you talk about panic /anxiety disorder, the more you join support groups and talk about it constantly , the more you make it a part of your life , the longer it will stay and the deeper it will get into your subconscious, which will make it harder to overcome, but overcome and be completely cured you can be and its very easy ,as much hate from other suffer's ill probably insight by saying that, the problem is that these type of books are the last thing you need. search the net for a guy named Charles Linden, the get back to living</span>

                    <span>In the midst of raging anxiety, I find 400 page a little overwhelming. While it is comforting to learn as much as possible about the condition that is affecting you, I would personally recommend starting with a more practical approach (I benefited from the SelfTherapy.org approach - a simple method of managing anxiety through inner awareness), and then follow up with a book like this one. Good luck - the search for relief from anxiety is well worth it!</span>

                    <span>No one asks for a panic attack, but you certainly remember the first one: rapid breathing, quickened heartrate and the absolute certainty that you are tettering on the brink of death or psychosis. Suddenly the world becomes a checklist of things to avoid. The ultimate end of all panic attacks are you huddled in your bedroom, paralyzed with fear of everything and nothing all at once. Don't Panic cured me of this.
<br />
<br />For those who aren't so sure about drugs or wary of therapy, this book provides you with concrete, pratical solutions of regaining your life. There is no psycho-babble or esoteric theorums - only real-life psychology and application. The way Reid Wilson guides you through your panic struck me as almost psychic in nature. The most important thing to remember is that millions of people are suffering the *same* worries and doubts that you are at this very moment. There is no shame or humiliation in taking steps to remedy your problems, even though you will probably feel both with your panic attacks and when you buy this book.
<br />
<br />It's ironic...in your battles against panic attacks you'll hear the advice 'You've just got to get over it'. For the sufferer, this is his/her greatest dream, yet it seems constantly out of reach. Some reviewers tell that this book made them worse; the book itself explains why this is. When you talk of your fears, its only natural that they'll get inflamed at first. Ultimately it's a step on the path to recovery, and recovery isn't always easy. A final note: obsessive-compulsive disorder mirrors the symptoms of panic attacks in many ways. That's worth noting for some of you. The same author offers a book on that topic. If you've found your way here, you're halfway home. I'd recommend also to start taking Vitamin B tablets - no joke.</span>
