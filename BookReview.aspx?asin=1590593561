It is set to replace Perl as the programming language of choice for shell scripters, and for serious application developers who want a feature-rich, yet simple language to deploy their products.   <p><i>Dive Into Python</i> is a hands-on guide to the Python language.

                    <span>This is a fairly comprehensive intro to Python that will be of most benefit to those that already have some programming knowledge.  Pilgrim's writing style is fairly straightforward and concise.  Examples are appropriate and understandable.
<br />
<br />One thing I wish I'd have known prior to purchasing the book is that the entire thing can be found at www.diveintopython.org.</span>

                    <span>I am definitely a C++ & Java aficionado (or bigot , you might say) but I think Python is one scripting language that is worth some studying. This book is a very clear, practically oriented introduction, best suited for people who already know how to program in some other language. It gives you a solid knowledge of Python fundamentals with an accent on parsing HTML and XML. Ah I forgot the best part... you do not have to buy the book! It is available for free download at diveintopython.org ... but the book is so good and the price so "right" that you might consider buying the hardcopy. Thank you Mark!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fun introduction to Python that goes from installations, through the basics of the language, and into specific tasks. The text is built for programmers who already know a language. The type of reader who can handle a fairly terse text that assumes that you know the fundamentals of imperative programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc.).
<br />
<br />I enjoyed the book a lot. The book gave me more credit than a book like Learning Python which starts at the very basics. And for a book of relatively few pages it gets into some cool topics like refactoring, unit tests, and functional programming very quickly.
<br />
<br />If you want an introduction to Python that doesn't talk down to you then dive in Python here.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great overview of not just the python language, but how to think like a python programmer.  If you're looking for a dry reference book that lists all of the functions and modules available in Python, this isn't your book.  What it does do is give you a good grounding in the basics and give you a great feel for Python.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Dive Into Python does exactly what you would expect from the title.  The author takes you right into Python by going through installation in the first chapter and you are already writing a program in the second chapter.  This is a book designed for the person who wants to just jump in and get right to work with Python without a lot of preliminary theoretical work.  That makes it an ideal book for anyone who has written programs before in Perl, Java, or other languages and already understands things like flow control and similar programming constructs.  
<br />
<br />The book starts with the basics and by the end has given the reader a good foundation in Python.  Areas covered include declaring functions, dictionaries, lists, variables, string formatting, objects, importing modules, working with classes, exceptions, file objects, loops, regular expressions, html processing, xml processing, scripts and streams, http web services, SOAP web services, refactoring, and dynamic functions.  With lots of code examples it is easy to follow along with the text and begin writing useful programs quickly.  
<br />
<br />This is a basic text on Python.  It includes everything you need to start programming basic programs.  There are more advanced books available but they all tend to assume that you at least have this foundational knowledge in order to understand how they use Python to access a database or make your program network aware with TCP/IP functions, or similar more advanced functions.  If you are new to Python this is an excellent place to start and get up to speed quickly by actually working with the program from the first day.  Dive Into Python is a highly recommended purchase. </span>
