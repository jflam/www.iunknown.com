                    <span>The title of this book truly says it all. These dogs are unforgettable. The best thing about this book is the memories it brought back to me of my childhood friend and mutt, Pokey. Since adulthood, I have always owned fullbred dogs, one rescued from a shelter, but still not the adorable mutt. After reading this book, I think of all of the love and devotion Pokey gave my family, and I am proud to say that she was a mutt. For those who own mutts, read the book and celebrate their uniqueness. For those who own pedigrees, read it anyway. It is full with stories of the love and joy only a dog can give. My only criticism is that it is too short. I could have read 100 more stories.</span>

                    <span>This book is fabulous!! If you love dogs, you will love this book about the wonderful nature of mutts. One story would make me laugh, the next would make me cry. Not because anything bad happened, but because dogs have such big hearts, and their goodness is such an inspiration. Their ability to love and their sense of loyalty is something we could all learn from. And as all mutt lovers know, a dog is a dog; purebred or mutt, they're all the same underneath. You'll read stories that will stay with you for life.<P>Our little dog, Harold, is in the book, but this is not influencing my enthusiasm. Although it has influenced how many books I'm buying!<P>The research section at the back of the book is a wonderful bonus, but the dogs are the light of the book.<P>Karen Derrico has done an outstanding job of writing and organizing the book. I'm recommending it to all my dog loving friends.</span>

                    <span>In addition to inspiring stories about mutts, the book contains a wealth of reference information including websites and even an organization that "registers" mutts. I highly recommend this book both as a general reader and as a pet columnist for my local newspaper.</span>

If there's a skeptic out there who thinks dogs have no feelings, check this book out - it'll prove you wrong</span>
