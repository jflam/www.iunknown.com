                    <span>I'm getting ready to deploy with my unit to Iraq and was told about Mr. Strong's books by a buddy who watches Strong's counter terrorism commentary on FOX news. I couldn't put this book down! Death Before Dawn is a have to have book if you want to learn how special ops really go down. I went to the author's web site at www.sealstrike.com and read his detailed bio and he's the real deal! Can't wait to read his second book The Warrior Code.<P>Read this book!!!</span>

                    <span>I couldn't put this book down. It was a great story filled with just enough technical material to give it authenticity without being tedious. The author takes you for an insiders look into the SEALs and their combat methodology. The characters are believable and compelling. I just ordered the author's new book The Warrior Code: SEAL Strike Book Two. ... Two Thumbs up!!!</span>

                    <span>Touched my heart like no other book ever has. It was very informative and it gave me insight on what could possibly be going on in Iraq. The Navy SEALS and the rest of our military continue to fight for OUR Freedom and we should be nothing but grateful! The SEALS are truly the unsung heros.<P>GOD BLESS our Military Men and Women.</span>

                    <span>This was one of the smoothest reads I've ever experienced. I used to read Tom Clancy but the stories became bogged down in a ton of boring techno-detail. Mr. Strong's first effort is obviouly directed at readers who want to learn more about the inside world of the elite SEALs without becoming eligible for college credit. I enthusiastically endorse this novel to anyone who enjoys a fast paced action oriented story about real life heroes. I'm sure the missions outlined in this book are being conducted all over the world now that we are at war with terror.</span>

                    <span>One could forgive Mr. Strong for not having Tom Clancy's command of the genre, but his failure to develop a single character in the book makes it a frustrating read. The only part of the book worth reading is the combat sequence at the end, but even that lacks the punch one would expect from someone who's actually "been there." Death Before Dawn left me thinking that while Mr. Strong may have been a terrific commando, he should put his pen down and leave writing to [others].</span>
