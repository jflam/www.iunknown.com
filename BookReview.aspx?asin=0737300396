                    <span>This is a fantastic book about that most exciting life cycle stage--retirement. But retirement doesn't mean "to retire" as in relaxing, taking it easy or doing little. Retirement can be the most  fulfilling and rewarding time of your life and it is often the most active  time as well. But to get the most out of it requires careful planning...and  that is what The Retirement Sourcebook provides. Mary Helen and Shuford  Smith have thoroughly researched their subject and leave no aspect  unexamined. The book is full of ideas and answers.

                    <span>This book, which is aimed at the mid-life adult contemplating retirement, is comprehensive, clearly written, and wonderfully current.  I purchased it for the Senior Collection our local library, and I will use it myself as I look ahead to retirement.<p>Mary Helen and Shuford Smith recognize that  successful retirement is a process requiring much more than choosing a  pleasant place to live.  Lots of decisions, opportunities and challenges  accompany the retirement journey, and the authors offer excellent tools for  addressing them.   Some of the tools are self-evaluative, while others look  outward, pointing to other avenues we can explore along the way. <p>In  fact, part of the book?s success stems from the fact that it provides sound  advice on a variety of topics without getting bogged down on any one  subject.  Instead, it offers suggestions about other resources--books,  documents, organizations, web sites, etc.  The web sites, especially,  extend our reach in remarkable new ways.  <p>The highlight of this book for  me, however, is the way it is written.  Every time I pick it up, I feel as  if I?m being introduced to yet another member of a circle of wise friends.   The authors draw much of their material from interviews with retired  people, and nuggets from those conversations are sprinkled liberally  throughout the book.  These new friends are people who have done it  right--or who have learned from a mistake or two?and I mean to pay  attention to what they have to say.</span>

                    <span>The Retirement Sourcebook is a buoyant guide to the later years. Loaded with possibilities as well as helpful realities, this book is an invaluable asset in refining your vision of the life you'd most like to lead.      The  authors are ebullient examples of retirees who have blossomed after leaving  the structured workplace.  They share their wisdom ("when you have  time, you have options") as well as their considerable practical  knowledge. And there is no shortage of inspiration with role models cited  ranging from Colonel Sanders to Mother Teresa.<p>    The chapter on  financial issues alone is worth the price of admission.  The authors,  experts at "working the web," sift through the mountain of  information available for the nuggets that will help you make an informed  decision.<p>     If you yearned to see Alaska but considered it too  expensive or thought a condo on a golf course would be a tranquil place to  live, read this book before you make any decisions.<p>     The Retirement  Sourcebook covers nothing less than the entire gamut of human experience  from stress and living wills to how to get rid of junk mail.<p>     You'll  be referring to it for years to come.</span>

                    <span>There are many, many bits and pieces of useful advice and direction to guide retirees or soon to be retirees floating around in the book world. This book has done a masterful job of bringing most of the key decision  factors and issues together under one "roof". Not only are the  standard factors-finance, climate, entertainment etc covered but personal  emotional and physciological issues are covered. The handling of death,  care giving, emotional trauma are covered. Perhaps a most useful feature  are the numerous matrices and check list tables throughout the book.  Example-the check list of values Vs time allocated to these values will let  a lot of people decide what is really important to their retirement  "health".This allows management of time and prevents frustration.</span>

                    <span>I picked up the book at10 p.m and couldn't put it down for an hour.   Three years ago I left my job to begin a dream; so I was fascinated with how it might apply to me. This book gives you ideas, data, and places to  find out more. I found myself in the pages and it made me laugh.  Most  importantly, it conveys a vision of what this part of our lives can be.</span>
