                <span id="Label1"><div><b>A guilt-free guide for adults seeking more satisfying relationships with their parents</b><br><br> In a recent study, half of all Americans rated their relationship with at least one parent as either &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;terrible,&#8221; and more than a third felt this way about both parents. As life expectancy continues to rise and the parent-child relationship extends further into adulthood, this problem is becoming more prevalent than ever. Now, psychologist Dale Atkins presents a step-by-step plan for adults trying to come to terms with parents who are only human&#8212;before it is too late.<br><br>In <i>I&#8217;m OK, You&#8217;re My Parents</i>, Atkins applies the same intelligent, no-nonsense approach that&#8217;s made her a frequent guest on top-rated TV shows. She urges a restructuring of the relationships between adults and their aging parents and gives practical, specific advice on how to exorcise the demons of anger and resentment, untangle financial arrangements that cause stress and feelings of powerlessness, set limits on your parents&#8217; demands for time and attention, turn a spouse or friends into a powerful resource, overcome your own resistance to change, and discover the redemptive power of humor.<br><br>This book draws on Atkins&#8217;s twenty-five years of experience as a relationship expert to present a comprehensive guide to repairing difficult relationships, gaining control, and building a life that you and your parents can live with for years to come.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I predict this book will become one of the classic self-help best sellers, and it should! Dr. Atkins writes from years of expertise in counseling young (and not-so-young) adults who are looking for ways to improve their relationships with their parents. Not "bad, awful, terrible" parents, but mothers and/or fathers who sometimes intrude, impose, ignore, invade, and/or may be insensitive to (or unaware of!) some of the needs, wishes, interests, and/or opinions of their adult children. The book is filled with a wide range of parent - adult child issues that will ring many familiar bells for probably most of us. Dr. Atkins' approach is articulate, optimistic, and practical, and is fun to read. I was sure she was writing about my own parents in several chapters, and I wish I had had access to these ideas years ago, instead of just rolling my eyes, silently mumbling and grumbling, planning visits carefully, censoring how much of my own life I shared with them. And they were actually pretty darn good parents - we just couldn't communicate about a lot of "stuff" from their generation to mine. After reading Dr. Atkins's book, I ordered a copy for my adult daughter! She's reading it now. Gulp!</span>

                    <span>In the wake of a multitude of books about how our parents have created all of our emotional problems comes this book that points out the fact that blaming someone is not a solution to problems. The focus of the book is to take that next step and find ways that you can move through guilt and anger and create a working relationship with your parents. To this end the book contains lots of examples from Dr. Atkins' actual patient files. It also includes exercises to work through, questionnaires to help you understand yourself and your relationship with your parents, and various lessons to illustrate the principles involved. <P>The first part of the book focuses on you. It includes an examination of ways to take control of your life so your past doesn't control your present, how to deal with guilt and parents who use it to control you, and anger. <P>The next part changes focus to your parents. How did they grow up? What did they go through as they were growing up? What was their life like? The focus is on developing empathy so you can use it to develop forgiveness. One of the most important points of the chapter is realizing that your fantasy parent doesn't exist. Not only do they not exist but also those fantasy perfect parents that your friends seemed to have were not perfect either. Two of the coping techniques covered in this chapter include creating reasonable expectations for yourself and your parents and creating appropriate boundaries.<P>The last section discusses the most common problems when dealing with parents. For example, some of the problems covered include the bait and switch technique, manipulating you with a health crisis, becoming easily offended when you don't share personal details of your life, putting you in the middle of their problems, or using money to manipulate you. <P>If you have a troubled relationship with your parents and are seeking to change, you should consider picking up a copy of "I'm OK, You're My Parents".</span>
