                <span id="Label1"><i>Blue Train</i> is one of those ineffable sound recordings that actually seems to capture a moment of perfect artistry. Coltrane was in the midst of a Prestige recording contract but was able to honor a previous commitment to Blue Note and release this one album. With four Coltrane originals, including the haunting theme of the title track, and one standard, this recording showed Coltrane was becoming the complete package: player, composer, and bandleader. What distinguishes this session from the Prestige dates of the same time is the easy, relaxed, and obviously well-rehearsed playing of the group, and the usual masterful recording by Rudy van Gelder. This enhanced CD-ROM also features two alternate takes. The well-designed multimedia elements, including musician interviews and pictures from the famous van Gelder studio, round this stellar session into an experience that informs and delights over and over. <I>--Michael Monhart</I></span>

                    <span>like Kind of Blue, Blue Train is a terrific jazz album that creates spellbinding interest throughout.  It is not as good as Kind of Blue (what is?) but it is right up there on many lists.  I would recommend getting this as an introduction to Coltrane's music, and if you like it a lot (which you will) I recommend getting A Love Supreme also, which is held in higher regard than this one (I can't say if it is better or not, I haven't heard it yet).  On all accounts get this cd, its cool jazz.  And of course, get Kind of Blue before you start buying any other jazz cds</span>

                    <span>This is the classic recording by tenor saxophonist, legend, John Coltrane. The one that put him on the map. He had a couple of good session dates before this one, but it wasn't until Trane released Blue Train, that people saw that, after being a vitol member in the Miles Davis Quintet, he could go out on his own, and make pivitol recordings. 
<br />
<br />He beautifully demonstrates his big huge warm style here, and with the help of his cohorts, Lee Morgan, a growing trumpet figure, on trumpet, Curtis Fuller, on trombone, the underrated Kenny Drew, on piano, one of the most recorded jazz bassits of all time, Paul Chambers, and the legendary Philly Joe Jones, on the drums. 
<br />
<br />The cd, of course, opens up with the classic, Blue Train. Trane arranged all the horn parts pretty well, as every horn man is playing in a different key. Good harmonies!!! Moments Notice, is such a beautiful song, and Lazy Bird is great. 
<br />
<br />Coltrane plays great with Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller. They all blend and match eachother beautifully. This was a classic recording 45 years ago, and it still is today. Coltrane will go down in the book, for being one of the most important saxophone figures, in jazz, of all time!

                    <span>John Coltrane in his prime couldn't have put out anything bad if he tried. While 1957's Blue Train (the only Coltrane release on Blue Note) isn't as innovative as Giant Steps or A Love Supreme, it's so chock-full of jazz standards and absolutely gorgeous ensemble playing that you'd be a fool to care. The best of his pre-Tyner/Garrison/Jones work, in my opinion. It's in a similar "cool" vein to Kind Of Blue, but better and more accessible in my opinion--it's less downtempo, and "swings" more. Of course both are classics, and should be bought in conjunction with each other.  
<br />
<br />The intro of the title track is instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with post-bop jazz; it contains wonderfully melodic, adventurous solos from the master himself, and you'd wish it lasted longer than 10 minutes. Moment's Notice and Locomotion swing like a mofo, with some great work by Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller on trumpet and trombone, respectively. Lazy Bird and I'm Old Fashioned are sublime ballads--Morgan especially shines on the latter. You can tell the band was actually having fun on this release, playing off each other with the kind of chemistry only a studio full of virtuosos could ever have. And just think: Coltrane was only warming up.    
<br />
<br />This version contains a little video clip of a Coltrane interview that you can view on your PC, and extra takes of the title track and Lazy Bird. The definitive version to own, and essential to those whose jazz horizons extend beyond "easy listening."    </span>
