                    <span>This is one dvd I can't quit watching.I've already watched it six times since I got it.Hawaiian dreams features 6 islands 11 minutes each of ocean veiws from each island.Most of these waves are of the lapping kind though on some islands they get big toward sunset.My favorites are day 4 on Lanai and day 5 on Maui.Day 4 features heavy waves surrounding you with rocks in between and miniture waterfalls coming off the rocks as the waves crash into them.This was shot number three.Day 5 on Maui features big crashing waves.Each island ends with a beautiful sunset over the ocean.I beleive I saw it sink below the water in one of the islands.The picture on most of these islands is pristine and sharp.The details in the waves are deep blues and whites.The dvd brings out the reds in the sunset and also the deep blues in the sky before sunset.Also on certain islands you can see rocks and sand far away from the ocean suddenly get submerged by waves which pull back out again.Their is very few sea gulls in this one but you do see one every so often.The sound is in dolby diginal surround and sounds great on a tv surround sound speaker system.This dvd is so relaxing it can cause you to go to sleep while your watching it.Total running time is 74 minutes of ocean views.Dvd features include loop play,instant island access thru chapter search and previews of the other vacation waves series.(...)</span>

                    <span>This DVD has been virtual bliss for me, here in NY. It's been a wonderful gift to be able to escape and enjoy the Hawaiian waves and sunsets. It's natural bliss. If you're expecting a quick music montage of Hawaii's beauty, this is NOT your video. However, if you really want to relax and experience Hawaii's natural beauty - virtually - this is it! <P>All six islands are captured in their own unique ten minute segment. Spend a few minutes with each non moving, non zooming shot, just sitting there. Listening to the waves, and letting your mind wander... Without quick 'Hollywood' editing, you are invited into the shot to relax and admire mother nature's rhythm and flow. Each segment consists of 5 shots lasting a few minutes each, capturing a complete day ending with a marvelous sunset. It truly is a 'mindmassage' meant for you to just relax, do nothing, and be! (I have been so relaxed that I have drifted off to sleep. That's really a blessing considering everything.)<P>Much more soothing than a fishtank or fireplace, you'll be gratefully transported to a far off land of peace and beauty. Play your favorite CD: Enya, Pure moods, smooth jazz, whatever?! for a completely different - but still lovely - experience. Share this wonderful gift with your friends and family. They'll thank you for it.</span>

                    <span>If you just can,t be there but you still want to escape to your favourite hawaiian beach this is the next best thing! This video will defintely leave you feeling relaxed. You visit six islands including kauai,oahu,molakai lanai,maui and finally hawaii itself. It has beautiful daytime scenery as well as colourful sunsets! I also own the Hawaiian zen video as well. It is equally as beautiful! I have just purchased the carribean dvd and i,m lookin forward to it as well. Aloha!</span>

                    <span>I should have listened to the people who gave this one or two stars. The sound of the waves sounded more like constant white noise. The subtleties of waves and ocean sounds were lost; there was very little of the ebb and flow which is evident on the real beach. After visiting many beaches on Kauai, I was disappointed by the choices given here. Even with our large-screen TV and great sound system, this was NOT a virtual relaxing vacation. The constant interruption of the ads destroyed the serenity they were aiming for.</span>

                    <span>I usually enjoy videos of this nature, and the scenery and audio here were of acceptable quality. Unfortunately, the entire experience for me is ruined by the incessant hokey interruptions of the video exhorting the viewer to relax, reminding us which day of "vacation" is being simulated, and advertising their website. These interruptions have much in common with pop up ads on websites, and are just as welcome. If I'm watching an ongoing commercial, I don't expect to pay for it. For a relaxing nature video, I'd recommend going with something more professional, such as Coral Sea Dreaming.</span>
