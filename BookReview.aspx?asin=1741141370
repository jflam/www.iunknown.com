                    <span>Arthur Veno is actually American born and was even at the infamous Hells Angels Monterey incident in 1969 as a teenager. Now Arthur lives in Australia, which he has called home for almost 30 years, and his curiosity in what could be best described as "patch clubs" has almost been a life long interest.  <p>The Brotherhoods is more about biker patch clubs in Australia, but a lot of the clubs he deals with have international standings.  In his book Arthur talks a lot about the relationships between patch clubs and the police, and while not condoning what these clubs "can" do, he finds that most of the trouble we hear about is due to police heavy handedness.  For the most part the patch clubs just want to get out and have fun, but when you start poking at a hornets nest (the clubs) with a stick (the police) there will always be trouble.  He also talks about a lot of the terminology that the clubs use as well as typical processes you have to go through to become a member in these clubs which is highly interesting.<p>Strangely Arthur has never been an actual member of a biker club and he doesn't even particularly like bikes himself, yet he has major contacts within most of the major clubs in Australia including the Hells Angels and the Gypsy Jokers, commonly playing the role of mediator between the clubs and the police.  A number of the stories that Arthur tells in his book may get him into hot water with some or all of the patch clubs he knows, and he acknowledges this while writing the book.  In fact on numerous occasions in the past he has feared for his safety and life while being involved with the clubs, so his future may indeed become interesting after this book.  <p>I did find his writing a little on the academic side and somewhat repetitive at times, which is why I awarded four stars instead of five, but he does have a PhD in social psychology and has spent most of his life in universities, so the writing style isn't surprising.  If you are looking for a book which could be best called a study of patch clubs then you can't look past The Brotherhoods.  If you are after a book full of raw and bloody accounts of biker lifestyle, then I would highly recommend "Hells Angel, The Life and Times of Sonny Barger" by one time Hells Angels president Sonny Barger.  In fact, I highly recommend reading the two books one after another, just as I did.</span>

                    <span>While the author is Australian and writes from his knowledge of Australian clubs he captures the flavor of the worldwide club scene.  Of all the books I've read about biker (bikie) clubs, this one rides the best.  Thanks to the author for his courage and for his story telling ability.<br>Ice  USMV MC</span>

                    <span>Dear reader or internet-surfer,<p>I am happy to report I have just finished reading Arthur Veno's book 'The brotherhoods: inside the outlaw gangs of Australia'. I found it very pleasant to read and packed with excellent information, revealing a lot about the author and his depth of knowledge on the topic. I feel I have gained a lot of knowledge on a scary subject.  The framework of this book is logical and easy to follow allowing greatest access to information on bikee gangs of Australia. I can only imagine the difficultly in writing such a book given the political and social context. I believe the author has a very balanced perspective increasing the overall appeal of this book. I found the writing style to be clear, presenting information in a forthright and accurate way, although on the odd occasion the message was encrypted. I don't want to over analyze this book as I only wish to convey that it was really fantastic to read. So thanks to the Author and all those involved! <p>PS - I have never been compelled to write a review before.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the finest examples I have ever seen about the world of the 1%ers. Written by Professor Author Veno an expert in Police and Justice Studies along with Human Rights and also a man thats spent years hanging out with club members and actually being friends with members of the Hells Angels, Gypsy Jokers. The Mad Professor as he became known draws on personal experiences of spending time with the men of the Outlaw Bike World. Professor Veno has seen firsthand the violent nature of the bike world but has also seen the violence of the police and the instigation they try to cause in the bike world. Constantly trying to demonize the clubs to bolster public support and to bolster their funds. The professor wrote this book to be an unbiased account and sociological study of the world the 1%ers live in on a daily basis. It truly is a wonderful book for showing what the 1%er world is and is not and what is actually just myth. It tackles the concept of a criminal organization and what really defines that phrase which is so constantly used by the police to describe the Outlaw Motorcycle World</span>
