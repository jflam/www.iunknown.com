                    <span>I chose "Covenant" because I wanted to read a James Michener's novel that was unlike anything else that I have read before. "Covenant" was very different, not in context but in quality. It follows a standard Michener's design: an epic from some thousand years B.C. to 1971 A.D.. The difference here is that Michener's passion for his characters is lacking. I felt no emotion while important characters were born, grew up, married, and died. It is not that the characters are so unappealing. On the contrary, they are very intriguing and daring. But by the time they are involved in a life-and-death struggle with forces of nature or other men, I did not care what happened to them. This should have been Mr. Michener's most passionate work. The title reflects it. Instead of calling the book "South Africa", the country about which he writes, he called it the "Covenant" reflecting the fact that each subsequent member of a nation who! want to colonize South Africa sees himself as Moses entering into the covenant with God. It is hard not to get emotional just thinking about it, but Mr. Michener surprised me by not involving emotion in his writing. By only affecting the readers' minds, not their hearts, James Michener makes the "Covenant" a beautiful but dispassionate narrative</span>

                    <span>I read this book in preparation for a trip to South Africa. There are of course several things to read to get a better feeling for this complex country, especially Mandela's autobiography--but this one I found particularly helpful in understanding the Afrikaans story. The original Dutch settlers were fierce and courageous people who banded together against a terrifying wilderness, ultimately cutting themselves off from their European roots altogether. All outsiders--European and African---were suspect. Religious fanaticism also played a role. I was startled to realize that aparteid in its starkest form was only a 1930-1940's development, and that the descendants of the Dutch were still traveling around the countryside in wagons in the 50's. Like a few other of Michener's books I've read, the historical parts are the best, and the modern is more like an historical narrative--but I recommend this book to anyone who wants a relatively painless way to get a deeper sense of the history than any guidebook.</span>

                    <span>Nowadays we hardly see an author's commitment with his project as James Michener has done with most of his books. "Hawaii", "Caribbean", "Texas", "Alaska" and "Chesapeake", among others, show such a level of research, understanding of the subject and respect to the readers that most modern (and popular) authors would never understand or know how to do it. <P>Michener's "The covenant" is a history lesson without having to attend class. South Africa is the subject of this lecture. From the indigenous people, to the Dutch and posterior English colonization, and finally the heinous apartheid regime, South Africa is dissected, analyzed and explained. Once again, Michener doesn't concentrate on people, but on the land. The characters are a little stereothypical, but that's on purpose: Michener uses his characters to explain what happens in a determined historical period. What is best, Michener was able to distanciate himself from the controversial history of this country; he presents the facts, good or bad, whether caused by Afrikaner, English or Native Black people, and lets the reader judge for himself. <P>One other thing we have to remember: the book ends in 1979, before De Klerk increasingly opened the country to democracy, so the final chapter of the book sounds almost prophetic. <P>And one thing I didn't understand is that Nelson Mandela wasn't mentioned even once in the book; that's strange. Mandela hadn't yet been released from prison in 1979 and maybe didn't have the same international exposure, but he certainly had been representative as a member of the ANC in the 50s and 60s. Michener created a character that goes through the same problems as Mandela did in real life, but that's not enough to represent South Africa's first black president . <P>Anyway, Michener is one of my favorite authors, and his passing away should be mourned by all those who enjoy an accurate historical fiction.<P>Grade 9.4/10</span>

                    <span>In books like Chesapeake, Hawaii and Alaska, the pages just fly by. You get so drawn into the tale that you feel like the characters are real people that you know. It's entertainment first, education second.<P>'Covenant' does not live up to this standard. I found myself simply not caring about the characters, and just waiting (longing) for the end of each chapter. A lot of it is just dull.<P>'Covenant' is not as bad as 'Mexico' - that was a true shocker - but it is a long way from Michener at his best. Read it if you're a fan, but if you're looking to get into Michener choose another.</span>

                    <span>Sometimes it's nice to read a small book, a quick 150-300 page diversion from the real world. At other times, however, it's nice to read a book with some real "meat" to it. Few big name writers were more adept at producing these meaty books than James Michener, and in the Covenant, he presents one of his biggest, a 1200+ page epic about South Africa.<P>As usual, Michener is not as interested in adventure or characters as he is with relating the history of a particular region. This is his formula: to cover a region from prehistoric times to the present, watching it slowly get settled and eventually civilized, though this civilization is often with a great price. This is not to say that he doesn't write a compelling story: he does, but he does not use heroes or villains to populate his world. <P>This is a good book, but a reader new to Michener should learn to try and not get too attached to specific characters, as Michener treats them rather unsentimentally, and they often die in undramatic fashion. Also, although there are some unpleasant people, Michener does not make them truly evil; he usually can show that these characters believe they have justifiable reasons for their actions. Writing as objectively as possible in a novel, he judges no one but rather allows the reader to make the judgements.<P>Many will be put off by the size of this book, but this is actually a reasonably fast read. In the end, the reader will feel both entertained and educated, and that is perhaps the best that can be asked of from a novel.</span>
