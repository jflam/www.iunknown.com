                <span id="Label1">In this beautiful picture book, winner of the 2005 Caldecott Medal, Kevin Henkes, captures the sweet, sometimes slapstick struggle of Kitten, who sees her first full moon and thinks it's a bowl of milk in the sky.<p>  Any child who has yearned for anything will understand how much Kitten wants that elusive bowl of milk. Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, "Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting." The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet). Children will love Kitten's quest and ensuing comedy of errors, but what they will love even more is that there's an actual bowl of milk waiting on the porch for Kitten.

                    <span>The writing is simply beautiful, which makes this charming story stand out in a sea of horribly written, celebrity driven picture books that have all but destroyed the genre. It's lyrical, simple, and the message is just right for the smallest of listeners. It's my two-year-old's bedtime favorite, and neither she nor I has gotten sick of it after dozens and dozens of readings. This book belongs in every preschooler's storybook collection.</span>

                    <span>Our 18-month-old daughter isn't particularly enthralled by the story yet, but I am hardly surprised by that; it is a little beyond her age.  It is a well-crafted story told in a straightforward manner, and I expect that in time she will enjoy this book for that reason.  For now, she finds the artwork to be very interesting, no doubt because we have 5 cats of our own.  I find myself in total agreement with Helen here; this is some of the best artwork I have ever come across in a childrens' book, so much so that I wouldn't hesitate to frame the drawings and hang them in a prominent space on my walls.  This is really well-done.  Even if it were a lousy story, I would enjoy looking at the artwork.  As it is, both the story and artwork are superb!</span>

                    <span>Kevin Henkes really soars to the top of the creativity list with this totally suspense filled book about the adventures of a captivating kitten who first thinks that the moon she sees is a cup of milk. It's her very first full moon and this determined little kitty just won't give up.
<br />
<br />This is a full moon story that will capture your child (or group of children) from beginning to end. And who couldn't but fall in love with this persistent little kitten?
<br />
<br />Filled with some of the best black and white (charcoal and cream) images I've ever seen, my kids immediately caught on to this extremely creative story about a kitten who just doesn't give up-even when faced with temporary bumps in the road. Frustration, exhaution and even pain don't stop this determined kitten from reaching her goal of getting to that cup of milk. Your kids will see the full moon and be consumed with the kittens determination and spirit. One of the messages that was clear throughout the story was one of courage and the ability to not give in or ever give up-not ever. 
<br />
<br />This is one cute feline that won't be forgotten and a great book that will both stimulate and relax your childs mind. If other books have failed, please give this one a try. It worked for our family and is so popular now that it's often hard to find in our home. "Where did you put the "Kitten and the Moon Book?".
<br />
<br />Happy reading to you and your child or children. And to those who babysit? You'd better add this one to your collection as well!
<br />
<br />Happy Parenting and Warm Regards,
<br />

                    <span>When I got this book I wasn't sure if my two-year old would like it since it was "only" black and white.  Boy, was I wrong!  He loves this book--you can almost sense that he is rooting for that sweet little kitty.  The funny thing was my 7-year old son asked if he could take it to his room and read it too.  Thank you, Kevin Henkes, for giving this wonderful book to us to share as a family.</span>

                    <span>Hi. During school some kids (including me) have been asked if we could be in a Caldecott reading group. In this reading group we have to read 25 of the books that were entered in the Caldecott award. At the end we were supposed to pick a book that we thought should win. My friends, Haleigh and Marissa were in a group with me. we decided to do an essay on the book Kittens First Full Moon. We did a little presantation in front of the reading class and we also shared our thoughts about the book. We even shared what we thought aboout the black and white pictures, few words and even te cute little Kitten. This reading class was fun and i hope that maybe next time (if there is a next time) you will choose the same book i did again. I had fun writing this paragraph. I really enjoy the book Kittens First Full Moon. Thank You.
<br />
