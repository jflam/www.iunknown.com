                <span id="Label1">This dramatic tale of the storm that hit Mount Everest in the spring of 1996 will resonate with anyone fascinated by life on the outer edge of physical and psychological limits. Before the killer storm subsided, some climbers reached the summit, others abandoned their quest, and twelve people froze to death. Matt Dickinson, a filmmaker and a novice climber, chose that fateful May for his first ascent of Everest, up the treacherous North Face. His story is one of discovery, tragedy, and personal triumph--told, literally, from the other side of the world's tallest peak. It will be cherished by all readers eager to experience adventure, from their armchairs to their own base-camp bivouac.</span>

                    <span>This is a gripping account of the deadly storm which engulfed Mt. Everest in May 1996 and left a trail of dead bodies in its wake on the south face of the mountain. The author writes about the storm as experienced on the north face: hence, the title of the book. He writes about the tragedy which engulfed the north side of Everest, in which death also came calling. <P>The author provides many details of his expedition's ascent which is sure to fascinate and delight all Everest junkies. The narrative is compelling and absorbing. The tragic deaths of three members of the Indian team who reached the summit, only to become engulfed by the storm during their descent down the precipitous north face of Everest, trapping them over night, is heartbreaking. The callousness of a Japanese expedition who, on their ascent to the summit the following day, passed the Indian climbers, still alive but near death, and refused to aid them in their extremis, is truly shocking. <P>The author also rehashes the effect of the storm on the south face and the heavy toll of life it exacted there. Jon Krakauer, however, does it better in his gripping book "Into Thin Air". In the final analysis, the author, Matt Dickinson, a novice climber who first ascended Everest that May 1996, comes across as a self-absorbed, selfish sort of lout. Notwithstanding his own personal shortcomings, however, his book still makes for an absorbing read.</span>

                    <span>Matt Dickinson's book took me by surprise--he reallly makes you feel like you're on Mount Everest. The piercing cold, the loss of oxygen, rusty equipment and frayed ropes: it's amazing climbing. He doesn't try to figure out why the deaths happened or place blame on anyone for the tragedy of the 1996 storm. He just tells a really great story about how his team survived it and how he, though he was not that experienced, made it all the way to the top. And the North Side is even more challenging than the South! That's where Mallory & Irvine may have first reached the summit and now they found Mallory's body. Dicksinson's takes you there -- you can't imagine how Mallory could have done it. This book is one that adventure lovers shouldn't miss.</span>

                    <span>I didn't think I would find a book to top "Into Thin Air" and one that would take a different view of the 1996 tragedy. I could NOT put this book down. I made it last a week and didn't want it to end. Dickinson really achieves putting the reader into the story. I live under the High Sierra and have summited Mt.Whitney in Calif. Driving by that mountain that seems to shoot straight up into the sky, I remembered Dickinson's description of the Himalaya valley floors that were at 18,000 feet. I imagined the towering 14,000 foot peaks of the Sierra buried under 4,000 feet of dirt and that would be only the valley FlOOR of the Himalays with 11,000 feet to go to the summit of Everest. THEN I could visualize the unbelievable height of this mountain. THEN I could realize the effort it takes (and what it takes OUT of someone) to get to the summit.<BR>Dickinson's writing is funny, tragic and extremely descriptive of the area, the people and the hard-to-imagine-summit he finally made. I know his wife would like him to stay home, but I hope he makes another trip to the Himalayas and writes another book!</span>

                    <span>I was a bit hesitant to read The Other Side of Everest; it was beginning to seem to me that there wasn't a person anywhere near the mountain during 1996 that *hadn't* written a book. I figured this one would be a rehashing of the story we all know so well, from Into Thin Air and other books. How wrong I was. The Other Side of Everest offers a different perspective of the 1996 tragedies, but it's well told - *and* the book offers a great deal more.<P>Dickinson, in my opinion, did a better job than Krakauer at writing for the non-climbing audience, perhaps because he isn't really a climber at all. He doesn't use much jargon, and when he does - "the Death Zone," for example, which was the UK title of this book - he defines his terms. He also answers a lot of the questions non-mountaineers and armchair adventurers have about climbing; for once and for all, he explains why climbers dread calls of nature above 8,000 meters, as just one example.<P>Dickinson writes very differently than most climbers, especially the ones who have written about Everest 1996. His narrative retains the tension and, in some places, tragedy that are common to the best expedition accounts, but he also uses humor in places where it's appropriate. I found myself laughing out loud in several places. The Other Side of Everest is also different in that it doesn't have the haunted, agonizing tone that Into Thin Air did, perhaps because Dickinson was farther from the tragedies, relatively speaking, or perhaps just because he waited longer than Krakauer did to write about it. Also, The Other Side is an account of a successful, "easy" Everest climb, not a disaster, which changes the perspective and the tone a lot from the other books about the 1996 season. <P>In additional to the Everest-disaster-season story, The Other Side has another story to tell: how a non-climber got to the top of the world. Dickinson's case of summit fever drives him to the top of a mountain he didn't really expect to climb - after all, he's clumsy even at sea level - and so his book is a good look at the way normal people with little mountaineering experience (i.e., commercial expedition members) handle high-altitude climbs - and, to the extent that it can be explained at all, why.<P>This book was written by a film director, so perhaps it isn't a surprise that the pictures are so good, but it's lovely anyway. I'm also pleased that the publishers sprung for two different insets of color photos, at least in the hardcover edition; some of them are truly breathtaking. <P>In short, The Other Side of Everest is well worth reading for all lovers of adventure travel and climbing writing; even those who feel they've read Everest to death should enjoy this one. The book is a welcome addition to climbing literature, and would give pleasure on almost anyone's bookshelf.</span>
