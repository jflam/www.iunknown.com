                <span id="Label1"><B> <I>This book heralds a breakthrough that redefines competitive advantage for the next fifty years. </B> Don't bridge the business-IT divide: Obliterate it!</I> The book is the first authoritative analysis of how third-wave business process management (BPM) changes everything in business and what it portends. While the vision of process management is not new, existing theories and systems have not been able to cope with the reality of business processes --until now. This book describes a radical, <I>simplifying</I> shift in process thinking and technology that utterly transforms today's information systems and reduces the lag between management intent and execution.  <P>A process-managed enterprise makes agile course corrections, embeds Six Sigma quality and reduces cumulative costs across the value chain. It pursues strategic initiatives with confidence, including mergers, consolidation, alliances, acquisitions, outsourcing and global expansion. Process management is the only way to achieve these objectives with transparency, management control and accountability. The process-managed enterprise grasps control of business processes and communicates with a universal process language that enables partners to execute on shared vision --to understand each other's operations in detail, jointly design processes and manage the entire lifecycle of their business improvement initiatives.  <P>Process management is not another form of automation, a new killer-app or a fashionable new management theory. With the third-wave BPM breakthrough and its solid <I>mathematical underpinnings,</I> business processes can now be unhindered by the constraints of existing IT systems. Short on stories and long on insight and practical information, this book will help your business become the company of the future, the real-time enterprise, the fully digitized corporation <I>--the process-managed enterprise.</I> The book also offers continually updated information and a dialog with the authors at its Web site.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I spent many years as a manager and business consultant.  I am now doing a little consulting in my retirement years.  I bought this BPM book when it first became available.  I read about 50 pages and was unimpressed.  Recently, thinking I should spend more time "keeping up," I picked it up again.  
<br />
<br />My reaction today remains the same: for me not worth reading.  After reading recent reviews here by YingAsReader and "slimeddy" I better understand why it is not worth my time.  "Proselytizing" as "slimeddy" writes, says a lot of the story.  This book reminds me of the hard selling "you've got to get with the quality revolution" books that were so popular in the 1970's.  They told why American management is "backward" and broadly described the potential of TQM and other formulas.  They also told nothing of the "how." As YingAsReader writes "the 'why' and the 'how' are missed."
<br />
<br />If you've somehow missed the points:
<br />
<br />	Business, life and the universe are moving (process).   There are no safe, static havens.  In management the old functional "silos" (production, systems, finance, etc.) are gone.  We finally understand business as process rather than 
<br />a world of feudal domains.     
<br />
<br />	Digitalization has made offer, acceptance, and contract execution "lickety split" fast, world-wide. Therefore we must 
<br />grasp, integrate and innovate quicker than ever.  
<br />
<br />  	Like the troops on the high ground, the business person who has the highest, and broadest view of what is going on has 	the advantage.
<br />
<br /> 	"Taking the high ground" in business today requires that you speak the latest "biztech" language, reflecting your clear understanding of the concepts involved, so that you may 
<br />adapt them intelligently to your specific business.    
<br />
<br />	And while your doing all this be sure to keep in touch with the customer.
<br />
<br />This is all good advice but not exactly new.

                    <span>I got about 100 pages into this book and checked the cover to see if I was reading an L. Ron Hubbard book. There was a lot of trumpeting of the party line "The third wave of BPM is not a fantasy ... or hype. For BPM, like other true breakthroughs, is based in the mathematics ... as opposed to static relational data". Praise the Lord, I'm saved!<br>There's only one chapter on implementation, and even that provides very generalized guidelines - start small, prove the concept, pat yourself on the back in these ways. Admittedly the audience is so general as to set the lowest common denominator pretty low, but the argument is pretty simple: the old way of provisioning services in IT is restrictive and inefficient. If that's the case, could we not expect to see a glimpse of the new IT business processes that support a BPM management model and encourage its adoption? <br>If you need to be convinced that managing your environment to your business processes is a good idea, this book delivers that message loud and clear. If you're a believer, though, it does little to put you on the path to salvation.</span>

                    <span>Nicholas Carr's article in the Harvard Business Review has taken the backlash wave from the IT overspend in the 1990s to spin a sensational story, a story that some rebuttals have called "dangerous," for it distorts the role of IT in creating competitive advantage. Companies are indeed struggling with the issue of IT's role, and it is difficult to break out of existing misconceptions of IT. This is evident in David Forbes' review of this book. He seems so locked into his perceptions that he distorts what the book actually says. For example, he says the Smith & Fingar's vision is that of expensive ERP sysems of the past. He must be so busy railing against ERP systems that he failed to actually read the book's related discussions that are in fact in agreement with him. And, about Forbes' comments about usability... did he actually read the section on amenity?  Again, agreement.<p>The point is that when it comes to IT, many people bring much baggage to the subject, for IT means many things to many people and is an emotiaonally charged subject for those with a particular stake in IT. Many read a book like this and filter it through their individual bias to the point where they distort what the book actually says. <p>As a business manager using the book to foster discussion in our company, I suggest readers go through it twice: once quickly with their defensive mechanizms in place, and then again with a keen eye on what the IT issues portend for their company going forward. We are doing precisely that in our company and find the book to be the focal point of our deliberations, for it covers all the key issues of the past and those setting the stage for the future.  Correct thining about IT, not preconcieved notions or turf bias, is essential for companies to move forward, for as the book says, IT is not about the past fity years of business automation and its inherent limitations, IT is about a "change in kind" in business automation where the focus is not on data and record keeping, but on the way business is conducted. And yes, the authors totally agree that usibility is key to that, for it's business people who must manage their own business processes.</span>

                    <span>OK, here's the story on this one: Some obscure mathematician (Milner) has found a way to model the real world by unifying computer algorithms and communications protocols and this has been picked up by an equally obscure open source community (exolab) which founded a standards group (BPMI.org) and tech company (Intalio) who are building a new class of enterprise system (BPMS) which the book claims will be as important as databases. (you see, I can do research) The book, by CSC Index, the reengineering company, claims some new benefits for this process based approach to building business systems. At this point you might have decided not to buy this book. You'd be wrong. What the book describes is one of the most fascinating Biz-Tech new ideas this reader has ever encountered, period. And from the endorsements in the frontis, it looks like this might be a major trend. My best line from the book .... "As Walt Disney once said, objecting to a proposed sequel to his Three Little Pigs cartoon, "You can't top pigs with pigs" In the world of business, stacking a thousand doghouses one atop the other to build a skyscraper is a great proposition for doghouse vendors, but not for future occupants. Skyscrapers need an architecture of their own -- their own paradigm, not a sequel to the doghouse paradigm"  Read and enjoy.</span>
