                    <span>One must take into account that the book is after all, 1997...there were only a few terrorist activities that happened to the United States at that time.<P>I find this book to be a good primer to other aspects of CT forces. Its only equal is Concord's "Special Operations Journal" which as of 3/1/2001 is in Volume 13. However, each SOJ is about the price of this book and you need to buy 3-4 SOJs to have the units contained here.<P>The book doesn't really cover the military CT groups like Delta or SEALs (Douglas Waller's "Commandos" does better) but FBI HRT, US Marshals, and CT forces against super-terrorism. <P>Stephen F. Tomajczyk did speak the truth when he said he visited these units and the photos show training exercises. Of course given the nature of their top-secret work, real mission photos aren't included...same applies to Concord Special Ops. Photos are mainly of training and the text is about unit history and terrorist events up to 1997.<P>For the size and price, I think this is a great valuable book and the first of its kind. Surely other future authors can provide more detailed text or photos but you won't find such value, blueprints, diagrams, color photos, descriptions, and true life stories of SEVERAL units in just one book or just one journal of Concord "Special Ops." And if you do, chances are the price will be a lot higher than this book.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book expecting a look at the many facets of the U.S. military and law enforcement special operations and counter-terrorist community though was disappointed by the units ultimately selected. The narrative is weak and not very insightful. I cannot endorse this title.</span>

                    <span>This book is definately an excellent source for the layman, however totally skips over a certain set of individuals of which there are photos of in the book itself, but no mention in text. Air Force Security Police (Security Forces) are pictured in the book twice, yet no mention of them at all. Security Forces were also rated in the top five most hated organizations by terrorists in the world, ranked with British SAS, Delta, and others mentioned in this book. They are pictured as the individual inspecting the undercarriage of a vehicle with a mirror, and the K-9 handler in the 'Secret Service' section. One should research a little more before placing pictures with organizations they are not a part of. Security Forces deploy all over the world in almost every country to protect U.S. Armed Forces from the threats of terrorism and work often with organizations in this book. Please understand this book is for layman only, and some information is vague, especially for military organizations.</span>
