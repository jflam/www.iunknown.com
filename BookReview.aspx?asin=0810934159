                <span id="Label1">Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst and his legendary California estate occupy a place in the public imagination through Orson Welles's Citizen Kane, but Kane's brooding Xanadu was merely a caricature of Hearst's exuberant castle at San Simeon. This new book sets the record straight and proves that, for once, truth is better than fiction.  <P>Here for the first time is the real story of Hearst Castle, and of the productive 28-year relationship between Hearst and his architect, Julia Morgan, who collaborated on the magnificent 165-room estate set on 250,000 breathtaking acres near the remote seaside hamlet of San Simeon, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Drawing on previously unpublished correspondence, and illustrated with never-before-seen historic photographs as well as more than 150 stunning color pictures, Victoria Kastner chronicles the evolution of this extraordinary hilltop, with its two spectacular pools and its astounding collections of fine art and antiques. Sprinkled throughout with stories of the famous parties hosted by Hearst and his companion, movie star Marion Davies, and their celebrated guests, this book brings to life America's most glamorous country house.  <P>259 photographs, 157 in full color, 9 x 113/4"</span>

                    <span>This book gives an intimate look at one of "America's Castles" from inside and out. The history of the building site is covered, as is the design and construction of the buildings. The life and times of W.R. Hearst and his friends and loved ones are presented in such a way as to flesh out the character of the house.<P>I just finished reading this book, and I'm tempted to pick it up and start all over again. This is one that I'll reread often.<P>The layout of the book is interesting and eye-catching, but the tints used on the pages sometimes make the text difficult to read. Make sure you sit down with this book in a very well-lit room -- not only will light make it that much easier to read, you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful pictures more easily.</span>

                    <span>I do not know about you? But I do not notice things in front of my face unless someone points them out to me. When I go to museums I need to go twice once with someone to point things out and again for my own exploration. I used this book for the point out phase. It is more intricate than a biography film. <P>There are several color pictures (259 illustrations) that point out items of interest, many more with maps and history (157 plates in full color). There is an expansive preface, forward, introduction, and prologue. There are twelve chapters that carry you on a historical tour of the castle.<P>I am not going to go through the book, as that is why you are purchasing the book and not the review. However on a personal note after looking at the book I went to the castle. I stayed overnight on the San Simeon coast to complete the tours in two days. As with all pictures the pale compared the real thing. However you now can use the book for memories. I did bring a camera. However you are not allowed to use a flash. And I have to admit that Victoria Garagliano is a better photographer. I think the cover shows the most impressive part of the castle. The Roman pool is located inside and under the tennis court. Just like the picture it is cool quiet and reflective. I did want to jump in just for the fun of it.<P>Now I leave the book on the coffee table so some unsuspecting person (and they are rare) will ask me about it.</span>

                    <span>Ever since the estate at San Simeon became the property of the California Department of Parks and Recreation, anyone can pay to see it and take the various tours through Hearst Castle. It's worth the trip down from San Francisco; if you can't make it, there is now _Hearst Castle: The Biography of a Country House_ by Victoria Kastner, with photographs by Victoria Garagliano. As befits its larger-than-life subject, this is a big book with gorgeous pictures, but the pictures are within a very helpful historic text, so even if you have seen the house, there is much to learn. There have been tourist picture books of the house before, but this is the first book to tell the house's full story. The story largely concerns the partnership between the architect Julia Morgan and her famous client. Miss Morgan is regarded as the first woman architect of any prominence in America. She and Hearst worked on the huge castle, adjacent guest houses, pools, and gardens over three decades. She had responsibilities even for his zoo animals, and he was essentially her patron. They were superbly able to work together, and to have obvious fun in accumulating and displaying the riches illustrated in this book. Morgan put up with Hearst's changeability, with every building turning out quite differently from how it was first planned. Given his impulsiveness and the span of time of construction, it is astonishing that the site has any architectural unity, but she managed to make it a real showplace.<P>The book also documents the entertainments held by Hearst's lover, Marion Davies, with whom he had a longstanding, loving, and happy affair. She was a perfect hostess at the Castle; guests and staff loved her. Hearst loved fun in his own way, but spent much of the time at the Castle managing his business affairs by phone, leaving Davies to show hospitality to all visitors. It was very unusual for their time, but they rejected socializing with the established money and society of the East coast, preferring to have Hearst's own business associates and movie stars as guests. Pictures in the book show Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, and many others.<P>Much of _Hearst Castle_ is taken up with pictures to document the astonishingly rich gothic interiors. Unlike most castles, however, this one feels like a home. There are comfortable overstuffed chairs and sofas throughout, and a poker table jostles with Renaissance-style sculpture. It is clear that Hearst and Morgan had fun tearing down and building up, and collecting the artifacts that range from ancient bric-a-brac to priceless masterworks. _Hearst Castle_ is a lovely homage to a great American house.</span>
