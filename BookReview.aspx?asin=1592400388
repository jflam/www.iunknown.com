                <span id="Label1">The charming true story of a spirited young woman who finds adventure--and the love of her life--in Paris. <BR><BR> "This isn't like me. I'm not the sort of girl who crosses continents to meet up with a man she hardly knows. Paris hadn't even been part of my travel plan..." <BR><BR> A delightful, fresh twist on the travel memoir, <I>Almost French</I> takes us on a tour that is fraught with culture clashes but rife with deadpan humor. Sarah Turnbull's stint in Paris was only supposed to last a week. Chance had brought Sarah and Fr&#233;d&#233;ric together in Bucharest, and on impulse she decided to take him up on his offer to visit him in the world's most romantic city. Sacrificing Vegemite for vichyssoise, the feisty Sydney journalist does her best to fit in, although her conversation, her laugh, and even her wardrobe advertise her foreigner status. <BR><BR> But as she navigates the highs and lows of this strange new world, from life in a bustling <I>quatier</I> and surviving Parisian dinner parties to covering the <I>haute couture</I> fashion shows and discovering the hard way the paradoxes of France today, little by little Sarah falls under its spell: maddening, mysterious, and charged with that French specialty-<I>s&#233;duction</I>.<BR><BR> An entertaining tale of being a fish out of water, <I>Almost French</I> is an enthralling read as Sarah Turnbull leads us on a magical tour of this seductive place-and culture-that has captured her heart.</span>

                    <span>This is a rare gem. A wonderfully scripted book with the appropriate amount of wit and humuor thrown in, I was hoping for more when I finished reading it. Sarah Turnbull has given us an intimate amount of how she adapts to city life in France. It is a refreshing account of life in a foreign culture. Unlike books by Peter Mayle, Carole Drinkwater which tend to be stories of country living, this book give a glimpse into city life which is what many of us are familiar with. One can also learn more about the French way of thinking (told with extreme wit and sometimes, exasperation), living, communicating and dealing with bureacracy. I highly recommend this book to all who want to know the French a little more, to find out how a girl in her twenties mustered up the courage to stay with a Frenchman she barely knew during her gap year and finally settled down for good in this foreign land that is more than half the globe away from her native Australian home and how she adapted and became "almost french", all amid a hilarious read. I caught myself chuckling away in a cafe and the subway while reading this book. Of course, no one then understood why and could have labelled me crazy, but only if they knew what a book "Almost French" is.</span>

                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have developed an interest in things French and found that this book answered a few of my questions.<P>Turnbull moves to Paris from Sydney to live with a man she hardly knows. The book chronicles her odyssey from naive foreigner to a more self-assured woman living in Paris. She will never be French but she has learned to navigate the obstacles in her way. Some things she addresses:<P>- Womens role in society. While expected to be intellegent, she is also expected to be low-key and slightly demure in public.<P>- Cocktail parties. She attends one where no one really mingles. She learns the French are really rather shy when meeting new people.<P>- Dress. The French value quality over quantity.<P>- Dealing with French officials. Turnbull relays a few harrowing stories while trying to process papers for work and learns a few ways of dealing with government workers.<P>One thing - Turnbull is Australian so her treatment from the French is probably not as bad if she were American. <P>Very interesting read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Sarah Turnbull, an Australian journalist, takes a year off work to travel. While she is roaming around Europe she meets a Parisian named Frederic, who invites her to visit him in Paris. It sounds like a good idea at the time; she does, although by the time her plane lands at Charles de Gaulle she is beginning to wonder what possessed her to agree to stay with essentially a complete and total stranger.<P>The visit goes well, though; so well, in fact, that she moves permanently not just to Paris, but into Frederic's apartment. The memoir that follows is a charming and amusing account of two cultures, embodied by two very different people -- the uptight, nattily dressed Frenchman and the casual, easy-going Aussie -- trying to coexist in a small space. He is appalled when she wears her sweat pants to pick up her morning baguette ("But it's not nice for the baker!"); she doesn't understand his sense of humor. This is a happy story that ends with a wedding, but not before the author has myriad battles with the language, countless misunderstandings with the the customs of the place, and some truly homesick spells yearning for Australia.<P>I found this book laugh-out-loud funny (although I'll admit my reaction may have been a little extreme) because I have spent time in Paris and saw myself very clearly in Ms. Turnbull's language struggles, efforts to get a journalistic career going, and just general befuddlement. I've passed my copy on to some travelling companions who felt the same way I did. But even if you've never been to France, "Almost French" is well-worth reading for the entertainment value alone. The descriptions are apt. The voice is personable and interesting, so much so that by the time you've finished, you'll feel not just that you've visited Paris, but as if you've made a new friend while you were there.</span>

                    <span>I don't know if Sarah Turnbull author of "Almost French" could be described as 'spoiled' as one reviewer suggests, but I do know that reading the memoir of her years adjusting to life in Paris provides enough proof to allow me to categorize her as 'adventurous' perhaps, 'impulsive', throughly 'enamoured' with her adopted city and possessing that "je-ne-sais-quoi" that gives us pause. <BR><BR>Meeting Frederic while on a journalistic assignment in Bucharest throws a curve ball in Australian-born Sarah's easy-care wash-and-wear lifestyle where getting dressed up means making sure there isn't any caked mud embedded in the soles of her Doc Martens. On a romantic whim, she takes Frederic up on his offer to visit him in Paris, and suddenly Sarah finds herself living in the City of Lights where her honed communication skills become meaningless in the whirlwind of French. <BR><BR>Language is not the sole barrier keeping Sarah outside the proverbial candy store window with her nose pressed up against the glass. She doesn't quite understand the French social situation where quiet mannered restraint is the order of the day. In chapter after chapter of amusing Anglo-Saxon vs. French/Latin anecdotes and speculations, Sarah allows us a sparkling glimpse of her personal epiphanies: how acquiring a dog allowed her otherwise forbidden entry, why wearing sweatpants in the street lowers the standards of an entire city, how she could NEVER eat low-fat again, how the Latin interpretation of the law leads to furtive games played opposite the French authorities, how wording something in seemingly flowery language lands her the money needed to sponser her journalism course and why becoming "almost French" isn't nearly as important as "just being yourself." Sarah is certainly not 'spoiled', she's just a victim of intense culture shock. Her revelations are imparted with a cozy friendly narrative sprinkled with just enough dialogue to imbue each character with some depth. I would like hear more from her in a further book as the shock wears off or new shocks electrify with new situations. <BR><BR>Readers expecting the details of Sarah's personal relationship with Frederic, her future husband, to be spun out like a rich romantic fairytale, be warned; even though the book is subtitled love and a new life in Paris, the love portion remains private; she relates only that they met in Bucharest, connected and suddenly were living together in France. The reader catches glimpses of Frederic as the quintessential Frenchman; the memoir focuses on Sarah's adjustment, not to Frederic, but to his country and its occupants. It makes for charming light reading and is recommended to all who like travel essays and don't mind a change from finding the provincial country idyll to discovering the heartbeat of a city.</span>

                    <span>Almost French is the story of how Sarah Turnbull, an Australian, moves to Paris and slowly becomes French herself. She covers many of the cultural differences that served as stumbling blocks for herself and anyone else who might find themselves in the same situation. She manages to lift the veil on the reason why Parisians are generally considered rude......the simple fact that they don't know you and that it takes time (alot of time) to build a friendship there. It also serves as an informative eye-opener for anyone who may be considering a visit to France with its abundance of useful information for getting by. Definitely recommended for any Francophile or potential visitors.</span>
