                    <span>The movie sound track is lovely as is and the vocals detract from it. And one might surmise that Robert Wyatt, whose voice is cited for its "strangeness" in the promo, does indeed have a strange voice that sound strained and amateurish, further detracting from the enjoyment. Besides vocals add a further unnecessary and distracting dimension that is out of place in context of the motion picture's concentration on birds and accompanying music staying in the background.<P>Oh, for the days when sound tracks were left as is instead of inserting "enhancements."</span>

                    <span>I disagree that the soundtrack detracts from the film. I walk by a movie theatre nightly on my way home, and, not having enjoyed MicroCosmos at all, I was avoiding this film due to the association. One night however, I needed something to relax and unwind after a terrible day at the office. Within the first few minutes of Winged Migration, I was awestruck, and, various scenes made me gasp aloud -- the migration over the Great Wall of China was almost a fantasy painting, as is the aerospace view looking down on white geese crossing the Earth. I too, came away with a more respectful attitude to the planet, grasping at once that the few "ugly" scenes of the birds waddling through muck were the result of man, not nature. Accompanying all of this beautiful visual imagery was a soundtrack which at times was amusing, timing classical rhythyms with the mating dance of birds, at times restful and serene, and at times energizing. The music is not non-stop throughout the movie, but instead, fades in and out as a gentle reminder that music, too, is a gift, whether man-made, or bird-made. I came away from the film feeling as if I'd just taken a one hour stress break, and immediately wanted the soundtrack.</span>

                    <span>I thought that this was one of the best soundtracks that I have ever heard, to go along with one of the finest movies/documentaries that I have ever seen. If you are a nature lover and one who doesn't live or die with a movie based on special effects, this movie can't be beat. In addition, I thought that the cinematography was absolutely fantastic. The sky & earth all around the birds themselves really comes alive. This movie teaches you as the music and visuals capture your soul. Finally, to hear more great (and very similiar) music, check out microcosmos, also by Jacques Perrin. The music is outstanding and the film is great, too (although I think winged migration is much better).</span>
