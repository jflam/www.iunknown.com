                <span id="Label1">Cryptography isn't all there is to security. But rendering information unintelligible to those without the proper key usually plays a big role in any networked data-sharing system. <I>Java Cryptography</I> shows the Java programmer (with or without crypto experience) how to implement ciphers, keys, and other data-obscuring techniques in Java. <p> The Java language includes lots of classes that are designed to facilitate cryptography, and this book explores them in depth. Key management classes, random-number generators, signed applets, and other parts of the Java security mechanism get attention in these pages. But most interesting are the author's examples. He has written a complete implementation of the ElGamal cipher as a provider in the framework of the Java Security API. If you want to understand how the Provider Architecture works, this is what you need to examine. Don't look here for an explanation of the mathematics, however. <p> In addition to his discussions and examples for individual pieces of the cryptography infrastructure and his implementation of the ElGamal system, Knudsen includes two nifty crypto-enabled programs: a chat system and an e-mail system.</span>

                    <span>This book is intended to teach experienced Java programmers how to add cryptographic elements to their applications. The text is not intended to teach encryption algorithms, basic Java programming, or the overall Java security model: there are other books that fulfill those functions. There is one other limitation: much of the book relies on the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) which are only available to those in the United States and Canada (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).<P>Chapter one lists some fundamentals of encryption and the relationship to security. There are also a couple of programs right off the bat that will let you explore message digests, and encrypting and decrypting messages. The basics of confidentiality, authentication, and some major cryptographic algorithms are outlined in chapter two. The explanations are quite terse, but not out of line with the aim of the book. Java Security Architecture (JCA) is explained in chapter three, along with a quick overview of the API (Application Programming Interface) and SPI (Service Provider Interface). Chapter four introduces Java's own pseudo-random number generator, plus programming for key seeds from keyboard timing. Key management, in chapter five, is somewhat weak. The APIs only deal with hierarchical key certification, but this may simply be an example of Knudsen dealing strictly with the language, and leaving the concepts to others. I was, however, bemused at some passages that may have suffered from a lack of copy editing: for example, one section that seemed to confuse production of Message Authentication Codes with working on Macintosh computers. Authentication of various types is covered quite well in chapter six. Chapter seven's guide to encryption covers details not normally dealt with in cryptography texts because it must handle all matters related to getting an encryption algorithm to actually function in an application.<P>Chapter eight gives enough detail about signed applets to prove that they are going to be browser specific for a while. Security provider programming is covered in chapter nine, using the ElGamal algorithm as an example. A sample application is created using an encrypted version of the talk utility in chapter ten. An e-mail application is created in chapter eleven using th provider previously generated in chapter nine. Chapter twelve closes off by looking at security design for the system overall.<P>Appendices review BigInteger arithmetic in Java, the Base64 encoding scheme (an option for converting binary objects to text characters for e-mailing), Java archive files, Javakey, and a quick reference for the Java cryptography classes as covered in the book.<P>Knudsen states that the book is written, as far as possible, without assuming any prior knowledge of cryptography. In this aim he succeeds rather well. The programmer with no background in encryption can still add a reasonable layer of security to his or her application. Those who study further, of course, will be able to ensure a higher level of protection and reliability.</span>

                    <span>There's no better first book on cryptography for a programmer to buy. You get a great deal of exposure to an important facet of network security through this little gem. It's friendly and to the point.<P>The Java API is excellent--but the idea of cryptography is little odd to the everyday web or network application programmer. Having someone to kindly bridge the crypto-what-ja-ma-call-its to a world of how-do-i-wrap-it-around-my-web-or-mail-service is simply priceless. There's NO silly cryptomath (because only those cryptoexperts get the math anyway) but instead it's filled with no-nonsense coverage of how each and every common crypto engine and crypto-"protocol" takes your stream of data and converts them to cryptograms. If you always like to learn as MUCH as you could about a particular computational wonder tool before tackling a project without turning your brain to mush with research mathematics--you'll like this book.<P>It's just one of those books I wished I read a lot earlier so I won't have an excuse to avoid APIs that exposes applied cryptography to network applications all these years. I highly recommend this book before you head on to the math of it.<P>It's too bad the SSL/TLS API for Java never made it into this first edition (it did make it into O'Reilly's latest Java network programming book though).<P>Any one know of a book just like this one but for another language like C or Perl? With a book like this you don't need to explain it all over again--but illustration and snippets of code showing how to use the various APIs in other languages would be useful. I think if the author is willing to dabble into all of these issues and give away his findings on a book website it will be just AWESOME! A second edition of said book with all of these issues covered would be just grand too :-)<P>P.S. When I started learning Perl I first bought Mastering Regular Expression. Because I felt that with Perl--it really simplifies one's ability to play with streams of text. And what better way to learn the language (especially if you know some basics about it) than to learn what it is brilliant at right away?! That's how I felt about Java Cryptography. The way Java makes network programming not only easy.. but also fun to add in complexities like security and cryptography makes it a very enjoyable programming language to work with as a student or as a programmer. This is the sort of book you'll want to read ASAP once you get the basics of Java the language down! :-)</span>

                    <span>Are you concerned about someone outside your company intercepting a password between your applet and your server? Are you worried about someone inside your company using a packet sniffer to capture the credit card numbers of your customers? No? Well, perhaps you should be! As a first step towards closing your security holes you should pick up a copy of "Java Cryptography". This book is written for the experienced Java developer with no cryptography background who needs to build cryptography into their application. The book starts off with a brief description of secure systems and demonstrates a "Hello zoT1WY1NJA0=!" program. It then gives a fairly detailed description of cryptographic concepts and the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Subsequent chapters discuss how to use the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). Chapter 5 covers generating and managing symmetric and asymmetric keys with an explanation of the difference. Chapter 6 discusses authenticating users and messages. Signatures and certificates are covered. Chapter 7 covers encryption techniques using different types of ciphers. Chapter 8 covers signing applets. The last chapters include sample encrypted chat and e-mail programs. The end result is a book that provides excellent coverage of cryptography in Java. The only defect in the book is that it is three years old (Java 2 was in beta). Fortunately, the book was written recently enough to include the new utilities used in Java 2. Even though a new edition is desirable, "Java Cryptography" still stands alone as the best book available on this topic.</span>
