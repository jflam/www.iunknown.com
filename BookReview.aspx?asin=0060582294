                <span id="Label1"><p>Amanda Eyre Ward's debut novel is an intimate portrait of three women whose lives collide during a brutal Texas summer.</p> <p>In Gatestown, Texas, twenty-nine-year-old Karen Lowens awaits her execution with a host of convicted serial killers on death row. In Manhattan, Dr. Franny Wren, also twenty-nine, tends to a young cancer patient, and resists the urge to run from her fianc&#233; and her carefully crafted life. In Austin, Texas, brassy Celia Mills, a once-vibrant librarian, mourns her murdered husband.</p> <p>Over the course of the summer, fate pushes these eerily recognizable women together, culminating in a revelation of the possibility of faith, the responsibility of friendship, and the value of life. <i>Sleep Toward Heaven</i> is a luminous story of murder and desire, solitude and grace -- a rare literary page-turner where redemption seems perpetually within arm's reach.</p></span>

                    <span>Sleep Toward Heaven is a must read! Amanda Eyre Ward has done a brilliant job at stepping into the of lives of 3 *empty* women and making them *whole* again!!<P>I can't say enough good things about this book. It was just amazing. I had very strong opinions on death sentences before reading this book ~ never in a million years would I think a novel could *open me up* some and make me see things through new eyes. Things went through my mind and heart, that I never thought could.. Amanda wrote this book with such dignity and grace ~ that all bled right through to each of the 3 women this book was based around. I, honestly, forgot this was fiction. I felt so wrapped up in it ~ like I was living right along with the story. With such tough subjects touched upon ~ such as murder, AIDS, lethal injection, end of a relationship, death of a child.... and so on ~ you would think the book would be *dark*. It was far from dark! It started out with a chill but ended up warm and cozy.<P>Thank you, Amanda, for showing that everyone has a bit of grace within. Whether it's deep down or right on the surface ~ it can be found!</span>

                    <span>I was forced to stay up late into the night last night to finish this novel. That is to say that I just could not tear my eyes from the page, even after I finally closed this book, I lay awake thinking about it. When a book can do that it deserves the highest rating there is to give (and from a first time novelist no less!)<P>How do we forgive the unforgivable? That is the question that is at the crux of this well etched novel. This is a novel about women on death row, but just to say that would be selling this book incredibly too short. The story centers around three women: Celia, Franny, and Karen. Their lives become inextricably entertwined during a few short months in the hot Texas summer. All three have dealt with copious amounts of sadness throughout their lives and in the end have managed to work through it with tremendous grace. <P>This is a compelling read, very vivid, poetic. Ms. Eyre-Ward's style and her characters are memorable, no nonsense and very very real. I look forward to more by this author!! I have read many really good books so far this year, but the hours I spent engulfed in this story and these women's lives were the most rewarding.</span>

                    <span>I fully agree with the reviewers who gave this wonderful book 5 stars. I began reading this book in the afternoon, read off and on the rest of the day, and couldn't go to sleep until I finished it. The way the author weaves together the three women and their places in the story is engrossing. If this is Ms. Ward's first novel, I can't wait for more.</span>

                    <span>For a first book by an author,this is very good.The only<BR>objection I had,was the style of the linked characters<BR>each telling their story.I thought it jumped around in the<BR>beginning and I had to go back and check their status,with<BR>each chapter.<BR> That said,the story draws you into the failed romance of<BR>Dr. Fran Wren,a New York City physician,and her failed<BR>medical mistakes.Franny decides to leave her fiance,and<BR>return to her roots in Waco,Texas.<BR> Outside of Waco,is a women's prison where Franny's<BR>Uncle,Dr. Wren,spent some of his time attending to<BR>the patients.Dr. Jack Wren,dies suddenly and Franny<BR>is asked to temporarily take his place.<BR> Reluctantly,Fran agrees to treat the women,some who<BR>are on Death Row.The women she finds herself assigned<BR>to are distinguished by names like Satan Killer,The<BR>Black Widow,(a serial bride who poisoned her husbands),<BR>and Karen,who is HIV-positive,and sentenced to die.<BR>Karen was terribly abused by men all her life-but she<BR>also took innocent life and that is debated in this<BR>book,along with Capital punishment.<BR> It ends with almost an O.Henry ending,impossible<BR>to guess.<BR> I hope Ms. Ward writes more books.I am waiting</span>
