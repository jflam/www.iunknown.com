                <span id="Label1">Walter Payton, whose tragic death from liver disease stunned and saddened the sports world, ran to glory in 13 thrill-packed seasons with the Chicago Bears before retiring in 1987, and this video serves as a tribute to his exploits on the field as well as his contributions in charitable endeavors. At first thought to be too short, too slow, and too small to have a professional career as a running back, Payton worked hard to make himself one of the game's all-time great runners. Interviews with colleagues, including Payton's coach with the Bears, Mike Ditka, as well as interviews with Payton himself, are interspersed with game films in this very professional presentation that tells the Payton story in vivid detail. As a production of NFL Films, the video features the trademarked gorgeously shot footage (complete with stirring background music) that shows Payton's intensely physical style of play to great advantage. One former opponent explains that Payton never took the easy way out, and at times would purposely initiate hard contact with a defender. And perhaps Mike Ditka sums it all up when he comments that though Payton wasn't physically large, "he had heart." Walter Payton was a respected and beloved athlete, and <I>Pure Payton</I> is a wonderful tribute to one of football's all-time greats. <I>--Robert J. McNamara</I> </span>

                    <span>In it you'll not only find Walter greatest runs, dives and jumps, you will also find a piece of legend, a charismatic human which range of influence ran far off football. This video is great because it's such a strong advocate for a sport sometimes underevaluated. Along with the incredible runs, stiff arms or Td's only Payton could make, you'll find a unique positive and winning attitude for every young player to watch. But 50 mins, that's short !!</span>

                    <span>I have literally watched this video 35 times and I can never seem to get enough. Every time I watch it I come away with more insight about Walter himself. Growing up in Chicago I came to know and appreciate Walter on a local level, but since his death I have come to appreciate him more and more. This is a must see video if you need inspiration or an uplift.</span>

                    <span>Untill now i've only seen him in the music videoclip "Superbowl Shuffle" and his first and only Superbowl appearance. Man, i've been rewinding the video a lot times to view it once again. It gets me pumped up everytime viewing it. He's a bull with a grace of an antelope. Now i understand why he's such a legend.
