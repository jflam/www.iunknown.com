                <span id="Label1">   An updated picture of the trials and triumphs of today's entrepreneur increase the company's bottom line. <P>    Starting a business involves inevitable ups and downs, for first-time as well as experienced entrepreneurs.  This updated, expanded edition by Jan Norman, one of the nation's foremost small business authorities, guides  readers through every stage of business start-up, from planning to marketing. <P>    <i>What No One Ever Tells You about Starting Your Own Business</i> is designed for people who are launching a business, whether they be first-time entrepreneurs or people who have been tripped up by the start-up process  before and want to do it right this time.  Using the real-life experiences of 101 successful business owners, Norman combines practical, straightforward how-to advice with interesting and memorable narratives.  The updated second  edition includes: <br> * Thirty new start-up stories from successful         entrepreneurs. <br> * All-new advice about how to make maximum use of the         Internet. <br> * An expanded resources section with helpful         information about start-up assistance. <br> * Detailed how-to tips about writing business plans,        selecting the right business, what financial records        to keep, and more. <P>    The eye-opening lessons from successful business owners who learned the hard way are akin to hiring a personal entrepreneurial coach to point out potential roadblocks in advance.</span>

                    <span>How much is it worth to you to know in advance how to avoid costly mistakes when starting or running a business?<P>Multiply that by 101.<P>This book contains 101 lessons learned the hard way by 101 successful entrepreneurs. That's 101 lessons we readers get to learn the easy way.<P>Ms. Norman's book is invaluable not only for the brave souls considering starting their own business, but also for those who have been in business for years.<P>In fact business veterans probably can appreciate even more than novices the value of avoiding costly mistakes.<P>In a highly readable, anecdotal format, Ms. Norman relates the stories of 101 successful entrepreneurs who learned business lessons the hard way.<P>The value of these insights is immeasurable.<P>The bottom line is there are 101 potential mistakes that you can avoid by learning from the experiences of successful business owners. It's like having 101 free consultants, each expert in his or her field.<P>Ms. Norman also provides a handy list of resources, including internet, association and corporate contacts.<P>She also encourages readers to contact her with their stories so she may continue the good work, perhaps in a sequel or in her newspaper column published nationally.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Based on the weight of the positive reviews, I purchased this book, thinking that it would be packed with down to earth advice from grizzled business veterans who had lived to tell the tale. It is and it isn't. <P>I came away disappointed after reading this patchwork collection of stories.<P>This book is divided into six thematic sections: 1) Look before You Leap, 2) Early Decisions, 3) The Money Chase, 4) Management Issues, 5) Helping Hand(s) and 6) Marketing. Each section has a collection of anecdotes to drive home a particular message, followed by "tips" that further reinforce the main theme. Anecdotes cover the gamut from reinforcing the standard "I wish I had more money" to "I wish I was more prepared" or "I wish I didn't prepare so much". Unfortunately, I felt as if some of the "advice" conflicted with some other "advice" presented in a section. <P>On the plus side, there are a few inspirational nuggets, and I personally enjoyed reading about one or two individuals who started from scratch to build large businesses. For the most part the stories focus on common sense advice. <P>If you are looking for a book to help shape your business plan or guide your actions, this book probably won't help you. <P>If, on the other hand, you have never started a business or thought about it, you might find the book interesting.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the other reviewers who said this book is pretty basic. However, there are a few nuggets of information, if you search for them.<P>Not the best book on business. I would recommend that you borrow it from a library or get it from a used book store.</span>

                    <span>Judging by the raving reviews for this book, I was expecting something spectacular. I came away feeling that I was cheated.<P>While the book is not bad, it is not worthy of the raving 5 star reviews and acclaim that it has recieved. I can only think that the reviews were shills or people who are terribly naive to business.<P>Not bad...but not great. Definitely not 5 star material.</span>
