                    <span>This book evidently is the result of a disertation as it has the typical structure of such a document. It really needs to be read in conjunction with other books on Russian History to get its full impact. It is highly documented with lots of notes. It gives Russian history a new look, telling you why Russia had to do certain things. It was very enlightening and well organized and written. I would give it a must buy recommendation.</span>

                    <span>When I read this book as a young university student in the early 1970s, it kindled an interest that has endured to this day. In fact, I went on to graduate school in Russian Area Studies and spent 16 years as a Soviet specialist in the Department of Defense, primarily as a result of the reading and study sparked by Billington's masterpiece. It is not conventional history. People have asked me again and again to explain why the Russians believe or behave in a particular manner. I refer them to "The Icon and the Axe." If it is possible to explain a People (as the Russians would say a "narod"), Billington does so. Truly a great work.</span>

                    <span>James Billington, the present (2000) Librarian Of Congress, was well known as an expert on the subject of the Soviet Union and Russia prior to his 1989 appointment by President George Bush as head of "the Nation's Library" (as Billington likes to label LC). His 1970 book about the roots of Russian culture and cultural history should be on the bookshelf of any person who seeks to understand Russia. He wrote it during his days as a Harvard U. history professor and put a lot of work into it. The result is a very thick (some would say huge) volume which discusses and presents the influences in Russian history, religion, and culture which have brought that country to the present age.<P>Billington is a comic book New England blue blood, like the U.S. President who appointed him Librarian Of Congress. He is a direct descendant of the Mayflower Billingtons, was schooled at Princeton University and later at Oxford U. in England. Many thought his Librarian Of Congress appointment might be a preliminary step to his becoming U.S. ambassador to Russia, but his boss, Mr. Bush, was not reelected in 1992, as expected, so Mr. Billington remained as LC chief for the following decade up to the present time.<P>Billington tells an interesting tale in his book about Russia. The influences of Asia on the Moscow headquartered country barely located in Europe give the Russian cultural tradition an oriental caste difficult for western countries to understand and identify with. Russia has always been a mysterious country to westerners, Mr. Billington informs us, and this has been a headache for Russian leaders. Peter the Great made a point of bringing French culture to Russia, and trying to "westernize" the Moscow capital so western diplomats, whose help the Czar needed, wouldn't be scared off (or at least as scared off as before). Peter The Great was partially successful, but the continuing Russian traditions and the eastern/Asian personality of these traditions didn't go away for Peter the Great or his successors, right down to the Communist Party leaders of post-1918 Russia and the U.S.S.R. The result, according to Billington, is that Russia always was and still is a "wanna be" western country.<P>James Billington relates a fascinating and brutal tale of an oriental country trying to become western for centuries, and mostly failing, stuck with the reality of its past. It is a tale of politics and poignance well worth buying and reading. His book is now 30 years old, yet it stands as a classic all libraries and individuals interested in Russia should obtain and re-read often.</span>

                    <span>The subtitle of this book, "an interpretive history of Russian culture", accurately warns the reader about what he is going to encounter. It is not a Russian history book, and in fact you may want to keep an outline history of Russia handy to get names and dates straight. It is also rather different from the usual run of "cultural histories", whether topical, like A.L. Basham's admirable book, "The Wonder that was India" or Elizabeth Massey's bedside book on Russian culture, "Land of the Firebird." Billington has written an interpretive history. While staying within a chronological framework, he talks at length about various topics that he finds illuminating, even if they are out of the mainstream curriculum on Russian history, art or literature.<P>In the hands of some other writer, this could lead to an eccentric collection of pet subjects being aired for our review, but in this case the result is consistently absorbing and illuminating. In fact, the book is something of a Christmas turkey, cram packed with all sorts of odd snippets of lore about Russia; the notes alone are fascinating reading. And it all manages to hang together and create a coherent picture. Indeed, it sometimes seems that Billington is trying to create an image of Russia that haunts you in a sweet, melancholy sort of way, rather like a Tchaikovsky symphony.<P>In fact, you may feel it hangs together a bit too well; to the less romantically inclined, it may be a bit too pat. Certainly the same themes run through the book, and Billington himself refers to the "irony" of Russian history. But make no mistake - there is an incredible amount of scholarship here, to the extent that you find yourself wondering how one person could actually be so familiar with so much material. If you are the sort of person that loves things Russian to the point of being obsessive (and there are a surprising number of us out there) the book is a must read.</span>

                    <span>I had expected this book to be a more traditional political and military history, a "who and where" type. This book is actually a very thorough handling of Russian religion, art and literature. The author seems to assume that the reader already knows basic facts of Russian history, such as its leaders, its major wars, etc. However, even if the reader is not familiar with these aspects of history, the book is still very readable. I feel I have a greater understanding of Russian literature and culture than I might have with a more traditional history. It is unfortunate that the the book only covers up to the mid 1960s, because the events of the past 15 years are unprecedented since the revolution of 1917.</span>
