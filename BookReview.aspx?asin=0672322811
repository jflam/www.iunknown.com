                <span id="Label1"><P><I>XSL Formatting Objects Developer's Handbook</I> is a syntactical reference and a guide for developing practical solutions using the complete XSL toolkit.  In exploring the available tools and architectures, the book allows programmers to understand and apply XSL as practitioners.  XSL-FO is a complex specification that provides a framework for describing detailed document formatting characteristics.  A primary goal of XML is to separate the data from presentation.  Unlike HTML documents, XML documents contain no information about how those documnets will appear when displayed.  The XSL-FO specification provides a standardized way to build stylesheets that express document formatting in pure XML notation.</P></span>

                    <span>I rated the book 4 stars because it provides solid examples in many areas of XSL FO that actually work. Even though the W3C recommendation has been out since October, 2001, we have just started to see accessible books on XSL FO, and this is the best. The author provides a hands-on view and gives you examples that work and get you up and going quickly. Not a lot of wading through esoterica wondering how you would even get started with a simple document.<P>However, that is not to say that the book is without problems. Let me list them in order:<P>1. Software that will format XSL FO is in its infancy. Therefore, although the examples work, you have to burn some shoe leather finding software that is compliant with the spec. It would have been better if the author had bundled an evaluation copy of either the Antenna House software which he claimed would format *almost* all of the examples or his own XFC software that he developed for IBM alphaworks. I did download the XFC software, but although written in Java, it is very much oriented towards a windows platform, and I could not concoct a way to get it to run on my linux machine (I gave up after discovering I had a non-compliant version of the xerces package). I think one of the reasons Michael Kay's Wrox XSLT book has been so popular has been because of his work on Saxon. Software would have made this book a 5 star book.<P>2. Downloadable examples. These were not available at first, but the author had them up within a week of my email, correcting an error on the publisher's web page. So, this went from a problem to a plus.<P>3. Pagination (Chapter 8) is not very clear. Some of the figure references seem to have been reversed (generally, in many places where the author refers to figure 8.1 you should read 8.2 and vice versa). This chapter needed a concrete example to start. Then the author could have gotten into the more esoteric issue of overlapping regions.</span>
