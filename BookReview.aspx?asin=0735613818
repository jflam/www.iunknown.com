                <span id="Label1">Ounce for ounce and dollar for dollar, the Pocket Consultant series from Microsoft Press is one of the best values around. The editors do a good job of recruiting competent authors and having them comply with well-thought-out style and formatting rules. <I>Microsoft Windows XP Professional Administrator's Pocket Consultant</I> is one of the gems of the series. Author William Stanek has spent time working with his subject--this book wasn't rushed to market to match the Windows XP release date--and he's good at revealing its administrative procedures clearly and concisely. The book is nicely indexed, so locating the section you need takes very little effort. This book--slightly larger than a paperback novel--is ideal for a harried administrator responsible for many different software products, as well as for consultants who need to learn how to use Windows XP Professional in a hurry.<p>  A particularly nice characteristic of Stanek's style: His skill at combining straight procedures ("Just follow these steps and it'll work") with supplementary information about options ("On the other hand, if you're doing something unusual, you might need to modify the standard procedure a bit"). As no real-life installation of Windows XP ever seems to match authors' ideas of normalcy, the supplementary information is critical. Screen shots are nicely handled as well. Their presence helps clarify what the text means, but they're not so large as to waste space. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Microsoft Windows XP Professional, as system administrators need to understand it. The author explains hardware installation, permissions setting, network security zones, and several kinds of network connectivity. Coverage of the specific requirements of mobile users--including virtual private networks (VPNs) and dial-up--is particularly welcome.</span>

                    <span>This book takes apart the XP operating system from top to bottom and everything in between. Taking it from desktop configuration to user access to mobile networking to troubleshooting. One thing I really liked about the text is the thoroughness throughout the book and the step by step procedures to show you how to configure and manage different parts of the OS. I'd also recommend as a study guide for the 70-270 exam as well.
<br />
<br />On the XP upgrade just completed this book saved my bacon several times. I am certainly glad to have this in my technical library.</span>

                    <span>Normally if it says Stanek on the cover I buy it without hesitation but like another reader I wondered if I should get the 2nd edition when I saw it. As someone who read and highly valued the 1st edition of this book I was skeptical that the service pack 2 would have such a large impact. However, after I skimmed this book and ended up purchasing it I am glad I did. Service pack 2 changes so many things and is such an extensive upgrade that the 2nd edition is really helpful. The 2nd edition is much more detailed and helpful. The sections on networking and security are also a big help. The new chapters are very helpful. The new networking and security features are radically different and make this book a great purchase. I believe this book has made me more productive and really improved my use of the OS.</span>

                    <span>I bought William Stanek's XP Pocket consultant when it first came out. When I saw the second edition, I grabbed it right away too and I am very glad I did. It is the only XP book I use now and it gets borrowed out so much I had my manager get a second copy for the office.
<br />
<br />What's so good about it? For starters, there's over 200 pages of new material and it is the only book I've found that details every change from Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2. Turn to page 55 and 56 for an example of how deep Stanek gets into the details. This covers Data Execution Protection, No execute page protection, and Physical Address Extension mode.
<br />
<br />Like Stanek's Windows Server 2003 Pocket Consultant, I don't think you can find a better book for beginners and advanced. Plus there's details consultants and experts will find invaluable.</span>

                    <span>Another excellent book from William Stanek. This a wonderful resource; especially for people like  me, who are always on the go. From page one to the last, book offers tips and trick at every page. This book has been close on hand since I bought it and will remain for the forseeable future. Mr. Stanek has once again written a valuable book that is easy to use and understand.</span>
