                    <span>This third edition was basically written by mid-2001, in the shakeout of the dotcoms. In spite of the intervening period of almost 4 years, the book feels relatively up-to-date on the technical side although the recent mergers in the telecom industry might need to be addressed by the author.
<br />
<br />The book, as stated by the author, is intended to clarify technologies, trends, and history in the telecom industry. Although it provides an overview of tech, that is not is its strength; placing the terminology in the context of the structure and the history of the telecom industry is. The book is not meant for IT specialists but people like myself that need to know enough about hardware, protocols, and systems to ensure clear communication about the telecom needs of the enterprise.
<br />
<br />Although the book is not as technical as some might like, I felt the author did a thorough job covering the structure of telecom industry and the impact of the regulatory environment, not just in the developed countries but the emerging markets of the global marketplace also. The international background, histories, mergers and aquisitions help provide a context.
<br />
<br />Interestingly, Dodds foresaw the importance of VoIP internationally as well as the fixed wireless leap for emerging markets. Those topics remain on the front burner. All in all, this is great book to start with. It explains all the key technologies with adequate detail while exploring options for SMBs with significant trends placed in a historical and regulatory context. I recommend it for the "new kids on the block". </span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book and overall found it to be very informative. It covers a general overview of everything from the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to telecommunications around the world. Landline, wireless, and internet are all covered along with the technologies that make them work. With that being said, this book will NOT make you an expert in telephony or any specific area of telecommunications. It is however, a great start.<p>The one problem I had with the book was numerous grammatical errors. I found that in some cases I had to mentally disassemble and rebuild a sentence to understand what was trying to be said.<p>I would (and have) recommend this book to a coworker and/or friend getting started with telecommunications.</span>

                    <span>Magnificent! Perfect example of a Technology book everyone can relate too. After finishing this one, I was desperately looking for any other technology book written by this author, couldn't find any. Looking forward to find more books from this Author..</span>

                    <span>I read this book while I was a legal intern at the FCC to try to learn the tech side of the telecom world. I knew policy, but I had no idea how the telephone network actually worked. This book gives a great basic grounding in the technology of telecommunications-switches, routers, time division multiplexing, and everything else.<br> <br>Luckily, basic is exactly what I needed. The "tell it to me like I'm a two-year-old" approach might be frustrating for some advanced readers. I found myself skipping some of the sections on the Internet because it was too elementary for me. <br> <br>Also, if you're going to read it, make sure you get the latest edition of this book. Technologies change fast, and some of the sections are bound to become out-of-date very quickly.<br> <br>Once you have the tech side down, you can pick up the regulatory policy side by reading The Telecommunications Regulation Handbook available for free from the World Bank. It's just as basic as Dodd's book, but is better read if you know how the technology works. Get these two under your belt, and you'll be ready to work at your local friendly telecom regulatory agency.</span>

                    <span>The Essential Guide to Telecommunications is probably one of the most well written and useful telecom books you will find.. <p>Annabel Z. Dodd does a great job in capturing a snapshot of the current telecom industry, in all of its different flavors. You will find technical overviews of numerous telecom technologies and transport methods. These include business telephone systems, circuit switching, local and long distance networks, cable, wireless, cellular and PCS, paging, Voice Over IP, satellites, broadband services, DSL, T-1's, ISDN, ATM, and much, much more. <p>Dodd's writing is understandable and enjoyable to read. Even those with little or no technical knowledge should be able to understand the text. The author seems to assume that the reader has only a minimal amount of technical knowledge, but does know something about the telecom industry in general. This is the perfect book for telecom salespeople who want to learn more about the products and services they are selling, or for those who just want to keep up-to-date on the latest in telecom technology. <p>This book not only gives you explanations of how various telecom technologies work, but compares them side-by-side from both technical and practical (business) points of view. <p>Where and when does using a wireless network make sense? What type of fiber offers the most capacity? How many T-1's are in a T-3? You will find the answer to all of these questions and more in The Essential Guide to Telecommunications. I highly recommend it.</span>
