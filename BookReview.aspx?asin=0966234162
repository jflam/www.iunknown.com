                    <span>This book gave me a lot of useful ideas.  I modified the games to fit my needs but the ideas where there. I borrowed it from the library and had to buy a copy for myself.  What a great investment!</span>

                    <span>I was looking for a book to provide team-building, but this book has more group familiarization activities.  The activities seem to provide strangers the opportunity to get to know each other.  For managers trying to provide team-building activites, I reccommend Quick Teambuilding Activities for Busy Managers: 50 Exercises That Get Results in Just 15 Minutes by Brian Cole Miller.

                    <span>I was really nicely surprised when I saw that such an unexpensive book can have so many great ideas. I truly consider Team-Building Activities for Every Group to be one of the best books available that promotes cooperative learning.</span>

                    <span>Good book with good activities.  Some are more involved than others and require some hefty prep and set up (if that's a problem, check out Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activities book, it's similar, but only has short, quick activities for when you are on a time crunch). I especially liked the writing format here, easy to skim the activities and quickly grasp the essense so you can decide if this is the one you wanna use!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book to supplement the team building games provided by BSA. I was extremely pleased with the games that are offered in this book. We decided to try "Cup Stack" at one of our first training sessions, and since then it has become a staple game for us. The variety of games available has enabled us to create a completely new variation of Junior Leader Training every time out. I have just ordered Alanna's second book to enhance our program even further.</span>
