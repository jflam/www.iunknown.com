                <span id="Label1"> In recent years, Microsoft has become more than just Bill Gates&#146;s company. Steve  Ballmer is now the CEO, overseeing a Goliath that has been plagued by a federal antitrust  trial, an employee exodus prompted by the dot-com revolution, and an ongoing economic  downturn. But Microsoft has not only survived; it has thrived, prospering to the point that  it is the second most recognizable brand in the world (behind Coca-Cola). <P> Bestselling author Robert Slater explains exactly how the company has adapted in the last  few years, taking readers into Microsoft&#146;s inner circle to tell an amazing story of  persistence in the face of adversity. Slater describes the many changes that have led to a  new corporate culture, a new strategic direction, new product lines, and new ways of  doing business worldwide. <P> There have been many books about Microsoft over the years, but this one brings the story  right up to the present, with fresh insights and information. Slater was granted  unprecedented access to the company&#146;s notoriously press-shy top brass, including  extensive interviews with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.</span>

                    <span>The book is ok, but it really doesn't give much detailed surpising information.  
<br />
<br />Gates is a brilliant guy.  Whether you like him or not, he is brilliant.  That much should be self-evident to anyone, but the book, unfortunately, doesn't give much insight into him as a person or as a corporate leader.
<br />
<br />To me the most interesting part of Microsoft was the startup phase, the struggle against the odds to dominate a dynamic industry filled with giants like IBM and HP.  The book, however, unfortunately deals mostly with Microsoft as of late.  And Microsoft as of late is just a big stodgy company that deliberately stifles innovation for startups, disparages  open source, and hooks its customers with upgrades and complex licensing schemes.  Microsoft has become the new IBM of old.

<br />I was hoping for a professional, objective look at Microsoft in 2004.  Something that would be of help to business managers in dealing with change in a dynamic economy as well as the community of users of Microsoft products.  What I got reads like propaganda written by Microsoft Public Relations Department.
<br />
<br />The nonsense begins on the very first page with the author's statement (page vii):
<br />
<br />  "He [Bill Gates] had, after all, almost singularly brought about the personal computer revolution."
<br />
<br />This statement displays such a total ignorance of the history of the personal computer, that it brings into question not just the author's credibility, but also his connectivity to the real world. Like Jobs, Wozniak, IBM (Estridge and Lowe), Intel (Grove), Kildall, Shugart, etc. never existed.
<br />
<br />As the book wore on, it became apparent that this statement was not just an isolated misunderstanding; this guy simply worships Gates and, to a lesser extent, Ballmer. "... both [Gates and Ballmer] had become high-tech icons" (page 209).  I lost count of number of times this guy used the phrase "great software" to describe Microsoft's product, which is right out of the mouth of Bill Gates. (This author has apparently never actually USED any Microsoft software.)
<br />
<br />The book is written from authorized interviews with MS employees including Gates, Ballmer and senior executives.  That perspective is apparent.
<br />
<br />The changes the author discusses at length and amount to the "rebooting" are:
<br />  - Promoting Ballmer to CEO
<br />  - Reorganizing into 7 divisisons
<br />  - Dropping employee stock options
<br />  - Bringing in a bunch of Human Resources people
<br />  - Settling the anti-trust law suits with payoffs
<br />  - Gates Foundation and his widely-publicized visits to Africa and India
<br />
<br />Reorganizing into divisions had simply become necessary to manage and control a company that had grown to 55,000 employees. Regarding stock options, the author never mentioned that accounting rules were changed to require companies to charge them to expense in the current period.  If Microsoft thinks bringing in a bunch of Human Resources people will help, then they have had no experience with HR people.  That will cause more misery than the DOJ. As far as Gates philanthropy, even Al Capone funded soup kitchens.
<br />
<br />The author repeats countless times Ballmer's statements that these changes will create a culture of "a more open and respectful Microsoft" Page 225: "He [Ballmer] said yes, there  was a kinder and gentler Microsoft afoot."  A "kinder and gentler Microsoft."  Really?  From Ballmer? I shake my head in disbelief that anyone could seriously report that statement. 
<br />
<br />Despite claims of a "new customer-oriented focus," nothing was mentioned about:
<br />  - customers being required to pay for support of buggy software
<br />  - forced registration of software starting with XP
<br />  - charging blackmail prices for Office
<br />
<br />Microsoft The Monopolist is just becoming bolder.
<br />
<br />Only at the very end in a few pages was there any indication that seemed to indicate, fundamentally, the culture has not changed and all the stuff is just window-dressing for appearances-sake. The book began discussing at length the DOJ anti-trust law suit and the distraction is caused the poor Microsoft executives, including Gates. Nothing was included about the details of the abuses that led to the charges.  But the author did correctly point out that Gates' philanthropy and these changes just happened to begin mid-trial. But in the end, Microsoft simply got off easy because Bush was elected.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: Is the book worth reading?  Probably, if only to learn the party line coming out of Redmond. If you want  objectivity, look elsewhere.

                    <span>An abundance of research leaves absolutely no doubt whatsoever that for organizations to be both profitable and durable, they must constantly reinvent themselves. Obviously, the nature and extent of that process will be determined by various factors such as timing, available resources, competitive marketplace, etc. Meanwhile, like the Southwest Airlines flight schedule between Dallas and Houston, there seems to be a new paradigm every 20-30 minutes. Moreover, organizations are at various stages of transition from one paradigm to another. And meanwhile, change remains the only constant. 
<br />
<br />In this volume, Slater explains how Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer reinvented their company. Microsoft? Yes, even one of the world's most profitable and valuable companies reached a point at which significant transformation was necessary. Slater organizes his material within five Parts: The Four-Year Crisis, Emerging from the Crisis, How Bill Gates Reinvented Microsoft, How Steve Ballmer Reinvented Microsoft, and The Rebooting of Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />Slater responds to questions such as these:
<br />
<br />1. What was the nature and extent of what he calls "the four-year crisis"?
<br />
<br />2. Why did it last for as long as it did?
<br />
<br />3. What did Gates and Ballmer learn from it?
<br />
<br />4. To what extent (if any) did they disagree on what to do in response to it?
<br />
<br />5. If there were differences between them, how were they resolved?
<br />
<br />6. In Leading Change, Jim O'Toole has much of value to say about resistance to change. He claims that much of it is the result of what he calls "the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom." To what extent was there such resistance within the Microsoft organization?
<br />
<br />7. What was done to overcome it? Were those efforts successful?
<br />
<br />8. According to Slater, what lessons can be learned from the entire process which included but was not limited to Microsoft's rebooting?
<br />
<br />9. Given his direct and extensive access to Gates and Ballmer (interviewing them separately as well as together), what does he think of each?
<br />
<br />10. In Slater's opinion, what must be done to complete the reforms at Microsoft now underway? 
<br />
<br />Slater is the author of more than 25 books, most of which I have read and reviewed. In my opinion, this is his most important work thus far, in part because of what it reveals about Gates, Ballmer, and their company but also because it reminds all of us that even a Microsoft will always be a "work in progress"...and that only hard and smart "work" will achieve the "progress" on which success depends.
