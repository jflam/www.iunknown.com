                <span id="Label1">In <b>Morality for Beautiful Girls</b>, Precious Ramotswe, founder and owner of the only detective agency for the concerns of both ladies and others, investigates the alleged poisoning of the brother of an important &#8220;Government Man,&#8221; and the moral character of the four finalists of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest, the winner of which will almost certainly be a contestant for the title of Miss Botswana. Yet her business is having money problems, and when other difficulties arise at her fianc?&#8217;s Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, she discovers the reliable Mr J.L.B. Matekoni is more complicated then he seems.</span>

                    <span>In the third installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe faces new challenges that give this book a slightly different twist. In this story the focus seems to be more on the ever changing quality of Precious Ramotswe's life and the people in it rather than the cases that come into the agency. I missed Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni and his quiet gentleness in this book, as he was indisposed throughout most of the story with a mysterious illness. Mma Makutsi and her new job as the manager of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and assistant detective figure prominently in the storyline. The reader learns more about her personal life, what drives her and her unique thoughts on the state of society especially the status of women. The mysteries are less obvious and a little less satisfying when resolved. What the reader is given is some beautiful philosophicial prose on the nature of the human condition as Mme Ramtoswe and Mme Matkusi each ponder the intricacies of their cases. I enjoyed this book, although somewhat different. Perhaps, as a reader I must come to expect that each book in the series is unique in its own way. McCall Smith has again created a wonderful story that quietly interweaves the African culture, traditions and communities into a story that touches us no matter where we live.</span>

                    <span>Morality for Beautiful Girls is third in a series about Precious Ramotswe, a lady detective in Botswana, Africa. For this Midwestern reader the landscape, weather, and daily life in Botswana were fascinating and clearly depicted. <P>This is not your typical mystery--there is no murder to be solved. Ramotswe and her assistant detective cleverly handle a couple of cases for clients, but her personal life is just as interesting: moving the office, caring for two foster children, and handling the auto repair shop belonging to her fiance who has suddenly begun acting strangely. Ramotswe deals with both the problems of her clients and her personal life in a thorough and straight-forward manner.<P>I had to buy the first two books in the series (The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, and Tears of the Giraffe) from Amazon.UK, so I was very happy to find this third book on Amazon.com. <P>For something just a little different--highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This is the second book I have read in this series and still have the impression that these books are very light on mystery. I guess I would have to say this is more true for this book than the first one I read. I have to agree with several of the other reviewers that there seemed to be more lose ends (or losely tied ends) that really didn't leave me satisfied. Beyond that, as a fictional read, the descriptions of the people and country have been consistantly good in both books.</span>

                    <span>It is really a great series! The changes in this book makes it fresh and gives it a new twist. Not only does she have an assistant who proves to be as wise and intelligent, but Mma's new approach to solving problems and understanding people's behavior is the main issue in this book. It shifts a little from the route of culture, and emphasizes on everyday issues just like in any other place. We don't see Mma explaining traditions and their meaning, but trying to understand human nature, whether it was depression or revenge, she finds a way to show reality and truth, even her assistant found her own way of facing truth.<P>I can't wait to find out what is going to happen to Mr. Matekoni, and what happened to the ring?!!</span>

                    <span>If you've read the first two of the series (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe), then you will want to read this one...it's a continuation of the stories in the lives of the main characters. I got so involved in the stories of these people and the descriptions of African landscape, that I didn't want it to end. I'm glad there's a fourth book to look forward to.</span>
