                    <span>This book describes kayaking at its best. I was especially interested in the section on kayak camping and storage of gear.The book is organized well and covers all facets of kayaking. There are many clear closeup pictures of the topic being discussed and in fact there is at least 1 picture on every page. I enjoyed this book and I ordered a copy for my brother in Alabama.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As advertized this book is about the basics of kayak touring. It is a well written and because of the authors enthusiasm- inspirational. For a begining kayaker, like myself, this book has served to fire and intensify my interest in touring. Unlike many books which dwell the dangers and near death experiences of the author-( thus dissuading many of us) this book deals with the great experiences this author and friends have had and inspires us to try to find some of those adventure ourselves. The author writes well, with a great sense of humor, and seems like the kind of person we all wish we had along as we paddled along our own journeys. I am sure we could have hours of animated discussions about the merits of rotomolded kayaks-- I like them. This is an informative book that will serve to introduce the reader to kayak touring, there is still much to be learned but that will come with experience. I believe even experienced tourers would enjoy reading this book.</span>
