                <span id="Label1">Musicians and artists might need talent to succeed, but writers don't, says Jerry Cleaver in <I>Immediate Fiction</I>. Cleaver allows that talent is needed to win a National Book Award, say, but otherwise, any of us can do it. All we need is the ability to "develop and exercise sadistic license." The operative word is <i>conflict</i>. As Cleaver puts it, "Happy lives make lousy novels.... If the characters are having a good time, the reader is not." He takes the mystery out of fiction writing. You don't have to write about what you know, he says; write what you can imagine. Don't fret if you can't find large chunks of time to write. Start with five minutes on weekdays and 20 on weekends, and you'll have 100 to 300 pages by year's end. Perhaps most refreshing about Cleaver's approach is the lack of directives. Some writing instructors demand that you work with an outline; others forbid it. Cleaver claims that teachers who tell you to do it one way or the other are telling you not how you work best, but how they work best. <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>In team sports, the job of a good coach is to clear away the extraneous and refocus their players on what is fundamentally important.  So a pitching coach may notice a player dropping his arm a little, or a batting coach may notice that a hitter has added something new to the trigger at the start of his swing (which has slowed him through the strike zone).  A hoops coach may notice that a guard has stopped squaring up before releasing the jump shots that are his bread and butter.  And so on.
<br />
<br />And this coach brings his player back to what's important, and to what's necessary, and to what works.  
<br />
<br />It's not that the extra stuff (the raw talent, the flair that each player possesses) is irrelevant.  It's that each player will bring what's uniquely personal with him anyway.  As long as the lack of fundamentals doesn't undermine him.
<br />
<br />And so we come to Jerry Cleaver, writing coach, and his patient approach to hammering home the fundamentals of story.  Jerry preaches WANT + OBSTACLE + ACTION + RESOLUTION + EMOTION + SHOWING because without these a writer may not get the chance to show what he or she can do.  Without these, it seems unlikely that your "stuff" will ever get you to the show.
<br />
<br />I was a reporter for some years, and a business writer for a long time after that, but I never got anywhere with my fiction.  Having absorbed the lessons in this book, I understand why.  
<br />
<br />I'm grateful whenever I'm on the receiving end of someone who deals straight.  Jerry Cleaver seems to have done that here.  And my work has improved significantly since I read him.</span>

                    <span>Immediate Fiction by Jerry Cleaver is the best book that I have read on writing fiction. It clearly lays out and defines terms that define the craft of writing that other books only partially explain or are murky about. This clarity makes it easier to work at learning the craft. I strongly recommend this book to all writers and would be writers.</span>

                    <span>I hate to buy those books in wich the autor starts with something like: "don't please yourself, please the readers." So I always read the Introductions before buying. This one passed that little test, it ellude me. 
<br />
<br />When I got it, I read it in two days. Is very funny, yes, that's why it got two stars on my review. But that's it... The book is just a very big motivation panphlet. It tells you how great you can be, the majestic writer you can become. It does not show you techniques or anything... Well, yes, it keeps saying "CONFLICT, CONFLICT." He thinks that a book full of conflict is a thriump. Points of view...? Plot...? Characters...? Scenes...? He says a little, but allways keeping it on "CONFLICT, RAISE THE CONFLICT." He says this damn thing in 20 or 30 different ways. At the end, you discover that writing is not all about conflict, and you will find great books like those of John Gardner that say: "maybe you can't be a writer if you don't know this or that..." It is hard on you, but is reality. I prefer that to someone saying: "if you can create enough conflict, you will be a great writer soon." That's the reason for all other reviews being so positive.
<br />
<br />This is a book for the very very beginners at writing and at reading writing books. If it's your first, it will motivate you and that's it. If you have already read other books on the subject, skip this one, it will bring nothing new. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>A little over a year ago, I had a strange epiphany, if you will.  I had this fantastical notion that I would be a writer - or TRY to be a writer - and that it would be the most cathartic, invigorating thing ever to happen to me.  So what did I do, start writing?  No, not quite.  First of all, I renewed my interest in reading.  (I read before this too, but not nearly as much as I knew I'd need to if I seriously wanted to write.)  I read a lot, thinking that to be a good writer, the first and foremost thing one needed to do was be a good reader.  (This was a great carefree period, in which I could keep deferring the inevitable process of actually SITTING DOWN TO WRITE for as long as I pleased; surprising how easy it is.)  After about ten months of heavy-duty reading, I started getting these sudden unexpercted urges to write.  I'd just be lying in bed late at night, a book facedown on my lap, and it would just strike me:  I've got to write!  I'd rush to my computer with all the alacrity of a six year old about to dive into a playpen, and then... absolutely nothing.  I'd stare at the screen.  I'd type a few paragraphs of whatever was in my head at the moment, then get stuck.  I didn't understand what was wrong.  How can a young guy like me who hasn't even begun writing be blocked?  I decided I needed some guidance.  I went on Amazon to see what kind of fiction-writing books were out there.  
<br />
<br />Luckily, I found a great one.
<br />
<br />The points in Jerry Cleaver's Immediate Fiction are so clear and inspiring, it's hard to get dejected once you've read them.  He gives the novice writer hope, saying that in the beginning it's inevitable that your writing will be bad, that you just need to chin up and move forward.  The criteria he gives, as well as a checklist once you complete your stories and are rewriting (does it fulfill want, obstacle, action, etc.?) are so unbelievably helpful; I would never have guessed how encouraging it could be just to see the elemental precepts written so simply.  I realized that my problem at the outset was that I lacked a fundamental knowledge of craft; that I was so preoccupied with the way my prose looked, I forgot the cardinal function of fiction: to tell an engaging story; that no matter how ornamental your prose is, you've got nothing without a strong story.  
<br />
<br />Inasmuch as this is the first and only FICTION composition book I've read, I can't compare and contrast it with others; however I find it hard to believe that other books of this nature could be much better.  If you're entertaining hopes of one day becoming a serious writer, you owe it to yourself to read a fiction-writing book that isn't going to quell your aspirations, or tell you you're no good, and that you won't be good for a long time.  You deserve this excellent, simplified gem, one which I will keep with me forever (along with Strunk and White's Elements of Style), and continually refer to.  
<br />Thank you Jerry Cleaver, for renewing my faith in myself, and showing me the basics with which to get started.</span>
