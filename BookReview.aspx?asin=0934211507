                <span id="Label1">Among the masterpieces of world literature, perhaps the least  familiar to English readers is the Iranian Book of Kings (Shahnameh, in  Persian). This prodigious national epic, composed by the poet Ferdowsi  between 980 and 1010 AD, tells the story of ancient Persia, beginning  in the mythic time of Creation and continuing forward to the  Arab-Islamic invasion in the 7th century. The Lion and the Throne  covers the first third of the Shahnameh and will be followed by two  volumes to complete the epic. Brilliantly translated and magnificently  illustrated, these volumes give English-language readers access to a  world of vanished wonders. The origins of civilization. . . the notion  of kingship. . . tenderness, a longing for justice, and social order. .  . the first kings felled by foolish pride. . . demons on the throne. .  . spiritual heroes and their martial virtues. . . mythical birds. . .  romance and passion-these are some of the threads woven together to  form the rich tapestry of ancient Persia. The tales in this volume were  selected and retold in Persian prose by the renowned scholar, Ehsan  Yarshater. Translator Dick Davis combines his skills as a poet and a  Ferdowsi scholar to evoke the metrical music, impact and nuance of  Ferdowsi's monumental poem.  <p>Over 130 full color illustrations from  breathtaking miniatures from the finest Persian Shahnameh manuscripts  of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries heighten the emotional impact of  the text. A short afterword by the eminent art historian, Stuart Cary  Welch, unravels the history behind these paintings by the great  masters.</span>

                    <span>I have been looking for a version of the shah nameh that both adults and children could enjoy, for years. I was first exposed to these stories as a child by my grandfather and I have never forgotten them. The Heroism, Romance and Tragedy that one is exposed to in these stories is truly exhilarating. It is simply but lyrically translated.The book also has beautiful reproductions of the persian paintings on the shah nameh which are an added treat. <BR>I eagerly await the two volumes which are yet to come.</span>

                    <span>In this first of three planned volumes, Dick Davis begins his effort to provide a fairly broad translation of the Shahnameh. He effectively utilizes the prosimetrum form, a mixture of verse and prose (naqqali in Farsi), where verse is used to accentuate periods of heightened tension.<P>In addition to being a fine literary accomplishement, this series of volumes is quite beautiful and heavily illustrated throughout with reprints from 16th and 17th century manuscripts. The books are very sturdy and make for excellent display.</span>

                    <span>I recently saw this book as well as the second volume in the planned three-volume set in the gift shop at the Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C., in connection with an exhibit of art work from various Shahnameh manuscripts currently on display. In all fairness to the publisher, it should be pointed out that this is a gloriously illustrated art book, not simply a text. The full-color enlargements of miniature fragments from medieval Persian manuscipts are breathtakingly beautiful, and the high price no doubt reflects the fact that this book was very expensive to produce. It is exquisitely produced and for those who can afford it well worth the cost. The rest of us should urge our public libraries to acquire it!</span>

                    <span>The Book of Kings, or Shahnameh in Persian, is a compilation of ancient Iranian stories put in Persian verse by Ferdowsi in the 10th Century. Its earliest stories describe the period from the golden age of Elamite civilization to the birth of the prophet Zoroaster. Despite its blend of fantasy and history, this book has been Iran's emotional link to its past for a thousand years. The book itself survived the incredible devastation of the Mongol invasian to become a testament to patriotism and a text book on leadership. This translation includes some magnificent works of manuscript art/calligraphy from the version commissioned by the first two Safavid shahs. (A chapter by Stuart Welch masterfully analyzes the history and techniques of the artwork.) To grasp the moral power of the Book of Kings on Iranians one should recall that its stories have been used by rulers and revolutionaries alike to justify their actions, or inspire reaction, for centuries. The story of Kaveh the Ironsmith (the first non-introductory story of this volume) was used by the revolutionaries to inspire Iranians to rise up against the monarchy in 1979. I for one am very happy to finally see a complete English translation of this international literary classic, and can hardly wait for Volumes 2 & 3. My only criticism of this edition is its price. I hope Mr. Davis did not want to have this compete with the Houghton Shahnameh for exclusivity!</span>
