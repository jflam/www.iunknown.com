                <span id="Label1">When Mark Arax was 15, his father, a  Fresno, California, bar owner, was  killed by two gunmen in  what appeared to be "a hit."  Arax became a  journalist in order  to acquire the skills he needed, and then 20 years later returned to  Fresno to ferret out the truth about his father's murder.  His book is a detailed and  absorbing account of multiple generations of his Armenian family and of his quest to  come to terms not only with his father's death and life, but also with his own obsession  with the case. As the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writes, "Almost every American  town harbors some brutal secret, but few produce writers like Mark Arax with both the   courage and artistic talent needed to coax the story out and shape it into fine literature.   Of course, Arax had an extra incentive: the footsteps he followed ran straight through his  own family, straight through his own heart."</span>

                    <span>I'm originally from Fresno, California and at the time of this murder, my grandfather, Ted C. Wills Sr., was Mayor of the city. When I picked up this book, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was validation.<P>For years I struggled with the bits and pieces of recollection I had regarding this period of my youth. Arax's book not only validated my experiences, what I had witnessed, but connected many of the dots regarding other incidences related to my past. The cover ups, illegal activity and silent handshakes were a part of my youth and Arax described this perfectly.<P>The author's well placed words painted one vivid picture after another about a mystery which is reality based. At the end of the book, the pictures come together as one complete "town" portrait. In doing this, he brilliantly exposed the "dark side" of not only my history, but of a town bent on keeping up appearances, at all costs. Secrets were taken out of the closet and placed squarely on to the laps of the public at large. "If we do not expose our secrets, we are bound to repeat them."<P>I strongly suggest this book to anyone interested in seeing how organized crime on a local level works. Along with this, I hope that readers will appreciate how the author was able to weave powerful Armenian history with not only his own family of origin, but with the political and criminal drama of a small town.</span>

                    <span>Mark Arax's book is a one of a kind. It is a history of a family, a history of the Armenian people, the history of Fresno. The one thing that stands out the most about this book is the stark honesty of it all, so much so that at times the effect on the reader is unsettling. As I read this book I found myself strongly disliking the author and then liking him very much. Filled with many unusual, colorful, complex and interesting characters, this true story at times reads like a novel. The story of how a young man, a newspaper reporter, goes out to find his own father's killers, is the stuff of movies and I am surprised that this book has not been made into a movie. But upon reflection, perhaps this book is too real for Hollywood. I am sure it is too real for some of the local people in Fresno who may feel he has slighted the town. But above all, after reading this book, I was left impressed with the author's toughness, his doggedness, his camera-like mind, his no holds bared approach and his take no prisoners attitude. I would suggest that this book would make very fine reading for anyone interested in California history, and also for any interested in the dark side of small town politics. A well-done, very unusual book.</span>

                    <span>When I first started this book, I was amazed at the description that Arax gives of Fresno. Being a life-long resident of Fresno, I can imagine everything he describes. Then I read about the corruption that I'd heard about all my life, and see the proof of it all. I was shocked beyond belief. <P>Then I read about these supposedly upstanding citizens that I've heard about all my life (who has community centers and arena's named after them here in Fresno) and I feel like a veil has been pulled from my eyes. <P>Mark Arax tells a story of life in a lot of small, and large, cities. The one part of the story I wish would have been included (but it is safer for him NOT to include, being that he is still a resident of Fresno) is not only the corruption of the past, but the corruption of the present as well. He describes how the city of Fresno was built upon corruption, ran in corruption for many years, and hinted to the present day corruption, but had to stop. Hopefully he will write another book about Fresno, and reveal something to everyone.<P>If you like to read, and you like to be trapped by a book, then I suggest you purchase this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The first chapter of this book was so well written that I was caught. I often had trouble putting the book down. Unfortunately, the brilliant parts of the book were too seldom. I am from Fresno and really enjoyed the parts of the book that dealt with Fresno's history of corruption and I also enjoyed the author's investigations into the murder. However, the family history was largely irrelevant to the murder and generally boring to me (I think that Armenian immigrants or other European immigrants would probably enjoy these parts). The author could have written two seperate books: one about his family and one about the murder. The author has put a lot of time and research into this book and I hope that he will consider writing a more complete history of Fresno's history of police and political corruption.</span>
