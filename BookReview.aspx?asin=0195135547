                <span id="Label1">In the past thirty years epidemiology has matured from a fledgling scientific field into a vibrant discipline that brings together the biological and social sciences, and in doing so draws upon disciplines ranging from statistics and survey sampling to the philosophy of science.  These areas of knowledge have converged into a modern theory of epidemiology that has been slow to penetrate into textbooks, particularly at the introductory level. Epidemiology: An Introduction closes the gap.  It begins with a brief, lucid discussion of causal thinking and causal inference and then takes the reader through the elements of epidemiology, focusing on the measures of disease occurrence and causal effects.  With these building blocks in place, the reader learns how to design, analyze and interpret problems that epidemiologists face, including confounding, the role of chance, and the exploration of interactions. All these topics are layered on the foundation of basic principles presented in simple language, with numerous examples and questions for further thought.</span>

                    <span>This is my far the most boring epidemiological text I have ever read. The author fails to correctly explain terms that he uses and displays a lot of arrogance on his part (i.e. "obviously this is blah blah blah" occurs 2-4 times in every page. This is supposed to be "an introductory text" and should help/facilitate learning of epidemiology for the beginning student. The author does not explain new terms in complete sentences but in a philosophical manner, has too many poor as well as good examples, and tries to elucidate mathematical logic with overly wordy descriptions. C'mon, just show us how it is used without making us read a whole page about it! After reading chapter 3 and 4, I can honestly say that I will NEVER read another book by Rothman again. That's my 2 cents.</span>

                    <span>A great cut-and-dry introduction to epidemiology. Although I would prefer to see some of the mathematical justification, for the less interested it's a good start. Examples are plentiful and clear, although some topics are handled as asides which may break up the flow of reading. Topics such as study design and measurements of association and occurence are clear-cut. Issues such as causation and confounding were sparse - helpful to supplement with Rothman & Greenland's "Modern Epidemiology".</span>

                    <span>As a graduate student in public health, I found this book to be a life-saver when it came time to study for my comprehensive exam. Concepts are laid out very clearly, but not over-simplified. The book progresses through the mainstays that you need to know in the proper order and at the right pace. Plus, the writing style is...friendly (no other word will do!). The book is far from intimidating for a new student, but has sufficient depth so that even a doctoral level epi student will reach new levels of insight into familiar concepts.<P>I especially appreciated the fact that Rothman uses social behavior examples, not only biomedical ones. (Critics who have alleged that Rothman overlooks "root" or "upstream" contributors to disease causation may be surprised to note that he draws upon domestic violence and substance abuse for this purpose.) <P>I would also like to address the comments of the first reviewer on this list, who woefully misrepresents Rothman as "anti statistics." In this text, Rothman provides formulas for everything from pvalues for stratified data to logits, and quiz questions at the end of each chapter so that you can test yourself as you learn to calculate. <P>Rothman holds a joint doctoral degree in epidemiology and biostatistics. His unerring grasp of biostatisics is precisely what allows him to out-think the average mathematician who conducts tests or follows particular procedures by rote or convention. Instead, Rothman uses artistry and originality in his practice of applying statistics to public health. As a teacher of these methods, he is unparalleled.<P>This book is simply the best introductory epidemiology text on the market!</span>

                    <span>I disagree with the previous reviewer. I do not find the author to be anti-statistics, rather anti-mindless use of statistics. <P>The previous reviewer missed the point on page 20: generalization in epidemiology. The point is that generalization is not purely within the statistical realm, but context dependent. In fact, the previous reviewer makes the author's point: if our basic understanding of the biology is that all humans are the same and that the differences between Houston and Chicago are neglible, then the study can be generalized to Houston. This conditional statement is the context and underlying biology. Changing our assumptions of the underlying biology (i.e., ethnic, age, gender composition matters and differ between the two cities) means that our belief in the generalization is different.<P>The point is that statistics is not interpreted in a vacuum. The author distinguishes between this concept of generalization, as opposed to a random sample of larger population, much like a sample survey. In a sample survey, it is a violation of random sampling to limit those humans to Chicago. For example, if I want to know who is going to win the next US Presidential election, I would not just survey humans in Chicago, because in this context I think that they would vote differently than humans in Houston. <P>Anyway, I think it is wrong to take the philosophy with a grain of salt. Attempting to train epidemiologists to think and to clarify Modern Epidemiology concepts are foci of the text.</span>
