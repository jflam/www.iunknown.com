                    <span>The first installment in a promising new series on the Third Reich by Richard Evans. In this book, Evans examines the Weimar Republic and the many factors that led to the rise of Hitler and his populist National Socialist Party. Far from being a foregone conclusion, Evans shows the many vacillations in German politics during this time and how for a brief while, the Weimar Republic appeared to be on the road to recovery. However, by constantly overriding the parliament by using the Enabling Act, chancellors set the stage for eventual dictatorial rule, as Germany went through violent economic upheavals.<P>Evans does a great job of outlining the various political parties and the antagonisms that developed after WWI. He notes the ideological origins of the Nazis in the German Nationalist Party, which refused to let go of its venerated image of Bismarck. Evans strips the veneer off this image, to show how badly the Nationalists, and later Hiter, interpreted Bismarck. He gives a lot of attention to the Center and Social Democratic Parties which formed the consensus in the Reichstag, and illustrates the rise of the Communist Party, which became the whipping post of Nationalists and Nazis as the threat of Soviet expansion grew.<P>Evans gives special attention to the plight of the Jews, but notes that Germany would have been the last place one would expected such a virulent form of anti-Semitism to emerge. Jews were for the most part integrated in German life prior to WWI, and continued to enjoy a relatively unfettered life through most of the Weimar period. But, the rise of the Nazi party in the rural regions would cast the Jew in an increasingly unfavorable light.<P>One can't but hold out hope throughout Evans' engaging narrative, as he shows how Germany struggled to hold onto representative government during the Weimar Republic, but as Hitler changed his tactics, and drew on an increasingly Populist base, he appealed to the German longing for Bismarck, especially in the wake of the Depression of 1929, when the Nazis saw their biggest gains in Parliament. But, even till the end the Nazis failed to gain a majority, but used the Enabling Act to establish dictatorial control.</span>

                    <span>Richard J. Evans is an eminent British historian of the Thrid Reich. This is the first volume of a three work set exploring Nazi Germany from its origins in the fruitcake fringe of ultra-<BR>right wing and paramilitary forces in Germany in the post-World War I era. Volume 2 will cover 1933-1939 while the third book<BR>will deal with the war years from 1939-1945.<BR> Evans has done his homework inculding an extensive foray into German language secondary works as well as first person accounts.<BR> Following World War I Germany was strapped with outrageous<BR>indemnity payments to Britain and France leading to widespread<BR>inflation, unemployment and anarcy in the streets.<BR> Evans goes into extensive detail concerning the roots of Anti-<BR>semitism in the works of men like Houston Chamberlain and the operas of Richard Wagner. <BR> The motivating factors leading to the rise of Nazism were Anti-Semitism, a hatred of democratic liberalism and fear of Communism in all its forms. <BR> Hitler and his cronies were skillful in winning power by their<BR>manipulation of the democratic process leading to the naming of Hitler to a coalition cabinet in 1932. As Reich Chancellor Hitler's men soon took power away from the military, conservative<BR>governmental leaders and led Germany to destruction. While they never won a majority vote in several elections they did use the<BR>dark days of the Depression and the divisiveness of their opponents to win ultimate power.<BR> Evans is good in showing the complex machinations which occurred in Germans politics to win the Nazis their supremacy.<BR>Events such as the Reichstag Fire led to Hitler's being able to rule the land based on an enabling act giving him ultimate power.<BR> Evans takes a broad view of German cultural developments as he chronicles the way in which the Nazis warred against intellectuals in realms from art, literature, music, movies to nuclear science. One of the chief weapons in the rubber truncheon wielding hands of the SS and SA thugs was terror. I was surprised to see how soon after the Nazi takeover in January 1933 the evil empire set up concentration camps for opponents, stifled a free press and became a police state under the cruel<BR>Himmler.<BR> As one who has read on the Thrid Reich for years this book was <BR>well done even though the general reader may become bored with the incredible detail Evans devotes to German politics . The democratic Weimar Republic never had a chance against the Nazis <BR>due to its weakn leaders, high inflationary economy and widespread unemployment. <BR> I will read the next two volumes from Evans. <BR> As a footnote readers will be aided in their study by the maps and the election trends included in the book by the author.<BR> A sober, dry and factual account we in our age of terrorism and<BR>police regimes should study, ponder and learn from. This book will become a requisite in any future study of the period.</span>

                    <span>As Karl Marx once wrote, people make their own history, but not under conditions of their own choosing. So it is that academic Richard J. Evans from Cambridge University approaches the superb first volume of the planned trilogy of a complete history of the rise and fall of the Third Reich, "The Coming Of the Third Reich", recognizing the existential constraints people living in the era of National Socialism faced. As Professor Evans puts it, not only are men constrained and shaped by the unique and quite specific web of cultural and social conditions in which they are enmeshed, but they also view these particular conditions through a particular perspective, and through the prism of a socially prescribed set of values, beliefs, and ideologies. Thus, the author argues that in the vast bibliography of works covering the history of the Nazi era, no one has yet covered the epoch in a fashion that does justice to the complex welter of ways, as sociologist C. Wright Mills would phrase it, in which biography and history meaningfully intersect such that one can appreciate what it was like for an individual to live in the times of the National Socialists, and to experience life on the ground as real people who lived through the turbulent 1930s and 1949s did. <P>Indeed, this trilogy is offered in a brilliant attempt to render such a comprehensive history that makes sense of how it that such a baffling and troubling phenomenon could arise in what was considered the most economically, socially, and culturally advanced society of the early 20th century. This volume recounts the story of the origins of the Third Reich in 19th century Germany, from the its very beginnings as Bismarck's foundling empire, through the events of the First World War, and the turbulent unrest and dissatisfaction of the Weimar years. It also describes the rise of the National Socialists through what the author describes as being an ingenuous combination of electoral success and massive political violence that took place in the chaotic epoch of the Great Depression. The book's central theme centers around how the Nazis managed to forge a one-party dictatorship in a democratic society so quickly, and with so little organized resistance.<P>This volume is, much like William Shirer's classic effort in "The Rise And Fall of the Third Reich", a narrative account of the events surrounding the events of the Nazi era. It is a massively documented effort to document the story of the Third Reich in chronological order, and much as Shirer did, attempts to "give voice to the people who lived through the years" of Nazi rule. The author is quite passionate in voicing his own concern that history once more render for the reader an intelligence recounting of the experiences of ordinary individuals, of the sheer complexity of the their existential constraints and available options, and the often incomprehensible choices they faced. So, what Evans aims to give to the reader in the early 21st century is a better understanding of the Nazi era by recreating all of its elements, in all their complexity and interweaving perplexity, thus reminding readers that, as L.P. Hartley said, "the past is a foreign country, they do things differently there". <P>Given the fact that it remains as important today as ever to understand both how and why the Nazis came to power with such speed and relative ease, it is critical to better appreciate the nature of life in the Third Reich, to comprehend why their opponents failed to stop them, and to better realize the nature and the operation of the machinery of the Nazi regime once it had grasped the reins of power. Moreover, it remains crucial to understand the complex mechanism through which the operation and goals of the Third Reich so quickly and fatefully engulfed the rest of Europe and then the world in such a bloodbath of carnage and ruin. For while the 20th century has no shortages of such catastrophes, including the soviet purge of the 1930s, none of the other such events had such terrifying and cataclysmic consequences for the rest of the world. What Evans offers us here is the masterful opening volume of a trilogy explaining in excruciating detail and breathtaking comprehensiveness the story of how Germany led Europe and the rest of the world into the depths of Hell. It is a book well worth the time and effort to read it. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>This lengthy book explores in a steady and detailed narrative the conditions in Germany that led to the Nazi takeover in 1933. <P>Although others have pointed out the "why write this?" aspect of this book, I think, as a historian, Richard Evans does a good job conveying a lot of information in an effective manner with, I think, an emphasis on letting readers today understand how a culture as advanced, wealthy, and powerful as pre-Nazi Germany could allow fear to drive people into the arms of fascism and toward cultural implosion.<P>The first in a planned trilogy of books, I think Evans dispels many of the myths about the Nazis that get trotted out by people eager to obscure the truth about fascism -- for example that the Nazis were Socialist (they weren't); or that the majority of Germans voted for them (they didn't).<P>The endless hatred and violence of the Nazis, coupled with their dynamism as a right-wing protest movement fairly flies off the page, and Evans takes pains to chart out how the various elements in German society led to the rise of Nazism, and how by the time people realized their peril, it was too late. The astounding 7.5 months in 1933 are laid out in considerable detail, showing how quickly the Nazis took absolute control of German society, meeting almost no resistance from the groups who should have fought the Nazis tooth and nail.<P>Evans includes repeated electoral results shown on maps throughout the book showing the shaky (and by no means certain) strides the Nazis took toward power, and a few photographs that communicate the evil of the fascist ideology.<P>What is most haunting to the contemporary reader is whether the historical lessons of Nazism's war on civilization were, in fact, learned, and what an individual would do, faced with such an evil. What's more, Evans questions whether a democratic society can effectively fight fascism in its midst without destroying the values of democracy itself.</span>
