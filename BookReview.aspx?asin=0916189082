                    <span>I have been to the southwest twice in the last couple of years.  The first time I didn't have this book and wished I had, the second time I had the book and was glad I did.  I have both Volumes I and II and used both of them.

                    <span>Martres throughly researched the photographic possibilities for this book, and covers virtually every photogenic spot in the region.  Having used his book on four separate trips to southern Utah, I appreciate all the new places I learned about in his book, and I can vouch for the helpful descriptions and tips for finding the ideal times and locations for the best photographs.  
<br />
<br />A major shortcoming of the book, however, is the total lack of maps of any sort.  Yes, there are written explanations of how to reach the discussed places, but it is hard to believe that a guidebook would not have one single map in the entire book!!  The book would have been improved immensely with some basic maps showing where the various places were, so that trip planning and time on the road would go more efficiently.  It was inconvenient to constantly be switching from book to a large separate map. 
<br />
<br />Another shortcoming is that the recommended shooting times usually do not consider seasons.  Many locations have a much different lighting angle on a winter morning versus summer, and oftentimes the recommended times for ideal photography did not work as discussed in the book.
<br />
<br />The other small complaint is that the photos in the book are all in black and white, making it more difficult to appreciate the grandeur of the various spots.  Color photos would have been more effective.</span>

                    <span>Martres's two books on photographing the Southwest are remarkably useful, sensible, and affordable.  He keeps his directions--both geographic and photographic--brief, relevant, and precise.  Even if you don't take a camera, these books can help you reach remarkable places of which may never or only vaguely have heard of.  I even enjoy just "armchair travelling" with these books.</span>

                    <span>As others have said, this is a great book, both for photographers and visitors interested in "off the beaten path" advice.  Laurent really helped me to find some of the most beautiful parts of this country, particularly in the escalente area, bryce, zion, and avoid some of the more crowded and touristy places. Wether you take pictures with an SLR, disposable, or just with your eyes, you can benefit from his advice on where to start your day, and which directions to travel for the best light.  <br>One morning, when Kathy and I woke before dawn and headed to the back of the zion museum to photograph The Towers of the Virgin at sunrise, one of the many, many tips in this book.  Practially in the dark, a man walked up to me and asked "do you want me to sign your book?".  Took a few minutes before I realized it was Laurent!  Very nice guy -- we talked for quite a while and enjoyed the magnificent sunrise refected on the cliffs.  Of the two other, more serious photographers there at dawn, one of them had his book also!<br>Consider it a blessing if you can spend from a few days, like me, or weeks and weeks following the magnificent paths through the southwest that Laurant suggests.  And don't miss his wonderful photography at the gallery in escalante...<p>BTW, early october is PERFECT time to see Utah.  Great weather, and much less crowded.  And if you make it to Boulder, Utah, do yourself a great favor and stay at the Boulder Mountain Lodge.  It's a gem we accidently found, tucked away in a garden.</span>

                    <span>A truly great travel guide. I've been to Utah 4 or 5 times and have read many guides to the area. This guide had many new places for us to visit. Last fall we went back to Utah and visited many of the smaller places he recommended. I was very satisfied with his directions to the hard to find places and his ratings of the places were very good. His picture taking suggestions were also very helpfull.</span>
