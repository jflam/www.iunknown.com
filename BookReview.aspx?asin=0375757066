                <span id="Label1">Jim Flick is the best golf teacher in the world.<br><br>Tom Lehman, winner of the 1996 British Open, says, "Jim Flick understands the overall golf swing better than anyone I've ever met."  Jack Nicklaus thinks enough of him to have opened the NicklausFlick Golf School, with teaching facilities in Salt Lake City, Palm Beach, Pebble Beach, Scottsdale, and Harbor Springs (MI). The following golfers -- pro and amateur -- all extol his virtues from tee to green: Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Paul Azinger, Phil Mickelson, Judy Rankin, Charles Barkley, Byron Nelson, and Chi Chi Rodriguez. Now, Flick has written a book that's inspirational, instructional and entertaining -- and will take five to ten strokes off even the most casual hacker's game.<br><b><br>On Golf</b> uniquely captures Jim Flick's method of motivational, one-on-one teaching, which emphasizes his belief that one should play golf, not work it. Whether you shoot 100 and are aiming for 90, or shoot 80 and are aiming for 70, <b>On Golf</b> is the best possible way to make sure that when you play a round of golf, your good walk will never be spoiled. <br></span>

                    <span>Jim Flick has a special ability to teach golf to guys like me (12 handicapper). His ability to verbalize concepts is excellent and I love his emphasis on feel while playing golf. After using this book as my golf "bible" for a number of months I have definately improved my tempo, feel, touch around the greens, and above all else: my scoring. <P>As a former professional musician I know Jim speaks the truth when he discusses the difference between the practice grounds and the playing grounds.... thinking about technique on the golf course is not playing golf - thats practicing on the course. Thinking about what notes to play on stage is not playing music - it's practicing it on stage..... performing on stage (or on the course) is very different from practicing.....<P>I can not reccomend this book enough - I'm giving away my other golf books (way too many) except this one and my Bob rotella books.....<P>ps: since I first wrote this I've broken 80 for the first time and multiple times - this season my goal is to be below 80 every other round.</span>

                    <span>In addition to a thorough explaination to the basic golf swing, this book helps the reader believe he can play golf. Jim explains how to enjoy golf more by becoming less mechanical and more in touch with what the golfer feels during the golf swing. Very enjoyable and comfortable reading. All written with the positive mind set golfers respect in the late Harvey Penick. Jim believes that you play golf to relieve tension and that to play golf well you must release tension. <P>The book is broken down into many small lessons, each of which conveys confidence to the student. Most golfers believe that you need to relax to play your best and Jim gives the reader tactics to accomplish tension release.<P>A great book to have at your desk during a coffee break.</span>

                    <span>The other reviewers are full of it when they say no mechanics are in here. They're in here, but they are presented simply, so you will understand them. The vast majority of golfers need to get their bodies to calm down so they're arms and hands can swing the club. Go to any driving range in the world and you will see that most people heave, twist, turn, and flop all over the place with there bodies. Except on the PGA tour driving range. There you see economy of effort and very easy looking golf swings. Jim gives great drills for getting the body to calm down and feeling great mechanics. DO THEM and you will get better.<P>Jeff Richardson</span>

                    <span>This is a good book. However, it has a lot about the mental game, preshot routine, keeping your hands and arms lose, etc. and very little about full swing mechanics. That being said, it's a good book for all the other parts of the golf swing that are just as important if not more so than the actual swing mechanics themselves. But, if you're looking for a comprehensive instruction book, this isn't the one. As far as golf instruction books go, very entertaining read. A good companion book once you have your general mechanics down.</span>

                    <span>I own and have read over 20 golf instruction books (I'm a nut for this stuff!). With the exception of Manuel de la Torre's "Understanding the Golf Swing" (for which I wrote the first Amazon review) it is by far the best golf book I have ever read. Flick's instruction, swing drills, humor and motivational messages are all right on. This book is not only instructive, but funny; it is a delight to read, and to put into practice. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone wishing to improve their game and have more fun in the process. By the way, the "4-step", "left foot, right toe", and "left hand off after impact" drills have improved my golf swing immeasurably. Thanks Jim!</span>
