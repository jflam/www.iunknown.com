                    <span>If you only buy one poker book, there are many others which would be a better choice. If your main exposure to poker so far has been watching televised final tables, then this should be 7th or 8th on your list of books to buy, and might not even be necessary. However, if you've played ring games for long enough to become experienced, but now want to try your hand at tournaments, this book is the perfect tool to help you morph your skills from poker to tournament poker (They are very different, by the way.) 
<br />
<br />You've probably heard all the ideas in here before, but Sklansky does a good job of explaining why they're true and applying them to real situations. The discussion of the Gap Concept is what this book is known for, and that chapter alone is probably worth the twenty bucks. (You have to remember, though, that the Gap Concept doesn't apply as much to skilled players pre-flop in NLH tournaments, who will freqently limp with all kinds of speculative hands.) 
<br />
<br />My only other complaint would be that, for a second edition of a popular book by a smart guy, there were still an some misspellings and instances of weird grammar. But if you're doing what I recommend and reading this after Doyle and TJ, it won't seem as bad compared to their informal style and wacky punctuation.</span>

                    <span>This is not Sklansky's best work. The books does have 2 or 3 good concepts but the rest of the book is vague. I wish he had combined this useful info in another book. The rest of the book is junk, with some filler quizes and crap advice. I mean geesh...his discussion on final table play is horrible.</span>

                    <span>"Tournament Poker for Advanced Players" by David Sklansky is solid background information on how to cope with the details of Tournament Poker.  If you have never played in a tournament - even if you have watched a number of Poker Tournaments - you should read this book before you venture into the deep end of the pool.
<br />
<br />Even if you already play a pretty good side game, you need to know just how tournament strategy differs from regular play.  It is not enough to appreciate that you have to make minor adjustments your stragegy to get into the next round. Rather than always working with the psychology of shearing the sheep, you need to focus on the immediate details that will get you into the big money in the here and now.  (Sometimes you have to just go ahead and do the obvious.)
<br />
<br />This book provides the kind of grounding in the fundamentals of tournament play that will keep you from kicking yourself for making mistakes that are obvious, after the fact.  Even if you think you already understand the differences between tournament play and regular side games, you could do a lot worse that to spend the time and money to read this book.

                    </div>
                    <span>Let me just begin by telling you that if you're looking for a book on Texas Hold'em Tournament strategy, this is not the book you're looking for. Sklansky assumes that you're already very familiar with your particular game's advanced strategy. In other words, this is a book for good cash game players who need to know how tournament structure changes their strategy. Therefore, if your only experience with poker is the No Limit Hold'em games you play at your buddy's house, you probably don't need this book. You haven't played in limit cash games, so the changes in strategy Sklansky discusses likely won't apply to you.
<br />
<br />The book is based on the fact that in limit cash games, you always think in the long-term: that is, you always make plays that show a profit if you make them enough times. In a tournament, however, there is no long term. One bad play could send you packing, and you won't have an opportunity to make that play one more time, let alone enough times for it to show a profit. All of the concepts stem from this, and eventually lead to the concept of winning NOT being all-important. For Sklansky, winning is a bonus, but placing in the money is what's important. Winning one tournament but never finishing in the money again during the course of a year is not profitable. Never winning but placing in the money consistently is what you're looking for. This is a tough concept for most amateurs to understand: they want to win, and Sklansky sympathizes with them... he just differs in opinion.
<br />
<br />In addition to the great concepts, this book is better than other Sklansky books because his writing is far more carefree; he isn't as cold and boring as he is in the Theory of Poker, etc. He's sarcastic, blunt, and much more... normal-sounding. The hand quizzes are great. Even if you don't play Stud or Omaha hi/lo, the quizzes give you real-life examples of why these concepts are so important. They aren't your normal hand quizzes, however... they don't focus on hand strategy, they look at the bigger picture. For example, most people who get dealt QQ at a final table on an average chip stack can't get all their chips in fast enough. Sure, you'll probably win with that hand, but what if you don't? You're out of the tournament. What if there are two other players at the table who have short stacks? Why would you risk busting out in 10th place when you're all but guaranteed to get 8th just by folding every hand? After reading this book, plays like folding JJ, QQ, AQ, etc will seem so logical you won't even believe you didn't do them before. Again, notice that the quiz isn't focusing on whether QQ is a good hand or not. Of course it is, but you have to think bigger than a single hand when you're in a tournament. These quizzes will teach you to do that.
<br />
<br />That's the whole thing with this book. If you want NL Hold'em strategy, pick up Cloutier's book. He gives you a very specific strategy to use in a tournament. Sklansky is giving you concepts that drive all poker tournaments, not a specific game. These concepts transcend the type of game. Yes, they're boring. No, people will not think you're cool for folding to a semi-bluff because it's not worth busting out over. Hey, if you want to go all in on a stone-cold bluff and be the next Moneymaker, knock yourself out. But I'll take an 85% chance of finishing 5th over a 5% chance of finishing 1st any day.
<br />
<br />Side Note: The "System" Sklansky presents is yet another concept that is twisted into something it's not. Sklansky isn't suggesting that his "System" is a great way to make NL tournaments easy to win. It's just a concept. He's showing you how No-Limit tournaments can have skill eliminated very easily. You don't have to use a system like this, you just need to be aware of this when you make a decision. So, if you have AKs... you usually want to see all 5 cards. Going all in lets you do this and remove skill from the hand, reducing it to luck.</span>
