                <span id="Label1">Captain James Cook's three epic 18th-century explorations of the Pacific  Ocean were the last of their kind, literally completing the map of the world.  Yet despite his monumental discoveries, principally in the South Pacific, Cook  the man has remained an enigma. In retracing key legs of the circumnavigator's  journey, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitz chronicles the cultural  and environmental havoc wrought by the captain's opening of the unspoiled  Pacific to the West, as well as the alternately indifferent and passionate  reactions Cook's name evokes during the writer's journeys through Polynesia,  Australia, the Aleutians, and the explorer's native England. Horwitz skillfully  weaves a biography and travel narrative with warm humor that is natural and human-scale, and his restless inquisitiveness quickly infects the reader. While  striking dichotomies abound throughout that journey--Maori toughs who adopt Nazi  imagery to symbolize their own fight against white domination, millennia-old  Polynesian sexual mores that would shame the Reeperbahn, a sense that  Christianity decimated native cultures at least as effectively as Western  venereal diseases did--few are more poignant than the ones that abound in Cook's  own life. This fine work is an adventurous reminder that answers to historical  riddles are elusive at best--and seldom as compelling as the myriad new  questions they pose. <I>--Jerry McCulley</I></span>

                    <span>"Blue Latitudes" is entertaining and informative, both concerning Captain Cook, and the modern day situation of all his various landfalls. Horowitz essentially has written a biography of the navigator, and added in his own story about globe-hopping in the man's wake.
<br />
<br />And it is interesting, believe me. The almost universal hatred of Cook in the South Seas, the aimless violence of Maori gangs, sailing aboard a replica of the Endeavor, all of these things are contrasted with a gritty picture of life during the actual explorations. Punishment, navigation, nutrition, everything sea-story readers want.
<br />
<br />But, while I enjoyed the book, it wasn't exactly my sort of travelogue. The biographical bits were great, but the modern stuff didn't interest me that much. It focused mainly on the culture of these places today, and while that is interesting, I was hoping for a bit more of the wilderness. Of course, perhaps that was the whole point. There is no wilderness anymore.</span>

                    <span>I wasn't all that interested in explorers until I read this book. since having done so, i have since read or am reading several other such non-fiction books. 
<br />
<br />I liked the book's comparison between Cook's day and today's reality: Tahiti, for example, conjures up images of a tropical paradise with a promise of escape from stress. Not so, it turns out. Today's Tahiti is polluted, crime-ridden, hot and buggy. - Not a place I would've imagined.
<br />
<br />This book enlightened me via honestly describing real life. That's what I like.  </span>

                    <span>Horwitz must be complimented for undertaking visits to so many different places around the world, and for his admirable depth of research.  What makes this book interesting is this research is the combination of traditional academic-style historical research and Horwitz's personal experiences during his contemporary visits.  He speaks with locals in places as diverse as Cook Town, Australia, Unalaska in the Aleution islands, and Niue, a dot on the map of the pacific between Tahiti and Tonga.  These contemporary local perspectives mesh with traditional historical studies on Cook's explorations to provide an enlightening perspective on the effect of Cook's explorations.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, this also makes Horwitz's account somewhat jaded.  He makes places universally viewed as paradise sound like trash dumps.  Tahiti, for example, comes across like some forlorn third-world country. This book reminded me of why I quit reading National Geographic: while I enjoyed reading about distant, exotic places, I got tired of constantly reading about how they were on the brink of ruin thanks to the relentless onslaught of humanity.  I've seen recent pictures of Tahiti, and it doesn't look that bad.  It does seem important to know that white man brought venereal and other diseases, pollution, and near-eradication and total subjugation of indigenous cultures.  I'm just not sure what to do with that information.
<br />
<br />The book is probably 3/5s travelogue and 2/5s history.  People who enjoy reading either will benefit from this book.  Just don't be surprised if, when you're done, you're not interested in visiting any of the places yourself.</span>

                    <span>This delightful book combines history with a travel narrative. Captain Cook made three Pacific voyages between 1768 and 1780 to every part of the Pacific, discovering countless lands, bolstering British claims of sovereignty, and creating maps of surprising accuracy. Horwitz, with his alcohol-seeking sidekick and travel companion Roger Williamson,  retraces Cook's voyages, relying mainly on air travel, and inquires how Cook is regarded in historical hindsight in the various places he explored. Obviously the indigenous peoples of the Pacific view him negatively, and Horwitz examines both the pro-Cook and the anti-Cook perspectives.  
<br />
<br />Areas visited by the author include Tahiti, New Zealand, eastern Australia, Niue, Tonga, and Hawaii, as well as Yorkshire and London in England. My favorite part was Horwitz's account of his visit to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, where year-round storms make travel dangerous even in large modern ships. One marvels that an 18th century explorer in a primitive wooden vessel would make a similar voyage, knowing that even if all went well, it would still take a year to return to England.
<br />
<br />The book was a bit overlong in places. In some instances, I felt I was reliving Horwitz's travel experiences in real time. But all things considered, this is a wonderful interweaving of history and travelogue. </span>
