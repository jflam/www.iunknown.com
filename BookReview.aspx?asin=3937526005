                    <span>Lisp (no it's not a speech impediment) is an old language. But in spite of all of the hype on the new languages like C, C++, and Java, there is still a need and a place for some of the old languages. 
<br />
<br />FORTRAN, which is still heavily used by the scientific programmers, particularily with cluster computers and COBOL (remember all the stories of the Y2K problem); Lisp refuses to go away. For certain application areas (not the least of which is AI) Lisp is clearly the language of choice. Easily the most important (or well known) pgrogram written in Lisp or using Lisp techniques is AutoCad. This package which has the requirement to handle millions of separate parts in a design is an ideal application for using Lisp which lends itself well to such large projects. 
<br />
<br />This is an exceedling well written book on the Lisp language. In the fifty-three pages of Chapter three, there is a twelve lesson tutorial on the language which gives the rudiments quickly and painlessly. 
<br />
<br />Throughout the book there is discussion on not just the language but points on how Lisp might fit particualrly in selected applications. 
<br />
<br />Great Book.

                    <span>Ok it was on the web a lot and many people have a change to trace the errors and post suggestions, so this is a pretty well written and well polished product, i would recommend to beginner to intermediate programmer , typing is pretty compact so you could use it as a reference but for a A grade tehre should be good exercises.</span>

                    <span>Davids choice to  unsellfishly  publish the book on the web 
<br />to all potential readers gave a boost to making a higly polished  product for anybody interested in Lisp .
<br />I would suggest to any of beginner to intermediate level Lisper to grab a copy of it.
<br />Tight and well written this could be used as quick refence or a way to decipher Lisp code.
