                <span id="Label1">Talk about an audacious title! But Suze (pronounced "Suzie") Orman means business in this anecdote-rich compendium of tips on 401(k)s, marriage, homes, and happiness. The PBS star/financial adviser has made plenty of the mistakes she warns against, like getting a 30-year mortgage instead of a cheaper 15-year, using Visa cards as magic carpets to calamity, and losing $20,000 in borrowed bucks to bum investment advice. Then she became a Merrill Lynch broker and an author capable of selling 10,000 books in 12 minutes on QVC. <p>  Orman's point--in this and her No. 1 bestseller <I>The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom</I>--is that you'd better face fiscal facts and avoid fear, denial, and the self-fulfilling low expectations the novelist William Wharton called "the Poverty Mind." America is a nation of check-bouncing, late-fee-incurring, guilty bad planners. How long will it take to pay off that $3,000 Visa bill with minimum payments? Thirty years, you poor, dear fool! What would you gain if you bought stocks instead of your daily latte for 30 years? $165,152! Her book might've been titled <I>The Courage Not to Be a Self-Sabotaging Neurotic</I>. <p>  Orman is the Andrew Weil of money health--she yearns to enrich your life emotionally, too. If you can't stand discussions of the psychological origins of fiscal decisions, or self-help lingo like "money is attracted to people who are strong and powerful, respectful of it, and open to receiving it," you'll want a more nuts-and-bolts adviser. If you want pep talk, true tales of woe and makeovers, and a jolt of a true pop culture phenomenon, Suze is for you. <I>--Tim Appelo</I> </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've read one other book by Suze Orman so far (9 Steps...) and will probably read at least one more (You've Earned It...).  What I like about this book and the other I read is how Suze tries to get at the root cause of how we think about money, talk about money, and act with our money.  Then we need to see whether these attitudes make us richer or poorer.  Do we need to adjust the way we think about money and about ourselves?  Because our thoughts influence our words, which influence our actions.  Do we need to de-clutter our physical and financial and emotional lives?
<br />
<br />The second part of the book has lots of good practical advice and information on many things financial, from whittling down debt to everything you need to know about bonds, IRAs, and other things.
<br />
<br />Finally, Suze wraps up by reminding us that respectful giving (that is, respect to both the causes we support and to our own needs) makes us much richer.  I consider myself pretty financially clever, and I've read quite a lot on the subject, but I still learned quite a bit, both on a practical and a spiritual level.
<br />
<br />I thought there might be a lot of overlap between the two books, but there is not.  This is good and bad.  Good, in that if you did read all the books, you'd learn something new in each (she even refers to past books where subjects are covered more thoroughly).  Bad, in that if you buy the books, and want to get all she has to offer, you've got to buy them all.  I, of course, checked the books out of the library, which is something I'm sure Ms. Orman would approve of, even if it means she didn't make a sale.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book several years now and still I go back to it for advice. One of the best ideas Suze explains is how to deal with couples with 2 different incomes. Follow that advice and you'll never be able to argue over money in a marriage, it's brilliantly simple.</span>
