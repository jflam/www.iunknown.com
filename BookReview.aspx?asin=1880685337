                    <span>I have read every book on the subject matter.
<br />
<br />There has never been a book of substance written on online no limit tournament poker.  I thought this would be the one.  Harrington imparts a few decent points but fills over half the book with "problems", making it completely unreadable.
<br />
<br />If online no limit holdem tourneys are your thing, the book is worth a read - just don't expect too much from it.</span>

                    <span>If you want to Cash in on Large High Stakes Tourneys, this book is for you.
<br />
<br />The Review saying his Style is Boring. Maybe it is but personaly I don't play Poker Tourneys for entertainment. I play for Money.
<br />
<br />Harringtons style isn't as tight as TV makes it out to be.
<br />There is a Reason Harrington has 3 WSOP Main event Final Tables and 1 Bracelet.
<br />
<br />Gus isn't as loose as TV makes you beleave. Keep in mind that the TV Poker shows are edited. They only show you about 45 minutes of play. A Live final table takes closer to 3 or 4 hours.
<br />
<br />Although Gus is proably the most loose at hand selection. He is also the Guy every High Stakes Cash Game player wants to play. Gus does Terrible at the Cash Games in the Bellagio.
<br />
<br />Back to Harringtons Book. There is so much Detail to this Book that He could not cover an entire Tourney in one Book. So he has a 2nd Book coming out that will teach you how to play later rounds.</span>

                    <span>Any poker book that will win you an occasional bet or two is obviously well worth the buy.  Harrington's book will certainly do that, even if you're a loose player.  You need to know the thought processes of the tighter players such as Harrington but he also covers other styles of play as well.   </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is good in that it covers a couple of topics never covered before:
<br />-Style of play, conservative/aggressive, super aggressive and how to counter each style
<br />
<br />-Pot odds and implied odds and how to use this in conjunction with your opponents play and style. Rather than a study on odds
<br />-Starting Hand values according to style and position.
<br />-Practical problems that are deeper in comments and strategy than any other NLHE book ever published. (Including Middle Limit NLHE). These really put you inside the head of one of the top Pros.
<br />
<br />What is evident is that Harrington is a very sophisticated player and the depth of thinking required to play NLHE at the highest levels cannot be covered in one book. References are made to other books by Sklansky for instance.
<br />Feel free to incorporate this new knowledge into your play but understand at the higher levels so will your opponents.
<br />
<br />The main lesson from Harrington is that we must each think for ourselves and incorporate our natural style but understand that at different stages of a tournament we must play tighter or looser.
<br />
<br />Harrington has had good success recently and we must ask why compared to the super aggressive players such as Negraneau and Ivey, the answer may be that in super large fields less sophisticated players are less bluffable and more willing to draw out all in. (Remember Men the Master's Aces getting cracked by a 20% draw out by an all in internet player at the 2004 WSOP main event.)

                    <span>I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus, interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's "Texas Hold'em Odds" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book.
