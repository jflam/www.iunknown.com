<h3 class="title">Does anyone use Newzcrawler?</h3>

<p><P>I just checked out <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/">Jeremy Allaire's Radio blog</A>, and he pointed me to an interesting application called <A href="http://www.newzcrawler.com">Newzcrawler</A>. The screen shots look really good. It's got a pretty nice interface for managing my RSS feeds, and it also has the advantage of having built-in blog posting software. </P><br />
<P>I suspect that once <A href="Weblog/MerryChristmastome....html">my Powerbook arrives </A>I'll be using Brent Simmons' most excellent looking <A href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire reader</A>, but I still need something for my Windows boxes. Any opinions out there?</P></p>

<p>I've been using it for about 3 months.  It's reasonable.  I was disappointed with the blogging client when I tried it so I implemented my own solution.  I think they have added support for MetaWeblog API since I last played with it.  You can always try it for 30 days, although it has some fairly annoying limitations in trial mode - it will only store 7 days worth of posts.  This causes old posts to show up as new on each scan.  HTH.</p>

<p>Use it, love it, recommend it! I don't post with it, though. I suppose I should give it another look now that it supports MetaWeblog API.</p>

<p>I like it a lot. I started posting to Radio with it in one of the latest versions and it works quite well for me.</p>

<p>Caveat: I'll rant about three-pane aggregators for a second even though this was about blog clients (I've used it occasionally with MT as a blogging client, but it doesn't work as well as just using the MT interface itself for me). <br />
I use it and get really angry with it frequently*. But this is how I want to aggregate, it's the real experience I want. So I'm stuck with it for now.<br />
NetNewsWire is nice too, I commandeered my gf's powerbook and have now since become a closeted OS X user--very pretty, but NNW does the same thing as Newz Crawler*, albeit slightly differently.<br />
They both do the same dang thing to me, which is have a hard time remembering which posts I have and haven't read. Drives me C-R-A-Z-Y. <br />
I haven't really reached the point of obsession yet where I figure it out, but it seems fairly random with both, but sometimes it tends to hate certain people's feeds this way--I can chalk that part up to just bad RSS generation, but the random part is almost motivation enough to roll my own.<br />
Speaking of which, Aggie actually tends to be the most reliably aggregator for me personally, I just don't like my results in a newsletter.<br />
OK end of aggregator rants, you hit a nerve :P</p>

<p>i built one but i haven't had much time to finish it lately. it's based on aggie but with a 3 pane ui. it works, there's just some clean up issues to take care of. http://www.slavin.org/code/starfish/setup.msi</p>

<p>Aggie (http://http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html) is an alternative to newscrawler. Open source, C#, reads opml channel files. </p>

<p>Actually, I use Aggie right now. I just imported my opml file into Newzcrawler. So far I like the UI of Newzcrawler better. I like to be able to read posts one at a time and mark off what I've read, as opposed to Aggie's newspaper format.<br />
I like Newzcrawler's RSS auto-discovery feature too.</p>

<p>I'll check it out, Sean, much obliged.<br />
I like Newz Crawler, its pretty much what I want in a user experience. For whatever reason when I update incoming channels, it gets new items, and it may or may not mark 1 to N previously read items as unread. Which is better than NetNewsWire--that one would just lose the ability to persist read/unread for me somewhat repeatably.<br />
Someone blogged that you had a write up on GSLgen, John,  I was going through your publications page and chuckled to find that you wrote Developer's Handbook (great book, great co-authors from another world, good stuff.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks! I miss that other world ... Maybe I'll find a reason to go back and speak at the Borland Developers Conference now that they're writing a .NET version of Delphi. I spoke for 5 straight years there from 95 to 99, and I miss that community.</p>
