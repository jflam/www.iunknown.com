                    <span>As in-depth as you will get on DNS for Windows 2003. A recent reviewer stated that it's much of the same. Well, much of it really is; and if you''ve been working with DNS for as long as many of us, nothing about its operations should be new to you. The most significant "tweaks" in DNS in the past few years have been done by Microsoft, to support their AD/200x line - those features are detailed quite specifically in this book (it's what this is all about anyway). And with AD continually evolving, chapters such as Managing DNS Programmatically (with WMI completely in mind) should be of utmost importance for the practicing MS administrator (that is, if you've really read the book!)</span>

                    <span>This book is well-written and very easy to read.  It covers all the basics of DNS and the specifics around Windows Server 2003 DNS.  The AD chapter is a gem!<p>I have to disagree with reviewer "Santhosh Sivarajan".  Just as with the base OS, there weren't huge differences with DNS between 2000 and 2003, but I think this book did a good job in covering the differences.  All the major enhancements including conditional forwarding and stub zones were covered in detail.  Also, contrary to what Santhosh said, application partitions are covered in depth in the AD chapter.<p>In short, if you are running Windows Server 2003 DNS, you won't go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, I have to make a comment about this book.  I can easily say that the authors just changed a few things from Windows 2000 and called it a  Windows 2003 book .  It does not contain any detailed information about the new Windows 2003 features.  They didn't even give an explanation of "ForestWide" and "Domain Wide" application partitions.  I would say they should change the name to "Windows 2003 DNS for Dummies".  Sorry to say but that is what I felt when I read this book.  It is a waste of money.</span>
