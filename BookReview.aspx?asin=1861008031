                    <span>The book doesn't provide much help even to install its own sample code. First, you have to look around very hard to find the source code to download (it is no longer in wrox.com). Second, the database is for restore to SQL Server 2000 only. It doesn't provide any kind of script file that I can make little modify to install it to a SQL Server 7 or MSDE 2000. You will be stuck if you don't have SQL Server 2000 installed. Third, the source code installation is not a install and run, I have to do some change to be able to opetn the solution.</span>

                    <span>This book provides extensive documentation for a sample e-commerce Web site, but not much in the way of instruction.  It is more of a "Look, here's how I did it"-book than a "Look, here's how you do it"-book.  If you're a beginner, this book will go WAY over your head.  It was written for those already well-versed in VS.NET/C#/ASP.NET and are looking for some guidance to put their skills to use in creating an online store.</span>

                    <span>The author definitely knows his stuff, but it is not for those who are not very knowledgeable in C# and ASP.NET. Hoffman has some excellent techniques he is applying to ASP.NET, but you will need to spend some serious time to grasp his concepts. He seems to be an excellent programmer, but not a teacher for those trying to grasp ASP.NET.</span>
