                    <span>I found this book too simplistic and way overpriced.  It provided little information that could not be found for free on the internet.  Furthermore, references are made to specific products, which means that the programs can not be run without downloading (or buying) the demos (some of which are severly limited).<br>It doesn't even have an index!</span>

                    <span>This book was written for a specific audience. If you are familiar with field devices and are moving into VB and the interface side of things, then this is the book for you. If you already know VB, then you will pick up a few things but not enough to justify the price. All in all, a good book, possibly a great one, depending, of course, on where you are coming from.</span>

                    <span>This books will get you started with ideas on how to write a Human Machine Interface application in VB. Books on this subject are few and far between. The only other book that I have found to be useful is "Automating Science and Engineering Laboratories with Visual Basic" by Russo and Echols. More advanced programmers will be somewhat disappointed that this book doesn't cover more advanced issues with HMI. Another excellent resource is ... where you will find the actual source code to a complete HMI application that you can modify to fit your needs.</span>

                    <span>This book is written with the beginner Visual Basic developer in mind.  If you are already an experienced VB developer, but know nothing about HMI systems, it is also a useful resource.  It is the only book I have run  across that addresses developing industrial applications using  non-proprietary software.  It's a life-saver if you are interested in  developing a low-cost, low-maintenance HMI or SCADA application for your  factory environment.  It provides step-by-step instructions for connecting  an HMI front-end to a PLC.  If you are new to Visual Basic or interested in  learning VB and specifically how it applies to an industrial application, I  would highly recommend adding this book to your reference material.  If you  want to further your education in this area, I would also recommend  contacting the author to schedule on-site training.</span>

                    <span>I've been working on a lighting control program in visual basic that reads and writes to PLCs, and this book didn't give me any new ideas.  It might be useful to someone who wanted to create an HMI interface but knew nothing  about Visual Basic (or programming in general), but the project would have  to be almost exactly like one of the examples in the book</span>
