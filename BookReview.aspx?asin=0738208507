                <span id="Label1">From a Web visionary and co-author of <I>The Cluetrain Manifesto</I>, a fascinating, ambitious look at how the Web is transforming the concepts on which our society is built.  <P>In this insightful social commentary, David Weinberger goes beyond misdirected hype to reveal what is truly revolutionary about the Web. Just as Marshall McLuhan forever altered our view of broadcast media, Weinberger shows that the Web is transforming not only social institutions but also bedrock concepts of our world such as space, time, self, knowledge-even reality itself. Through stories of life on the Web, a unique take on Web sites, and a pervasive sense of humor, Weinberger is the first to put the Web into the social and intellectual context we need to begin assessing its true impact on our lives. The irony, according to Weinberger, is that this seemingly weird new technology is more in tune with our authentic selves than is the modern world. Funny, provocative, and ultimately hopeful, <I>Small Pieces Loosely Joined</I> makes us look at the Web as never before.</span>

                    <span>The reason that I chose to read this in the first place was that I was seeing it listed in sidebar after weblog sidebar, so it seemed like the "in" book to be reading right now. I quickly discovered that there is good reason for all the buzz. This book will probably be solely remembered for its spin on the Warhol quote that "on the Internet, everyone will be famous to 15 people" (loose paraphrase), and that's a shame, because it's so much more than that. Weinberger asserts that the advent of the Web has forced us to take a hard look at our assumptions about things like space, time, relationships, and what really matters to us. The Web, rather than something that is inherently good or bad, is a fairly accurate reflection of who we are as a society. Weinberger's style is both enlightening and disarming. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about where we've come since the Web's introduction, and (perhaps) where we're going.</span>

                    <span>This cluetrain co-author and host of the Journal of the Hyperlinked Organization presents a compelling survey of not what the web should be or could be, but of what it is. Small Pieces looks at our human concepts of space, time, truth and hope, and how the web may not be a perfect world, but unlike the real world, the web is our world. This book is probably going to be a sleeper, the one we later point back at and say, "Here's where we started to understand."<P>When I started reading Small Pieces, my first thought was "Nice speculation, but how do you know the first-person web is the best web?" Then it hit me: This is not a prescription for how we *should* do Internet, it's a detailed survey of the who, how and why of those who do. David challenges the pundits and frustrates the gurus of web design, but to dismiss him is to discount the grammar of a civil defense warning: Like it or not, Small Pieces is how it is in the online world.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book that helps define what the internet is and how it is effecting our lives. This book provides great insight and gets you thinking about what we do every day on the internet. Are we being more social or anti-social if we spend more time on the internet? We are creating the internet with every web page and every weblog. It's like writing a book that never finishes.<P>This book looks at the internet by looking at Space, Time, Perfection, Togetherness, Matter and Hope.. This really gets you thinking about what the internet is and what it will become...</span>

                    <span>A confusing little book - from all the hype you'd think there was some earth-shattering discovery enclosed therein.<P>But this was just a collection of little essays about the web, the contents of which would be so plainly obvious to every 12 year-old I know. Yet for an over-40 who'd never used the Web, they wouldn't understand it either. So who is the target audience? <P>It doesn't even merit being considered as "WWW Futures 101". Very disappointing.</span>

                    <span>More a look at society as bounded by the Web than a look at the Web itself, as someone described this book. That's true, for it seems to offer more insights about modern humanity and the weird situation we've created for ourselves than about the Internet itself. Topics include knowledge, time, matter - the stuff of philosophy, and not of a book about the Net.<P>Everyone who uses the internet should read this book. Anyone interested in modernity should read it as well, even if she doesn't have a computer.</span>
