                <span id="Label1">How do highly paid professional speakers put magic and motivation into every talk? Lilly Walters, Executive Director of Walters International Speakers Bureau, reveals their secrets and strategies in this practical, conversational guide. Mark Twain reputedly said it took him three weeks to prepare an impromptu speech, but readers of Secrets of Successful Speakers will do it in days-or minutes. This book spells out the rules in 11 easy-to-follow steps, each accompanied by interactive exercises. Readers will learn to: set objectives before writing; customize the talk for each audience; conquer stage fright; cultivate a reputation as an expert; develop themes for each presentation; organize material in memorable manner; edit for best effect; project a professional "platform image" through personality, voice, and clothes; motivate audiences to change their actions and attitudes; involve listeners by using humor, heart, and audience participation exercises; deal with problems and pitfalls ranging from poor staging and faulty audio-visual equipment to hecklers and questions of ethics. This authoritative and accessible guide also contains fascinating anecdotes of well-known personalities and how they mastered the art of public speaking. It will quickly become the reference of choice for trainers, lawyers, doctors, managers, and everyone who makes presentations or gives talks.</span>

                    <span>Any person looking to raise the level of their speaking needs to add this book to their library.  I personally own every book Lilly has published.  As a professional speaker myself and the author of, "10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking" (Warner Books), I appreciate the value of the information in Lilly's book and I recommmend this book to anyone.</span>

                    <span>This is certainly one of the best books on public speaking I've read. The only other work that deserves special mention is Jack Valenti's Speak Up with Confidence. Walters gives surefire tips and techniques that are recipe for a successful presentation that may inspire for years.  <p>Her crisp advice on the main requirements of a speech of "passion and compassion with a purpose" is very potent and often leaps off my mind each time I prepare to instruct or make a speech. Walters has carefully drawn from the "secrets" of public speaking pros and concocted them into a surefire formula for success. What's more, her anecdotes and quotes are both entertaining and memorable.  <p>I found myself a better speaker even after reading and applying steps 1 and 2. Wait till I conquer step 11! Thank you Lilly Walters for an absolutely inspiring and terrific book.</span>
