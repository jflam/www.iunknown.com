                    <span>Some people told me not to watch this kind of movie because it has a lot of witchcraft.  Well, I saw a part of the movie at a friend's house and was intrigued.  I bought the DVD and to be honest, I thought it was a nice little movie full of little surprises here and there.  I love the part when Harry talks to Ron for the first time in the train and they feast on the delicious & very yummy sweets.  Tempting, isn't it?  If only we could eat all of those candies without worrying about diabetes, our teeth, & sugar intake.  Sigh!</span>

                    <span>Herry Potter is an extremely creative concept, and a brilliantly composed story. I have read the books, and the movies do a wonderful job of putting these masterpieces on the big screen.
<br />
<br />If you like a really good fantasy film, see this.
<br />Not just for little kids! :)

                    <span>When I read the title Harry Pothead and the Stoned Sorcerer I thought it was gonna be cooler than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This movie has nothing to do with drugs whatsoever. Talk about false advertising! I gave it two stars because it's cool to watch while high.</span>

<br />Pass on this and you'll regret it!</span>

                    <span>Words Can't express just how aweful these movies are compared to the books.  I have been a Harry potter fan almost since the begining.  The books have and continue to be a beautiful source of inspiration for me.  But the films fall utterly short of even mediocre.  I understand that there must be changes when a book is adapted for film but too many vital complex characters, such as Hagrid and Ron, are reduced to one-dimensional comic relief.  Every character lost at least one-dimension - even harry.  I felt that if I hadn't read the book I probably wouldn't understand the movie.
<br />Not is only a horrible adaptation, it is horrible as a film.  The actors feel as if they're either trying to hard, or don't know what they're doing.  Daniel Radcliff has to gasp before every line!  The corniness was almost too much to bear.  I felt embarressed for the actors.
<br />The special effects sucked.  The troll in the girls bathroom should have at least  looked convincing.  The trees in the forbidden forest were too far apaart to be menacing.
<br />I  will say though, that Argus Filch the caretaker was portrayed beautifully.  The one star I give this film is for him.</span>
