                <span id="Label1">ARE YOU A CULTURAL CREATIVE?<br><br>Do you dislike all the emphasis in modern culture on success and &#8220;making it,&#8221; on getting and spending, on wealth and luxury goods?<br><br>Do you care deeply about the destruction of the environment and would pay higher taxes or prices to clean it up and to stop global warming?<br><br>Are you unhappy with both the left and the right in politics and want to find a new way that does not simply steer a middle course?<br><br>In this landmark book, sociologist Paul H. Ray and psychologist Sherry Ruth Anderson draw upon thirteen years of survey research studies on more than 100,000 Americans. They reveal who the Cultural Creatives are and the fascinating story of their emergence over the last generation, using vivid examples and engaging personal stories to describe their distinctive values and lifestyles. <b>The Cultural Creatives</b> offers a more hopeful future and prepares us all for a transition to a new, saner, and wiser culture.</span>

                    <span><P>I've just read some of the negative reviews of this book and felt compelled to re-post my initial review....where's the harm in wanting to do good? I can't imagine a "Mother Russia" scenario, as one reviewer suggests.<P>Oh, well, that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. <P>For my money, the 'movement' these authors highlight will most likely run afoul...there is hope for our planet. <P> Psychologists Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson have written a handbook for people who are working to make this world a better place. Their book, THE CULTURAL CREATIVES - HOW 50 MILLION PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD - is a guidebook for those who are interested in saving the planet, nurturing their personal relationships, and being sensitive without being stomped on. You might be a Cultural Creative if you're into: books and music; arts and culture; stories; social causes, especially issues dealing with women and children; and authenticity. The authors have created an interesting test to gauge where you stand in the mix and use a lot of graphs throughout the book to identify cultural creatives and their issues. If you're from the '60s and you've ever wondered what to do with all the energy created during that period of our lives, this book will open your eyes. If you've sometimes felt like an alien in your own family, the authors will offer you comfort because you're not alone. Even if you're just wondering why cultural creatives are so passionate about their lives, this planet, and their causes, this book will help you put it all together. Cultural Creatives include such personalities as: Pope John Paul XXIII; Martin Luther King, Jr.; The Dalai Lama; Annie Dillard; Georgia O'Keeffe; Marc Chagall; Yo-Yo Ma; Robert Redford; Katharine Hepburn; and Bill Moyers. Pretty good company, don't you think? While the book represents a lot of research on the part of the authors, the data is never presented in a dry, boring format. I found it hard to put the book down. The information resonated with me -- I'm from the 60's -- and it gave me hope for the future of our species and our planet. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>This book, The Cultural Creatives, is the best news to be published since Marilyn Ferguson's The Aquarian Conspiracy. Through graphs, interviews and so on, the authors remind us that humanity is not down and out, that there is a movement afoot that many of us call the New Group of World Servers. This group is made up of people who are more interested in serving the greater good than lining their own pocketbooks, who see the need and then work to find the solution. They don't stop there, however, and they don't expect others to take care of the <BR>problems we've created over our several million years of existence on this planet. <P>As soon as I bought and read this book I sent it to a daughter in Tucson, who was beseiged by her colleagues for information, copies of the graphs, etc, so I never got the book back. I consider it not lost but joyfully seeding its miraculous message in another environment. I will buy another copy and probably give it away, too. Thanks to the authors. I heard Ray interviewed this morning on Jefferson Public Radio in Southern Oregon and hope he and his fellow author will continue their work, encouraging all of us who are Cultural Creatives and now know that we're not alone! In light, Nancy M. Davison.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fascinating book that I couldn't put down when I first got it. Anderson and Ray write in a style that is both intellectually stimulating and easy for lay audiences to understand. As a "cultural creative" myself, the book had a helpful, optimistic tone.<P>But the book is far from perfect. As some other reviewers have astutely pointed out, the authors fail to take into consideration that people might overlap more than one of the three groups outlined in the book. What happens when a "modern" couple from Omaha decide they want to move back to "traditional" Grandpa's farm in the country to raise their kids? Anderson and Ray don't give fair treatment to cross-over between the groups. This is unfortunate, and gives an incomplete picture of the United States.<P>Next, as someone who took a good amount of sociology in college, I was disappointed with the book's treatment of how one becomes a modern, traditional, or creative. More individual case studies, instead of a macro-level analysis would have been helpful.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Just what is a Cultural Creative? Authors Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson conducted a study for the EPA (1998) to ascertain citizen views about the environment. What they discovered was 50 million CC individuals who are changing the world one step at a time. The authors supply a test the reader can use to determine whether they are a 'Traditional' (25 percent of the population); a 'Modern' (50 percent); or a CC (25 percent). <P>Using their three "types" to explore cultural values, including attitudes towards the environment, the authors have uncovered a lot of good and bad news. Not surprisingly perhaps, all three groups think the environment is very important (good) while disagreeing about many other cultural issues including the best way to deal with the environmental mess that is killing life on this planet (bad). The authors suggest that while most folks are aware of the attitudes and opinions of the 'Modern' and 'Traditional' types because they can be found arguing in newspapers, on tv and in person, the opinions and activities of the Cultural Creative types are more elusive. <P>Ray and Anderson have assembled a huge amount of information and synthesized it into a fairly coherent package. They leave virtually no sociological source untapped as they report on everything from AIDS to Zen. Their book is nicely complemented with survey results and graphs (simple and easy to understand) and plenty of references for further reading. While I don't agree with each and everything these authors say (only 95 percent), I do believe thinking people (especially Moderns..which I used to be) need to read this provocative book. <P>I underlined so many passages and pasted sticky markers on so many pages I don't know where to begin to describe the content, except to say this is not a doom and gloom book that will make you want to swallow rat poison. This book offers examples of a better way to live. It offers HOPE for our planet. To put the CC message in a nutshell..if we want life to continue on this planet we must act and act now.<P>You may not agree with all you read, but you will probably find the authors arguments compelling and may discover you are already a Cultural Creative or on the way to becoming one through the process of self-actualization (yes, they include Maslow, Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Wicca and Catholic nuns).</span>

                    <span>I'm grateful a friend loaned this book to me. The authors' research identifies a core population that is committed to a series of interrelated movements-- ecology, human rights, glbt rights, access to health care, etc. This group, comprising 50 million, illuminates the deficiencies of the left/right political dichotomy and offers a paradigm to transcend that model.</span>
