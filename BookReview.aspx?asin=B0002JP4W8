                <span id="Label1">The beauty of <I>Frank Lloyd Wright</I> is that aside from telling a long and often melodramatic story lucidly, it deals with issues of art and architecture in ways that are approachable but not simplistic. (It's also surprisingly scandalous, although this is seen as part of his art.) Wright was first and foremost a rebel who took his cues from nature, though, as one commentator points out, this is not to say his approach was natural. What he was rebelling against was the clutter and claustrophobia of Victorian architecture. The rooms he designed opened up on each other, and his exteriors seemed to grow laterally out of the landscape. All of these ideas are neatly illustrated--although it perhaps could have been explained how Wright's later, whimsical designs related to his earlier, earthbound ones--with some marvelous footage of a Wright lily pad column supporting a load of sandbags and quiet Steadicam shots of Wright interiors that give the viewer a feeling for his sense of light and harmony. The filmmakers have wisely kept the technical talk to a minimum, but they are also not afraid to step back and let the experts ruminate on the nature of his genius, even when these experts are at a loss for words. Burns has made stars of some of his commentators in previous films, and in this one the late critic Brendan Gill shines. Wright himself comes across as a man who never doubted himself, a lousy father, and self-consciously Byronic. His vitality and larger-than-life persona seemed to belong to the 19th century, making him--and this is perhaps a mixed blessing--the last of his kind. <I>--John Clark</I> </span>

                    <span>The reviewers below are right about this DVD:  if you want to see Wright's work, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.
<br />
<br />Burns is obviously fascinated by the person.  We learn so much about a self-promoting genius who succeeded in such a uniquely American way.  Perhaps his most fascinating characteristic is Wright's apparent complete absence of self doubt, carried to such an extreme as to allow him to reinvent himself over, and over, and over again.
<br />
<br />Wright was a hornswoggler in the best American tradition.  Had a few of his works not attained memorable standing in 20th century architecture, he'd be long forgotten.  If the era in which he built were more like our own present, he'd be broke from lawsuits and uninsurable for malpractice.
<br />
<br />We live in a more careful, more thoughtful era now.  And there are good things about that.  But Wright takes his personal place in history now, and Burns seals it with this lively and diligent production.</span>

                    <span>I bought this dvd thinking that I wanted to see homes that Frank Lloyd Wright built, but this dvd does that no justice.  This is a documentary of Frank Lloyd Wrights life, not a movie about his work.  I do not suggest buying this unless you want to know about the man, not his work.</span>

                    <span>This review is for "Fallingwater-a conversation with Edgar Kauffman Jr." film. Most reviewers on this page are refering to the PBS documentary on Wright by Ken Burns. 
<br />
<br />This documentary ("Fallingwater-a conversation with Edgar Kauffman Jr.")is quite special, as it looks at the process involved in making this incredible building, with interviews by the living Ed Kauffman Jr., many apprentices and old film footage. But the best is when they give a detailed tour of the house. Quite fascinating. This is the best documentary on Fallingeater I've ever seen. Very detailed, with lots stories by Ed Kauffman jr. et all. I can only hope this comes on DVD. A real gem! </span>

                    <span>This was very disappointing.  There was way too much information on the personal failings of Frank Lloyd Wright and way too little on the architectural themes.  Yes, you will see all the obvious structures:  Fallingwater, the Guggenheim, the Johnson Wax building and the Japanese hotel.  But Usonian structures receive about 2 minutes out of 2-plus hours.  Yes, Frank Lloyd Wright was a jerk.  We get it, Ken.  I didn't need dozens of examples on why this was true.  My feeling is that if Jerry Springer had done 2-plus hours on Frank Lloyd Wright, it would have looked a lot like this.  Two stars for the little architecture we did get a chance to see.<p>You will learn much more about this subject with the A&E tape called "The Homes of Frank Lloyd Wright".</span>

                    <span>This biography of Frank Lloyd Wright is a fascinating story.  He was the most celebrated American architect of his day.  He felt a house should be one with nature, to compliment it.  His homes gave a distinctive feeling of spaciousness; and he believed an architect's primary purpose was to build dwellings that people delighted in living in - and not just looking at.  <p>Scandals tainted his "first life" and probably contributed to his lack of major commissions.  But his career took flight when, at sixty-two, he married a woman who, for once, was his intellectual equal.  She was totally devoted to him and had him write an autobiography and begin a school of architecture.  The exposure led to new clientele - and to his most significant creative achievement - the Guggenheim Museum in New York, which took thirteen years to build, and was completed six months after he died.<p>Frank Lloyd Wright thought very highly of himself, of his own abilities, and of his contribution to the advancement of mankind's existence.  His self-confidence drove him to push the edges of the envelope - for his entire life.  His vision was infectious.  Clients would recall fondly that working with Mr. Wright, while he was designing and building their homes or offices, would be the highpoint of their lives.  <p>Mr. Wright's accomplishments are a testament that life - and living - are not bounded by age; and that divine ability can sometimes lead to greatness.<p>This is easily one of Ken Burns' best works, and I couldn't stop watching it!</span>
