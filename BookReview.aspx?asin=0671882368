                <span id="Label1"><P> For every frustrated reader of the great nineteenth-century English novels of Austen, Trollope, Dickens, or the Bront&#235;s who has ever wondered whether a duke outranked an earl, when to yell "Tally Ho!" at a fox hunt, or how one landed in "debtor's prison," here is a "delightful reader's companion that lights up the literary dark" <I>(The New York Times).</I> <P> This fascinating, lively guide clarifies the sometimes bizarre maze of rules, regulations, and customs that governed everyday life in Victorian England. Author Daniel Pool provides countless intriguing details (did you know that the "plums" in Christmas plum pudding were actually raisins?) on the Church of England, sex, Parliament, dinner parties, country house visiting, and a host of other aspects of nineteenth-century English life -- both "upstairs" and "downstairs." <P> An illuminating glossary gives at a glance the meaning and significance of terms ranging from "ague" to "wainscoting," the specifics of the currency system, and a lively host of other details and curiosities of the day.</span>

                    <span>I picked this book up after reading _Everyday Life In Regency and Victorian England_, which I thought did a decent job of describing the mundane details of English life in the 1800's. Daniel Pool's book is immensely more interesting, detailed, and enjoyable.<P>_What Jane Austen Ate..._ is divided into two parts: a series of essays on daily life in the 19th century, and an exhaustive glossary of words common to the folk of the period, but not to us. Both parts are engaging and <P>interesting, suggesting all sorts of interesting ideas for characters, scenes, plots, and schemes (Most people will read this for background on other works, but I read it to ensure historical accuracy in something I'm working on). Pool refers to classical works by Dickens, Austen and Eliot when describing a certain facet of life to help pull it all together.<P>This book gets 5 stars not because it's the greatest book in the world, but because it's clearly the best of its kind. Readers and writers of 19th century fiction would do well to read it.</span>

                    <span>This was a very enjoyable book. The background it provides helps me to understand the social contexts and the way of life of the folks Austen and Dickens (and their many fellow writers) wrote about. <P>The book is a series of small essays that offer insight into a specific topic. These essays are grouped into helpful sections such as The Public World, The Private World, and The Grim World. They are all entertaining and help those of us who know little of those times to get a handle on some basic notions. <P>The one caution I would offer is that a century is a long time. Fashion, technology, politics, and everything else changes many times over the decades. However, these essays seem focused on those things that would offer the most confusion to the modern reader. Just be sure to keep a close regard on the time period the specific essay is covering and match that to the period not only of the author but the period that Dickens or Austen or whomever is writing about.<P>This is an lively, entertaining, and informative book. But it is not foolproof. Enjoy it responsibly and you will benefit from this book every time you read a Regency or Victorian author.</span>

                    <span>Not bad, but use with caution. As so many other readers have pointed out, there are a number of careless errors in this book. The distinction between the Regency Period and the Victorian era does get muddled. Considering the broad timespan and variety of topics covered, it's still worth reading, but there are other volumes that you should consult to verify or disprove the many statements. (DICKENS OF LONDON and the DICKENS INDEX would be a good start if you can find them) The section on currency and it's meaning was interesting, but in no way should it be a guide in comparison to modern money. THAT would be a book in it'self. The dictionary in the back also comes in handy, especially when searching for occupations. Now, I will admit my knowledge of Jane Austen is somewhat limited, and I hesitate to recommend any sources.</span>

                    <span>Covering so much territory, haphazardly, there are bound to be some interesting tidbits (even some whole entries), and the author does better with objects supporting often vague claims with a few facts and figures than with people and activities where he says they might have done this, or might have gone here or there. Who knows. The two main stoppers for me were, first, it's incredibly repetitious. Separated as though new but within two (that's 2) pages are:<BR>".. all the land in each generation was left to the eldest son.."<BR>"The idea was for the estate...to pass to one person..."<BR>"... necessitated that the land go to one child..."<BR>"... the logical heir, then, was the eldest son."<BR>"... was usually a deed giving the land to the eldest sonÉ"<BR>"So now the problem... solved by leaving it to the eldest son."<BR>- that's aside from several literary examples of someone leaving land to his eldest son; good grief.<BR>The other stopper is "part two" of the book, a glossary with some interesting entries, but padded out to 135 (not a typo) pages. An example of the fluff: "ale- What was the difference between beer and ale? Sometimes the term 'beer' included ale. Sometimes it didn't. Sometimes ale was supposed to be stronger than beer, other times not." The mucked up repeating and a fair amount of similarly worthless fluff, despte some interesting sections, rates only two stars, and you'll do much better with a way more interesting, better researched, more thorough, better presented book by Norrie Epstein (Friendly Dickens) or the dense but even more rewarding book by Robin Gilmour (The Victorian Period).</span>

                    <span>If you love to read historical novels, whether they be the classics of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters and Anthony Trollope, or historical romances by such authors as Judith McNaught and Julia Quinn, this is a great book for you. It will also appeal to history buffs, and those with just a passing interest in the social customs and etiquette of bygone days. <P>Accessible and covering a broad range of topics, it's a reference book that touches on everything from social hierarchy (an Earl outranks the eldest son of a Marquis who outranks the younger son of a Duke, the eldest son of a Duke, however, ranks above an Earl and just below a Marquis), how to name your estate (what is the difference between a hall, a manor and a house?), how to play Faro (you need a machine to deal), manage the servants (especially when they're just not getting the silver bright enough) and walk with a member of the opposite sex (a gentleman, remember, always walks on the side nearest the street). <P>The book also includes an extensive glossary of terms of the period (just what is a costermonger and a mantua-maker?) It is also filled with literary references and citations from the great British 19th-century authors, including those mentioned above. Don't worry if you haven't read any of the books, the references are used to illustrate points, though this book may inspire you to finally pick up a few of those classics you've always been meaning to read. <P>My one complaint about this book is that it's just not as thorough as I would have liked. It covers a wide range of topics, and in trying to keep the book readable, it only touches the surface rather than becoming deeply involved in any one topic. <P>As an overall reference book, it's very good, and is very useful to anyone who might be writing a novel set in this period, or just enjoys reading books set in 19th-century England. <P>The closest book I am aware of to this book is "The Writer's Guide to Everyday Life in Regency and Victorian England" by Kristine Hughes, which follows in the same general reference covering a lot of topics, but without the references to classic novels. Also, the recent "An Elegant Madness: High Society in Regency England" by Venetia Murray is a collection of accounts of some of the most notorious real people of the era. And for the literary angle, "A Dab of Dickens and a Touch of Twain" by Elliot Engel offers a biographical overview of many of the authors referred to in this book.</span>
