                <span id="Label1">Forget the high-carb, low-carb debate. The glycemic index (GI)--a measure of carbohydrate quality based on how quickly a food raises blood-glucose (blood sugar) levels--is the dietary key to health, say the authors. Contrary to other diets that treat carbohydrates as all alike, <I>The New Glucose Revolution</I> divides carbos according to their GI into two categories. One is high GI (less desirable): carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion, leading to fast and high blood-glucose response. Examples are baked potatoes, sports bars, instant rice, corn flakes cereal, and baguettes. The other is low GI (more desirable): carbohydrates that break down slowly during digestion, leading to a gradual glucose release. Examples here are pasta, whole grains, fruit, legumes, and yams.<p>  A low-GI diet is especially recommended for people with diabetes, abdominal overweight, and Syndrome X, say the authors, who have strong medical, nutritional-science, and diabetes education credentials. They explain the importance of understanding GI values, how GI is determined, health applications, and how to choose low-GI foods and balance the overall GI load. They give cooking tips, menu ideas, and 47 recipes. A 68-page table gives the GI values of many foods, including brand names. <I>The New Glucose Revolution</I> is recommended for health-conscious readers who want to understand the glycemic index and how to incorporate it into their diet. <I>--Joan Price</I> </span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for learning how to eat in such a way that you naturally move towards your optimal weight, and do so without hunger if you're overweight and need to lose.<P>A few of the previous reviewers apparently skimmed through the book and/or missed many of the qualifying details provided in the book about foods. Potatoes indeed have a high GI value: the bigger and older the potato the higher the value. So those small young red potatoes have a lower GI value than those big white Idahos most of us eat. Also, the authors stress that the goal of this approach is not to condemn all "high GI" foods and avoid them like the plague; the goal is to learn how to balance them out with sufficient low GI foods that you don't provoke the classical insulin spike associated with high GI foods.<P>And the approach is not a "high carbohydrate diet." The GI values specifically measure carbohydrates and their different effects--as measured in the lab-- on insulin response. Meats, fish and dairy are pretty much "no GI" foods (as are a large number of vegetables by the way), and the authors encourage us to eat them abundantly (but to tilt towards the lean side of the meats and to still make sure we don't overeat). The main idea with meats, cheeses and other high protein foods is that they are "calorically dense" and that you can easily overeat them, the more fat they contain the easier.<P>This is not a "plug and chug" kind of a dietary approach. The authors expect their readers to be reasonably intelligent and mentally hard working in devloping their individual eating plans. The GI values were not simply "invented" because they sounded good in theory. They were discovered as a result of extensive experimentation with human subjects and extensive post-eating blood draws. <P>If you want a brain-dead approach that will simply tell you "this food is good, this food is bad" or that will tell you "today is Tuesday, this is what you can have for lunch" than this book is not for you. You are going to have to exercise your brain cells as well as your fork and your cardiovascular system (exercise is strongly encouraged) if you are going to get anything out of this approach.<P>In the very few weeks I've used this approach I've already lost 13 pounds with no discomfort whatsoever and a fair amount of "cheating" (actually there is no cheating in this approach. If you pig out on a particular food at one time you simply adjust your eating plan accordingly for the next day or so and proceed. Forget the guilt). If you want to take it slow and easy, just remember to throw in some veggies with every meal, and try to have a low GI fruit with every meal as well (and horrors!! another contradiction!! Bananas are both "good" and "bad." Young bananas that are still very slightly green have a tested low GI value; older bananas with a lot of black spots on them have developed their sugars and now have a high GI value. Focus on eating slightly green bananas and forget the paranoia about them).<P>The whole process is about learning which foods have low GI values and which foods have high GI values, and of thowing in some low GI foods whenever it seems appropriate and convenient, remembering that meats, poultry, fish and dairy are essentially "no GI" foods and including them in their lean incarnations as much as possible.</span>

                    <span>This book has had one BIG use since its first edition: the introduction of the concept of Glycemic Index (G.I.) which makes it clear that not all carbs are created equal. The G.I. measures how fast the carbs in a food get translated into glucose (which travels in the blood). As most diabetics should know (I am one of them -Type 2, since October 2002), violent blood sugar rises is something that most people (athletes excepted, ocassionally, perhaps) should avoid. This is where this book's meat and bone truly lies: the presentation of this concept plus very useful tables (a ton of pages of them!) of G.I.'s of most foods, which should come in handy when choosing what to pick in the grocery store or the restaurant.<P>On the flip side, there are some VERY conflicting views presented in the book: "the most important message is that the diet should be low in fat and high in carbohydrates." (quote from page 55). This thought disturbed me, after a year of successfully applying a low-carb lifestyle. With the new edition the above approach was not changed, but rather a new concept was introduced: that of the Glycemic Load. Think of it as a sort of weighted average that combines the quantitative (amount) component of carbs with the measure of the glycemic index (more on the qualitative end), yielding a net measure that should be a better indicator of how healthy a particular food is for you. It's too soon to say whether this Glycemic Load concept has any positive effects at all, but it makes perfect sense. To err on the safe side, I will give the book 4 stars: improved if you compare it with the original edition, but too soon to know whether it will work or not.</span>

                    <span>As a PCOSer who has struggled with her weight since puberty, I highly recommend this book. It is useful not only for the information but is balanced and clear. This isn't a "diet" but information on what affects PCOSer, IR folks, Diabetics and Pre-diabetics and how to avoid the insulin issues. In the last 6.5 months I have lost 75 lbs, 51 1/4 inches, increased my energy and strength (along with exercise) and gone down 10 sizes. I don't count calories, I don't deny myself, I eat healthy food. And this book has helped me do this.</span>

                    <span>If it ignores biochemical individuality and pretends that all foods have the same effects on all bodies, the book is worthless and very dangerous nutritionally. It will certainly help some, though that is only because around 50% of people in the world would apply to its recommendations. For instance, foods can have different effects in different bodies. <P>If you want to know more about your body type before you begin a nutritional program, I suggest the following books instead. Most of the information presently known is from the sympathetic system side and very little is known about the autonomic, though these recommendations can protect you from such false suggestions of a 'common good program' for all people. Know thyself, before you make a nutritional plan. With the following books you can:<P>Day, Phillip. 2001. Health Wars. Kent, England: Credence Publications.<P>Wiley, Rudolf A, Ph.D. 1989.
