                <span id="Label1">Packing a whopping 22 hours of content on five double-sided discs, <I>Los Angeles Lakers: The Complete History</I> is a treasure trove for fans of the purple and gold.  In fact, even the ambitious title doesn't do the set justice, as the opening 2002 documentary traces the franchise to its Minnesota roots and a vintage 1953 feature shows the game's first dominant big man, George Mikan, in action.  The glitzier West Coast years--Wilt, West, Magic, Kareem, Shaq, Kobe, et al.--are the primary focus, of course, and this set, one of the first two entries in the NBA Dynasty series (along with the slightly less-substantial <I>Chicago Bulls: The 1990s</I>), collects seven of the highlight videos that were released on VHS (2000 and 2002 were also on DVD), which provide a time-capsule look at each of the championship seasons.  <p>  The real joy of the set, however, is nine NBA playoff games presented as they were originally broadcast and almost in their entirety.  They last about 90-100 minutes with TV introductions and post-game interviews, but minus halftime, commercials, and some slower moments.  The games include such absolute classics as the game in which rookie Magic Johnson started at center in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the 1987 "baby hook" game against the Boston Celtics.  If you're used to watching current NBA games you might be tempted to just skip to the end, but it's surprisingly rewarding to watch the game develop, to watch the game's superstars strut their stuff (or see a couple of 1972 reserves named Phil Jackson and Pat Riley), and to observe how radically the sport has changed over the years.  Variable picture quality and technical glitches are unavoidable (even the 2002 game looks washed out), but this is the first time complete or nearly complete NBA games have been available in the home-video era, and they probably still look better than the VHS tapes you've been saving over the years.  Yes, it'd be easy to argue about which games from the Lakers' long history should have been included, and the highlight videos don't have a ton of replay value, but the NBA Dynasty series is a major milestone in archived sports.  <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>Finally! The 2000-2001 Championship DVD was NEVER released on DVD (only on VHS) until now! You get all the recent 'back-to-back-to-back' championship dvds as well as the early years. The Showtime Dynasty was incredible. To relive those fabulous years by watching this DVD is so nostaligic. My only rant is -- where's Kobe? His picture is not ornamated anywhere on this DVD, yet there's a pic of DFish and Rick Fox. Is there some sort of conspiracy with Kobe not being mentioned on the DVD covers? And not mentioned as a Laker great? I sincerely hope Warner Bros and the Lakers organization have a good explaination for this. Kobe is a cornerstone of the current Lakers dynasty as much (and if not more) than Shaq.</span>

                    <span>I still have the VHS "Lakers 87," even though I have no VCR player! Maybe I would have broken down and got a VCR just to watch the worn out tape. But it's a non-issue! This disc set is truly a treasure trove for - not just B-Ball - but for *sports* at its best! The Lakers of the 80's, according to Dr. J, are the best NBA team ever. They were indeed the most exciting, bringing team play, fast breaks, and show biz appeal to a new level. Remember how almost every game, the Lakers stepped on the court to start the 3rd quarter... and pulled away to quick huge leads? Like Butter! The *pinnacle* of beauty was (sorry M. Jordon) Magic on the break, in the middle to wingman Worthy, or Scott, or Green, or Ramb-O! It's the coup de grace, baby! Hear color man Tommy Heinson (aka Fred Flinstone) call the action. It's yubba, dubba, doo time baby!!! Along with an Ali compilation, this is THE DVD -- to see the best of sport in the modern era. Lakers vs. Celtics is a greater style/skills/culture clash than Ali/Frazier or Foreman. What a matchup... slam dunk! Just one thing, though: Where is Twinkle Toes Jackson, "master of the finger roll" (white off-guard circa 1976-7)? Some footage of Twinkle doing his reverse roll, 180 roll, tootsie roll, rolling thunder would have been awesome! And remember when Twinkle launched from *the free line* for a finger roll!! Twink was solo on the fast break, Chick Hearns announcing, "Mission to control, prepare for take off!" Twink was still about 8 feet from the hoop when he rolled the ball up, and landed 6-7 feet from the hoop!! But while he was in flight the crowd was going c-raazy, flash bulbs were popping everywhere!! Then Twinkle released his "landing gear!" Anyway, I thought they could have shown a few minutes of Twinkle.</span>

                    <span>This set is certainly desirable for any die hard Lakers fan, and basketball fans who remember how great the game became after Magic and Larry Bird paved the way for unselfish play will surely enjoy it.<P>The edited games are great. The finals games featured between the Lakers and the Sixers are mindblowing because of how fast paced they were. It's pure fast break basketball at its best. The games between the Lakers and the Celtics are intense and you also realize what an excellent job Dick Stockton did for CBS when he was the play-by-play man. In retrospect, even Stockton's color man partner seems pretty balanced, even though he was a Celtic great and even though he had the incredibly irritating habit of placing the subject of his sentences at the very end, Tom Heinsohn. <P>No set is going to be perfect, but I think where the box set is a bit of a letdown is in the "history" aspect. It's really just a compilation of all the NBA films that they do at the end of each year for the champion. And while they are all pretty good and I rented them all years ago, they don't really tell the history of the team. They tell the history of the champtionship seasons.<P>If you're looking for history, Disc 1 is probably the best, with old footage and more recent interviews. But there's no description of the Lakers of the '70s and how they got Kareem and what the team was like before Magic and how the Lakers drew about 11,000 fans per game. I think that is missing from this and I would have liked to have seen more of that. Also too bad someone couldn't dig up more interviews with Elgin Baylor and Jerry West talking about how frustrating it was to lose all those years to the Celtics, although there is a good feature on Rod Hundley and Tommy Hawkins talking about the '85 Lakers win.<P>Two other criticisms: (1) On the whole the editing of the games is very good, but on the early games is a bit choppy. We lose the last few minutes of the 71-72 Lakers championship, which was the team's first and there's no footage of West running off the court with Pat Riley. It should have been there. (2) Not enough about Chick Hearn and his role with the Lakers. He's featured prominently as the narrator on the '87 overview, but there should have been more devoted to him. Also, it would have been nice if they could have taken one or two of the games and replaced the network commentary with Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz.<P>Still, any Lakers fan should have this.</span>

                    <span>Well when i got the DVD i thought it would be the complete history of the Lakers even the years they didnt win the title. The DVD was just a compilation of the Lakers Championship Videos and had 9 of the games from championship years. The DVD was good but I was expecting more. If you want a complete history of the World Champion Lakers then I highley recomend it. <P>PS: They should make a Dynasty Series DVD for the Celtics</span>

                    <span>Guess we were a little premature in predicting a 15th championship for the Lakers this year. Oh well, it just makes this set an even more fitting collectible for all Laker fans out there. After all it might be a few years before we see them win another one, so it puts some closure to the dynasty for now. Til they win another one, we can always check out these DVD's and revisit happier times with the Lakers!<BR>P.S. All you Boston fans out there seem to be suffering from mass amnesia. Sure they have more championships but the Celtics havent been relevant for more than a decade! Are you guys pretending the last 18 years didnt happen? Since 1986 the Celtics have exactly ZERO championships. The championship drought is approaching 20 years and it doesnt look like its gonna end anytime soon.</span>
