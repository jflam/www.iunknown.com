                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Leil Lowndes. Through vivid examples (backed by research studies) and stories from her own fascinating life, she tells the reader HOW to truly be a fantastic friend and HOW to attract & KEEP wonderful people in your life. The book serves as a mirror- it helps you to look at your current patterns, and challenges you to make changes in your life. Leil brings to focus several small elements in life that many people gloss over...by understanding the significance of these details, you can build deeper and more fulfilling friendships. After talking non-stop about how great this book is- I've leant it out to several buddies....they are all huge Leil fans now too! I've also truly enjoyed her other books "Updating" and "How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships."</span>

                    <span>The material in this book is somehow intriguing and indeed useful. What drags it down is the author's style, which is somewhere between gossip and hairdresser's conversation.<br>It's a pity that a lot of energies are spent digging into the countless fluff to get to the bottom line, which, as said before, is not bad.<br>An advice? Read only the summary boxes in every chapter: you'll get a downhill ride throughout the book in 30 minutes to 1 hr (depending on your inspired thoughts).</span>

                    <span>This is beautiful.  The book teaches you how to handle different people and how to be warm.  A brash guy such as me is learning more and more each day when I sit and read this book.  If you are into sales you should read this book.  Sales are about building trust.  However during a business appointment developing trust is a luxury that limited time can not offer.  This book helps you in that department.  Learning science of selling from guys like Brian Tracy and Zig Zigler is all fine but when it comes to retaining you clients forever and getting referrals this book will help more than you'll believe.  For greater understanding of what she is saying, other than her true admiration (love!) for the cowboy salesman, drink a lot of coffee with books on sales and then finish off with Leil's readings.  Do so every day and see how your life changes.  Caution: the book will not help you with sales if you do not practice her words day in and day out.  Developing real warmth towards a stranger is a bio-chemical science and it will not appear real unless you feel warm in the inside (thanks to the bio-chemical reactions) - one will develop this through practice only.  I hope Leil emails me and would throw more light into this.</span>

                    <span>I really needed to hear some suggestions on developing/maintaining and nuturing friendships. This book was more than I could have hoped for at a time in my life when I needed friends the most and didn't seem to have any. It gave me the tools I needed to do just that and more. I'm finding it fun to work on "Knights At My Round Table." I'm learning how to develop friendships with all different types of people - people I really like who may not necessarily like each other. <br>  Leil shares some very personal experiences in her book - experiences that are only printed words to people who have not gone through them. She talks about the importance of having friends during these times. Friends who do things for you without asking "why or how." Friends who help us live our lives when we have trouble remembering how. <br>  I'll never be without friends now after reading this book. It's helped to change my life and see what's most important to me in addition to my immediate family.</span>

                    <span>God Bless Leil Lowndes! How beautiful she is, in every sense of the word, for bringing forth this piece of work to us from her heart. Her book suffuses such a refreshing sense that we can altogether break from the cycle of cliches associated with the labeling on different groups of society. As diverse as peoples'  communications means are today, she gracefully blends tact with compassion in her approach to have a better understanding on human nature and behavior and how we can all not shy away and come to get to know one another. Along with a myriad of examples and topics included, inherent in everyday life, Lowndes also adds a variety of approaches siutable to anyone and everyone, (like a one-size-fits-all technique) and the power of possibility, making it not only easy, but a pleasure to read this book. <p> Thank you, Liel!</span>
