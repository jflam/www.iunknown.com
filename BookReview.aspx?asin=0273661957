                    <span>As the CEO of a software company, I have been searching for PRACTICAL advice for enhancing the experience for our customers. Most books I have seen are full of theory and are basically worthless. If you don't walk away from this book with a list of action items, then you obviously don't care about serving your customers.<P>I believe that this book will be on my desk as a reference for a long time. It will take a couple of years to implement all that I learned.<P>Definitely worth the read!</span>

                    <span>Unlike others in the field, Wheeler and Smith lay out what you need to do to consciously design a business that consistently gives the customer an experience that lives up to their brand. In the rush to cost control, we often forget that it's easy to make life difficult for the customer, and the result is massive damage to the brand, even to the point of destroying the organization.<P>A must read, especially in uncertain times, where the tendency will be to cut, without regard for the customer.</span>

                    <span>We all know that the customer has already become the decision maker of company operations in the digital economy. Without custmers, no company can survive. Shaun's book certainly uncovers the secrets on how to sustain the performance and growth of the company. He illustrates his proven model with a number of cases we can benchmark. In this regard, I dare to say that this book may be used by all business people as the bible of management.</span>

                    <span>This is a must-read book for executives and managers seeking to improve customer loyalty. The authors convincingly demonstrate how branded customer experience drives customer loyalty to create a sustainable competitive advantage. The book is well researched and contains dozens of examples of companies who have met the loyalty/branding challenge. The stories behind the success of Harley Davidson, Amazon.com, Virgin, Home Depot and many others are fascinating and highly instructive. The ideas and perspectives covered in this book are both insightful and pragmatic. It is an excellent resource.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely worth the read. It does a nice job of quickly building the case as to why delivering an exceptional customer experience is the key issue for many companies today, especially service firms. More importantly it provides a clear example of how to get it done, so for internal practioners this book can serve as a straightforward roadmap for implementation. I also thought the examples were good, especially as they related to the issue of senior leadership engagement. Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone else interested in this subject since I have not found a lot of material that actually describes what to do to deliver a branded customer experience.</span>
