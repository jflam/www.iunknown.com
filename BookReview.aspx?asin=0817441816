                <span id="Label1">Almost everyone can "see" in the conventional sense, but developing photographic vision takes practice. Learning to See Creatively helps photographers visualize their work, and the world, in a whole new light.  <P>Now totally rewritten, revised, and expanded, this best-selling guide takes a radical approach to creativity. It explains how it is not some gift only for the "chosen few" but actually a skill that can be learned and applied. Using inventive photos from his own stunning portfolio, author and veteran photographer Bryan Peterson deconstructs creativity for photographers. He details the basic techniques that went into not only taking a particular photo, but also provides insights on how to improve upon it&#151;helping readers avoid the visual pitfalls and technical dead ends that can lead to dull, uninventive photographs.  <P>This revised edition features the latest information on digital photography and digital imaging software, as well as an all-new section on color as a design element. Learning to See Creatively is the definitive reference for any photographers looking for a fresh perspective on their work.  <P>* New edition of a best-selling title <BR>* Updated to include digital <BR>* All new artwork, and a totally revised and expanded text <BR>* All-new section on color as a design element <BR>* Written by one of Amphoto's bestselling authors</span>

                    <span>I have read a few books on compositions. What makes this one standout is the way Bryan illustrates his technique. In each chapter, he first defines each concept clearly, then he uses pictures and the related comments to demonstrate the point. Combining all the chapters, it is a complete approach to composition. He always includes a "big picture" shot to go with the sample picture to demonstrate the different the technique makes. By doing so, it also demonstrates how to use photography telling a story. <BR>The focus is on building and fixed subject. The tonal contrast bit could be better. Also no mentioning of layering (maybe by design). These are very minor gipes.<BR>The book is very easy to read and understand. It has a lot of beautiful pictures of Oregon. Hey, he has made power lines looking good (in picture anyway)! Highly recommended for beginner and intermediate photographer.</span>

                    <span>This is an interesting little book. It is geared towards the novice photographer, but others with more experience may be inspired by it too. It can easily be read in one sitting. The author shuns sophisticated camera lingo or fancy techniques and concentrates on the fundamentals of composing a memorable photograph. The book is profusely illustrated and most photographs are presented twice, one framed in the conventual manner and the second with a subtle, but dramatic improvement. The author powerfully demonstrates that minor changes can have profound effects on the success of the picture. Raising or lowering the camera angle, using aperture to control depth of field, choosing the proper focal length, emphasizing lines, texture or shapes as well as other simple techniques are all briefly discussed. The prose is concise; for the most part the author lets the photography do the talking. While these are all basic techniques and the author does not cover any unique ground, the information is well presented. Most successful photographs fail because of simple mistakes. The author almost exclusively confines his focus to landscape photography or inanimate objects. The reader looking for insight into photographing people or nature will be better served by other references. The reader looking for the basics of using a camera, or the reader looking for intermediate or advanced technique will also be disappointed. However, if, like so many of us, you are in need of simple techniques to improve your photographs, this is a useful resource. The novice will certainly benefit from reading this and even the experienced photographer may find an idea or two.</span>

                    <span>I own the previous edition of this book, so I waited with anxious expectation for its revision. This is more than a revision, it's a brand new book, a necessary addition to the theory and practice of implementing creative vision in making photographs. I recommend this book to all who wish to receive inspiration and mentoring in realizing their own creative vision in photography and even general artistic picture making. The text is written in Bryan Peterson's inimitable down to earth, friendly yet knowledgeable style. The photographs are truly inspirational. This book is a keeper!</span>

                    <span>When I heard that this book was going to be revised, I waited for it in anxious anticipation - it was well worth the wait!<P>Sometimes all that is needed to improve a composition is to change one's perspective, which is often pointed out in this book. This is something I'm learning to take advantage of, and can see the improvement in my pictures.<P>I was also happy to see a section added dealing with color and one on digital imaging.<P>If you've got a basic understanding of photography behind you, then I'd highly recommend this book!</span>
