                    <span>I think the question is whether you are an advanced amateur or pro photographer already-someone who is looking for advanced diagrams, etc. on studio setups, etc. That is NOT the type of book this is. For someone-such as myself-who is self-taught and trying to learn or solidfy an understanding of lighting, this book is an excellent tool. It does include exercises, but by no means do they take up the bulk of the text. Most of the text is lean, clear writing that helps you understand the characteristics and behavior of light, some different choices you have for lighting, etc. As such, the book very much fills a niche for a certain audience because unlike other books, this one attempts to teach the foundations of photographic lighting. And it does that job well.</span>

                    <span>I regret buying this. Its partly my fault for not reading more reviews. Its also partly the problem with buying on line. In a book store had I looked at this book I would have seen that is merely a lesson plan for teachers with out an idea. The book offers almost no information. Instead the premise is that the 'student' should go out and do the exercises. In other words, learn it by yourself.<BR>Perhaps if you are a teacher without an idea you could use this for lesson plans. The authors are an example of university teachers who publish garbage to appear to advance their status on campus. Otherwise this book is useless.</span>

                    <span>This is not a good book if you want in-depth information on the subject of lighting. However, it does give a nice overview of the major areas of photographic lighting. Unfortunately, it leaves the reader wanting more information and further explanations. I felt this book was a good read for a novice photographer, but not someone who knows the basics, but wants a more in-depth view of the broader categories of lighting.</span>

                    <span>This book is fantastic! It covers all aspects of photographic lighting from film, filters, exposure, compensation, zone system to creative techniques. The terminology is easy to understand and techniques explained in a "no nonsense" format. Excellent for beginners to intermediate photographers.<P>I have had this book for a few months now and through practicing and completing the revision exercises, I have a better understanding of the techniques used for photograhic lighting situations - location and studio (lighting ratios etc)<P>I hope they publish many more books like this one.<P>Thanks Amazon.</span>
