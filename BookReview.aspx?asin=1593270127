                <span id="Label1"> The UNIX shell is the main scripting environment of every Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX system, whether a rescued laptop or a million-dollar mainframe. This cookbook of useful, customizable, and fun scripts gives you the tools to solve common Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX problems and personalize your computing environment. Among the more than 100 scripts included are an interactive calculator, a spell checker, a disk backup utility, a weather tracker, and a web logfile analysis tool. The book also teaches you how to write your own sophisticated shell scripts by explaining the syntax and techniques used to build each example scripts. Examples are written in Bourne Shell (sh) syntax.</span>

                    <span>Another one of my goals this year is to get familiar with Linux and shell scripting.  I have some "how to" books, but I also picked up Dave Taylor's Wicked Cool Shell Scripts - 101 Scripts For Linux, Mac OS X, and UNIX Systems (No Starch Press).  Taylor's done a great job with this book.
<br />
<br />Chapter List:  Introduction; The Missing Code Library; Improving on User Commands; Creating Utilities; Tweaking Unix; System Administration: Managing Users; System Administration: System Maintenance; Web and Internet Users; Webmaster Hacks; Web and Internet Administration; Internet Server Administration; Mac OS X Scripts; Shell Script Fun and Games; Afterword; Index
<br />
<br />Taylor didn't write this book as a tutorial on script writing.  Rather, he wanted to provide a "cookbook" of scripts that people could learn from and use immediately.  He also wanted something more interesting than the scripts normally found in the how to books on the market.  I'd agree that he's accomplished his purpose.  Each script starts with a listing of the code and an explanation of how it works.  He shows you how to run the script and what the results of running the script should be.  Finally, there's a "hacking the script" paragraph that explains how you might want to modify the script to do something different.  This entire package of paragraphs in each script serves as a sort of "mini-lesson" on some aspect of script writing.
<br />
<br />As I mentioned above, I'm not quite ready for this book right now.  When I pick up some fundamentals, I'll be heading into the Web and Internet Users section.  There's code there on using Lynx and shell scripts to strip out information from websites.  I have a project in mind I've wanted to do for some time, and I think I finally found the tools that will allow me to do it.
<br />
<br />As a side note:  LinuxWorld Magazine voted this book the Best Shell Script Programming Book of 2004.  So I'm not the only one who thinks it's pretty good...
<br />
<br />A well-written book packed with a ton of practical information.  If you have a background in shell scripting and you want to stretch a little, this is the book for you...</span>

                    <span>This is a great book on Unix shell scripting. The book is loaded with useful scripts and I was even able to use some of the ideas presented in this book to make my own scripts perform much more efficiently. At one point I got stuck with one of the scripts so I emailed the author and he got back to me with a fix within a couple of days. Turned out to be a quirk with the Solaris 8 version of the operating system. I would recommend this book to anyone who works with Unix systems.</span>

                    <span>I've been using this book to learn Unix scripting. By writing the scripts in the book and seeing them work you get an understaning of how the script functions. By taking pieces of different scripts and using them in your own you can build up a good understanding of scripting concepts. I've tried several books and this one is at the top of my list!</span>

                    <span>I guess it's always difficult deciding on whether to buy a techy book like this one - particularly if you're ordering on the web. Fortunately, I bought my copy from one of those old-fashioned book shops and was able to browse through the scripts before making the decision :-)
<br />
<br />This book has some very useful scripts in it. They probably won't be *exactly* what you're looking for, but they are good examples that can easily be adapted and appended to help you work smarter/faster.
<br />
<br />The accompanying descriptions are written so that those who are unfamiliar with the shell will have enough information to get the scripts up and running - and those who are familiar with the shell won't feel patronized.
<br />
<br />Being a Mac scripter myself, I also like the fact that the author *likes* OS X and has included lots of OS X-specific information in the book.
<br />
<br />This would be a useful addition to the library of a Mac user who wants to move from plain *user* to *power-user* :-)</span>
