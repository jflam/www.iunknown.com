                    <span>This is a most amazing resource for all self-employed people. The authors know their subject incredibly well. Their advice is clearly based on exhaustive research and the results of interviewing many, many business owners to see which methods of promotion work best for them. 
<br />
<br />The resources listings at the end of each listing are valuable in their own right. 
<br />
<br />The authors write in a clear style and explain not only what to do but how to do it. They also spell out clearly the pros and cons of each form of marketing and the importance of carrying out marketing that suits your personal style. 
<br />
<br />The value of this book far exceeds the price. Just look at the number of pages. Cut years off your learning curve and buy this book now.</span>

                    <span>For just a few dollars, you get hundreds of pages (almost 700) filled with valuable advice, tips, and information on how to do your own marketing. This is a comprehensive guide that is a must-have for small business owners. With minor exceptions, the material in this book isn't likely to change that much over time. I can't comment on the book's usefulness to big businesses.<p>The book is divided into 4 parts and 13 chapters - the first part deals with getting ready to be in demand and sought after, the second part is about creating a winning marketing message, the third part helps you choose tailor made marketing methods, and the last part is about growing big. My only wish is that there was a fifth part dedicated to using the web for marketing your business (this is addressed throughout the book but not in sufficient detail as this book was published in 1998). <p>The hundreds of tips and information are explained in a clear and a simple fashion that easily lead to actionable tasks. That's the best part about the book on top of the flow of topics. Considering how much material is packed into this book, it will take a long time to cover everything - probably a few months to a year. I have had this book for over a year and still not finished it. There are also lots of references to other helpful sources of related information.<p>If you own a small business, don't hesitate and just get this book. It will be one of the most valuable purchases, I am sure of it. Good luck with your endeavors!</span>

                    <span>If you own a business and you want ideas for marketing, this book is for you.  There's something in it for the beginner and for the expert, and I don't think you could ever use all of the ideas it provides.  I started putting some of the tips to use the day the book arrived (even before I had thoroughly read it--after just flipping through it a bit) and my business saw the results very quickly.  I highly recommend this book, especially for small business owners.</span>

                    <span>I have to admit that I have not delved into the book too much yet partly because the areas that I skimmed were old news to me. It does, however, have a wealth of information for those who are not familiar with marketing oneself. When I have slow times in my business, I pick it up and try to pick up new tips or refresh old tips. I am sure I will get good use out of it.</span>
