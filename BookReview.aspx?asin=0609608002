                <span id="Label1"><I>Start with No</I>, by negotiation coach Jim Camp, is a tenaciously contrarian guide to the art and science of give-and-take that proposes a viable alternative for today's prevailing "win-win" approach. Beginning with an inverse premise--that having the right to say "no" and veto any agreement is actually the key to favorably concluding the various deals and transactions we face every day--Camp's procedure counters the common emotion-based urge to compromise ("a defeatist mind-set from the first handshake") with a series of less intuitive decision-oriented actions. "My system teaches you how to control what you can control in a negotiation," Camp writes. "When you do so, you can and will succeed (understanding that success sometimes means walking away with a polite good-bye)." Emphasizing the importance of this underlying attitude, his method combines related steps like defining a mission, understanding the adversary, assessing fiscal and emotional investments, preparing an agenda, and tracking behavior. Each is fully explained, as are associated skills such as how to structure a question to elicit a truly helpful response (e.g., "What else do you need?" vs. "Is there anything else you need?"). Despite its unorthodox manner, if diligently applied, the route that Camp details here may indeed produce winning results. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>This is a disappointment.  Reading it, one always feels like there is going to be a technique or revelaton around the corner, but it never appears. There is some good stuff about neediness and questions and distinguishing between factors under control and those that are not.  It is OK, but I suggest Roger Dawson's books as an adjunct.</span>

                    <span>I picked up "Getting to Yes" in my first year of law school -- and quickly got tired of getting my rear handed to me every time I entered a negotiation.  But I never found anything better until I picked up this book.  Contrary to the folk wisdom that had been passed down to me, you don't have to be a tough, table-pounding, take-no-prisoners jerk to win a negotiation.  Camp's style is unfailingly helpful and polite -- I could see my mother doing it -- but at the same time tough as nails.  (Perhaps this explains why my mother always gets her way....) And although Camp (quite justifiably) spends a lot of time bashing "Getting to Yes," his style also looks for creative resolutions and synergies when they can be found.  I just got through a particularly tough negotiation with my mission and purpose intact, giving my adversary the opportunity to say no at every turn, and I've never felt better.  Thanks, Jim! </span>

                    <span>Hello all,
<br />two years ago I decided to start my own business. The result so far has been nothing at all. In spite of having many ideas somehow I haven't been able to get to the end of any. 
<br />
<br />All the times I have negotiated I have done feeling a big necessity to receive a yes and I have reached very bad agreements resulting in people not taking me seriously. I just didn't have the slightest clue at managing negotiations: What to expect, how to act, how to ask for what I want,...
<br />
<br />Today I had my first negotiation after reading this wonderful book. What a difference. I didn't feel any necessity cause I know there are more companies that would be interested. I had on paper a list of the things I wanted to received from the other company. I was willing to receive a NO or to say it.
<br />
<br />Result: Instead of just talking and getting nowhere (like always so far) the guy has accepted my petitions and I am moving on with the project. What a difference!!!
<br />
<br />I feel that now I have tools at negotiating. I don't feel lost or fearful. I know how to act and ask for what I want.
<br />
<br />Thanks Jim Camp for this book.
<br />(sorry for my english which limits how I can explain myself).</span>

                    <span>A simply brilliant book, on "how to" negotiate. While contrarian in nature the underlaying principles are a lot closer to win-win than the author admits. A thurough understanding of win-win and strategic negotiation is required before reading this book however. 
<br />It dose take some time to "get into" this book, as it contradicts everything you have been tought. But stick it out and you will begin to see the deeper level of understanding behind the book, and win-win strategy as well.
<br />
<br />A must read for any profesional. As for those who "don't get it" - too bad.</span>

                    <span>There is just nothing in this book. Even books like Solution Selling, and Major Account Sales Strategy have better negotiation content - and these books have maybe 10 pages devoted to it.
<br />
<br />The author uses his military background to create action anologies and military terms and name dropping to cover the fact there is NOT anything actionable that one could possibly take away from this book.
<br />
<br />If I had learnt anything at all from this book, I would negotiate my money back.
<br />
<br />HUGE Disappointment.</span>
