                <span id="Label1">Here's an unusual approach to traditional woodwork styles written specifically with new construction in mind. Current building techniques and budgets seldom allow for the kind of lovely and appealing detail found in older homes, so much new construction today is rather bland, unadorned, and visually boring compared to some of the elaborate and beautiful interior detail of older homes.<p> Rodriguez offers a number of step-by-step projects to bring some visual interest and style to an otherwise uninteresting newer home, including a board and batten door, wide plank flooring, chair rails, fireplace mantles, door and window casings, corner cupboards, window seats, and even a charming and elegant mailbox post! Tools, materials, and detailed techniques are included for every project, making some of the simpler projects workable for even a beginning woodworker. <I>--Mark A. Hetts</I></span>

                    <span>My wife and I are restoring a home built in 1908. It is a little past the time period this book refers to, but many of the items like the trim work and mantel pieces are not at all out of place for later homes. As other readers have stressed, the only complaint you will have is when you get through the book and find yourself wanting more projects and tips for traditional woodwork in older homes.</span>

                    <span>Traditional Woodwork provides weekend woodworkers with projects and ideas that will produce results that are found in 17th and 18th century homes. Mario Rodriguez approach to building these projects makes what would seem to be difficult, very easy to understand and follow. Using clear photographs and easy to read text, projects move along smoothly using inexpensive tools. With a little weekend time, authentic period details can be added to any home new or old. The only thing wrong with this book is it is to short and you will want more.</span>

                    <span>This is a great reference book if you want to add traditional details to a modern home. I especially liked the chapters on adding built up baseboards and window molding. I first saw the book at my local library and found myself checking it out so often that I decided to buy my own copy. Chapters include adding wide plank flooring, a corner cabinet and building your own mantel.</span>

                    <span>I own a small woodworking business and when I ordered this book, I expected to learn how to construct a period fireplace mantel, and maybe some base board trim. What I got was a clearly written and reader friendly tribute to yesterday's woodworkers. Mr. Rodriguez is excellent at taking the reader through the above projects and many others, giving him (her) the background and traditional tools and methods used to create the finished product while also offering modern time saving alternatives.What I found particularly useful was a mindful chapter on the laying of wide plank floors. I have searched high and low and never have I learned as much useful information on this topic as Mr.Rodriguez provided me in 15 minutes. I found the other chapters to be helpful as well. The federal style mantel project is outstanding. This is a book I would've paid twice the price for.</span>
