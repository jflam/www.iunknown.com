                    <span>Baseball: The People's Game is the third volume in the series of this famous work and the best of the three books. It's about the way people played amateur and semipro ball all over the country, in schools and colleges, on sandlots, even in prisons and on reservations. It includes five chapters on early women's baseball and of course material on the black clubs and leagues. I'm the wife and assistant of the late author, Dr. Harold Seymour, the historian of baseball. To read more about his baseball books, visit my web site, http://www.DorothyJaneMills.com. Soon I will be opening a new web site about his work: www.HaroldSeymour.com</span>

                    <span>Harold Seymour made the right move as a kid when he waited on Bedford Avenue outside the right field fence at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn to catch home runs hit off the bats of Dolph Camilli and Pete Reiser. Thus began a love affair with the game that has blossomed into three great books  including "The People's Game," maybe the best. Seymour goes into  great detail about aspects of the game as they relate not to the big  leagues or even to the bushes but to stories and anecdotes that anybody who  has ever played the game can relate to, especially us old timers. If you're  my age, you probably remember continually taping up the .35 ball after the  cover came off, generally about the second inning. If it was a really big  game, you probably used white medical tape that you had purloined from the  medicine chest. But in all likelihood, you used the much more utilitarian  black friction tape from the garage.The ball had to last the whole game as  no one had another thirty five cents for a second one. And do you remember  when there just weren't enough gloves to go around and you had to share a  mitt with your opposing player? A myriad of rememberances await readers of  this love letter to our National Pastime. But they are six hundred of the  liveliest, most interesting pages any player or fan of the game will ever  read. Go read this home run of a book! It's a gem.</span>
