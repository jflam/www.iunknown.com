                <span id="Label1">The Landser, German soldiers in World War II, were feared for the efficiency and ruthlessness in battle. In his book Frontsoldaten, Stephen G. Fritz mines the letters, diaries, memoirs, and oral histories of these men to create the definitive account of soldiers' lives on the front lines. Frontsoldaten addresses the training, images of combat, living conditions, combat stress, bonds of comradeship, ideology, and motivation of the Landser.  <P>Frontsoldaten reveals the war through the eyes of these self-styled "little men" with a sense of immediacy and intimacy. Fritz contrasts these German soldiers with their American counterparts, showing how much soldiers everywhere have in common. But he also discusses significant differences in ideological intensity, group cohesiveness, ingenuity, discipline, and quality of equipment that will come as a suprise to many readers familiar with the history of World War II.</span>

                    <span>This is an indispensible, if somewhat superficial, look at the ideological motivations of the German soldier (or "landser" as he called himself) during WWII. It is the only book I've ever read that actually attempts to probe the mindset of the rank-and-file soldiers and junior officers who fought Hitler's war rather than dismissing them as brainwashed robots or mindless products of a militant culture, content to "just follow orders." <P>Author Fritz genuinely wants to understand why the Landser fought so long and so hard, and against such overwhelming odds, for a government that committed such outrageous crimes against humanity. To do this he examines the correspondence of, and some of the memiors and fiction written by, the average Wehrmacht soldier (he excludes works written by veterans of the Waffen SS, because he feels they come from a different place ideologically than the guys in gray). In his examination, Fritz makes a number of assertions, observations and discoveries, some of which are extremely interesting, while others which come off as facile and opinionated.<P>On the plus side, Fritz does an excellent job of examining how Hitler's promise of a 'social revolution' which would produce a truly classless society by transferring the selfless, all-for-one values of the combat soldier (the 'frontsgemeinschaft') to the whole civilian population (creating the 'Volksgemeinschaft'), intensely motivated millions of young men. He does a fairly poor job of explaining why Germans had such intensely anti-class feelings (it is not generally knpwn that Germany has traditionally had intense class divisions and hatreds going back centuries....see Bailey's excellent work, 'Germans'); the two go hand in hand. Anyway, Fritz comes to the conclusion that for many in the German army, the war was not about conquest, but about an attempt to create a totally new world, one where all the old, corrupt ways of doing business would be thrown out the window, and a sort of socialist meritocracy created. He also does a very insightful job of showing that the Hitler Youth was not merely a brainwashing factory but a place where children were taught to ignore social status and think about the group before the individual, and how emotionally moved many of the children were by this notion. One of the most startling comments comes from a committed German communist who admitted, 'The HJ was a positive sight in my neighborhood.'<P>The German soldiers' reaction to combat, hardship, and suffering was largely the same as any other combatants', but Fritz points out that the superior German educational system of the 1930s and 40s produced rank-and-file soldiers who could quote philosophers and theologians in their letters home, and had a firm grasp of military and political history in Europe. This is why the letters of many privates sound like master's dissertations, and makes for good insight.<P>Fritz is also on the ball with his analysis of German training methods, which relied heavily on psychology (amusing in light of the Jewish origin of this science...somehow I'm sure Freud got no credit) and the understanding that cameraderie and initiative were more important than any other factor in producing first-class soldiers. He points out that the British and Russian armies actually showed far less imagination in battle, and they, rather than the Germans were closer to being 'robots' than the Germans.<P>Where Fritz stumbles is in his sources, which rely too heavily on Sajer's "Forgotten Soldier" and on the letters of two or three particular soldiers. He also has a tendency to throw in disclaimer-type statements, as if he fears he is being too sympathetic to the Nazis. The book sometimes has the feel of a graduate thesis itself. <P>Overall, though, I would strongly recommend "Frontsoldaten" to anyone who wants a better understanding of why one poor nation led by a man who was probably insane before the war even started, came to within a hair's breadth of conquering the world.</span>

                    <span>This book is from the U of Kentucky press and is essentially a loose collection of first-person accounts from the Landser (German infantryman) during WW2. The chapters are organized by topic and the writer provides some supporting analysis to supplement the quotes and give structure to the overall work. <P>The quotes and personal accounts of the war are extremely interesting. The book does not get bogged down in the detail of individual battles, campaigns, or strategies, but instead focuses on the feelings and emotions of the soldiers involved. I found the analyses, however, to be a bit superficial and too forced. At times it seemed the author was analyzing things just to have something to say. He also quotes too heavily from certain sources (he must have quoted Guy Sajer's Forgotten Soldier 50 times) and tends to use the same quote several times throughout the book to support various analyses.<P>Despite the problems of the weak analyses and the repetition of quotations, the personal accounts are extremely interesting and make up for the book's deficiencies.</span>

                    <span>The author has strung together quotes from thinly disguised works of fiction, did not interview a single veteran himself, and has passed it off as some sort of scholarly work. The only embarrassing thing about this is the pseudo-intellectuals who have bellied up to the bar here to trumpet and champion this second rate work. I suppose for those starved for literature sympathetic to the Nazi cause in WW II, this book must appear to be a godsend.<P>But for those with an actual working knowledge of the Wehrmacht Heer in the Second World War, they can only shake their heads at the ignorance displayed in the other reviews here. For shame.</span>

                    <span>For me this book offers a glimpse into the lives of soldiers whos story is seldom told. Placing aside the crimes of the Nazi's this book shows that the German soldier were still human beings. Their story is worthy of being told and despite which side of the battle they were on, their story is worth being heard and remembered. This book pays little attention to the cold over view of world war two that many books focus on, and sheads light on the war through the eyes of the men who had to do the fighting. This is truely a beautiful book that is brutally honest and human. Worth reading.</span>

                    <span>This book is nothing more than a re-hash of things from other books. A large portion of this book is nothing more than quotes from the book "The forgotten Soldier" by Guy Sajer. Interspersed is the authors "opinion" of what the various quotes mean. Not very historical if you ask me. All in all, it is just barely interesting, and also one of the least informative that I've ever read.</span>
