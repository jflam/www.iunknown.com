                    <span>Author Cindy Ventrice, a management consultant specializing in employee morale, suggests ways to give recognition, not just rewards, to help employee morale and productivity. While some of her tips may sound familiar to those who have read other books on this subject, she is particularly helpful when she suggests which types of rewards work best, and for which employees. She incorporates psychological motivational theory and suggests measurement tools that will give you feedback on which techniques are most effective. We recommend this generally solid book to top executives, managers, HR personnel, workshop leaders and trainers handling employment issues. And, by the way, we really appreciate you. You're doing swell work. Thanks.</span>

                    <span>Saying thanks is not just good manners; it's good business practice. Employers often fail to realize that acknowledging an employee's contributions is an easy and effective form of motivation. And consistent acknowledgement reduces the need for outlay of significant cash, although when something material is given, it should be nice. At www.capitolengraving.com, we have substantial experience in the recognition industry and often remind clients not to give mixed messages by thanking an individual with a cheap gift. Use a mix of techniques, as detailed in this book, to thank and impress outstanding employees.</span>
