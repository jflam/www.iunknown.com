                <DIV class="ReviewHeading">Book Description:</DIV>
                <span id="Label1">INTRODUCTION  <P>Wedged into the northeastern corner of Central America, Belize offers some of the most breathtaking coastal scenery &#150; both above and below water &#150; in the Caribbean. Add to this magnificent inland landscapes, archaeological ruins and wildlife to rival any destination in the region, and it&#146;s easy to see why the number of visitors to this tiny country increases every year. Despite its small size &#150; roughly that of Wales or Massachusetts &#150; Belize has the lowest population density in Central America, a fact that contributes to its easygoing, friendly and, with the exception of bustling Belize City, noticeably uncrowded character.  <P>Belizean territory comprises marginally more sea than land, and for most visitors it&#146;s the sea that&#146;s the main attraction. Lying just offshore is one of the country&#146;s, and the continent&#146;s, most astonishing natural wonders &#150; the dazzling turquoise shallows and cobalt depths of the longest barrier reef in the Americas. Beneath the surface, a brilliant technicolour world of fish and corals awaits divers and snorkellers; while scattered along the entire reef like emeralds set in sapphire, a chain of islands, known as cayes, protects the mainland from the ocean swell and holds more than a hint of tropical paradise. Beyond the reef lie the real jewels in Belize&#146;s natural crown &#150; three of only four coral atolls in the Caribbean. Dawn here is a truly unforgettable experience as the red-gold disk of the sun rises over the foaming white reef crest. These reefs and islands, among the most diverse marine ecosystems on the planet, are increasingly under threat; Belize, however, is at the forefront of practical research to develop effective protection for the entire coastal zone, which for visitors means a chance to explore some of the best marine reserves in the world.  <P>In fact, Belizeans&#146; recognition of the importance of their natural heritage means that the country now has the greatest proportion of protected land (over 40 percent) in the hemisphere. As a result, the densely forested interior with its plentiful natural attractions, including the highest waterfall in Central America and the world&#146;s only jaguar reserve, remains relatively untouched. The rich tropical forests support a tremendous range of wildlife, including howler and spider monkeys, tapirs and pumas, jabiru storks and scarlet macaws; spend any time inland and you&#146;re sure to see the national bird, the unmistakable keel-billed toucan. Although it&#146;s the only Central American country without a volcano, Belize does have some rugged uplands &#150; the Maya Mountains, situated in the south-central region and rising to over 1100m. The country&#146;s main rivers start here, flowing north or east to the Caribbean, and forming some of the largest cave systems in the Americas along the way. Few of these caves have been fully explored but each year more become accessible to visitors.  <P>In addition to these natural attractions, Belize boasts a wealth of archaeological remains. Rising mysteriously out of the forests are the ruins of the ancient cities of the Maya, the civilization that dominated the area from around 2000 BC until the arrival of the Spanish. Traces of this astonishing culture have been found all over the country; Maya ceremonial artefacts have even been discovered deep in caves. And although only a few sites in Belize have been as extensively restored as the great Maya cities in Mexico&#146;s Yucat&#225;n pensinsula, many are at least as large and in their forest settings you&#146;ll see more wildlife and fewer tour buses.  <P>Culturally, Belize is as much a Caribbean nation as a Latin one, but with plenty of distinctively Central American features &#150; above all, a blend of races and cultures that includes Maya, Mestizo, African and European. English is the official language &#150; Belize only gained full independence from Britain in 1981 &#150; and Spanish is equally common,  but it&#146;s the rich, lilting Creole, based on English but typically Caribbean, that&#146;s spoken and understood by almost every Belizean, whatever their mother tongue.</span>

                    <span>This book, though it has many excellent sections and qualities, has one short-coming: its accommodations and restaurants are dated (published 2001 but most establishments were reviewed in 2000 or 1999). There are many new establishments that have opened and a bunch that have closed. I knocked on the door of the "Trends Guest House" in Belize City only to be told by the neighbor, "Its closed. Been closed for two years", "Oh", I replied. "Yea man, there was a murder" the neighbor said. "Oh?" I replied. "Yea, the owner was murdered by a guest." Oh! I replied. So the recommendations are hit and miss, but for those that which were open, the comments are reliable (most have raised their prices) and worth pursuing.<P>If you are going to snorkel or dive, you should know that much of the reefs in the Northern Cayes (Ambergris & Caulker) are 65-85% dead. This is because of the three hurricanes in the last 5 years. According to one marine expert, it will take 20 years or more of them to return. Nothing is said about the destruction to the coral reefs in this guide.<BR><BR>On the plus side this guide has excellent Internet references. Almost every hotel has email addresses and many of them have webpage addresses. Maps are clear, concise and easy to use. Tons of references that point you to a plethora of information on Belize. (most with web address). Belize is completely covered, no area of interest is omitted, and Peter Eltringham has include a very good section on TIKAL, Flores (across the boarder in Guatemala) and the Bay Islands (Roatan).<P>His bibliography on recommended books to read is valuable and solid for anyone that wants to know more on Belize.<P>All Rough Guides have a difficult to use number system to quote the price range of a hotel, i.e. one hotel is a number '6' which means between BZ$110-150 that scale is back on page 28 of the guide, then you convert the BZ$ to $US. This system is a pain when it is so much easier just to say $75 dollars.<P>Bottomline: WHEN the new edition comes out, Rough Guide to Belize will be at the very top of the Belize guides but, until then, you will be best served by another guide.</span>

                    <span>My wife and I went to Belize in April 2002. I reviewed several books of Belize, of which there were few. This one seemed to be the book to buy. I wasn't disappointed. It had very good restuarant recommendations for Ambergris Caye as well as hotel info. Some information was not updated (internet cafe in Cayo had moved, [an inexpensive] great internet connection place was not mentioned also, a series of cabins that were listed as in business in Crooked Tree were *completely* run-down and *nowhere* near being in business) but this didn't hamper our vacation very much. It had good info on stuff to do in and near Cayo. Bottomline: buy this guide if you're going to Belize.</span>

                    <span>(Planeta.com Journal) - This 300-page book is a superb second edition that details the best of ways of exploring Belize (and nearby Tikal and the Bay Islands). What Belize First calls "a tour de force" is a must-read for travelers heading to this country. Author Eltringham's first visit was during his tour of duty by the UK's Royal Air Force. He's returned numerous times and covers community tourism issues with the same clear-spoken authority of trekking and diving. Independent travelers will relish the detailed information, practical advice and helpful maps.</span>

                    <span>We had Lonely Planet "Central America" and Fodor's "Guatemala and Belize", but it was Rough Guide we kept coming back too. In our trip to Guatemala and Belize we spent 4 days in Belize, but only out on the Cayes. Most of the time was spent on Caye Caulker (a very laid back and relaxing escape) staying at Mara's Place which was listed in the guide without much fanfare, but hit the spot. <P>If you need low budget (~25US per room - no tax!) stay with Mara. She is right near the swimming spit and has lovely cabins (no A/C, but ceiling fans) that are simple, but clean. You'll always notice Mara driving around town in her sporty ATV.<P>For the size of the Caye the restaurants are plentiful with most listed in the guide. <P>The one short coming was scuba info. Belize barrier reefs are known for their great scuba and snorkeling and the island has plenty of shops - but only 1 is listed. They will refer you elsewhere if they can't accomodate you, but I am surprised that Rough Guide didn't dedicate more space to this popular sport. I assume the writer either a) didn't spend much time on the Cayes or b) didn't care much for water sports. Might have been both, but this is a huge oversight given that the Cayes are one of the most popular destinations in Belize.<P>Despite this shortcoming - you won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>After looking at several other books we chose this one for our 14 day trip in January of 2001. It was an excellent resource for important info and interesting tid-bits. It is a little old now and some information is out dated at this point. It could really use an update. My husband and I would volunteer to go again!! We had a great time and higly recomend Belize for the less mainstream traveler. Go now though, it is definatly changing! Don't miss Hol Chan marine reserve snorkeling and Placencia village. Also, we loved Crooked Tree and Tikal. Have a great time and take this book with you!!!</span>
