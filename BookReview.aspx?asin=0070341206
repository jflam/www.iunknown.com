                    <span>This book is a good, though only partial, treatment of the subject of developing a seminar business from scratch.  It's actually better at teaching you how to promote yourself as a trainer or seminar leader than it is at showing you how to build a business.  It's "you can do it, too!" approach is empowering but woefully incomplete.
<br />
<br />Seminar leadership is a viable business in itself, as well as a component of any subject matter expert's business.  There is tremendous potential in establishing onself as an expert and selling that expertise though seminars, including "backroom sales" of books, videos, audiotapes, and related products.  Seminar attendees, book readers, etc., are also a potential audience for private consulting assignments.  The ability and drive to leverage one body of knowledge into multiple formats and venues is central to this book's purpose.
<br />
<br />After reading the book and listening to the companion audiotapes (sold separately), I attended a two-day "Seminar Leaders University" hosted by the American Seminar Leaders Association (ASLA), founded by the author and subsequently sold by him.  I hold their "Certified Seminar Leader" (CSL) designation.  However, none of these three resources addressed the *economics* of the seminar business or prepared me for the business of the seminar business.
<br />
<br />Begin with this book, and follow up with Howard Shenson's books, epecially "How to Develop and Promote Successful Seminars and Workshops: The Definitive Guide to Creating and Marketing Seminars, Workshops, Classes, and Conferences," for the dollars and cents of marketing, testing, and delivering successful seminars.
<br />
<br />"How to Make it Big" should whet your appetite for more substantial fare to complement its enthusiasm and introduction to the subject.</span>

It also has so many references and tools that it will be the only book necessary regarding this  subject for you to have and keep.  Thank you Paul!</span>

                    <span>This book was really helpful to me. It contained information on everything from what to do with the initial idea of a seminar business, to how to write a great seminar brochure, to marketing techniques. Overall, I'd  HIGHLY recommend it to others interested in making money in the seminar  business. <p>Also, a good selling point is the listing of names, addresses,  and numbers for people in the business, contacts, good seminar locations,  etc. Very worthwhile investment!</span>
