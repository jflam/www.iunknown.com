                    <span>This is a must-read for anyone interested in the civil rights struggle of the 60's.  It is a very readable and detailed account  of the murder of Medgar Evers by Byron de la Beckwith.  This is one of those books I thought I would leaf through, but I got so absorbed that I read it in one sitting.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely not what you would call fun to read, but it is a stirring and important document.  The author commits a few infelicities of language (for which I would have deducted the quarter-star if I could) but keeps the narrative tension high and sheds a lot of light for this Yankee girl on the kind of culture that made a man like Medger Evers loyal to the state of Mississippi even though it was a state that would allow his murderer to go unpunished for decades.  It doesn't gloss over the warts of those on the side of the angels, and although it doesn't fully explain the psychology of the assassin, perhaps no one can.</span>

                    <span>I picked up Ghosts of Mississippi several years ago but tucked it away for a rainy day.  De la Beckwith's death earlier this week (and a California rain storm) prompted me to dust it off.  I now regret not having read it years ago.  Maryanne Vollers' work is, in short, a masterpiece.  Her amazing investigative skills and craftmanship left me wanting to read more.  Logging on today to write this review, I was thrilled to see that Vollers has a new book out (Ice Bound).  This time I won't wait!</span>

                    <span>I got the paperbound edition of this book on the advice of a friend who, like me, had been disappointed by the film that borrowed its title (but not  its content). The book is so gripping, and knot-in-the-stomach good, both  as a work of journalism and true-life suspense. The sticker on my copy sez  "Ghosts of Mississippi" was a National Book Award Finalist. Hey,  it shoulda won because it's an American masterwork that oughta be taught in  high schools in colleges. Yo! You want heroes worth believing in, and  villains worth bringing to justice? Then put on a CD by the Roots or Rage  Against the Machine and read this righteous book and learn real lessons you  can live by.</span>

                    <span>In the literature of the civil rights movement, Ghosts of Mississippi, stands out like a jewel! Maryanne Vollers brings vast insight and a fine  writer's eye to and agonizing and shameful event in American histoy--the  murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers and the three trials it took  to convict his killer. There is great sadness in this story but also the  hard glint of hope, as Vollers chronicles the love and hope that a few  dedicated inviduals--black and white--carried in their hearts in the long  struggle to see that justice was done, for the family and friends of Medgar  Evers, and for all Americans. Kudos to Ms. Vollers!</span>
