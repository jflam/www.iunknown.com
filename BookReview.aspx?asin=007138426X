                <span id="Label1">Victoria Moran wasn't always as slim and serene as she appears now. For 33 years, she "lunged" at food, bingeing and dieting, rarely losing weight for more than a few weeks at a time. Then 18 years ago, she adopted the principles of self-acceptance, self-nurturing, and spirituality she describes in this book--and lost 60 pounds for good. She learned to live without obsessing about either weight or food, relying on "grace and good sense."<p>  Moran's 101 "simple secrets"--each two to three pages long--are sometimes obvious, sometimes provocative, sometimes profound. Some, like "accept yourself today," "walk more," and "get a support system" seem self-evident, but Moran digs into the psychological components that might be holding you back. A few seem unusual, such as "in the beginning, eat out" (reason: when you eat in a restaurant, it's clear when the meal is over) and "visit an art museum" (to recognize the beauty of voluptuous women). <p>  Moran's style is warm, welcoming, and strong, like a good friend who has found the answers you seek and won't let you off the hook. Highly recommended for emotional eaters who are ready to change the behavior and attitudes that are stopping them from reaching their goals. <I>--Joan Price</I></span>

                    <span>This book has become my best friend. It supports and guides me in my decisions, it cheers me in my smallest and most grand accomplishments, it encourages me to be kind to myself. It offers me practical advice that really works. I love this book as I would a dear friend, and I recommend it sincerely to anyone who is not 100% accepting of the way she feels, looks, or thinks she is perceived in the world. <P>I recommend it also as an alternative to protein diets, low-carb diets, special supplements, and other diet gimmicks. This is about real life and real food and living in the real world. It is really a helpful book.</span>

                    <span>I may have read every diet book ever written and tried everything that's come down the pike. For the first time, reading Fit From Within, I finally feel that someone understands exactly what I go through trying to control my weight. And she knows a way out. I trust this woman because what she writes rings true. I think that I can now live more freely and fully, and this time, I'm trusting that the weight I lose will actually stay off.</span>

                    <span>A quote in this wonderful book changed my life and the way I think about my body that is larger than I want it to be. The quote is as follows:<P>"Get clear on this: being fat is not disgusting. Child abuse is disgusting. Tying up a dog outside all day and night in every kind of weather is disgusting. Homelessness and starvation and weapons of mass destruction are disgusting. Overweight is a state. A situation. An inconvenience certainly. A threat to health in many cases. A sign, perhaps, of self-indulgence or indifference or emotional distress. But not disgusting."<P>I cried when I read this. I have honestly looked in the mirror and said to myself "you are disgusting." But, you know what, my being overweight does NOT make me disgusting. Ms. Moran is absolutely correct in putting things in perspective, and she changed the way I think about myself with this one paragraph. I hope you will buy this book and be affected as I was.</span>

                    <span>I Like Victoria Moran's books, and bought this one because I wanted advice and ideas about getting fit. Although the book is filled with a lot of ideas , I thought that they lack originality. I would recommend this book to somebody who's never read a fitness article or a diet book, but somebody looking for fresh input this book alone wouldn't be enough.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Reading this book reminded me of all the titbits of wisdom I have gleaned from many books over the years regarding overcoming eating problems and getting back to "normal" eating and "normal" weight. Those that come to mind include: Twelve Steps for Overeaters (L. Elisabeth), The Seven Secrets of Slim People (Vikki Hanson, Shawn Goodman), Fat is a Feminist Issue (Susie Orbach), Feeding the Hungry Heart (Geneen Roth), The Goddess Diet (Larrian Gillespie), Intuitive Eating (Evelyne Tribole, Elyse Rech) etc. Reading the other reviews, I can see there seem to be two main views - either 1) this book is great or 2) this book lacks something. As someone with long-term eating problems (over 25-years' worth!), my advice to prospective readers/purchasers is this. If you do not have a big issue with eating and/or being overweight, this may be the perfect book for you to get back on track. But if you have had long-term eating problems, one book may not necessarily be enough, it may be better to read this as well as a selection of books on related topics and work slowly step by step in your own time and in your own way towards your goal. Becoming fit from within is a very personal issue.</span>
