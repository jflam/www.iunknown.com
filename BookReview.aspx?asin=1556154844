                    <span>Every software developer should read this book. It is concise, well written, and useful at every stage of software construction.<P>There are at least 3 copies floating around the office. As developers browse through other people's copies, they realize that it's a great book to have.<P>The only drawback, and this is just a sign of the book's age, is that it works primarily for procedural driven languages. This is almost assumed from the beginning, since Object oriented languages were much less developed then. An updated version for OO is necessary and would definitely be welcome.<P>The book describes practices how an individual programmer can make themself better at building software. By necessity, this overlaps other facets of software development, including managing projects, but the bulk is for the individual programmer.<P>I can't tell you how much this has effected my personal practices. It makes a world of difference, especially to the middle of the road programmers, which is the biggest group in the software community.<P>As Mr. McConnell says, the best programmers take a lot of this material for granted, and the worst think that they don't need it or that it doesn't exist. As a result, a lot of the practices go undocumented and are lost to those who could benefit from them. They are in this book and clearly spelled out and well organized.<P>If you are programming for a living, and want to get better at it, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>The subtitle of McConnell's book is "A Practical Handbook of Software Construction". I have found that it lives up to this claim excellently. Like Brook's classic "The Mythical Man-Month" Code Complete offers practical advice on the real-world challenges of software development. Code Complete contains 33 chapters, which can be read as separate essays.<P>
To entry-level programmers and computer science students, this book is an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the industry. For experienced programmers, this book is an great way to review your own development strategies and best practices. For project managers, Code Complete serves as a great source of ideas for process improvement, as well as a great learning tool to pass on to new entry-level hires. My employer has used several chapters out of Code Complete as the basis for discussion topics.<P> 
McConnell writes in an easy-to-read, entertaining style that has made him one of the most popular authors in the field. His book "Rapid Development", is also an extremely popular book on software development, and many (including me) are anxiously awaiting his next work, "Software Project Survivial Guide".<P>In short, Code Complete belongs in the library of every serious developer</span>

                    <span>Back in 1993, when there was a commercial software industry in America and programmers could believe that one could convince management that improving development methods would help company profit, this book was well thought of. <P>Now, any programmer that tried suggesting changes suggested here would have his/her job sent off to Bangalore.</span>

                    <span>If you are a programmer, get this book ASAP! This will make you a better programmer and give you guidence for continual improvement. This is a great book!<P>The only bad thing about this book is that it is a little outdated (goes up to C language; does not mention C++ or Java), but I think Code Complete 2 is coming out soon (June 2004).</span>

                    <span>I am not jet finished reading this book, so maybe later I shall have some additional comments. The book is very old (copyright 1993), but it is valuable asset for professional programmer. <BR>This book is the best example of the rule "the more you know the better is your benefit of reading a book". For example, although book does not deal with object oriented programming (as far as I read till now), even if you are professinal programmer who is in object programming you will get something that you very probably missed - a lot of important and fine details that will help you be a better programmer in object world. It is very hard to explain the profit you get with this book, but it is: you get your knowledge of coding polished to the maximum. <BR>To return to the example of OOP (object oriented programming) this book will tell you about the cohesion of your methods (the book calls them traditional names, routines) and sorts of coupling; everything is the pure ground for OOP but from the perspective of traditional programming; even in OOP books you cannot find easily such explanations, and that done in traditional programming. <BR>If you are a beginner, this book will show you how to name the routines and variables, will show you that statistically short routines of say 20 lines are more prone to errors per line of code than routines of 100 lines! Anyway, I do not want to spoil the pleasure of reading the book: don't expect too much from it, but if you are a brilliant programmer who appreciate precision and polishing of your knowledge, you will be on a right track if you choose this book.</span>
