                    <span>Wanna know something?  I had social phobia and the best thing i could do for myself was read about it.. over and over and over..  various materials, opinions, etc.  But reading is only half the battle.  the other half is  getting out there and actually putting the ideas, such as the ones found in  this book to use, then only will you have success.  this book won't cure  you but it can sure help if you have enough courage to help yourself.  i  recommend this book strongly.</span>

                    <span>I have social phobia. I have undergone therapy and drug medication in its treatment. I first was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I read this work as I was coming to better understand the true nature of my  disorder. If you'd like to understand what my life has been like, please  read this book.      Marshall's "Social Phobia" is a  comprehensive study and explanation of not only the syptoms of Social  Phobia, but also a synopsis of current research into the work. Not to  suggest that the work is in any way esoteric. Marshall portrays the  character of this disorder through numerous case-studies from his work at  the Anxiety Clinic at University of Wisconsin - Madison. He first gives a  very full picture of how social phobia manifests itself in peoples' lives  before going into theories as to why. He is wonderful at telling these  peoples' stories. From this starting point, he moves deftly into his  academic knowledge of the subject, offering the reader easy access to the  professional's knowledge. Marshall's book offers the real-life story of  Social Phobia and an objective study of it. I found both of great value; he  showed me that there are others out there like me and also helped me to  better understand (and thereby recover from) Social Phobia. At the end of  the book, he summarizes current treatments of this disorder, offers an  Appendix which differentiates Social Phobia from the other Anxiety  Disorders, and provides a suggested reading list. Marshall's work has been  an enormous help in my own life, and if you wish to understand this  disorder, it can be of immense value to you, too.</span>
