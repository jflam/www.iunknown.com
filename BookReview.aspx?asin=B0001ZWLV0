                <span id="Label1">Looking for an overview of the American Revolution akin to Ken Burns's <I>The Civil War</I>? Look no further! <I>Liberty! The American Revolution</I> successfully takes a unique, detailed peek into the 25 years of events that led to the establishment of the United States of America. The British are not painted as rigid "bad guys," nor the colonists as the rebellious "good guys." Instead, it correlates the complicated struggle between Britain and the American colonies to a stern mother and her teenage child longing for independence. Beginning after the French and Indian War (1763), <I>Liberty!</I> kicks off with the issue of taxation, the colonies' revolt, a declaration of independence, war with the British, eventual victory, and the establishment of a country and constitution unlike any in the history of mankind.  The men and women involved are portrayed by actors and actresses reciting original documents, letters, and articles from the times. Well-edited, these soliloquies create an interesting feeling of conversation and continuity, almost as though you are getting a firsthand account of the events as they unravel.  Though there are good battle descriptions (particularly Gen. Washington crossing the Delaware, Gen. Burgoyne at Saratoga, and Cornwallis at the Battle of Yorktown), the emphasis of <I>Liberty!</I> is on policy, events leading to war, deteriorating relationships, and ongoing governing challenges rather then actual military strategy. Nonetheless, this documentary is as exciting and interesting as any historical movie you will likely see, and a lot more accurate. <I>--Rob Bracco</I></span>

                    <span>This documentary starts with the reasons of why the Americans, after decades of loyalty to the British government, decided to seperated itself from their mother country. Then it goes on to the revolutionary war. After the war ended, it explains how the new country was created with the new constitution and the bill of right. Keep in mind that the focus is on the American revolution, not the biography of the founding fathers. Overall, PBS made a good effort to make a comprehensive documentary in 5 1/2 hours.</span>

                    <span>This series was first broadcast on PBS in 1997 as an astonishing "bring it to life" narrative of the years leading up to the American Revolution, the scope of the war itself, and the drafting of the Constitution.  Each of the six segments (an hour each) dissects not so much a specific point in time as a prevailing attitude.  A long list of actors brings color and liveliness to not only the familiar names such as Franklin, Jefferson, John and Abigail Adams, and Patrick Henry, but also some of the lesser-known names such as General Howe, General Burgoyne, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Benjamin Rush.  One of the best performances is delivered by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Joseph Plumb Martin of Connecticut -a soldier from Connecticut who enlists at the age of 16 and serves in Washington's Continental Army for most of the war.  Martin's diary is a wonderful source for understanding the lives of Continental soldiers and provides much of the "average American" viewpoint during the conflict, although he turns up again in episode six, returned to civilian life and grappling with the reality of the new Constitution-based government.   Familiar and not-so-familiar period portraiture helps to flesh out sequences that don't actually feature actors or dramatizations, and interviews with prominent historians and other scholars round out the drama and anchor the viewer with a bit of perspective.  The sidelights come in from all across the spectrum: opinions of British regulars are given as much voice as the American colonists, slaves and indentured servants deliver a number of rebukes, Southern aristocrats decry the vile customs of their neighbors to the north, and the Federalist-versus-Antifederalist argument is dramatized with an intensity no junior high school history class seems to have ever been able to manage.  These and other well-timed juxtapositions drive home the reality that the Americans were far from united on the subject of independence, just as members of Parliament were far from united on the subject of what to do about their upstart colonies.  The series is loaded up with generous helpings of what this reviewer calls GINKT moments (Gee I Never Knew That).  GINKTs are undoubtedly one of the most effective tools in retaining audience interest and sparking discussion.  Wonderful teaching tool.</span>

                    <span>Liberty! is probably the best historical documentary I have ever seen.  Throughout the years, my civics, social studies, and history classes have been showing videos on the American Revolution almost every year.  Most give the same information:  the Tea Act, "No Taxation Without Representation," boycott, Boston Tea Party, "Shot Heard `Round the World," all the battles, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution.  Besides the monotony, there was always a slight slant to the history.  The videos, like the textbooks, often gave black-and-white views of the Revolution.  All British were snotty and wrong; all Americans were humble and right.  They talked of battles in the sense of numbers and victories, like keeping score of an extremely long game of tag.<br>	Liberty!, I am happy to say, is different.  For once, it is a documentary that shows the opinions of all sides.  Those who remained loyal to the British are actually discussed and given viable reasons for their loyalty, unlike other stories that portray them as wealthy or indifferent people that were the enemies of the righteous.  Also, it gives new light to the "colonists-band-together-for-a-mutual-cause" idea as the not-so-widespread opinion that America should detach itself from Britain and become its own nation.  In fact, Liberty! sheds new light on many unmentioned factors of the Revolution.  It displays conflict and change other than that between America and Britain.<br>	The highlight of the series is how it shows all views.  It gets and tells its information from a combination of expert historians and actual letters, journal entries, and other historic documents from the Revolution.  While most documentaries do also, they dispense facts through a narrator.  Liberty!, though having Edward Herrman as an excellent narrator, also uses actors and re-creations.  The actors, in full colonial times attire and playing the writers of these letters, speak directly to the camera and bring the Revolution and the series down to a much more personal, intimate level.  It makes the War more real to hear these people as though they were still alive today.  I was especially touched by Abigail Adams' letters to her husband (the actress was both talented and beautiful) and was delighted with the Marquis de Lafayette, who was bouncy and enthusiastic.<br>       The interviews with eloquent historians, too, give great details, back-story, and opinions.  The balance between personal accounts, paintings, interviews, and filmed re-creations is a great asset to Liberty!  They add reality, humor, horror, sadness, and power.<br>	Liberty! - The American Revolution is a well-directed, realistic, personal, easy-to-understand, and definitely easy-to-stay-awake-and-watch documentary series.  To top it all off, it has a great song at the end of each video.  ; )</span>

                    <span>Must say I have only viewed the VHS version, thus far, and look forward to owning the DVD.  This documentary sets the standard in my mind for historical perspective on a period so much neglected in the public education experience.  I found the use of the various characters selected, and the excellent portrayal by the cast, to be vital in setting the stage for the growing tempest that became the Revolution.<p>Especially compelling was the portrayal of Abigail and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Lafayette, and the English Gen. Bergoyne... and not to forget the French General (whose name eludes me, at the moment).  Very well done.<p>I would also highly recommend to anyone who has been very satisfied with the documentary to obtain the companion book, which I thought went above and beyond in giving an even better view of how conditions were in England, as this conflict approached.  I came to the conclusion that the Revolution also played a big part in the British Government reforming itself to the benefit of the nation, post-Napoleon.  Check your local library for the volume, it's worth the read.<p>As a companion to this series, also check out the followup documentary on Benjamin Franklin.  Work like this needs to be commended to others, and supported by satisfied viewers... so if you are wondering if it is worth the money and the effort to obtain a copy to view, it is, very definitely!  By all means, buy a copy and donate one to your local library or high school.  Every public library, every school library, and every home school family, needs to include this documentary in their collection!</span>
