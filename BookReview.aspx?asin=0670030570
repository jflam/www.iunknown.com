                <span id="Label1">The punchy Penguin Lives series is the best thing to hit  popular biography in some time, and Thomas Cahill is just the fun and  erudite guy to Penguinize Pope John XXIII. He captures both the  irresistible character of Angelo "Little Angel" Giuseppe Roncalli, a  peasant born in backwards Bergamo, and his place in world and church  history. In fact, Cahill shows, as John XXIII, Angelo brought the  church into the modern world in the 1960s, upsetting the poisoned apple  cart of his nefarious predecessor, Pius X, whom Cahill convincingly  likens to a Joe McCarthy with the private meanness of Nixon. John XXIII  anticipated liberation theology by seven decades, reached out to Protestants and even non-Christians, and saved thousands of Jews  from Hitler by wily machinations Cahill aptly compares to Paul's  epistle to Philemon. (Cahill says it's unfair to brand Angelo's  immediate predecessor, Pius XII, as <I>Hitler's Pope</I>--though  he was a "moral pygmy" next to the giant John XXIII.) Cahill gives a  quickie history of the Papacy that generations of cramming history  students will thank God for, and includes just enough about Pope John's  irreverent wit and way of life--the La Grenouille chef, the Jackie  Kennedy friendship, the possibly apocryphal quip to a buxom woman  wearing a crucifix ("What a Golgotha!"). An exemplary brief bio of an  exemplary man. <I>--Tim Appelo</I></span>

                    <span>The concise history of the papacy prior to John XXIII isn't Cahill's attempt to defame the institution, but rather to place Angelo Roncalli in his proper historical context--as a stunning exception.  If one puts aside his/her bias and seriously examines the history of the popes--whether one is liberal or conservative--he/she will find that most of the men who have held the office have been generally lacking in spirituality and rather obsessed with worldly power.  This isn't anti-Catholic or ideological on Cahill's part, it's simply history.  John XXIII stands in such stark contrast to the fairly sordid history of the papacy, that he represents an amazing change from the norm and Cahill deals nicely with this.  A pretty good biography with some priceless personal stories and a thesis on John's role in the Cuban Missile Crisis which does not get enough press.  Cahill is a solid author and this is a good book.</span>

                    <span>This is a short biographical essay on John XXIII sandwiched between pages and pages of anti-papal screed and pseudo-history.  I have read all of the author's "Hinges of History" series, but will read him no more; Mr. Cahill's bias and cant are a barrier to the necessary trust between author and reader. Here's the book in a nutshell: reforming/liberal popes = good, conservative/traditional popes = bad. I am exaggerating only a little in my encapsulation! The author frequently substitutes assertion for argument, particularly in regard to the current pope, John Paul II. After re-reading the book, I am still unsure what it is that the author dislikes so much about the current pope except that he appears to be holding the line on traditional Catholic teaching.  For all the much-vaunted tolerance of liberal believers, I was shocked by the author's repeated ad hominem attacks upon the character of popes and others who take views not sanctioned by the author.  As for Mr. Cahill's liberal utopia, I suggest that he look at the Episcopal Church in the US for a picture of what the Church will look like if we vote on our doctrine and elect our bishops; I don't think it is an improvement!  This book is a perfect example of the saying that "when orthodoxy becomes optional, orthodoxy will soon be prohibited."  I have tried but cannot understand those (like the author) who want to belong to an organization with which they completely disagree and then want to make the organization over in their own image. There are plenty of non-hierarchical denominations out there if Mr. Cahill truly wants one. I recommend that you avoid this book or read only that portion of it dealing directly with John XXIII.  A more scholarly alternative from the same perspective without the cant is Eamon Duffy's Saints and Sinners.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to get a look at the pope, but I couldn't see past the chip on Cahill's shoulder.  Make no mistake, this book is not primarily about Pope John XXIII (Angelo Roncalli).  It is primarily about Cahill's opinion of the papacy as an institution.  John just serves as a model for Cahill's ideal.  A good half the book is spent bemoaning the shortcomings of other popes.<p>Even once the author gets around to talking about Roncalli's life, he still spends a fair amount of words complaining of the conservative programs of the popes at the given time.  It's not until Roncalli becomes pope that the story squarely centers on him, at which point the book actually becomes quite good.  If Cahill would have kept his focus on Roncalli throughout, the book would have been much better.<p>I'm a protestant, so I have no particular love for the idea of the papacy, but I was distinctly turned off by the scornful, condescending tone that Cahill takes toward even the idea of orthodoxy.  In short, there's just too much of the author in this book.</span>

                    <span>I just completed reading this book and found it to be a concise biography of a great man.  I do admit that it left me wanting more.<p>It is obvious that Thomas Cahill has enormous respect for Pope John XXIII and feels that he is the most important pope of the modern era.  I do agree with this.  <p>I am a "cradle" Catholic who had lapsed for about 10 years and recently returned to the Church.  However, I still have many problems with the conservative nature of the Catholic Church today and reading a book like this (as well as Hans Kung's book on the Church) gives me hope that the Church can return to the spirit of Vatican II.</span>

                    <span>The first 72 pages of this book are a history of the Papacy which I didn't need to read. The last 20 pages of the book, Cahill spends bashing Pope John Paul II's Papacy!  There is some good information in the middle.  Obviously Cahill is a liberal Catholicand unhappy at the Orthodox position that the John Paul II Pontificate has taken and which was needed for the Catholic Church.  I do not think that John XXIII 's vision was what the Church became after Vatican II.</span>
