                    <span>Blue Streak: Inside jetBlue, the Upstart That Rocked an Industry, $24.95 US, written by Barbara S. Peterson, is about the history of United States airliners, but more specifically a single company - jetBlue - the most successful discount airline in history. 
<br />
<br />Barbara C. Peterson does an admirable job of profiling David Neeleman, the somewhat unconventional CEO of jetBlue. We get his family history, tidbits about his upbringing in Brazil and Utah, and some personal anecdotes about both his early attention deficit disorder and his unabashed missionary work. Peterson then drags out the fact that Neeleman was a third year dropout from the University of Utah and had two children before he ever tasted one iota of financial success. But being a college drop-out hasn't hampered Neeleman, who simply followed his hearts desire and found a way to soar. 
<br />
<br />Neeleman had a natural gift for numbers, and proved to be excellent at sales. In 1982, he started tracking the potential of the airline industry after delving into a long article that he found in the Wall Street Journal. Eventually Neeleman would back into his opportunity, but only after operating a successful packaged tour business that suddenly imploded in late 1983 when Hawaii Express declared bankruptcy, and took his growing agency down in the process. Unable to refund a substantial number of deposits, Neeleman's first startup was forced into bankruptcy. 
<br />
<br />From the ashes of that debacle, he formed Morris Air after working under travel agency CEO June Morris. By the late 80's, June was the first female CEO in aviation history, and Morris Air - under Neeleman's watch - was a successful airline. At least on paper. The fledgling enterprise existed as a public charter out of Salt Lake, where Morris leased all planes and crews, but they faced competitive disadvantages. Money handling rules were strict, they couldn't accept credit card payments, and they had to keep all funds in segregated escrow accounts. Their advertising also failed to mention their charter status. This drew the ire of both regulators in Washington D.C. and Alaska Airlines, whose home turf Morris was squeezing. 
<br />
<br />Needleman dodged controversy, and with the aid of Tom Kelly, the hamstrung charter received certification to fly as a fully scheduled airline anywhere in the USA. However, less than a year later, Neeleman was stunned when the airline he built from scratch was sold out from under him - to Herb Kelleher's Southwest. 
<br />
<br />What Neeleman thought of as an opportunity to join forces with Southwest, devolved into a disaster as the two boardroom tribes clashed and were at each others throats. Kelleher fired David and Neeleman retreated to Salt Lake with his growing family (and $25M) during the Summer of 1994. Neeleman faced a quandary at this point, for Kelleher had tricked David into signing a five year No Compete when Southwest absorbed Morris. 
<br />
<br />To get around this legal straightjacket, he incorporated a small company named Open Skies, which sold electronic ticketing and reservations software that he'd developed while nurturing Morris. (Neeleman later sold this to HP, and became their best client.) Eager to soar again, Neeleman joined a group of Calgary investors that wanted to challenge Air Canada. David thought it was the best revenge. He got to launch another startup, and was well North of Kelleher's legal reach. The new airline christened WestJet launched in 1996. Neeleman felt alive again, but he was only biding his time. 
<br />
<br />When the No Compete expired, David worked the phones and started talking up investors. He'd assembled a "Dream Team" in his mind. He'd meld executives from Kelleher's Southwest and Branson's Virgin into a cohesive whole. Southwest because he had something to prove to Kelleher, and Virgin because they had a very strong name brand. Neeleman had that familiar startup itch, and he had to scratch it. He'd been formulating his plan while he sat on the sidelines those five years, and he was ready to shake everything up. And thus jetBlue was hatched. 
<br />
<br />I really enjoyed this one Barbara, a great read!

                    <span>When I bought this book, I was skeptical at first on how much I would like it. Well, it turns out I absolutely loved it.
<br />
<br />I picked this up because I have an interest in aviation, and had a desire to learn about jetBlue. This book looks at David Neeleman, the CEO of jetBlue, and how he came to make a successful upstart airline, that as the title states, "Rocked an Industry."
<br />
<br />From his past experience in the aviation field, to every little nook & cranny of detail on how he founded jetBlue, this book has it all. This is a very interesting read as jetBlue isn't the average airline, it's an airline designed to be customer friendly.
<br />
<br />If you have ever wondered how jetBlue became a success, or how the airline came to be, this is the right book to pick up.</span>

                    <span>I must agree with the other reviews of this book -- it is a captivating read.  The only reason it took me two days to finish this book is that I do have a job and family that need a good portion of my time.  
<br />
<br />This book was very well written and provides an inside look at the founding of a business where the needs of the customer truly is what it values the most.  In fact, this book should be a must read for anyone thinking of starting their own business regardless of the industry.  </span>

                    <span>This amazing business success story reads like a fast-paced novel.  You don't have to know anything about the airline industry to find BLUE STREAK fascinating.  I couldn't put it down once I began. Now I feel I have an inside look at something I knew virtually nothing about before.</span>

                    <span>I picked "Blue Streak" up with the idea of leafing through it, and didn't put it down until I reached the last page. Peterson's account is intelligent, well-researched, and in parts, almost unbelievable -- like most great business stories, the personalities that steered Jet Blue to the stars are larger than life. Peterson clearly knows the industry inside out -- her "set pieces" on the founders of Southwest and Virgin are worth the price of admission on their own. My only quibble is that I wished she'd gone deeper into a couple of areas, e.g. Neeleman's personal life. But all in all, a terrific read from an exceptional journalist.</span>
