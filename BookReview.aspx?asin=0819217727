                    <span>Read the editorial reviews for accurate, factual descriptions of the contents.  The beauty and unique contribution of Cotter's book of daily night prayers come from his exquisite phrasing, fresh metaphors and images for the Holy One, and flexibility for each reader/prayer's needs. <br>     Other reviewers have mentioned his easy, natural use of inclusive language.  He goes farther; his language for God is expansive and creative.  I am reminded that the whole Universe bears the imprint of the image of God.<br>     Those from the Anglican or RC liturgical traditions may find this volume most accessible, but any Christian wishing to deepen her or his relationship to God might find it helpful.  I can give no higher compliment than to say that I have been giving Cotter's book as gifts for almost every occasion since I discovered it some months ago.<br>     Warning:  Be prepared, upon reading this book, to become a "Cotter groupie."</span>

                    <span>Jim Cotter's slim voume has graced my bedside table now for many months  and usually finds a spot in my suitcase when I travel. I am a member of a  choir that sings the office of compline monthly and I have developed a  great love of the service. Jim's version is fresh and inviting. The  language is both prayerful and poetic. It is satisfying.<p>Jim has done an  excellent job of creating a prayerbook that is inclusive in language  without any obvious effort. It does not stand out that this is an inclusive  langauge effort, it is simply good prayer. <p>There are one or two bits  that seem a little odd to my ears, for example the allusions to God as  unicorn and other unsual creatures. Even those simply startle one into new  thoughts. There is only one such reference in the order of prayer for each  day of the week, so even this is a minimal issue. <p>As a tool, Jim's book  succeeds. The organization is logical and convenient. Organized by day of  the week, all material is readily at hand. Even when exhausted at the end  of the day, I can pick up this volume and find myself prompted for a little  peaceful prayer before dropping off to sleep.<p>The volume is nicely  printed, well bound and the included ribbon marker is useful. The cloth  binding gives every appearance of promising to stand up well to regular  use. <p>While I have other prayerbooks downstairs in my study, this is the  one that stays on my bedside table. Recommended.</span>

                    <span>my copy came to me as a gift.<p>it is the first inclusive language prayer book i have seen that is elegant and poetic.  it is full of the kind of vibrancy and life that until now i thought was confined to the ancient  prayers.<p>there is, in the introduction, a suggestion for its use as a  companion for those who are awake in the night either because they are  watching with someone, or because they are themselves sleepless.  <p>if you  love poetry, you will love this book.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book! It's evening prayer based on the Catholic or Episcopalian service, but designed to be read by one or a few lay people.  It has a different version of the service for each night of the week, with  the whole service in order, which minimizes page-turning.  Then there are a  few variations in the back for the different liturgical seasons, a few  extra multi-purpose prayers and room to write in your own stuff. But that  makes it sound much more boring than it is.  The whole service has been  re-written in modern, very inclusive language. There is not a "Father  Son and Holy Spirit" in the whole thing, but the great part is that I  didn't even realize it until I was half-way through the service.  Unlike a  lot of inclusive languge versions, this one is not at all awkward.  It's  poetic, with tons of poetic images for God.  There are some difficult  images (God as a snow leopard?) which the author acknowledges in the intro.  But it's wonderfully joyful, slightly humorous, and a great ending for my  day. I look forward to it nightly.</span>
