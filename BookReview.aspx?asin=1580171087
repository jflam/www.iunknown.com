                    <span>Although a lot of these ideas boil down to common sense, (open the mail each day as it arrives and while standing next to the recycle bin, for instance) I do have to say that reading this book inspired me to do some *SERIOUS* uncluttering. I've only owned it a month and in that time I think I've thrown out, sold, or donated about two dumpsters worth of things I was holding onto for all the wrong reasons. For the first time I'm enjoying getting rid of things, and making room to actually have places to put things away. Let's just say I used to browse for costume jewely in online auctions, but now I drool over storage accessories. Sigh. (Another lifelong clutterbug bites the dust.) In short: yes, I'd have to say that the book was very helpful, at least in providing that intial kick-start that so many of us pack rats need.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very helpful. There were many ideas that are really just common sense but you need someone to point them out to you. For example, just the idea that everything has a place and mail once opened never goes into a pile, but gets filed or thrown out. My piles are now a lot less. There are many other great tips and ideas and it is sometimes helpful to hear things over again. It is also one of those books that you can pick up when you just have a few minutes and get something out of it.</span>

                    <span>I always prided myself on being an organized person, but when it wasn't just me anymore and I was challenged with keeping a home, two children, four animals, and a too-hectic lifestyle organized, I was feeling out of sorts. This easy-to-read, easy-to-pick-up-whenever book offered me some tips that weren't necessarily complex, but rather ideas that I could put into quick action. Just by implementing a handful of the ideas in this book, I was able to get back in control of those bothersome tasks like paying bills, sending birthday greetings, keeping my kids' school stuff organized, and much more. We're still not chaos free at our house, but at least we know where to find things when we need them most. And what's best about this book is that you can pick it up and find a new idea whenever you want ... no need to read it cover to cover (and in my opinion, that's why it's helpful to have some of the basic ideas repeated under separate sections).</span>

                    <span>I received this book as a (not so welcomed) gift. But after flipping through a few pages, I realized that it was probably the best gift I could've received. I found the ideas extremely helpful and easy to incorporate. The biggest problem I thought I had with eliminating clutter was finding the time, but by following a few simple solutions from this book, I actually save time and have less clutter. My husband is especially glad I was given this book, and I'll certainly give it as a gift in the future!</span>
