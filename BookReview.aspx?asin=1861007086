                <span id="Label1">Aimed at those with some previous exposure to VB .NET, <I>Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook</I> is an effective guide to the new object-oriented features of the language. This concisely packaged tutorial will let you get  up to speed with the latest and greatest in VB .NET's support for objects.<p>While there are any number of beginner's books for VB .NET, this one aims higher, with unique coverage of more advanced class design features. The text begins with a thorough guide to the data types available in VB .NET while introducing essential new language enhancements like inheritance and delegates. The authors next delve into modeling classes with data members, exploring all the options for scoping and sharing data in classes. After covering these "nouns" of class design, the authors next turn to methods (or verbs), starting with constructors. A standout section here is a thorough discussion of new conventions of passing by value and reference in VB .NET and how to pass strings and arrays effectively.<p>One of the strongest chapters in this book looks at the object life cycle, with in-depth information on a variety of constructor options, plus several design patterns (like Singleton and Factory), which shows how the new VB .NET can measure up to other object-oriented programming languages. Several later sections on new .NET features like properties, delegates, and events show how to use these features correctly. (A short case study using a banking application explores the options when it comes to event handling.) Final chapters demonstrate using inheritance, both with classes and through interfaces. The book closes with an in-depth discussion of deployment in .NET with full coverage of options for assemblies.<p>With plenty of short code samples and readable tables listing essential language keywords, this title is aimed squarely at the more experienced VB developer. Its concise format and considerable expertise on the object-oriented features of VB .NET makes this title an excellent choice for anyone serious about class design in this new language. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Ever been looking for a book but you were not sure what you were looking for because you were not sure what you don't know.
<br />
<br />That was me before I finally found it.  I am a self taught VB programmer who was REALLY struggling with the OOP concepts.  Before buying this book I had purchased 4 or 5 other VB.NET books that didn't cut the mustard at getting me over the OOP hump.  And then I found this book.
<br />
<br />This book takes nothing for granted and explains so much in such great detail.  What is garbage collection?  What happens when you call a Reference Type by Value?  By Reference?  What is constructor chaining?  What is an interface?  What is inheritance?  (And on and on it goes knocking out one question as a time to the tune of HUNDREDS of questions.  I have now red this book four times.  (Scanned twice, read once, and now am doing a slow thorough read.)  It is TRUE that this book is NOT on Object Modeling/Object Oriented Design (now if I could just get my brain wrapped around that).  But that is not a great starting point for learning .NET.  What I didn't know that I needed to know was that the CLASS is at the heart of OOP fundamentals.  Now I would not say I am an expert, but I can pretty accurately conceptualize OOP principles and how .NET works.
<br />
<br />If you are in a similar situation, this book is THE book for you.

                    <span>Silly, naive me. I purchased a book with the title "Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook" in order to learn more about effective class design, and particularly the expectations of previous Wrox books having wonderful practical examples. But you know you've made a mistake when you receive your book and on page 2 read "This isn't a book about object-oriented analysis and design." It seems as though someone asked the authors "What time is it?" and they wrote a book on how to build a watch and the space/time continuum. I found the single chapter devoted to classes in Sybex's Visual Basic .NET Programming far more valuable than this book. Perhaps it's one of the cases where the title just does not match the intended content -- I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and give two stars instead of one. But I'd also hesitate to ask the authors for directions to the restroom, afraid that I would receive a lecture on the digestive process and the history of plumbing.</span>

                    <span>As an experienced developer, I thought this book was not bad. I was looking for a book to strengthen up my class building skillset, but most of this material is just a presentation of fundamentals that I already know. Unfortunately, this book failed to clarify on topics where I lack a strong understanding because they don't really go very deep. Writing is repetitive and sometimes hard to decipher.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the better Wrox Handbooks and I really liked it.  This isn't exactly a guide beginners guide on class design, nor is it an experts book..but it does one thing very well, if you are new to VB.NET or .NET and you know what you want your classes to do, this book will show you how to accomplish it.  Moreover, there are some good examples and it can get you thinking in different directions.<p>They were a little skimpy on issues like using Properties vs. Public Variables (and if you move to .NET, you will have to fight VB6 programmers clinging on to bad habits of the past), but overall, I think the book does a great job at what it advertises itself to be.<p>Also, the discussion on Delegates and event handling was particularly helpful if that's your interest.</span>

                    <span>Complete and very detailed. This book could be a text book for teaching a course of class design. I am very satisfied with the verbose approach as it is more understandable (sorry, my english is not as good as I wish). There are some minor bugs in code but I made my own apps following the written code examples, not the downloaded ones and corrected this bugs.</span>
