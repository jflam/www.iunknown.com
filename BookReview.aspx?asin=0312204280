                    <span>This book is well organized, detailed and full of great tactics for telling if you're being lied to. You'll like it because the author gives clear-cut examples and explains very clearly how to apply the techniques in different situations. <P>Everyone in my office is reading it but I think that it's also very effective in personal situations. As a single woman I like having the ability to tell if guys are full of it. <P>It has become my Bible for the real world. You may be surprised at just how well the techniques work for you. One other great thing is that there isn't just one or two techniques that you have to always rely on. There must be about twenty different ones that can be used in just about any situation. The only thing is that the more advanced techniques take a little practice, but you can start using the simple ones right after you read it.</span>

                    <span>This book contains a few useful gems. Section 6 on Psychological Profile was interesting as well as the discussion on human behavior and Part 8 on tricks people/organizations use to manipulate. The test of the book was crap. I can't imagine treating people the way Lieberman suggests. Maybe I could if I was never going to interact with them again. What lieberman seems to miss is that you can't try to manipulate people day-in and day-out without it harming you reputation with those people.</span>

                    <span>I found this book very enlightening. I was truely amazed, but you must remember that some people come into contact with liars more than others. The tips for finding out if your partner is being dishonest really hit home with me when i look back on my former relationship. <BR> I cant understand the mentality of some reviewers who think this book will turn you into some kind of liar. If I purchase a book on serial killers I wont become one, but might learn something of interest instead. Its insulting to my intelligence to think I will be somehow swayed by a book along a dishonest line.<BR> Remember knowledge is power and arm yourself for the real world where dishonest people abound!</span>

                    <span>As an average guy, I found this book practical and useful. At least I become more aware of the uneasy gestures and "freudian slip" of those who wanna cheat me. I learnt tricks to test potential liars and to tap more information from people who wanna keep something in their mind from me. In particular I like the way the author put his theories into real life sample setting that readers like me can understand better how to apply different tactics under different circumstances. However, I have to say that there still exists significant ground for improvement. First, the priniciples are loosely linked in various chapters that one might have to read the book several times before one can really absorb the essence into his/her mind. Such a weakness is rarely found in books written by PhDs. Second, many more conditional applications can be added into the book. Third, there are just so many tactics for so diverse situations that one might easily forget them all. I am afraid I might have to read it over four times to bear at most 50% of the more useful tactics in my little mind. <P>In a word, a good read. Nevertheless, an enhanced version from the author is much anticipated.</span>

                    <span>Great title. Unfortunately, in spite of some of the other relatively rave reviews, I did not get that much out of this book. I found it "okay" but cannot say I read much that was surprising. If you have never read much in this area, it's a reasonable first start. If you have read a few related books, you probably won't learn much.</span>
