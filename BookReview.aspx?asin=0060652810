                <span id="Label1">For half a century, Madeleine L&#39;Engle has spun magic with words, touching millions of lives and earning a devoted readership with her award-winning fiction, candid reflections on her personal and family life and graceful meditations on faith. Now, <I>Glimpses of Grace</I> captures the essence of L&#39;Engle&#39;s literary gift in one unprecedented volume.<P> Ranging freely throughout L&#39;Engle&#39;s remarkable lifework of more than 40 volumes of fiction and nonfiction, adventure stories, family dramas, autobiography and religious commentary, editor Carole P. Chase has collected evocative passages and arranged them as daily readings that offer illuminating bits of wisdom, provocative insight, and, above all, engaging and intelligent daily inspiration. With enduring power and resonance, each of these 366 rich selections speaks to the simple joys and sorrows of daily life and the deepest questions of the human heart and spirit, while reflecting the exhilarating artistry of one of the most spiritually alive and articulate storytellers of this century.</span>

                    <span>I read the Crosswick Journal series before being buying this treasure as a Christmas gift to myself a few years ago. I was already a fan of Ms L'Engle. However, this book brought her into a new realm. I followed the readings quite faithfully during two yearly cycles. I must say that they provided my those glimpses of grace that were needed during that very difficult time of my life. These are only glimpses because they are relatively short and easy to digest over breakfast. However, as so often happens, glimpses open doors that reveal so much more. My faith in the God of Creation was reaffirmed through this book. This God accepted me as I was (and am) and affirmed me as good. What more can one ask from a book of daily reflections?<P>Thank you Ms L'Engle. I'm proud to call you a fellow Episcopalian!</span>

                    <span>L'Engle does something here that few devotional authors dare. She not only supplies answers and inspirations, she poses questions. Questions without easy answers. Questions that penetrate to the heart of true faith in God.<P>Does she qualify as a mystic? Yes, in that she moves outside the world of pure rationalism. <P>Is she a Christian? Yes, in the sense that she believes upon Jesus Christ as the savior and as the only begotten Son of God. <P>Is she an agnostic? Yes, by her own definition. She says that by confessing agnosticism, she is only confessing that she doesn't know everything. She refuses to lie or pretend otherwise. Yet, in the midst of not knowing, she still believes in the God that created the universe.<P>This devotional breathes life into a sometimes stale genre. L'Engle's openness might challenge, even offend, some. But for those on the limits of faith, those hanging in amidst life's tragedies and unexpected miracles, "Glimpses of Grace" gives a little more grace to move on. This is classic and poignant writing. One closes the pages filled with a greater awe and greater mystery regarding the love of God.</span>

                    <span>This is a beautiful devotional, and a glimpse of the way a brilliant mind works at something we all aspire to: understanding God. It is refreshing to read something that doesn't pretend to have all the answers about Him, but encourages us to "learn to love the mysteries". I don't know about you, but that is what I am trying to do. Instead of simplifying who God is and reducing him to the level of an idol, the author encourages us to see him as Omnipotent God, Creator & Sustainer. It is a breath of fresh air to me, and a wonderful encouragement.</span>

                    <span>Chase skillfully combines memorable quotes from L'Engle's amazing works of art. Each day's reading provides an uplifting message that engages readers' in a thought-provoking journey through the year. As a whole, the book's collage effect serves as a wonderful introduction to L'Engle's work and gives faithful readers a poetic reminder of her skill. Makes a wonderful gift!</span>

                    <span>L'Engle expert and biographer, Carole.F. Chase, gracefully presents a powerful reading from this great 20th century thinker, novelist, poet and writer of Christian truth for every single day of the year (even for leap year). As it is with the best of this sort of book, Glimpses of Grace's daily readings produce not only a fulfilling sample of the author's greatest work; but they also produce an appetite for the works themselves. L'Engle fans will recognize the many and various themes which are common to the author's whole corpus, but many are likely to be surprised and overwhelmed seeing the massive quantity this author has produced and how much is yet to be discovered in her many books. Those most intimately familiar with the life and work of Madeleine L'Engle will realize how insightfully and thoughtfully Carole Chase has selected and arranged these "glimpses" which provoke intense contemplation and inspiration at the same time.</span>
