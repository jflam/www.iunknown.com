                    <span>Whether you like Kaplan & Norton's concept of the balanced scorecard or not, we probably can agree that they have had huge adoption of their ideas in many of the biggest firms in the world. 
<br />
<br />Kaplan & Norton's focus on creating easy-to-understand frameworks for implementing strategy is admirable. They have published their ideas in articles and books over they last 10 years. This book - Strategy Maps - is the third book in their campaign for making strategy happen.
<br />
<br />The first book from 1996 introduced the BALANCED SCORECARD (BSC). A tool that translates an organization's mission and strategy into a comprehensive set of performance measures that provides the framework for a strategic measurement and management system. The performance measures were arranged into four PERSPECTIVES. Viewed horizontally, like in a grid, each perspective represents the set of objectives desired by a particular stakeholder (Financial, Customer, Internal Process/Organization, Learning & Growth/Employees). The perspectives, when taken together, permit a complete view of the strategy and "tell the story of a strategy" in a clearly understandable framework.
<br />
<br />In 2001, the second book introduced the STRATEGY-FOCUSED ORGANIZATION that places strategy at the centre of its management processes - not only for measurement purposes. Strategy is now central to the firm's agenda. There are five principles to a Strategy-Focused Organization: Mobilize Change through Executive Leadership; Translate the Strategy to Operational Terms [that is, balanced scorecard and strategy map]; Align the Organization to the Strategy; Make Strategy Everyone's Job; Make Strategy a Continual Process.
<br />
<br />Finally in 2004, this book expands the concept of the STRATEGY MAP, which is a visual representation of an organization's strategy and the processes and systems necessary to implement that strategy. A strategy map is basically a one-page graphical summary, showing employees how their jobs are linked to the organization's overall objectives.
<br />
<br />This book adds some new contributions to the concept of strategy maps:
<br />
<br />TEMPLATES. The main benefit of this book may be the (very) many templates that should stimulate most readers to build their own customised strategy map. Being a relatively experienced balanced scorecard practitioner myself, I certainly enjoyed the inspiration from the templates. Most benefit is derived from the templates that describe the basic components of how value gets created in the internal process perspective as well as the learning and growth perspective. I can highly recommend the strategy map templates reflecting the firm's generic competitive strategy - lowest-cost vs. product leader vs. customer intimacy.
<br />
<br />STRATEGIC THEMES, which are based on a few selected key value-creating processes. The authors introduce a taxonomy that classifies internal value-creating processes into four clusters that each may have literally hundreds of sub-processes that create value in some way: 
<br />- operations management (i.e. producing and delivering. Also known as supply chain management)
<br />- customer management (or CRM)
<br />- innovation of products and processes (such as Product-Lifecycle Management etc.)
<br />- regulatory and social: conforming to regulations and societal expectations
<br />
<br />INTANGIBLE ASSETS FRAMEWORK, which attempts to describe, measure, and align the three intangible assets in the learning and growth perspective to the strategic processes and objectives in the internal perspectives. The three types of intangible assets are:
<br />- Human capital: employees' skills, talent, and knowledge. 
<br />- Organization capital: culture, leadership, employee alignment, teamwork, and knowledge management 
<br />- Information capital: Databases, information systems, network, and technology infrastructure
<br />
<br />I have worked in practice with the balanced scorecard since 1998. This book is a natural follow-up to the authors' previous work. I fully acknowledge the critical issues mentioned by some of the reviewers. So if you don't want to work with balanced scorecard, let this book go.
<br />
<br />But if you are already working within this strategy framework in your organization, you really shouldn't miss this book. It expands on many of the interesting ideas that you probably already know. It also brings you up to date with their current thinking. That's why I rate it four stars.

                    <span>This book is well written and provides an interesting model for construing workplace. But having said that the book doesnt point out how its methods might fail or might not be for everyone and doesnt provide any real alternatives. It also doesnt try to thoroughly enable readers to think for themselves by providing the necessary "scaffolding". To be able to think on ones feet and change ones models and practices on the fly is what is needed in todays workforce. So in some sense this is a one size fits all approach-albeit an interesting one. 
<br />
<br />A better book would have come about by using the principle of eduction to enable others to understand how they learn and how they dont learn including: multiple intelleigences, learning style theory,using knowledge discovery systems, visual journaling, active imagination etc. The problem with these books is lack of thoroughness and failure to really tap in to the potential of people and a focus on keeping it simple when simple isn the answer to everything. But this book is a nice try given the aforementioned limitations</span>

                    <span>Kaplan and Norton co-authored an article which was published in the Harvard Business Review (January/February 1993). In it they introduce an exciting new concept: the balanced scorecard. They have since published three books: this one, preceded by The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action (1996) and The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment (2000). Here's some background on the two books before we shift our attention to Strategy Maps.<p>In The Balanced Scorecard, as Kaplan and Norton explain in their Preface, "the Balanced Scorecard evolved from an improved measurement system to an improved management system." The distinction is critically important to understanding this book. Senior executives in various companies have used the Balanced Scorecard as the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning. When writing this book, it was the authors' hope that the observations they share would help more executives to launch and implement Balanced Scorecard programs in their organizations. <p>Then in The Strategy-Focused Organization, Kaplan and Norton note that, according to an abundance of research data, only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, that only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, that 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. These and other research findings help to explain why Kaplan and Norton believe so strongly in the power of the Balanced Scorecard. As they suggest, it provides "the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning." After rigorous and extensive research of their own, obtained while working closely with several dozen different organizations, Kaplan and Norton observed five common principles of a Strategy-Focused Organization:<p>1. Translate the strategy to operational terms<p>2. Align the organization to the strategy<p>3. Make strategy everyone's job<p>4. Make strategy a continual process<p>5. Mobilize change through executive leadership<p>The first four principles focus on the the Balanced Scorecard tool, framework, and supporting resources; the importance of the fifth principle is self-evident. "With a Balanced Scorecard that tells the story of the strategy, we now have a reliable foundation for the design of a management system to create Strategy-Focused Organizations."<p>Those who have not as yet read The Balanced Scorecard and/or The Strategy-Focused Organization are strong urged to do so. Brief comments about them in commentaries such as these merely indicate the nature and extent of the brilliant thinking which Kaplan and Norton provide in each.<p>What we have in Strategy Maps are two separate but related components: Further development and refinement of core concepts introduced in the earlier two books, and, a rigorous examination of new ideas and new applications by which to convert intangible assets into tangible outcomes. In the Introduction, Kaplan and Norton explain that their direct involvement with more than 300 organizations provided them with an extensive database of strategies, strategy maps, and balanced scorecards. This abundance of material has revealed a number of strategies and tactics by which literally any organization (regardless of size or nature) can create and then increase value. The strategies and tactics are embraced within three targeted approaches for aligning intangible assets to strategy:<p>"1. Strategic job families that align human capital to the strategic themes<p>2. The strategic IT portfolio that aligns information capital to the strategic themes<p>3. An organization change agenda that integrates and aligns organizational capital for continued learning and improvement in the strategic themes."<p>Kaplan and Norton carefully organize their material within five Parts. I presume to suggest that Part I be read and then re-read before proceeding to Value-Creating Processes, Intangible Assets, and Building Strategies and Strategy Maps. Part Five provides a number of case files generated by private-sector, public-sector, and nonprofit organizations. In fact, I strongly suggest that Chapter 2 be re-read several times because it offers an invaluable primer on strategy maps. When reading and then re-reading Chapter 2, be sure to check back on Figure 1-2 (Page 8) and Figure 1-3 (Page 11) in the Introduction.<p>One word of caution from Kaplan and Norton: "It is important (if not imperative) to describe an organization's strategy with word statements of strategic objectives in the four linked perspectives BEFORE turning to measurements. Many organizations building BSCs attempt to go directly from somewhat vague strategy statements to measures without this step, and often omit critical aspects of the strategy or else select from measures that are already available, rather than selecting measures that quantify their strategic objectives."<p>This is a much longer review than I usually compose because I am convinced that only what is measurable is manageable. Also because, after extensive prior experience helping corporate clients with formulating process maps of various kinds, I am convinced that organizational "journeys" to increased sales, profits, and value need maps by which to reach those destinations just as those who drive vehicles do when seeking their own destinations. One of the greatest benefits of strategy maps is that the process by which they are devised helps to ensure that the most appropriate destination is identified. Think of Kaplan and Norton as travel agents and cartographers, to be sure, but also as consultants whose services you can retain merely by purchasing their three books, then by absorbing and digesting the information and counsel those three books provide. For many decision-makers in all manner of organizations, Strategy Maps may well prove to be the most valuable business book they ever read.</span>

                    <span>I was extremely disappointed by this book.<br>  <br>My most serious concern was the failure of the authors to cite John Thorpe's "The Information Paradox: Realizing the Business Benefits of Information Technology".  Results Chains were first developed in the late 80s and early 90s by DMR Consulting and Fujitsu Consulting.  Basically, Strategy Maps are simplified Result Chains with a Balance Scorecard flavor.  Harvard professors MUST do a review of the literature BEFORE they publish.<p>This is important because a Results Chain avoids 3 problems that will bedevil Strategy Map users.  <br>1) A Results Chain is more much explicit about the role that assumptions play in achieving business outcomes.  Assumptions are either statements about uncertainty (e.g. price is an important criteria for customers) or they are things that are outside of your control (e.g. a competitor will not enter this market).  Strategy Maps DO NOT talk about risks or assumptions.  This is bizarre.<p>2) The book continually mixs up inputs, outputs (from internal processes), and outcomes.  (Osborne's "Reinventing Government" has a nice appendix about the differences.)  It is not clear whether the elements on the Strategy Maps are actions to be taken or the results of these actions. <br>The failure to understand these distinctions will cause confusion down the road.<p>3) Results Chains are much more explicit about the contributions that one element plays in achieving business outcomes.  In contrast, all the Strategy Maps have many-to-many relationships.  <br>What will happen if the benefits are not achieved?  How are you going to do any kind of root-cause analysis with a Strategy Map?<p>As the other reviewers have noted, the Strategy Maps in the book are very generic.
