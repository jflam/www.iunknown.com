                    <span>I am a huge fan of brain teaser books. I have a huge collection of these types of book. BUT after reading this book I say that this book is not as good as it seems in the review. If you think that you will find many Logical and mathematical riddles, this isn't the book for you, but on the other hand if you are into word games this might be a great book for you .</span>

                    <span>Is it normal to get a plethora of amazing Christmas gifts but  ignore them all to focus on a book of games? In my case, and clearly what appears to many others, ABSOLUTELY!! Being a college student I have a pretty busy schedule, but I occasionaly like to escape from the realities of schoolwork and delve into puzzle books. (They are fun, yet intend to be challenging) The problem arises when I find myself with Goldilock Syndrome, some are too easy while others are just too hard. When my mother gave me "Are You Smart, or What?" I finally found the perfect combination. Easy and hard now peacefully coexisted in a book of fun where brains were a plus, but cleverness was the key.</span>

                    <span>I love puzzles and this is one of the greatest word game books I have ever read.  Lighthearted and fun it still proved challenging.  The answers are basic and obvious but somehow often elude the reader.  When I could not figure one out and had to look at the answer it was always followed with a groan as I realized that I had overlooked the obvious.  A great gift idea that the whole family will enjoy, I highly recommend this book.</span>
