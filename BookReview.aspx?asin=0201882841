                <span id="Label1">Where would graphics professionals be without Visual QuickStart Guides like <I>Photoshop 7 for Windows & Macintosh</I>? Economically priced, they offer a lot of bang for your buck--hundreds of screen shots, all precisely annotated, step-by-step instructions for virtually every feature and menu, numerous insightful tips and sidebars, reference pages filled with keyboard shortcuts, a thorough index for pinpointing just the right problem area, and much more.<p>This latest entry is one of the best. The authors have the ability to clearly articulate what each tool and feature does, why you might want to use it, and how it works, all in a concise form--usually in eight steps or less. However, perhaps due to the multitool versatility of Photoshop, this QuickStart Guide may not the best starting point for all beginners. These are not tutorials that take you from simple ingredients to complex outcomes. Instead, the authors put the tools in your hands and help you discover what you can do with them on your own images. An analogy would be that this book is like a great car manual, but not necessarily the driving lessons. You have a problem in a project, look up the appropriate keywords in the index, and apply the steps to work out a solution.<p>For the experienced user, this is a fabulous reference to have on hand. (Especially those Mac users who've upgraded, since most screen shots are from OS X.) It takes readers through all the many parts of Photoshop: color management; resolution; making selections; compositing (moving, copying, sharpening and blurring, cloning, and more); using layers; the history palette (including using snapshots and the history brush); adjustment layers; working with color (including levels and curves and the spot color channel); painting; blending; masks; paths; type; filters; actions; preparing images for print or for exporting to other applications; optimizing for the Web; and making slices, rollovers, and animations. And new features have a "7.0!" call-out--for example, the new File Browser or the Healing Brush and the Patch tool, to quickly bring you up to speed with version 7.0. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>If you are just starting out in Photoshop then don't buy this book, it will confuse you. But, if like me, you've dabbled about in Photoshop and really wanted to get to grips with the basics through to intermediate then definitely buy this book. I've been using Photoshop for several years ( self taught) in the beginning a friend showed me how to use layers etc but I got lazy and tried to cheat. A few weeks back I decided to get a book and start from the beginning.<BR>I already know all the tools etc so I didn't want a complete learners book.<BR>This was perfect, I'm more than happy and I've learnt tons.<BR>Right now I'm reading Real World Photoshop 7 which is fantastic.<BR>Anyway, as I said, this is NOT a book for the absolute beginner.<BR>Hope this helps</span>

                    <span>All in all this book's title and description on front page is misleading,and for that they deserve a poor review<P>Its cover claims that you can teach yourself Photoshop the quick and easy way and that it is a visual quick start. This book is not for beginners, unless you have used other bitmap editors and are therefore familiar with concepts and terms in bitmap editing and are now interested in learning Photoshop.If I were a beginner, I would be completely confused during the first few chapters and would never have made it past that.The first few chapters spew out all these terms that are for intermediate and advanced users. Generally speaking, if you did know a thing or two about image editors, but not everything, you might find the explanations to be fair to average and could use clearer explanations;perhaps with an example here and there.<P>I have used Photoshop for a couple of years and was comfortable with the book, but I remember what is was like when I was first learning it. This book would have scared me and greatly underminded my confidence in taking on a program with such a high learner's curve. While reading this book and introduced to methods that I did not know,I sometimes found myself surfing the net for better explanations.<P>There are better books out there for beginners and even intermediate users</span>

                    <span>I had been using PaintSho Prop, but I knew I needed to use Photoshop. I bought this book because I wanted to know how to use the majority of the tools, I didn't need to know how to "WOW" or do special effects. I read every chapter and did every example. I immediately uninstalled paint shop pro. I don't claim this to be the best book in the world. But if you just need to learn how to use Photoshop, this is the book for you. This is not a "WOW" book, it shows you how to use the tools and that is how you want to start out. This is worth every penny. TRUST ME! I don't usually give good reviews!</span>
