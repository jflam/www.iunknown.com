                <span id="Label1">The harsh beauty of the polar regions has long fascinated  explorers  and armchair adventurers alike. The forbidding terrain and exotic life- forms  appeal to our sense of wonder, and while we may think of them as  similar, the  Arctic and Antarctic are as unlike as Kansas and Kenya. In Poles Apart,  Galen  Rowell takes us on an exhilarating visual journey to the top and the  bottom of  the world, using his camera to reveal the fascinating differences in  these polar  opposites. In Part I, Rowell's side-by-side photographs highlight the contrasts  between  North and South. The photo essays of Part II continue the comparisons,  developing such themes as Arctic and Antarctic science, polar bears and  penguins, and visits to the North and South Poles. Part III provides  detailed  information on the story behind each photograph as well as technical  data of  interest to photographers. Galen Rowell is known for choosing subjects that, while beautiful, are  unfamiliar to much of his audience. Yet his books enjoy wide appeal  because he  accurately focusesin images and wordson the essential spirit that sets  his  subjects apart from the rest of the world. So it is with the distant  lands and  seas of the polar regions, which hold valuable lessons for all of us  concerning  evolution, geology, history, human endeavor, and the impact of human  greed. No  other vast areas of the earth remain as pristine, and for Rowell, the  Arctic and  Antarctic have become metaphors for those intangible elements that  define the  earth's wild places. In a world fast becoming a theme park of artificial  experience, his book is an invitation to understand and appreciate what  is real.</span>

                    <span>Turning to page 74, my Danish-born wife, Aino, was amazed to discover her little town of Scoresbysund. She spent her fomative years(age 5-12)growing up there, where her father, Dr. Werner Mortensen, served as the sole doctor for the area of 3 villages. <P>Galen Rowell's photography captures the typical beauty of a Scandinavian mileau, even though it is truly a facade for the garbage that the typical native Greenlander casts no further than his front door! <P> His words portray the many problems of the native Inuits, who have been unable to adapt to the influence of Danish culture and progress. For Rowell to elaborate on the problems of alcholism, violent crime, and the high rate of suicide in a village of only 500, distinguishes him as an author that researchs his subjects quite well! It brought back memories for my wife of the "Grundlander" that beat his wife with the carcass of a frozen seal, only to have his wife bite of his ear. <P>The large yellow building in the left foreground is the eight bed hospital; the little red house with white trimmed windows that is over to the immediate left is where family Mortensen grew up from 1966-72. This book really takes my wife back,and helps me see things that were only in her mind's eye. It also brings her up to the what the present day Scoresbysund has become. And now that my family will be moving to Fairbanks,Alaska, my wife can get a sneak preview of our future from this marvelous book. Having lived in Alaska myself, I definitely recommend this book for its shear splendid photography and candid commentary. Great job Galen!</span>

                    <span>This is much more than a coffee table book, though its unique photographs of the pristine beauty of the Arctic and Antarctic would impress even the most casual of browsers. A short story about each photo is included, along with more general, thoughtful and poignant commentary from someone that is truly in touch with the global environment. Rowell is one of the great nature photographers, and this is a stunning collection</span>
