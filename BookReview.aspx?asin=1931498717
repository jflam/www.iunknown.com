                <span id="Label1">In the first of his three debates with George W. Bush, 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry argued against the war in Iraq not by directly condemning it but by citing the various ways in which airport and commercial shipping security had been jeopardized due to the war's sizable price tag. In so doing, he re-framed the war issue to his advantage while avoiding discussing it in the global terrorism terms favored by President Bush. One possible reason for this tactic could have been that Kerry familiarized himself with the influential linguist George Lakoff, who argues in <I>Don't Think of an Elephant</I> that much of the success the Republican Party can be attributed to a persistent ability to control the language of key issues and thus position themselves in favorable terms to voters. While Democrats may have valid arguments, Lakoff points out they are destined to lose when they and the news media accept such nomenclature as "pro-life," "tax relief," and "family values," since to argue against such inherently positive terminology necessarily casts the arguer in a negative light. Lakoff offers recommendations for how the progressive movement can regain semantic equity by repositioning their arguments, such as countering the conservative call for "Strong Defense" with a call for "A Stronger America" (curiously, one of the key slogans of the Kerry camp). Since the book was published during the height of the presidential campaign, Lakoff was unable to provide an analytical perspective on that race. He does, however, apply the notion of rhetorical framing devices to the 2003 California recall election in an insightful analysis of the Schwarzenegger victory. <I>Don't Think of an Elephant</I> is a bit rambling, overexplaining some concepts while leaving others underexplored, but it provides a compelling linguistic analysis of political campaigning. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I must say this book addresses a lot of issues for both the political and non-political audiences that most progressive books can't even come close to doing. Lakoff may at times refer to the way conservatives craft and frame their policies such as say tort reform so that what really happens is that trial lawyers end up giving to the Republicans and less of it to the Democrats just as they had easily manipulated corporate donors who only up to a decade ago gave more to the Democrats than to the Republicans. Those who keep insisting that it's all about the money are missing the point and that's one of the main problems this book addresses. Let's take another issue such as the so-called Mccain-Feingold campaign finance reform act. Here you'd have Senator McCain claiming that his bill would take the money out of politics and supposedly make it easier for more people to run for office. Add to it, Mccain like most conservatives would paint a few Democrats like Clinton and Torricelli or people associated with the party like Denise and Marc Rich as evildoers who will be punished once his bill goes into effect and in the process failing to mention that George W. Bush, Rupert Murdoch, and Tom Delay to name a few of the many conservative Republicans are the biggest culprits of dirty money campaigning. Sure, Mccain will falsly argue that Bush, Delay, Murdoch, etc ... are honest campaigners even when it's obvious that it isn't really so. Having read this book in addition to looking at the devil's details of Mccain-Feingold CFR it's obvious that Mccain and sadly Feingold had framed the bill so that soft money would be classified only on donors likely to be pro-Democratic while at the same time reclassifying the other soft money donors usually Republican as hard money donors and in the process allowing unlimited loopholes which is why Bush happily supported the bill in the end and was able to raise far more in 2004 than he raised in 2000 which of course was far more than what Clinton had raised in his 8 years in office. The problem of course is that once an argument is successfully framed, the rest of the work becomes easy, a concept Lakoff discusses as "slippery slope." Another interesting aspect that Lakoff discusses is how Democrats keep falling for the conservatives' frame trap and wind up in self-defeat. Revisiting CFR, last year, the rightwing media successfully painted 527s as Democratic while hiding the Republican donors from the screen despite the fact that Republican donors actually raised and spent 3-4 times as much money as all the Democratic groups combined and only to end up beating the Democrats 51 to 48. Money is not the answer to success; thinking and framing are. Conservatives don't want you to be independent thinkers and framers but instead want you to fall for their same deceptive frame traps which is how conservatives have been winning for the past 30-50 years. It's time to think and frame outside the money box. Buy this book, read it and learn to frame independently and progressively and together all of us can do what the politicans and the media can't and won't do: TRUE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.</span>

                    <span>This book is a definite must have especially if you're a disaffected conservative like myself ready to leave the Republican building and would like to join the progressive cause. Moreover, if you're sick and tired of a wimpy Democratic Party that relies on corporate donations and internal polling to run campaigns and progressives with no unity , which has been the case for 50+ years, and would like to reform the Party and unite the progressives, this book is the cure. Courage and framing, not money and polling, are what Lakoff correctly proves that conservatives used to succeed and would be well worth a strategy for Democrats and progressives to follow if at all they want to be relevant, much less in the majority.
<br />
<br />The only people who would hate this book are closed-minded conservatives who endlessly rant and complain that Democrats and progressives have nothing to offer while at the same time accepting lie after lie from Bush, Rove, Limbaugh, etc ... And it's obvious from their immature negative reviewers that they're fearful of others finally realizing that all the hoodwinking and cheating conservatives have been so good at with their seductive framing is about to meet its match and that folks is honest framing with courage. That alone makes this book a must read.</span>

                    <span>If Howard Dean and others really think this is some kind of great revelation, then the Democratic Party is totally doomed.
<br />
<br />This is the same old line, "They vote Republican because they don't understand.  We are just not saying it right."  What "progressives" never seem to get is that people DO understand.  They also disagree.
<br />
<br />Do these people really believe that Conservatives have some "secret" knowledge about "framing" that the Democrats have been lacking?  And that Lakoff has just "discovered" it and now progressives can compete on a level field?  Ludicrous!
<br />
<br />Do you really think Rove knows tricks that Carville doesn't?  Do you really think Conservative strategists are really willing to stoop lower than Democrats?
<br />
<br />Why not offer people something they want instead of trying to find a way to turn their stupid, little, gullible minds around.</span>

                    <span>As part of the Democratic Action Network here in North Carolina, this book was recommended to us.  Obviously, with John Edwards on the national ticket and not carrying the state, we are trying to focus on how to make change.  Progressives understand how Republican tax cuts favor the rich and pull the rug out from under working people, but in the face of "tax relief" speech find ourselves desperately needing a new language to describe "efficient government" that maximizes our "tax investment."  
<br />
<br />Progressives are continually startled when people do not vote for what is clearly in their own self-interest.  Lakoff addresses these issues in a focused and understandable manner.  Clearly, people who drive around with "W" on their gunracks have a perspective to which progressives must learn to speak.  Last week in western North Carolina, a preacher threw out 9 members of the congregation because they had the audacity to vote for John Kerry.  One Democratic congressional candidate was asked how she could be a Christian and a Democrat.  Clearly, we are involved in an ideological war, the dimensions of which progressives have greatly underestimated.
<br />
<br />I am particularly struck by Lakoff's view about how these two groups view God.  From his perspective, conservatives view a God who is wrathful and requires punishment, a very "old testament" view.  Progressive Christians view a beneficent God who loves His children.  But while conservative Christians are well organized, progressive Christians are only loosely aligned.  Much work needs to be done because people will vote against their own self-interest if they believe it to be God's will.  The Republican rich have manipulated these issues, ignoring that Jesus' gospel is that we should take care of the sick.
<br />
<br />Lakoff's argument on idea framing is helpful, but is new thinking for progressives used to thinking issue by issue.  I know I am going to need more than just this little book to really get the hang of this, but it is an interesting starting point.  For those of us puzzled by the direction of our country, befuddled by public unconcern of blatant lies and misrepresentations by the president with the war in Iraq, we need to reshape our thinking.  We need to redefine a "Clean Water Act" that encourages pollution as a "Dirty Rivers Act" or find conceptual ways to battle these ideas before Republicans succeed in polluting the planet.  Lakoff's book is a key to this; and is therefore essential reading for progressive patriots.     </span>

                    <span>I had always thought that it was only a matter of not being afraid to tell the truth and boldly take stands on doing what's right for the nation that would help the Democrats and progressives. Apparently, the last election convinced us otherwise. Sure, John Kerry was truthful and honest. However, it was not until the first presidential debate that he framed his ideas and then on the campaign trail it was nothing but back to repackaging Bush-lite. 
<br />
<br />Like Thomas Frank, Lakoff does agree that voters are ready to vote against their own economic interests but Lakoff takes it one step further. Conservatives and libertarians have one thing in common. They've figured out how to manipulate voters' minds into voting against their true interests. True, money can be a major factor but it's what libertarians and conservatives use to think ahead and keep the public brainwashed as long as they can.
<br />
<br />This book is non-partisan and proves that even if you're telling the truth, you need to get past the deceptive manipulative tricks conservatives and libertarians have used for the past 50 years by reframing the issues without backing down. That my friend is the key to success.</span>
