                <span id="Label1"><p>The death of a celebrity is often as fascinating as--and sometimes more fascinating than--a star's actual life. From the grisly end of Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson family and the mysterious demise of Bob Crane to the peaceful passings of Lucille Ball and George Burns, <i>The Hollywood Book of Death</i> is a captivating and appealingly packaged volume of more than 125 television and movie stars' final curtain calls.</p>  <p>Arranged in an encyclopedic approach by manner of death, these well-researched accounts include details of celebrities' colorful lives and unusual deaths, their funerals, and the intriguing aftermath. With more than 100 rare photographs and a special "necrology" index of more than 6,000 stars and directors, along with a section revealing where Hollywood personalities are resting in eternal sleep, this enthralling reference promises to be on every film and television buff's "Top 10" gift list.</p></span>

                    <span>If you're interested in the lives and deaths of TV and movie celebrities, this is the book for you. It provides an account of each featured celeb's life and (of course) death no matter how tawdry either the former or latter may be. Suicides, murders, old age, disease, and every other imaginable way the Grim Reaper takes his harvest is here. One will be saddened over the suicides of Freddie Prinz and River Phoenix as well as feel pride over how a real-life cowboy and hero like Buck Jones went to his final roundup rescuing people in real life as he did so many times on film. My only recommendation is that the reader should read only a few pages at a time since the book can prove rather depressing what with seeing the often sad end of so many bright stars.</span>

                    <span>The Hollywood Book of Death is a very compelling book-covering not only the high profile celebrity deaths (River Phoenix, Phil Hartman), but also lesser-known and forgotten stars. Murders, as well as puzzling and accidental deaths, suicides, drug- and alcohol-related, and many notable deaths from natural causes. The appendices are also helpful, providing a very comprehensive necrology of show biz personalities and where they are buried. But it's more than lists. I found reading the individual stories to be very absorbing. I bought the book for my interest in only one or two of the people covered, but found myself drawn in to reading more and more of the interesting and often bizarre tales of Hollywood deaths. Some will be familiar to you, but the author has uncovered even more details of those well publicized cases than you probably knew before. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I picked this up on a whim while browsing in my local bookstore one day, and I am glad I made that purchase. I read one or two entries every night, so it took me a while to get through it, but it was very interesting and informative, if a bit depressing at times. It was easy to read, and I was able to read each entry quickly, which is not usually the case for most Hollywood "biographies" that I've read. <P>I do have one complaint with the book, however. Even though I am not usually the one to need pictures in the books I read, it would have been MUCH nicer to have included at least one photo for each of the stars here. There were several featured people that either: 1.) I did not know of or 2.) I could not recall the face of. It would have been nice to have a convenient reference of these people. Looking back, many of the entries were without pictures.<P>Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.</span>

                    <span>Celebrities. There has always been an incredible fascination with the ins and outs of a celebrity and everything that goes with it. It's been that way for decades and decades. While some may be interested in what they do or spend, nothing is more interesting and fascinating than the tale of a star who's time has come and gone and are no longer with this. This decent sized book tells the tale of over 125 celebrities who have passed on to that big silver screen in the sky. Some big names, some you have probably never heard of before in your life. The big name stars that are featured in this book like Mary Pickford, W.C. Fields, River Phoenix, Bela Lugosi, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and a ton of others, are always interesting to read about. But it is the people you are not familiar with that comes across as more intriguing. The book is divided into a couple of different categories dealing with the way of death. There is the first section, "Accidental Deaths", which is pretty much self explanatory. People in this section include Sonny Bono, Grace Kelly, Brandon Lee, and a dozen others. Then there is the "Alcohol And Drugs" section, where such celebs as Belushi, Barrymore, Farley, and Holden among others will be found. There is "In Obscurity", a section with lesser known performers, although Martha Raye is in here along with Clara Bow and Hedy Lamarr. This section deals with entertainrs who, well, went into obscurity. The book rounds out with "Murders", "Natural Causes", which does have a lot of people in it but does not fill up the book at all like an earlier review said. Plus, there is "Puzzling Deaths" and "Suicides". Some entertainers get a lenghty enough tribute, while some others don't. But I found each one to be appropriate to the level of star they were talking about and gave as good enough of information as there needed to be. There were definitley some doozies in here in regards to the person themself and their demise. Their is definitley bizarre and sordid stories in here as the title of the book says. While some may of died of old age or some other kind of natural cause, there is still usually enough interesting things and facts written about them that still makes it worthwhile, even when the ones that died normally, well, died normally. Plus you get fun little tall tales about people like John Barrymore. As legend has it, his body was borrowed from the morgue and taken back to Errol Flynn's house by his buddies and propped up making it look as though he didn't die. This, of course, sent Errol running out of the house. There are a few odds and ends like that here and there, and it's part of the fun that this book has between it's pages. The author, James Parrish, put together a nice and interesting book that is sure to be eaten up by any fan intrigued by the subject. I know I was.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be written in a very basic, generic writing<BR>style. Much better books have been written on this subject in a<BR>much more interesting way. No new information here I have'nt read elsewhere. This book should have been titled "Hollywood <BR>Book of Death For Dummies" or something. I highly recommend this<BR>book for the Hollywood graveyard beginner. Enjoy.</span>
