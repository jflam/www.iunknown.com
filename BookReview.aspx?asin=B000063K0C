                    <span>This movie shows a glipse into the life of author James Joyce, his muse and love Nora, and their stormy relationship and "so-called" love.  I had heard little of Joyce before purchasing this film, and was interesting in learning a little about his life.  I knew it would be somewhat intense from what I read about it.  Instead, the movie proved to be dull... as real life can be at times (which explains the title for my review).  I look to movies to be entertained, inspired, or be taught something new. It only made me realize how good my life is.  This movie is a raw portrayal of sex, drinking, and mad jealousy. No romancing, no sugar coating, no BS.  If you want to watch real life at its rawest, the movie is for you.  But, don't purchase if you think this movie will be similar to Shakespeare in Love (Also a movie about an author and his muse).  You will be very disappointed. Honestly, I got the film to see Ewan McGregor. It's not one of his best films, but if you are a Ewan fan you might want to check it out.  </span>

                    <span>I knew nothing about James Joyce and Nora Barnacle before I saw this movie.It did pique my interest to know more of Joyce's works, but the movie was not an easy ride.I frequently got confused trying to understand and identify with their somewhat obsessive-compulsive and stormy relationship.Not much was explained about his novels so one does not garner too much in that department.Also, the sound quality was poor on my VHS copy.I did enjoy, though, the fine acting of Mac Gregor and Lynch.Definately worth a go!</span>

                    <span>A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie;  Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.</span>

                    <span>It was the 21 of December and I was busy into baking and wrapping but wanted something wonderful to watch on TV while I was buzzing around my house.  On the Sundance Channel I found NORA and ended up sitting down and watching the entire movie...it was spellbinding.  I did not know much about Joyce before this movie but it certainly makes you want to search for info on his life...Pat Murphy directing was flawless and the actors so suited to the roles.  The photography was incredible.  Wonderful movie - make sure you watch it.</span>

                    <span>The story intriqued me. However, not knowing much about James Joyce, I was confused at what all the hub-bub was.<p>To me this was a story of a very troubled couple.  The man James Joyce a soon to be famous writer in his earlier years, horribly insecure.  The woman Nora Barnacle, a willful sexually risky young woman of her time, with a troubled past.  They meet on the street and not being of the same "class" initially the relationship is very uneven.  Soon however, they run off to Italy to escape not only both their pasts, but the puritanical restricts of Irish society of the day.<p>As their relationship is fierce, so is its ups and downs.  They have children and James Joyce being a struggling writer takes much of his failures to heart and drowns them in the bottle.  Needless to say this does not improve things. They are often forced to rely on family for support. <p>A bigger twist is placed in the relationship when James is forced to go back to Dublin for financial reasons to support the family. The already insecure man, is rattled by his friends attempt to meddle with his relationship with the former maid, now the mother of his two children.   Once they make up they find a peculiar way of mitigating their distance, by writing torrid letters to one another.  These letters apparently now part of James Joyce's writing.  <p>Soon however, when James returns to Italy, he riles things up locally and Nora leaves him to return to Ireland.  <p>The story continues.<p>I found this hard to understand at times, you never really have a clue who James Joyce is from the movie.  I guess it is assumed you know.  I don't.  What triggers the initial attraction is also unexplained.  Also surprising is the forwardness of Nora, so early in a budding relationship.   Much is left very open.  You don't see why Nora puts up with James, he is very cold to her and often very obnoxious.  It seems more a sexual obsession for both.  Needless to say, both come across as very self-centered and immature throughout the whole of the movie. <p>I gave it 3 stars because I felt things were not tied up well. The acting was well done, but the screenplay was lacking.</span>
