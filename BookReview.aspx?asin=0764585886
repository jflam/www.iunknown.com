                    <span>this is a great piece of art by arthur miller.  he catches your attention with the lies and injustices of the 1600's.  this is a good book because of it's content.  the speech is, as it was in that time.  it tells a tale of a  little girl who gets caught being "naughty" and blames it on the  circumstances of those she doesn't like or has problems with.  this book  teaches that to lie about something that could have been small makes it  much larger and much more complicated to deal with.  the girl in this this  book is in witchcraft and is caught dancing naked in the woods by her uncle  who is the reverend.  with her are two other girls, a servant, and a  cousin.  the town is brought down to a level where every one is accusing  every one else for past happeneings.  farmowners are accusing neighbors of  it so that the land is auctioned  off at low prices so that they can  increase the quality of their own land.  it becomes a big issue when it  could have been solved completely with a simple confession.  the subject is  blown out of proportion and it destryos a lot of lives and families. the  truth is finally found after nine-teen people are hanged for the crime of  witchcraft.  i reccomend this book to  anyone who enjoys "a good  book".</span>

                    <span>How can anyone find this confusing?  This is a pretty simple work, and I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be confused as to what it's about.  And why would you need Cliff Notes for this?  <p>In any event, my  problem with this play is that its just too simple:  not enough meat and  the characters aren't all that interesting.  Yes, it shows us how  narrow-minded the Puritans were.  It's also an allegory for McCarthyism,  for those of you who don't know.  But do we really need this play to point  out what it tells us about human nature?  I personally find it overly long  and overly dull for what it's trying to convey.</span>

                    <span>i was required to read this book for an english class, and am glad i did, because it really made one think about how narrow minded the puritans were and how that really brought on the hangings of the so called witches.  this  is definately a book to read.</span>
