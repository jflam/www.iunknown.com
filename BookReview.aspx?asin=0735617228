                    <span>Every professional developer should read this book, period!<p>This book provides a great overview of what techniques are important when writing secure applications, and what pitfalls to avoid. The book does a good job at making a point through examples and by explaining possible exploits.<p>This book tries to cover a lot of ground. Most of the things discussed are for C++ developers. However, most of the things discussed are of general interest no matter what language one develops with.<p>I found myself wishing that the book covered a bit more about my development environment of choice: Visual Studio .NET. As mentioned above, I found all the content very interesting and applicable, but I think it would be good to have more than one chapter covering .NET specifically. I do realize however, that this book was first written before .NET. Perhaps someone will dedicate a book completely to .NET ("Writing Secure .NET Code" anyone?).<p>This book provides a solid foundation and teaches developers what to look for. However, the book is written for developers and managers alike and does not cover tons of implementation details. I would recommend this book to everyone as a first book to read about secure application development. It is not the last book people should read however. There are a number of good books available for a variety of environments (including .NET) that discuss specific implementations of various security and privacy techniques. Get several of those books as well!<p>Bottom line: This is a great book. Developers must read it. No "ifs" and "buts". Once you are done with this one though, get other security books and keep on reading...</span>

                    <span>One can't help but wondering why two MS security experts bother to write a book about secure code? Since it is obvious that their employer does not make use of their recommendations, either their recommendations aren't any good, or they are, and their employer ignores them anyway. Either way, the book inspires little confidence - there are other books out there on the subject that are not laden with such negative connotations.</span>

                    <span>The title of the book is misleading to begin with. The book is not about writing secure code. It's about (1) not writing non-secure code and (2) using Windows specific security APIs. <p>(1) Not writing non-secure code. Covers several issues, some more obvious, like buffer overruns and validating user input, some more complex, like escaping URLs and socket security. I thought the book would teach me best practices about organizing code, as in "do like I do". Instead it goes like "don't do like I'm telling you".<p>(2) Using Windows security APIs. This is THE BEST part of the book. Gives you a very good overview about several different APIs, including ACLs, protecting sensitive data, securing DCOM and .NET code, excellent tips on installing programs etc. etc.<p>Keep in mind that this book is said to be used internally within Microsoft with "security pushes", with the audience of 8000 people, including not only developers of all levels, but managers as well, therefore the book is by definition a high level overview.<p>Sometimes the book feels like MS educational course. Ex. (tip on p.77) "I created the ... diagrams ... using ... Microsoft Visio Professional 2002". That's cool, but what does it have to do with security ? <p>Some topics should never be there. How about 3 pages of tips for a kernel driver writer ? It's a huge topic in itself and how many readers outside MS do this anyway ? Privacy issues are covered idealistically. Yeah, sure, if you put a specially crafted XML to the special place on your site, the users magically start trusting you... I'd better read about real situation with privacy, not how the government rules it to be. Oh, and how about 40 pages about cryptography ? Please...<p>The book tries to show you the security process with development and testing. I can easily see they use this process in Microsoft, with 8000 people. For a small team it's completely useless. How about using 4 (!) people for a code review ? Sure, upon reading this book you will know that security code review is a must (if you have enough resources). Didn't you know that before ?<p>The code samples are ugly. How about this: "... X is cool ... several pages of Perl (!) ... see what I mean ?". Ok, one of the authors admits to be a Perl fan, but how am I supposed to read through all this gibberish ? C(++) samples are not much better. May be they are fully functional and compilable and all, but please, they are huge and inconsistent in themselves.<p>All in all, 5 stars for Microsoft, 3 stars for the rest of the world.</span>

                    <span>Well, well, well, the Micro$oft Press is publishing a book on seure coding best practices. Sort of seems ironic doesn't it? After all, this is the same company that sells an operaing system that has new holes popping up every day. Micro$oft should start a new online forum called the "hole of the week club." THIS IS NOT A COMPANY THAT PRACTICES WHAT IT PREACHES. <p>Bill Gates initially tried to downplay security holes as exceptions to the rule. Make no mistake about it, these are not exceptions to the rule; these holes pop up every day in dozens of places. Security problems are business as usual at Micro$oft. They don't really care, as long as the public keeps buying new releases. <p>A while back, Micro$oft made a big deal out of cramming all of their developers into an auditorium for several hours scolding. I know, I was there in the back row trying to hear what the suits were saying at the lectern. The sound system was a disaster. <p>Security is not something that can happen overnight. In fact, with a 50+ million-line code base, it would take years of source code auditing and proactive inspection to tighten up Windows. Micro$oft would literally have to freeze development for the next decade. We all know that this will never happen. Bill Gates, and his handy lightning rod Steve Balmer, are too busy packing in new features. This only serves to increase the already prolific stream of security flaws.<p>Given all of this, LeBlanc's book is not what it seems. The truth is, Micro$oft is run by a bunch of HYPOCRITES! They somehow hope that by publishing a book on secure coding that they will give the public the impression that Robert Short and Dave Cutler are "serious" about security. It's all a bunch of fluff and marketing hype. Take it from an insider. The system is so big that we've lost R&D engineers who took a wrong turn while wandering around the Kernel. <br> <br>When will this madness end? Probably when large corporations and federal agencies threaten to sue Micro$oft. Eventually, it will get to the point where Windows will put our national security at risk (if it already doesn't) and the legislators will start making noise about liability laws. Windows is big business, and the people running the show won't makes changes until they become financially salient.<p>I hope you're listening Mr. Gates, it's time to change your prioritites and business process. Before it's too late...</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for any beginner to intermediate programmer who would like to know the hooks and corners of securing the code.<p>The book starts rather philosophically and for any one who read Steve Maguire's book this might seem like a bit boring. But the real meat wont come until the part 2 where the author takes straight dive into the coding with lots of examples. Some of the web related examples deserve double clapping just for the effort the examples are bringing out the case of bad-news. This got to open up any programmer's eye and any managers mouth (in shock! that is).<p>The author takes us mostly into the world of Windows and C/C++ and some what into .NET and managed code behavior and security lapses one can get easily into.<p>While I enjoyed this book thoroughly, I just could not give it 5 stars because of its bia towards Windows and .NET framework. This can be accompanied with Steve Maguire's excellent book on Writing Solid "C" Code.<p>For an expert this book only offers few bits of additional information. This might be the case as the author tried to address many facets of programming and didn't concentrate on one subject alone. Ideally this book can be made into a separate series of books each concentrating on a single topic of interest.</span>
