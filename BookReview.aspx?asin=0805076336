                <span id="Label1">Marriage, when it's right (and usually when it's wrong), is a subject that stirs strong feelings. Gay marriage inspires its own set of passions, with opponents decrying it as a step that will undermine the very fabric of society while supporters posit it as an inevitable next stage in step-by-step acceptance of homosexuality by mainstream America. Appearing as the issue heats ups following President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment that would block the gathering tide of gay nuptials, this polemic by <I>Atlantic Monthly</I>/<I>National Journal</I> writer Jonathan Rauch deftly walks a fine line, both personalizing the subject (Rauch is a gay man with a longtime lover and a lifelong wistful attitude about marriage) and addressing it with an intellectual poise informed by historical and philosophical perspectives. Rauch actually supports the steady-as-she-goes, state-by-state advancement of gay marriage, believing that "same sex marriage will work best when people accept and understand it, whereas a sudden national enactment, where it suddenly to happen, might spark a culture war on the order of the abortion battle." <I>Might</I>? It says a lot about Rauch's temperance that he doesn't forecast an inevitably fractious future for the nation while it sorts through the implications of gay weddings. There are more impassioned perspectives on the issue, but Rauch's positive approach advances the issue with a welcome coolheadedness that actually suits the controversy. This is, after all, a fight over the right of traditional outsiders to engage in an inherently conservative institution. <I>--Steven Stolder</I><I></I></span>

                    <span>The same folks who argue that all human behavior is socially determined, are inclined to be the same folks who also insist that homosexuality is genetically determined.  Likewise, the same cosmpolitan urbanites who have been snickering at the traditional belief in the 'sanctity of marriage' are by and large the same people arguing for gay marriage.  The same people who have been snickering at "family values" of the traditional family unit are now demanding that being excluded from the legal defination of family is akin to racism.  It's no wonder that the overwhelming majority of Americans are finding the arguments on behalf of gay marriage tedious.  Rauch repeats the same contradictions when he argues out of both sides of his hat in this book. In one chapter, Rauch repeats the Andrew Sullivan argument that exclusion from the traditional committment of marriage would 'fix' the anti-social promiscuity of gay males. In the next chapter, he dismisses the concerns of traditionalists that the traditional family would be undermined by extending the protections of gay marriage to lesbians and gay males, who he argued are by nature promisicous and self destructive unless put under the restraint of the legal obligation of marriage.  Then in another chapter, he argues that marriage is just a legal contract devoid of any moral imperative or purpose whatsoever.  Take your pick, all of the arguments for gay marriage are in Rouch's book.  But to the public, the contraditions are obvious, which is why the gay marriage advocates are taking the tack of stuffing gay marriage down the public's throat via the courts system, instead of advocacy and local activism.  This is a book written by a gay marriage advocate for other gay marriage advocates.  It has nothing new or innovative to say. </span>

                    <span>...clearly an argument that displays first a loyalty to a specific outcome, and then seeks a way to get there.  
<br />
<br />Rauch does well not to demonize the opposition, who, certainly, can be their own worst enemies when it comes to debating the issue, trotting out canned phrases like "family values," and "the sanctity of marriage."  
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, his assertion that allowing gays to marry will strengthen the instution misses the point entirely.  First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.  
<br />
<br />Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires.
<br />
<br />His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No.
<br />
<br />I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America.

                    <span>Boy, this guy really has a hard-on for marriage. It's cool though; he presents all of his arguments (very good ones, by the way) in a clear concise way which explains the compact nature of this book. It's a pretty easy read, I think I finished it in a day, but that's not to say that the content is light. Jonathan Rauch raised questions that most people haven't even thought of in the marriage debate. And while he takes the most inoffensive route when describing "same-sex marriage opponents" I almost wish he would say "religious right-wing nutjobs." For the life of me I cannot figure out why people who proclaim that they want to "protect" marriage would try to keep people FROM marrying. If you're going to defend marriage shouldn't you protect it from divorce? Anyway, this book is rather good although a little too assimilationist for me. </span>

                    <span>Many of the other reviewers have offered fine summarys of the author's arguments. I only wish to add the following heretofore unmentioned observation. The primary reason for many, if not most people's hesitations, reservations, or outright objections to homosexual marriage have religious roots or foundations, eg. what does it mean to be a man or a woman or married in his or her particular faith. For better or worse, the primary locus of marriage in the western world has been the Church or synagogues. Clearly there are liabilities to both the Church and synagogues as well as to the state in this arrangement. However, marriage and its meaning have, and probably still is primarily located in the religious context and the transcendent orientation of marriage, however much that is also suffused with humanism.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Mr. Rauch sidesteps this issue. He primarily addresses the issue of religion in one paragraph on pages 13,40, 70 and 118 respectively and by a somewhat unimaginative and stale appeal to secularism after trying to relativize religious statements about marriage by saying different religions say different things about marriage. This seems a silly and unfortunate argument as really only two religions have been primarily relevant in the discourse of the west: Christianity and Judaism and they are remarkably consistent about what they have said about marriage.
<br />
<br />This choice seriously weakens Mr. Rauch's argument in that he ends up simply speaking past most people in their concern about homosexual marriage. Further, this move by Mr. Rauch forces him to conclude that marriage is primarily a contract, which is simply overly reductionist, and merely the least common denominator in marriage discourse in the west, as important as it is.</span>
