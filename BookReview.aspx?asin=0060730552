                <span id="Label1"><p>Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, had just reached the top of a 21,000-foot peak in the Andes when disaster struck. Simpson plunged off the vertical face of an ice ledge, breaking his leg. In the hours that followed, darkness fell and a blizzard raged as Yates tried to lower his friend to safety. Finally, Yates was forced to cut the rope, moments before he would have been pulled to his own death.</p> <p>The next three days were an impossibly grueling ordeal for both men. Yates, certain that Simpson was dead, returned to base camp consumed with grief and guilt over abandoning him. Miraculously, Simpson had survived the fall, but crippled, starving, and severely frostbitten was trapped in a deep crevasse. Summoning vast reserves of physical and spiritual strength, Simpson crawled over the cliffs and canyons of the Andes, reaching base camp hours before Yates had planned to leave.</p> <p>How both men overcame the torments of those harrowing days is an epic tale of fear, suffering, and survival, and a poignant testament to unshakable courage and friendship.</p></span>

                    <span>Excellent Inspiration
<br />
<br />	The awesomely true adventure story Touching the Void, buy Joe Simpson, is the account of two men's epic battle against time, nature, and ultimately themselves. Joe Simpson and Simon Yates are experienced mountain climbers and good friends. For their next task they attempt to tackle the very dangerous West face of a mountain in the South American Andes. No one has made it down alive from this route, but Joe and Simon will be the first. Or will they?
<br /> Be prepared to never put this book down. From beginning to end readers will be at the edge of their seats anticipating what is in store on the next page. Not only is this book amazing in the sense that it is a true story, but it is tremendously inspiring. Many people would simply quit, give up, if they were put in the same situation of the lead character (being trapped on a mountain alone with a broken leg). But the way Simpson looks fear in the eye and says "I'm not scared" is sure to be an excellent inspiration the un-inspirable. After reading this book one will never look at adversity in the same way again.

                    <span>I highly recommend this astonishing tale of survival and the nature and strength of the human spirit.  I disagree with those reviewers that felt the book was too technical and of interest primiarily to sportsman and mountaineers.  I am a middle-aged, working mother of three, and rank this book among my favorites of recent memory.  I do consider myself to be moderately well-read, and was expecting clumsy writing and poor technique, knowing that this was the author's first book.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  The truth is, after the second or third chapter, I was so gripped by the story that the writing flowed and flowed and flowed.  I found that I could not stop reading.  When I finally reached the point in the book where Joe is rescued, my own head was pounding and I actually felt thirsty, dehydrated, and exhausted. That is a testimony to the power of his writing.  A number of years ago I read Jon Krakauer's book of the Everest disaster,Into Thin Air, as well as Anatoli Boukreev's companion book, The Climb.  While both of these (especially Krakauer's book) were excellent reads, they pale in comparison to Touching the Void.  This is a must read - for those who crave adventure, as well as those who don't.  </span>

                    <span>This is the best book on why we do mountaineering I have read.
<br />
<br />I avoided the book for years because I had had my own epic including 1000ft fall, crevase and wounded partner in the Italian Alps. But it was the best explanation to me on why we go to high mountains, why we solo, and for me why, one day, I stopped.  It was so good at helping me understand I have started again!!
<br />The centre of the book is making decisions - to climb hard, to rescue your partner, to cut the rope, to abseil, to struggle to live.  This is why the book is a success, not becuase it is yet another tale of "I clipped the loose piton ...".
<br />
<br />I cannot understand why any reviewer cannot give it 5 stars - they either have no emotion or they have not hung themselves out to dry once or twice. Or they worry about the style - shame on you.  You really do need to go climbing high mountains.</span>

                    <span>A few weeks back, in search of something good to watch at the video store, I picked up Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void documentary from the shelf. As I was skeptically reading the back of the DVD case, the fellow standing next to me said that it was a "really good movie." I took him on his word and later disovered a movie that I have since been raving about to all who will listen. It is a riveting story in which an injured climber is left for dead on a Peruvian mountain and manages to crawl his way off. It sounds like fiction, but, as is often the case, this true story is incredible beyond what a writer could believable construct. So, when I found out that Joe Simpson (the climber left on the mountain) had written a book, Touching the Void about his harrowing adventure, I knew I needed to read it.<p>The movie and the DVD extras take the viewer on an emotional path where one at first dislikes the arrongant and impetuous Simpson, while his climbing pal Simon Yates seems more sympathetic. However, as the movie continues and especially if you watch the Return to Siula Grande DVD extra, it becomes hard not to empathize with Simpson's reaction to returning to the place where he had faced so much trauma and to, in contrast, find Yates cold and unfeeling, as if the experience they shared so many years before no longer affected him personally. The end of the movie leaves one with the impression that Simpson, although understanding at what Yates did, does not really like Yates and does certainly not consider him a friend.<p>The book, written several years earlier, certainly leaves a more positive impression of Yates. While Simpson admits to having written the book in part to clear Yates's name in the climbing communitry, his storytelling takes the reader beyond a defense of Yates's actions. In fact, Simpson's description of Yates's attempt to lower the injured Simpson down the mountain portrays an act that is nothing short of heroic. It is clear that his cutting the rope was a last, desperate resort to end a situation in which there was no way out.<p>While the book and the movie both tell very closely the same story, reading the book and seeing the movie is neither a redundant experience nor an exercise in detecting differences in the two plots. In fact, the one enriches the story in the other. The maps and the first-person telling in the book complement the documentary-style script and the sweeping vistas caught on film.</span>

                    <span>Twenty years ago in the Peruvian Andes two men set out to conquer a seemingly unconquerable foe.  The West Face of Siula Grande had never before been climbed; Joe Simpson and Simon Yates planned to rectify that.   The details of their adventure are well documented in Joe's book, Touching the Void.  As its cliché title implies, Joe Simpson found himself in a hopeless death trap, the belly of a glacier chasm starving and injured.  What follows you will have to find out for yourself.
<br />
<br />The main problem with books of survival stories is that the protagonists are not experienced writers.  So the survivor has two options: either learn how to write or hire a biographer.  Joe decided to learn how to write.  It is obvious that Touching the Void is Simpson's first book-with simple sentences, clichés and forced character development.  But emotional connection is the advantage of having an author-protagonist writing autobiographical events.  Joe is able to relate his passion and fear better than a hired author would.  Emotionally realistic and rough around the edges, that is what Joe's first book became.  
<br />
<br />One more inherently difficult task that Joe faced was to express in words the very technical, sticky predicaments he crawled out of.  It is hard to explain how traversing one cornice was extraordinary difficult or why a particular 15-foot section of ice climbing taxed his body more than any others.  It takes way too many words to properly describe the terrain; the reader has a hard time following what really is happening.  I found this problem when I wrote a miniature survival story of my own (a 17-year old climbing quandary with a young friend).  It took me hours to accurately describe the climb and why one particular rock face was more perilous than the others-and then in the revision I took it out because others told me the description was too confusing and superfluous.  Joe had a hard task.
<br />
<br />It is this intrinsic pitfall that leads me to recommend the movie over the book.  The documentary from IFC with the same name reenacts most of the scenes with complicated climbing dangers, and leaves you gasping for breath at the end.
