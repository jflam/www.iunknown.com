                <span id="Label1">The truths about Iran&#151;quite different truths from versions put forward by Washington, Tehran, and the media. Afshin Molavi, a rising young writer born in Iran and fluent in Farsi, traveled his homeland for over a year. Along the way, he met with students of the right and left, bazaar merchants, Islamic clerics, pro-democracy writers, Islamic hard-liners, feminists, government officials, and kids hooked on anything western. All opened their hearts to the young Molavi, speaking candidly about issues that matter to them: unemployment, freedom, religion, poetry, history, love, marriage, the Internet, the ruling clerics, and green cards. Throughout his journey, Molavi weaves the tale of nearly 3,000 years of Iranian history through pilgrimages to important historical sites and monuments. Few books have penetrated the soul of Iran as deeply as this exceptional report on one of the world's most important nations. <I>Persian Pilgrimages</I> is a journey to remember. </span>

                    <span>I have not read a better written book on Iranian history, culture, and politics. Molavi is brilliant in the way he weaves through Iranian history while at the same time telling the story of contemporary Iran through his interactions with the people. It is at once witty, hopeful, heartbreaking, and charming, but thoroughly entertaining throughout. <P>I casually came across the title in the book store one morning and by evening I had finished it! For those interested in a fascinating culture and country, I highly highly recommend this. Simply put, Persian Pilgrimages is one of the best books I've read in years!</span>

                    <span>Afshin Molavi is very insightful for his young age. This is a wonderful book taking a glance at almost everything that makes Iran what it is. He not only explains about the history of every place he goes, but relates it to the people of Iran and how it effects them. It's very well written and rather easy to read. I would recommend it as a must read for any Iranian and person who is interested in Iran.</span>

                    <span>My hat off to Mr. Molavi for this very nice piece of work. A very pleasant book to read and written in a very simple and down to earth style. The book is refreshing because of how impartial it is to the events that have shaped the present day Iran. I think the only side Mr Molavi takes is that of the Iranian people themselves.<P>Thank you Mr. Molavi.</span>

                    <span>Many years ago I lived in Iran. My husband and I, both Americans, worked there for an NGO, (Nongovernmental Agency), and were able to travel throughout the country. Our daughter was born there and when we left Iran, I left a piece of my heart behind. I recently came across Afshin Molavi's "Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran" in a bookstore, and I couldn't resist buying it. After reading the book I must say that it truly brought back so many visual images, unique experiences and memories of Iranian friends, their extraordinary hospitality and culture, and the political turmoil that existed - even back then. I feel like the author has given me a greater understanding of the land I learned to love. He has also updated me on how the country and its people have changed over the years...and how they have remained the same.<P>Afshin Molavi, a young journalist and writer, was born in Iran and educated in the West. He returned to his homeland for a year, (1999-2000), to explore the many facets of Iranian society. Molavi states at the beginning of the book that his intent is to record the voices of Iranians, no matter what their politics may be. He traveled throughout the country, visiting many of the cities and towns that I knew, on a pilgrimage of sorts. Students of the right and left, bazaar merchants, Islamic clerics, pro-democracy journalists, taxi drivers, urban slum dwellers, village farmers, war veterans, partying teenagers, feminists, women who are pro and anti-veil (chador), political hard-liners and reformers all spoke openly and frankly to him and all have a voice in this wonderful journalistic-anthropological-travelogue.<P>Molavi weaves a story of nearly 3000 years of Persian/Iranian history and reflects on Iran's present problems in light of its past. He takes us to the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargad and to the exquisite rose gardens of the poet Hafez's shrine in Shiraz. We visit a shrine to Iran-Iraq War veterans and the Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum. A fascinating portrait of everyday life emerges from Iranians who sometimes hold diametrically opposing views. Molavi's Iranian heritage and knowledge have allowed him to penetrate the culture as no foreigner could. His Western background gives him the distance to report objectively.<P>This book is a gem. I found it to be extremely well written, more informative than most books of this kind, and deeply moving at times. Highly recommended!<BR>JANA</span>

                    <span>I found this book very informative as I had planned a trip to Iran until the Bam disaster happened. As a non muslim I found the descriptions of life ,politics and religion and the synergy of the 3 (if synergy is the right word)intriguing. The book certainly helps me to understand this whole ME business a little better.However :WHAT SLOPPY WRITING!!!!! THe author s editors let him down badly.The numerous repetitions of insights and episodes , grammatical errors and spelling mistakes diminished my pleasure considerably and led to my low rating of an otherwise valuable addition to my library.</span>
