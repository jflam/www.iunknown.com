                <span id="Label1">Put a hacker in a room with a Furby for a weekend and you'll hear a conversation that's fairly one-sided in its originality. Toss in an 802.11b network card, a soldering iron, wire cutters, a logic probe, and a few other carefully selected tools and materials and you'll have potential. Add a copy of Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks and by the end of the weekend that Furby will be saying things you never imagined.   <P>From How to Hack a Toaster to building Cubicle Intrusion Detection Systems, Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks offers an array of inventive customized electronics projects for the geek who can't help looking at a gadget and wondering how it might be "upgraded." Beginning with basic hacks, tools, and techniques for those who may not have a background in electronics, the book covers the tools of the hardware hacking trade and basic soldering techniques. Clear step-by-step instructions allow even those with no formal electronics- or hardware-engineering skills to hack real hardware in very clever ways.   <P>Hacks in the book are rated on a scale of difficulty, cost, and duration. Projects range from those that are truly useful to some things you may have never thought to do, but which are really cool, such as:   <P>Building your own arcade game   <P>Making radio-controlled cars play laser tag   <P>Building an automobile periscope   <P>Hacking an 802.11b antenna   <P>Building a building size display  <P>Perhaps you're an electronics hobbyist who likes to learn by doing. Maybe you hack software and want to see how the other half lives. Or, maybe you've never hacked at all, but you'd like to get started quickly with some projects that do something interesting from the start. If you're any of these, then Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks will indulge your inner mad scientist. Using the projects in this book as a jumping point for other new and clever hacks, it won't be long before you're looking around, asking, "I wonder what I can improve next?"</span>

                    <span>After making a few these hacks you learn a couple things about the book. Try to stay with the recommended materials list and you will do fine. It also gets you working on the basics of circuitry. However it is as labeled "projects" not really anything too much to learn from, but great if you just want to have some fun.</span>

                    <span>Short review: If you actually know who Forrest Mims is, then you (and/or one of your geeky friends) will absolutely love this book.<P>Slightly longer review: This is a fun and easy-to-read book for electronics enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels, geeky or otherwise. From classic projects like the Mac-quarium and the refurbished Furby to more practical hacks like building a backup laptop power supply, you're likely to find at least one or two projects that you'll enjoy reading about... and actually doing! Highly recommended, like most other O'Reilly books.</span>

If I<BR>were teaching any high school technology class, this <BR>would be my text book. It not only teaches you about<BR>each project, but provides the tools and insight to<BR>help unleash your own creativity, or that of your students<BR>or children.<P>Tim O'Reilly should send some sample copies to schools <BR>and see what they think. It might prove to be their<BR>foray into the textbook market.</span>

                    <span>Are you an electronic enthusiastic with a lot of spare time and some extra cash laying around? Well, turn those resources of time and money into awe-inspiring hacker projects. Scott Fullam's latest book is the tool you need for that transformation. Inside you'll discover plans for your own cubicle intrusion detection system - cube warriors of the world unite! See what's causing the traffic jams with your homemade video periscope for your car. Go all out and build a gigantic (building-sized) low-resolution display, perfect for declaring your love for your girlfriend, or for mad games of pong. <P>The book is nicely laid out like a textbook and crammed full of illustrations and tables and schematics and photos. Page 270 (describing wearable computers) inspired me to hack my old camcorder's viewfinder for a handy head-mount display. Perhaps you'll be motivated to build your own home arcade machine (page 213) or customized TiVo from scratch. Whatever your hacking fancy, you'll find related projects within these pages. A must read for the experienced or up-and-coming hacker</span>

                    <span>After reading through this book, I have become motivated enough to try some of the "hacks" suggested here. This book is one that appeals to the "mad scientist" in all of us, the one that is always looking for ways to build the better mouse trap or the perfect home "do it all device." There are enough projects listed here to try that even those with little or no hardware experience would find at least a handful of projects doable. Projects like the "Macintosh aquarium" or the laptop PC power supply for example. In fact the book is divided into Basic and Advanced Hacks and techniques, so if you've started off with a couple of the basic projects finished, you can move on to more advanced ones. Very cool.<P>And for each project, there is a graph for project cost, time and difficulty on the beginning page. For some projects, there's a list of what items you will need. There are also extensive step by step instructions for each "project," along with drawings, photos and diagrams. You'll love this book if you're one of those people who loves taking apart products and trying to "improve" upon their original design.</span>
