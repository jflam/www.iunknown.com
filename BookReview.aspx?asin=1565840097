                <span id="Label1">Francisco Silingo was a junior naval officer in the Argentinean military dictatorship of the 1970s. Convinced by his superiors that extreme measures were essential in defending Argentina from subversives, he pushed drugged political prisoners out of airplanes into the Atlantic Ocean. Silingo related his experiences to author Horacio Verbitsky because his former commanders began denying such practices ever occurred--though they had gone to great lengths to justify them to their men. This book caused outrage in Argentina in 1995, when nearly 9,000 of the "disappeared" remain unaccounted for.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who wants to understand what went through the minds of the torturers, and comprehend how they could perpetuate their atrocities needs to read this deeply moving book. The grubbiness, the gangsterliness, the banality, the bureaucracy and the horror are conveyed in their true magnitude. Yet there is a detachment about it that adds to its credibility. This book is not about left or right, it condemns no political ideology, it doesn't blame the USA - it just tells us what happened and explores deeply how it could happen. I read this book and could not get its vivid presence out of my head for days. Like some psychological trauma, I needed to talk it over afterward.</span>

                    <span>I thought this book had a lot of potential, but turned out to be a long-winded lament of Scilingo. It lacked a comprehensive historical overview of Argentinian politics, which would have placed the Dirty War in its proper context. Not useful for first time readers to modern Argentinian politics. Its not even a story of Scilingo himself. I found it a bit clumsy</span>

                    <span>This is an essential read for anyone interested in the contemporary Argentine history. The writer is an acknowledged expert on the subject. Why then have I awarded it one star? Because the translation is appallingly bad, at times bordering on the incomprehensible. One gets the impression that it was done one word at a time, dictionary in hand. If you are not already familiar with the events and personalities of the period you'll have difficulty figuring out what's going on. Conclusion: Only for those who are never, ever going to learn to read Spanish</span>

                    <span>Verbitsky transcribes Scilingo's confession regarding the "flights" in which he participated during Argentina's dirty war, between 1976-83. The trivialization of his testimony gives the reader insight on how "desensitized" to their own excesses, the military had become by the time their "deed" was over. Scilingo was the first naval officer to admit to the military's violation of human rights during the war against "subversives". He exempts himself of responsibility by claiming that in the process of carrying out orders from the commanders in charge,the officers themselves, had also become victims of the process. He provides details involving the "loading" of the planes from which live bodies were thrown into the South Atlantic Ocean. A worthwhile tool in making an assessment on the entire story...</span>

                    <span>An ex-officer in the Argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. I can't write "highly recommended" about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. Just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the United States only because they were "anti-communist".</span>
