                    <span>The book is very accessable and easy to read and is full of advice that should be immediately useful to most beginning and intermediate golfers. It certainly helped me! The section on how to set up a pre-shot routine and the last chapter ("Bringing Your Swing to the Course") was especially useful but the earlier chapters have plenty of useful information. Most golf books have advice like "Keep your swing on plane"; this book tells you how to get it there, how to keep it there on the course, and how to get it back when it breaks down.<P>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Reinmuth does a very good job of minimizing focus on a lot of technical golf swing details that would likely confuse the reader. Instead, he explains in very good detail, a logical and realistic way to build a golf swing with minimum tension. He also gives excellent advice on fundamentals, pre-shot routine, and course management. Probably the best golf instruction book I have every read (I own about 40 golf instruction books).</span>

                    <span>This is about as simple as it gets. You can sum up 95% of the book with "Relax when you swing, and make your real swing more like your practice swing." May be breaking news to some...<P>I didn't see much that can help the average to good golfer here.</span>

                    <span>I have read his book and also taken a few lessons from Dean. I am 52 years old and been playing golf only for 7 years. After learning how get rid of tension in my swing, my handicap dropped from 16 to my current 8.3. Tension is everywhere in your swing: Fingers, hands, forearms, shoulders, back, etc. My wing spped went up about 15 MPH and now I hit my drives 240-250 in the air instead of 230. This book is a great read and easy to understand.</span>

                    <span>Tension is the most destructive element of the golf swing. After reading and digesting what this book has to say, I dropped my handicap 4 points in three months. (From 13 to 9). I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in truly becomming a better golfer.</span>
