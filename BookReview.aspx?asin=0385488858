                <span id="Label1">To really know someone, as the saying goes, you must walk a mile in their shoes. But to really understand a golfer, you've got to work as their caddy. <I>Sports Illustrated</I> columnist Rick Reilly managed to get some very intriguing golfers to let him lug their bag and write what he learned both about the game and the folks who play it. Going hole to hole with them let Reilly know a different side of veterans such as John Daly, David Duval, Tom Lehman, and Jack Nicklaus. But Reilly also went beyond the pros to caddy for Deepak Chopra, Donald Trump, professional gambler Dewey Tomko, and Bob Newhart. In some cases, the portraits that emerge fall directly in line with the popular image but at other times it's just the opposite. Daly is sober but has shifted his addiction to massive amounts of Diet Coke, candy, and marriages; Duval is intensely driven during rounds but surprisingly laid back and friendly off the course; Chopra's inner peace is locked in a mortal battle with the inherent frustrations of golf; and Trump manages to be both an egomaniac and a pretty nice fellow. And although he's on assignment to profile his temporary employers, Reilly emerges as an entertaining figure in his own right as he commits numerous faux pas, breaks taboos, infuriates multiple golfers and caddies, accidentally dumps all of Nicklaus's clubs onto the turf in the middle of a round, and discovers that caddying is tougher than it looks. Reilly walks a nice line with the tone of <I>Who's Your Caddy?</I>: it's reverent to the game without becoming a misty-eyed poetic ode, and it's laugh-out-loud funny without being nasty or low brow. And while golf fans will certainly appreciate it, <I>Who's Your Caddy?</I> is an impressive book for fans of biography in general. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>The chapter on John Daly and in other parts makes this the kind of book that is dis-tasteful. As the Amazon people know I read a winde range of books and books are my hobby and I will spend 600+ in a year and I will recommend books if I like them - this is the first book in a long while I was disapointed with. Says it is suposed to be humour - they mean TOILET houmor. Swearing and situations like John Daly.</span>

                    <span>I read Rick Reilly's column in Sports Illustrated that excerpted part of his book.  I loved it.  It made me laugh.  It was informative.  Sadly, Reilly took the best parts of his book for his column.  The rest of the book is just okay.
<br />
<br />The book purports to be about what it's like to be a caddy.  It's more about what it's like to be Rick Reilly carrying a golf bag.  You don't learn much about caddying.  When Reilly misrakes a trap at Augusta, he doesn't explain what went wrong.  He doesn't tell you what's the right way to rake a trap.  He just confesses his embarrassment about the situation.  I would have been embarrassed to.  But it would have been nice if he could have taught the rest of us what we've been doing wrong this whole time.
<br />
<br />Caddying is a grand profession.  Like all professionals, those who do it well make it seem effortless.  I would have enjoyed learning more about how a caddy does things differently (better) than the average Joe and less about how Reilly felt about lugging various people's bags around.</span>

                    <span>Rick Reilly makes you laugh, think, and occassionally shed a tear while taking a different view of the sports world in his weekly Sports Illustrated column.  With Who's Your Caddy, Reilly takes the sometimes too serious golf community and turns it on its head.  I found myself laughing out loud at least a couple of times per chapter and often had to share a passage with my wife (who doesn't even golf).
<br />
<br />The title perfectly describes the range of golfers that Reilly chronicles in this book.  While caddying for golfers ranging from pros to celebrities and scratch golfers to hacks, Reilly reveals the reasons so many of us play and love the game.  You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this book, but if you do golf, you'll be able to relate to many of the situations that Reilly describes.  His offbeat sense of self-deprecating humor and his commentary on rounds with the non-professionals such as Donald Trump and professional gambler Dewey Tomko are especially enjoyable.  Reilly's empathy for golf's more enigmatic characters such as John Daly, David Duval, and Casey Martin offer a different perspective from the mainstream sports reports.
<br />
<br />This is a great book to unwind with after a long day and you'll find yourself wanting to read one more chapter before putting it down.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Aside from being a very funny writer (if at times a bit too crude), Rick Reilly is among our best sportswriters because he isn't hamstrung by the symbiotic relationship most of his counterparts have with their teams/sources/beats. He can tell it like it is, and if people are offended, then he's probably on the right track.
<br />
<br />"Who's Your Caddy?" had me laughing continuously. Reilly knows comedy, and he knows how to set up a gag. I think he overplayed his ineptitude as a caddy just a bit, but the conceit of this book essentially demands that he fail at the task of caddying for pros like Jack Nicklaus, Tom Lehman and David Duvall. I'm not a regular SI reader and hadn't read much of his work before (though I had seen him on TV a number of times), but I'll now seek out his other books after reading this one. Only Dave Barry, Dan Jenkins and perhaps Christopher Buckley rank as high on my personal laugh-o-meter.
<br />
<br />I think golfers or those fairly familiar with the sport and its lingo will love this book, but I'm not sure non-golfers will go for it. I was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes look Reilly was providing, wishing sports journalists would more often take the same kinds of chances. I knew what Reilly was telling me was true, and I sensed when he might have been exaggerating for comedic effect. Former Masters champ Tommy Aaron comes off like a jerk, but you'd never have known that watching the worshipping CBS coverage of the tournament, where announcer Gary McCord was banished for saying Augusta's greens were so fast it looked like the greenskeeper had bikini-waxed them.
<br />
<br />Lehman comes off looking like a great guy, and I have no doubt that Reilly is right on the money. The chapter on John Daly is an eye-opener. As is the one on LPGA member Jill McGill. Profanities abound, and the account of who's sleeping with whom -- female golfers with female golfers, female golfers with female caddies, female golfers with male caddies -- is the LPGA's worst PR nightmare. Some would say Reilly has no business writing about that. A lot of those same people would probably also say kids shouldn't read Huck Finn or Washington journalists shouldn't be so negative. Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. And in the hands of a great writer, it can be a belly-buster.
<br />
<br />If you don't think this is your cup of tea, then I'd recommend this book as a gift to a sports fan who isn't necessarily a big reader. It would make a great father's day gift.</span>

                    <span>Reilly makes a very frustrating sport hysterical.  He really puts famous golfers, not-so-famous hackers and some very inspirational athletes in perspective.  Even if you don't golf, this book is a great read for it's humor and great stories.</span>
