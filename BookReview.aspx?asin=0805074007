                <span id="Label1">Noam Chomsky is considered the father of modern linguistics. In this richly detailed criticism of American foreign policy, he seeks to redefine many of the terms commonly used in the ongoing American war on terrorism. Surveying U.S. actions in Cuba, Nicaragua, Turkey, the Far East and elsewhere over the past half a century along with the modern American war in Iraq, Chomsky indicates that America is just as much a terrorist state as any other government or rogue organization. George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq drew worldwide criticism, in part because it seemed to present a new philosophy of pre-emptive war and an appearance of global empire building. But according to Chomsky, such has been the operating philosophy of American foreign policy for decades. Opponents of the Bush administration's tactics consistently point out how the American government supported Saddam Hussein for many years prior to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait (pictures of Donald Rumsfeld shaking Saddam's hand are easy to come by) as a means of pointing out how the United States is happy to fund despots when it's in American interests. But Chomsky, armed with extensive historical notation, takes this notion further, arguing how the repression of other nations' citizenry is, in fact, the very reason Americans support certain foreign leaders. The charges made throughout the book are severe, as are the dire consequences he posits if current trends are not reversed, and Chomsky is no more likely to make friends or gain supporters from the mainstream now than he's ever been. But <I>Hegemony or Survival</I> is relatively dispassionate. Instead of relying on camp or shock value or personal attacks as some of his contemporaries have done, Chomsky drives his well-supported points steadily forward in an earnest and highly readable style. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>"Hegemony or Survival" by Noam Chomsky is a masterly work by America's foremost dissident. If we are fortunate enough to survive the future that Chomsky depicts, history will no doubt be indebted to the truths that are revealed in this important book. <P>The U.S. has of course played a major role in the world since the end of WWII. Chomsky shows how U.S. foreign policy and military power has been tied to elite economic interests over this period of time. He argues that deteriorating living conditions for most of the world's people are of little concern to those in power, as evidenced by the long record of U.S. support for numerous brutal dictators who repressed their citizens but protected U.S. business investments. <P>As technology becomes more lethal, Chomsky believes we are entering a very dangerous era. If and when the poor and excluded masses choose to exact retribution against us, the results could be devastating. The terrorist attacks are but one example of such a "blowback" to U.S. foreign policy. However, Chomsky contends that the risks associated with maintaining stockpiles of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction trumps concerns about the public's safety because these weapons are critical to maintaining U.S. power. <P>Chomsky's response to the post-9/11 question of "Why do they hate us?" is much more satisfactory than the sound bite offered up by President Bush. The author makes clear that tensions in the Middle East are directly attributable to the U.S.' desire to control the world's oil supply. He suggests that the lifting of sanctions in the 1990s might have strengthened Iraq's democracy and could have led to Saddam's ousting from power, thereby alleviating the need for war. Chomsky is also highly critical of Israel, including its relationship with the U.S. and the Palestinian homeland issue. <P>Interestingly, Chomsky turns the U.S.' official definition of 'terrorism' around to make the charge that the U.S. routinely engages in terrorism itself (for example, the contra wars in Central America in the 1980s). On the other hand, Chomsky cites sources who testify that the Iraq war has increased Al Qaeda recruitment. But the author believes that terrorism can only be subdued by addressing core social, economic and political inequities in the Middle East and elsewhere.<P>In the final chapter, Chomsky details how the militarization of space comprises the logical next step on America's path to global dominance, providing the U.S. with first-strike capability against virtually any target in the world. Chomsky is hopeful that the "global justice movements" can be mobilized to prevent this provocation and restore peace and sanity to the world.<P>I highly recommend this intelligently written and thoroughly researched work to humane people everywhere.</span>

                    <span>"Hegemony or Survival" , published by Noam Chomsky in 2003, almost two years after the holocaust of 11/9 , portrays in a very descriptive and detailed manner, the ways and means a very small and privileged political elite in the USA conducts the destinies of the whole world, since the fall of Britain from its imperial heights of world domination after World War I. The likes of George W.Bush and his father, sarcastically named George Bush I and George Bush II by the author, as to denote a political autocracy in the States, are accompanied by Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, just to name a few American presidents of the XX century, all, in the author's radical view, banded together on a common ground of arrogance of and defiance to international established law (World Court, the United Nations, etc..), in order to secure to the United States and the goals established by the elite, the access to the strategic world resources demanded by the American collosus, oil primarily. The recent war in Iraq is in this way analysed as less recent wars in Middle East, Latin America and Africa, all of them occasioned and motivated by the power greed of the American government. It seems that from the radical perspective taken by the author, it makes no difference to world balance whether power is exerted by a Republican or Democrat, all of them adopting a political posture most convenient to American strategic interests. Traditional political allies of the USA like Britain, Israel and Turkey are portrayed on a very debasing light, given the knee-jerk posture they adopt vis-'a-vis the Americans. <BR> <BR> Still following the author's view, the only power strong enough to counterpoise the ravages perpetrated in the world by American arrogance, is world public opinion, specially outside the USA, given the exposure of the latter to what Noah Chomsky calls the "manufacturing of consent", attained via rigid media internal control. The book is a sharp rebuke to the posture adopted by sucessive generations of American political leaders, but unfortunately does not address ways or presents realistic proposals to get America and the world out of the mess we are all in, being, in any way, a good reading to anyone interested in the making of of international power politics of the supreme power and world politics of the second half of the XX century. I don't quite agree with the author all the time, but think his is a lucid view on many present issues of earth politics</span>

                    <span>You don't have to agree with everything Chomsky writes to find value in his work and his arguments. Before you accept any label that's been pinned on him, give his work a chance. His biggest crime just might be paying attention to facts, and questioning the praise we pour on ourselves, and actually caring about things like morality, and hypocrisy, and people. <P>Chomsky is the antithesis of the kind of intellectual and pundit that corporate media prefers, and he directs much criticism toward this 'establishment'; indeed, he has compared intellectuals and elite opinion-makers to the commisars of Soviet Russia. <P>This book is a sort of summation of material he has covered extensively before and since in different formats. The book proposes some important questions and considerations about this point in history. America finds itself in a state of unparalleled power in history. How do we use it? What is the cost of the quest for global dominance? The stakes are higher than ever. Terrorism, WMD, nuclear capability--these are things that threaten our existence. Are our current leaders really concerned with ending terrorism? Were they ever? What does the doctine of pre-emptive action mean, especially as applied to Iraq? And how long will people buy the same old stories that don't hold up under scrutiny? Who stands to really gain from global hegemony? <P>Chomsky reviews recent events like 9/11, world reaction, the National Security Strategy of 2002, announcing a doctrine of pre-emption, and, of course, Iraq, which is being played out as an outstanding example of hypocrisy and blind embrace of power. Once again, he goes through some useful facts about Iraq and America, namely that Saddam was a US client who had to be punished when he stopped following US orders. But of course, we now care so much about the Iraqi people, you know, we liberated them. And we cared so much about them when we supported Saddamn's reign by wrecking the country with sanctions. It's such a sham, you wonder how Bush himself can not crack up when he defends the 'reasons' for the war (WMD, democracy, etc, etc), or how he and most politicians can hide their utter contempt for the man on the street, or for anyone who actually looks at reality. <P>What is now clear in Chomsky's work is a very self-reflexive element, because Chomsky realizes how his work is viewed through the traditional doctrinal filters. Therefore, much of it seems like very, very bone dry humor, as he exposes the BS of politicians, elites, and ultimately ourselves. We're spreading democracy in Iraq...but are we really spreading democracy? Do we realy care about democracy, or the rights of all people, or freedom for everyone? Running through one case after another, the answer is quite different.<P>There's a very good reason Chomsky is often dismissed, or simply despised. His work concerns elementary moral questions, intellectual honesty, and general concern for PEOPLE, not institutions, or even states. He's anything but anti-American, if anything, he's very American. He cherishes freedom, and he routinely states that many of our American freedoms are unique and unprecedented. He reminds us that in a democracy, in a real democracy, you don't 'rally to the leader', you don't blindly worship the state. If we believe in freedom, real freedom, then we question power structures and their authority over us, and we reject them if they're not legitimate. <P>Chomsky is not a 'liberal', he is radical, his criticism is for the entire system and its track record. He does not have a 'master plan', and he would reject anyone who claims to. Notice he's been called everything under the sun: Marxist, Nazi, Stalinist, Communist, anti-American, deranged, etc, etc, etc. His answer? Yeah, you DO have to be deranged to pay attention to things like elementary morality, and to actually have concern for your fellow man. Highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to think about current events, to seriously think, and to look outside the very narrow spectrum of debate in this country that is favored by the media and intellectuals.</span>

                    <span>Noam Chomsky, formerly a linguist, has become famous nowadays for churning out poorly-written, almost unreadable screeds that universally attack the United States, and sometimes Israel. If Chomsky hates the evil capitalist place so much (and who wouldn't, with millions of greenbacks in book sales and a cozy professorship at prestigious MIT), why doesn't he move to social-democratic havens like Sweden? Hypocrisy aside, what is most problematic in Chomsky's work, including this one, is the poor scholarship and unconvincing argumentation. In fact, increasingly Chomsky makes no attempt at argument, taking his own beliefs as automatically correct, and dismissing out of hand any alternative views. His fans, no doubt, are not interested in debate or critical thinking, so maybe they are satisfied with this approach. I was not. "Hegemony or Survival" did not, in fact, answer any of my questions, such as:<BR>-Is the US really a hegemon? (Chomsky makes no effort to prove that it is. His merely proclaiming that it is is apparently enough for this modest professor)<BR>-Is American survival, and indeed the survival of the powerless and persecuted around the globe aided by Chomsky's proposals for neo-isolationism, for an American withdrawl and renunciation of any involvement to resolve problems?<BR>-Does Chomsky, a self-proclaimed Anarchosyndicalist, hate the USA for what is does or what it is (ie. NOT European social democracy, NOT anti-capitalist, NOT Arabist, decidedly liberal democratic, decidedly pro-free-market....)<BR>How disappointing, then, that Chomsky, makes no effort to really debate and instead takes the low-road of preaching gospel to the ideological choir.</span>
