                    <span>I haven't even read the entire book, but I can attest to the effectiveness of the chapters I did read--and I plan to read the rest and put it into action as well.  I read the chapter about pleasing your boss, basically finding out what your boss wants, and doing that, not what your job description says you should do.  My boss likes to micromanage (he's admitted as much) so I started seeing him constantly and going over all the details of my work.  Our relationship improved immensely and I started really enjoying working with him, not to mention learning a lot from him.  I read the chapter about keeping your resume out there and checking out other places to work even if you really don't plan to leave.  The result was that I went to an interview at another business, basically just to practice interviewing (I almost didn't go to the interview and what tipped the balance toward going was that I remembered the advice from this chapter of the book).  Naturally, since there was no pressure, I was completely relaxed and really enjoyed the interview.  Result: a great job offer, which I initially was going to take, till I told my boss, and he matched it and then some, and pretty much gave me carte blanche to come and go as I please in my present job.  With results like these, you can bet that I can't wait to read the rest of the book!  Not only am I enjoying my job more than ever, I also respect and like my boss more, I'm getting paid more, and I have more freedom in my work.  I highly recommend Fire Your Boss--it has obviously worked for me. </span>

                    <span>This book has a different way of looking at your career. Basically it says forget about loving your job or career like the other guides such as What Color is Your Parachute and Do What You Love the Money Will Follow.  This book says work for the money and do what you love on the weekends and nights.</span>

                    <span>This book will show you exactly how to get on with your new "free-lance" gun-for-hire work life in this age of outsourcing and corporate racing to the bottom.
<br />
<br />The author very deftly and patiently gives full explanations behind his recommendations, and he is DEAD ON.  Company loyalty gets you nowhere these days, and you have to think like a sword-for-hire to survive...the book tells us how.
<br />
<br />Become your own free agent.  Work to live, don't live to work.  Fire your boss, quit your career, and plan your exit strategy when you first get in the door. The only way to make REAL payraises is to keep moving from job to job, industry to industry, keeping you and the money/benefits at the forefront--regardless of the Protestant work ethic we've all been raised with. It's called "job fishing", and it's the new networking (cultivated from SOCIAL life leads rather than work life leads, and yes, you now have to get a social life!).  By always keeping your resume' circulating--and a pole in the water--job leads will come to YOU rather than you working for them.  You simply sort through what's found its way onto your hook.
<br />
<br />This method, as brought to us in this superb book, cuts through all the interview and hire bull--all the superficial stuff, like appearance, politics (personal and other), power struggles, and the lowdown on starting salaries (such as usually being about $5k less than the last denizen of that particular post). We can negotiate our own employment tickets now, starting with money and chosen benefits, right down to termination agreements...putting back into our hands the power to determine exactly how we enter and leave a job.
<br />
<br />It shows you how to prioritize opportunities according to YOUR needs instead of the employer's needs, and how to KEEP that job if that's where you really want to stay for more than a year, and how to keep the raises coming.
<br />
<br />There's also a section on how to make the best use of temp agencies, headhunter agencies, and other "traditional" job hunting techniques.
<br />
<br />If you're just starting, starting over, or merely wishing to move on, I advise getting this book to join the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd century method of job "security." (ha-ha-ha)
<br />
<br />In the review style of Joe Bob Briggs, this book has:
<br />No breasts
<br />No aardvarking
<br />No physical attack styles
<br />No gratuitousness of any kind
<br />Lots of "money-fu" and "you-fu"
<br />Not nominated for any drive-in Academy Awards...
<br />
<br />But Wenchypoo and FedUpWithLiars still gives it 5 stars!  Check it out.

                    <span>Reading the other reviews of this book makes me think that either Stephen Pollan paid a lot of people to write reviews, or else everyone else in America works in the most cyncical, Dilbert-esque companies imaginable.<p>This book starts with an idea that does make some sense: the purpose of a job should be to make money so that it can provide you with financial resources to have a rewarding emotional life at home with your family and community. Many people have been caught up in having a "career", trying to find personal satisfaction on the job, instead of finding personal satisfaction at home. In the end, they end up having neither, spending so much time at work and then realizing that they can be downsized in an instant.<p>However, he takes this idea to the most absurd extreme: the only thing that should really matter about a job is how much you get paid. Forget doing interesting, challenging work, forget an environment that you enjoy. Furthermore, a lot of his advice is just plain wrong. For example, his chapter "There's No I in Job" is about how you should just suck up to your boss and make him look good. Well, what happens your boss leaves or moves to a different department? If your value isn't recognized by others in the company, you're back to square one. His other chapter about always being on the look out to jump to the next job is the stupidest drivel I've ever read. I can guarantee that during the tech bust the LAST people to get hired were the ones who jumped from company to company every six months in the late 90s.<p>Frankly, it IS possible to find an enjoying, satisfying job AND still put your family and home life first. In a couple years this book will be relegated to the dust heap of so many other "Wow, look at this radical, contrarian idea" self help books, right where it belongs.</span>
