                    <span>I used this textbook for a three term, year-long Calculus sequence at the University of Oregon, and I must say, it's a terrific text.  
<br />
<br />Many examples are given in each section about the new concepts explored.  Plenty of challenging exercises allows the student to get an ample amount of practice.
<br />
<br />The layout and design of the book is nearly flawless.  Important formulas are outlined in red, main ideas are in bold, and graphs and pictorial figures are well colored.  Don't overlook this as superfluous!  Layout and Design can really help the student remember the concepts and digest the information easier.
<br />
<br />Finally, the text includes worked out problems lead by visual and auditory explanations on CD.  While this is not entirely necessary, it is a nice bonus.
<br />
<br />Overall, I highly recommend Stewart's Calculus series of texts, and hope my school continues to use his Multivariable version in my "Several Variable Calculus" class in the fall.

                    <span>I am using the book for my multivariable calculus class. Five examples -- vaguely related to the exercises -- are not enough to learn the material. This book is good as a reference, once you have already learned the material. However, attempting to independently learn topics is very difficult. While the solutions to the examples are thorough, they do not explain the reasoning in choosing a particular approach. It leaves the reader thinking... "I know how to do the example, but I surely don't know how to approach this exercise." More thorough explanations of technique rather than pure examples would be very helpful. </span>

                    <span>I have been using this book in all of my calculus classes for the past 3 semesters and it is mediocre at best. The examples in the book are extremely simple and some of the problems seem not to be covered in the examples, so you have to find your way through them. Luckily for me, I do not use this book anymore.</span>

                    <span> Overall, this is one of the rather average math books that are out there today. This is well organized into different sections that are easy to follow along and seamlessly flow towards the more complicated and advanced theories of calculus. What I liked the best about this book is the abundance of practice exercises and the well derived proofs that give us a chance to understand how certain equations and theorems originated. This book is very comprehensive and an economical investment because it can be used for all four semesters in a calculus course. However, for all its content, this book is also very complex and sometimes hard to follow around if your instructors decide to skip several chapters. Although the explanations and examples are well done, every section seems to introduce three or four different methods to solve the same equation, which is needlessly confusing. The sections in each chapter, particularly at the end of the book can also get muddled together. For example, the sections in the beginning of the book are easy to follow, introduces one or two subjects and then moves to the next section. Towards the end, an individual section might introduce half a dozen concepts and theorems along with their proofs (which are often superfluous). The sections can also branch off into subjects that were learned in the previous part of the book or go into detail or go into things that are brought out only at the end. If you plan on using the practice problems in this book, I would recommend you also get the student solution manual, it is the only way to do the more challenging word problems in the exercises.   </span>

                    <span>This is by far the best math text I have ever used.  I find the examples adaquate, theorems well explained and homework problems challenging however possible.  The main reason I love this book is that it does its job - it teaches you calculus in an easy to understand manner, while letting you see the power of calculus through many well done applications.  I finished both Calc I & II with A+ grades solely from learning straight out of the text (I'm not a fan of 8:30 class).  Just make sure you pick up the solution manuals along with the text.</span>
