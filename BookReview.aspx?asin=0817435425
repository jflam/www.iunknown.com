                    <span>By far, the best reference text I have ever found on the topic. It may be a little dated with the film equipment bias. Also there is bias toward Canon products (noted by the author). However he appropriately shows that effort and tenacity are key ingredients, not choice of equipment manufacturer. If I could have only one text on wildlife photography, this would be the one.</span>

                    <span>I own every bird photgraphy book that Amazon lists and this is by far the most useful - and I say that even though I am a Nikon photographer.  Beyond the basics, Morris emphasizes exposure, sharpness, composition.  He is a good teacher.  Moreover, he walks the talk.  If you put all the bird photography books on a table and just looked at the pictures, Morris's photos would stand out from the rest in every respect: sharpness, "snap", color balance, compostion, and the sense that they were captured at the critical moment.<p>A warning to all you digital photographers!  Morris shoots film.  When you see what he achieves with it, you will be tempted to take your old film body out of the closet and phone New York for a rush order of 20 cartridges of Fuji Velvia.</span>

                    <span>If you only ever read one book about bird photography, then let it be this one.<p>I have many wildlife photography books in my library, but this is the one that I refer to time and time again.<p>Arthur Morris covers everything from equipment, lighting and composition to exposure. <p>Highly recommended. Please visit his website at [URL] for a wealth of information. Arthur Morris also now provides a 'pocket guide to exposure', details of which are on the website. It is a real gem.</span>

                    <span>What the other reviewers have said is true. This is an outstanding book on bird photography. It also contains outstanding photos. The closest thing to a weakness with the book is the strong association and support Morris has with Canon products. I'm a Canon person myself, but I sometimes wonder about equipment advice Morris gives in his book or his fine website at birdsasart, because of his contract connection with Canon. <br>Despite my whining on this subject, the book is excellent if you want to learn about photographing birds. It includes a review of the basic principles of any type of photography, then goes on to give very detailed information on techniques of photographing birds. In addition to camera use, there is good information on tripods, stalking techniques, and some bird photography hotspots around US and Canada.<br>An excellent book, even for non-Canon shooters!  I gather that it is being released in a paperback edition now, which will be a better value.</span>

                    <span>Starting out into the world of photographing birds? This is a book that will really help you.  I have read it a number of times cover to cover. And even while it is bulky, I have taken it on trips to read the night before I went out. Lots of tips and well written.</span>
