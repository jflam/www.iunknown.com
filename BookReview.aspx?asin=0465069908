                <span id="Label1">Nearly a century and a half after Charles Darwin  formulated it, the theory of evolution is still the subject of considerable debate. Oxford  scientist Richard Dawkins is among Darwin's chief defenders, and an able one indeed-- witty, literate, capable of turning a beautiful phrase. In <i>River Out of Eden</i> he  introduces general readers to some fairly abstract problems in evolutionary biology,  gently guiding us through the tangles of mitochondrial DNA and the survival-of-the- fittest ethos. (Superheroes need not apply: Dawkins writes, "The genes that  survive . . . will be the ones that are good at surviving in the average environment of  the species.") Dawkins argues for the essential unity of humanity, noting that  "we are much closer cousins of one another than we normally realize, and we  have many fewer ancestors than simple calculations suggest."</span>

                    <span>Reading the other customer comments you can see that this book will upset many readers of 'strong faith.' In addition, there are a few that say material in this book has been written by Dawkins elsewhere before.<P>Well, this is the first book of his I have read, and I found it to be provocative and very interesting. He tends to put down those who believe in 'something larger' besides the theory of evolution, which wasn't really necessary except to bring out loud counterarguments in the reviews from those folks.<P>The best parts of the book were the clear, logical, and interesting examples of natural selection. It has been said that gaining new perspective is one of the most powerful things you can learn. This book will definitely give you a new perspective on the world around you, and will be a short and interesting read in the process. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>A book essentially dealing with genes (a favourite subject of the author) and how scientists can use DNA 'fingerprinting' to delve deeper and deeper into the past to discover life's origins and branching points. <P>It dispels some myths & misconceptions about how evolution works and also raises some rather novel issues (I thought) about heredity - took me a bit of time to get my head round the argument here!<P>Although I found this book enlightening (as all Mr Dawkins' books are), I found myself a tad overwhelmed by the economics brought in to play to explain the apparent inconsistencies in populations of male & female in certain species, and also I found the discourse on bees a little more laboured than usual. <P>Nonetheless, a very thought-provoking and interesting read for those who wish to know more about life, the universe & everything (42).</span>

                    <span>Richard Dawkins is a great Darwanian defender and a mayor evolution thinker. This book is a marvellous introduction to evolution and his ideas. You may not agree 100% with Dawkins, but it is irrefutable that his theories are worth considering, and what's more important, his view of life is clarifying. If you are not an expert and just want to have a general perspective of evolution or want to know what's all the fuzz about creationists a evolutionists, well, this is a really good book to begin.<P>Just a final note, if you are familiarized with Dawkins works you may feel this book too basic. It will be better to try some of his other works.</span>

                    <span>As a layperson of Science I have no critisism of Dawkins whatsoever. I agree with the fundamentals of all his points. As a major thinker in evolution biology it behooves me to listen to him. But since I have read the majority of his work I think that I can comment on how this volume stacks up against his other volumes.<P>I cannot help thinking that Dawkins is at his worst when he does two things: tries to assume a Carl Sagan-like mantle of the scientist who is describing the wonders of Science in general, and; when he issues a book that repeats in pale prose other ideas better introduced in his other works. It is this latter critisism that I would level at him him in this book. <P>I had the distinct notion that I had either read these essays before, or that they had been gleaned from assorted previously published introductions in other books. I have to say that from what I found in the English Edition of this book, there was no evidence to back up my predjudice --- still the feeling was always there and certainly the thematic details of several of his books were contained within the pages of this book, from the "Selfish Gene" to the "Blind watchmaker" to the importance of memes in the development of language and cultures. <P>Moreover I had this same uneasyness when I read "Unweaving the Rainbow" --- some parts were great, but some parts were absolutely uninspiring (the hedge sparrows were absolutlely soporific). <P>This slender volume could not compare with the three classics, really the ones worth reading: "The Selfish Gene" " The Extended Phenotype" and " The Blind Watchmaker." <P>In a world where a lot of good books compete for our time, R. Dawkins works are important. But I think that one can get more out of concentrating (or even re-reading) the three books above by Dawkins and leaving his lesser works as possible introductions to his ideas (though once again, I think that his main works offer a better introduction to his ideas than these essays).</span>

                    <span>This short (172 pages in total) volume is to briefly describe some ingredients of evolution theory and to quench the creationist agenda. It is unique in its unapologetic tone -- while other books on evolution attempt persuasion, this one bluntly dismisses alternative explanations on basis of logic. As such it is not difficult to imagine many becoming irritated by this book. However there are too many fine points to be missed if one chooses to ignore it altogether.<P>The river Dawkins speaks of is the river of DNA. Precisely because the information a gene passes on from one generation to another is digital (A, T, C, G) they are preserved well generation after generation. Using a surprisingly simple mathematical argument (Dawkins terms such arguments as "armchair" arguments) he demonstrates that everyone we encounter when we travel "sufficiently" back in time is either an ancestor of all of us or of none of us. Citing a computer simulation result built upon proven properties (for e.g. celibacy of mitochondrial DNA) and reasonable assumptions, he informs us that our most recent ancestor in the purely female line lived in Africa between 1.5*10^5 and 2.5*10^5 years ago. He shows by examples that the process of evolution is gradual, and asserts that nature seeks to maximize DNA survival (in Dawkins' jargon: DNA survival is "God's utility function").<P>The succinct and clear exposition of the book appealed to me. Its fine balance between armchair theories and real examples, together with its accessibility (it does not require prior knowledge) made the book a very intriguing read.</span>
