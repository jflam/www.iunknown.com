                <span id="Label1">If you're looking for thorough, at-home training in any Adobe application, the Classroom in a Book series is a good choice. Slow, deliberate pacing is a hallmark of these well-written books. Readers work through a wide variety of projects using professional-quality graphics and fonts (supplied on a companion CD-ROM). Rather than the personal "avoid-the-mistakes-I-made" quality of many how-tos, the series employs a more serious tone befitting books that are recognized as part of the official Adobe certification training.<p>Readers begin with a Quick Tour tutorial that briefly covers all of the basics--working with tools and palettes, placing graphics and text. It's a great first dip in the water for those coming from QuarkXPress. From there, the lessons focus  in more depth on specific areas: the work environment, setting up a new document with master pages, working with colors and gradients, importing and linking graphics, drawing with vectors, adjusting typography and editing text, creating tables, working with XML, exporting to PDF, color management, and much more. The lessons work best when followed sequentially; each includes many smaller tips that become helpful in later lessons. Sidebars feature handy information from the user's guide. (Although a trial version of the application does not come on the CD-ROM, it's available for download at Adobe.com.)<p>It's the Photoshop- and Illustrator-type features within InDesign that make it so much more fun to use than rival Quark. This book shows you how to do cool things with transparencies, blending modes, feathered edges, and drop shadows, a lot of which is new to version 2.0. There are also exercises that cover less wow-inducing (but just as time-saving) tools for creating indexes and making tables.<p>Frequent illustrations and screen shots help readers monitor their progress. Chapter summaries and review questions let beginners test their confidence in the material before moving on, and allow experienced users to skip material they already know.<p>The book has a few minor errors, a couple of which might just be platform related. Despite these, <I>Adobe InDesign 2.0 Classroom in a Book</I> is the best way to learn a powerful application that makes print design a breeze. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>I am a designer that is completely self educated. I have found in my 3 years of study that the books I most enjoy are the step by step lesson/ tutorial books. Now I know some people have complained that this book doesn't deliver the goods, but I am here to say that it does and more. It shows you how to use each aspect of InDesign 2 and how you can apply it to real world use. The problem that I have with books like Visual Quickstart books is that they say: " This tool does this and this is how you get this," but if you're a new designer you don't know what things are or what a "Pull Quote" is or for. That is why I stick to these step by step books. They explain the what and the why of what you're doing so you can apply it to your real world work. My complements to Adobe on a JOB WELL DONE~!</span>

                    <span>If the authors had bothered to proofread and actually test things out, this could have been just as good as the other CIB texts, such as those for PageMaker and Acrobat. Instead, I have to constantly check my Visual Basic book for which button/pulldown etc. REALLY performs the function I need, thus wasting valuable time. <P>I hope sincerely that the next book is edited and that someone actually TESTS it out before sending it off to the printer.</span>

                    <span>Purchased the book because my firm was migrating to InDesign last year and I remembered from past experience the Classroom in a Book series was pretty good. Well, the book is somewhat helpful EXCEPT for the errors noted in the review below. It's pretty disappointing that the publisher of the software couldn't have done a better job with their own guide! For a better intro to InDesign, try the Visual Quickstart Guide.</span>

                    <span>My review of this book echoes those before me insofar as the typos are concerned. I am transitioning over to InDesign from Pagemaker and thank goodness I know Adobe products as well as I do. In the first 25 pages there are over 5 major errors that cost time. They misnumber their example pages (ie: see page 3 but the picture they show is actually of page 2) to telling you the wrong menu to select (Go to type>text wrap, when in reality the text wrap command is under window>text wrap) Since I have a good knowledge of Adobe, I can overcome this, but if you are not mostly familiar with adobe's interfaces through photoshop, pagemaker, etc, this IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. I love a lot of the CIB books too, but this one is a miserable experience. Hope they get a new editor before they lose more readers. Plus, once you open the classwork CD you can't return the book. Don't make my mistake!</span>
