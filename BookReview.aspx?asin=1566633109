                <span id="Label1">Dan Rostenkowski--Chicago ward politician, 36-year congressman, and former chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee--went from the pinnacle of power to federal prison when he was convicted of corruption in 1994. His downfall makes for fascinating political drama, and Richard E. Cohen, a veteran Congressional reporter for the <I>National Journal</I> and author of three books on Washington, D.C., is well-placed to examine the long and colorful career of this Chicago bull's political life.<p>  Rostenkowski's father was a city alderman in Chicago and a Democratic ward boss who taught his son the importance of taking care of constituents. For Danny, politics was the family business. However, this book is as much about the way Congress worked under Democratic leadership in the '60s, '70s, and '80s as it is about Rostenkowski. Plenty of attention is devoted to internal Democratic power struggles, for instance, while Rostenkowski's kickback scandal receives comparatively little space. At times, Cohen even seems to downplay his wrongdoings, quoting aides and colleagues who said of Rosty, "In the 1990s he used 1950s' rules. The standards changed and he didn't change with them." Cohen writes that the end of Rostenkowski's political career also marked the end of an era in politics and that characters like "Rosty" have "all but disappeared from increasingly bland American politics.... we won't see many more like him." Some might say that's a good thing. <I>--Linda Killian</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Richard Cohen's biography of former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL) offers a broad overview of the career of one of the most powerful Members of Congress in recent history.<p>Tracing Rostenkowski's rise from a local politician in his ethnic Chicago neighborhood to the halls of Congress in Washington, DC, his chairmanship of arguably the most powerful and storied standing committee in the House of Representatives, and finally his high-profile downfall after an indictment for corruption charges, Cohen's biography is also the story of the changing world of politics from tradition rich smoke filled rooms to the 24-hour cable news cycle of today.<p>While deeply researched (Cohen interviewed several of Rostenkowki's senior aides and spent time with the Congressman himself), "Rostenkowski" lacks the intricate detail of more serious works of political history. Cohen achieves neither the depth nor the perspective to push his work into the must read category. However, for a well-written and enjoyable overview of Dan Rostenkowski's career and the changing traditions in the House of Representatives, "Rostenkowski" is a worthwhile read.</span>

                    <span>Though I've been a Republican (and occasional Libertarian) since I was old enough to vote, one of my favorite politicians remains a Democrat.  Chicago's own Dan Rostenkowski served as chairman of the very powerful Ways and Means Committee until 1994 when he was voted out of office amongst corruption charges and disgust with the Democratic establishment in general.  Richard Cohen's book is the first and (as far as I can tell) only full-length biography of this politician and its a fascinating read.  Following Rostenkowski from his beginnings as an obscure lackey of Mayor Richard Daley in the '50s to his position as the most powerful man in Washington, D.C. in the late '80s and early '90s, and finally ending with his downfall, Cohen's book shows how this man came to power though the old fashioned politics of patronage and was eventually destroyed by them.  Its also a finely nuanced investigation of a man who remained bluntly unglamorous as American politics were transformed into the world's most vapid beauty contest by the Clintons and their ilk.  Even as you read about the man's flagrant abuse of power, its hard not to miss Dan Rostenkowski whose ill-fitting suits, cheap haircuts, and blue collar manner become all the more likeable in the face of our recent crop of lip-biting, pain-feeling, bridge-building politicians.</span>

                    <span>COHEN's book takes us from boyhood to the ignominious end of a political career -- and does so while telling a second and equally fascinating stoy about the changes in the American political system that accompanied, and  ended, with the ROSTENKOWSKI era. For those who find Chicago politics --  where tombstones sometime vote -- to be worth a good read, this is a  wonderful view of how all that worked in and around a Congressional  district. For those who find the story of this Polish-American icon to be  worthy of a book investment, this volume delivers 200%. For those who  appreciate what a professional journalist with 30 years of Washington  reporting can add to the ROSTENKOWSKI story by way of historical  perspective and evolution, this is a book that cannot be missed.</span>
