                    <span>As a veteran fantasy leaguer and two-time defending league champion, I have been looking to broaden my horizons when it comes to projecting player stats.  This was my first year buying Shandler's book, and I am amazed at the wealth of valuable information he includes.
<br />
<br />In his projections, Shandler includes a host of statistical measures that you won't find anywhere else, and they have led me to  a lot of insights I wouldn't have had without the book.  The highlight for me was the PQS pitching log, which turns a subjective look at starting pitcher performance into a valuable quantitative tool.  I also enjoyed the essays that he and his staff put together, looking into the minutia of baseball performance.
<br />
<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain an edge in fantasy baseball or to anyone with an unsatisfied curiosity about predicting baseball players' stats.</span>

                    <span>I started participating in fantasy baseball last year. It was a great time, but I became inundated with magazines and endless articles on what to do. It was too overwhelming that in retro I choked when it came to picks from rounds 5-10.
<br />This book puts the mind at ease and also is a great read if you're getting into baseball and wanna understand the natural progression of talent and skill. Yes, it does come with an oh-so-handy spreadsheet and chart, but it does give you the tools needed to make educated choices and sleeper choices that are above "sleeper" quality.
<br />Definitely a great tool to use and parlay come draft day. If anything you'll appreciate the number 26!</span>

                    <span>Have subscribed to Shandler's Forecaster since 1997.  Believe me, I've been through all the other mags and publications, both by noted fantasy gurus such as Bill James, John Benson, etc in addition to Spoting News, Fantasy Sports and so on.  I still read and buy the others, as I consider them interesting and enjoyable reads.  Yet, when I want the crucial info that will lead me to league titles, I refer to Baseball HQ.  The Forecaster has guided my preseason and in season ship for 6 yrs now.  The best, no questions asked.  Projections based on empirical data, trends and base skill indicators.  I could go on and on.....  Play Ball!!!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I won my first baseball title last year and $1000+ thanks to this book. Although I didn't follow the dollar values of each player, I thoroughly studied the trends in different ratios to determine my own values. I scored at the draft and dominated the entire league. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone except my league mates. I can't wait for the 2004 edition. Also look for Rotoman's projections.</span>
