                    <span>This book is a great, concise guide to setting up and administering Tomcat. No assumptions are made that you have years of Java or system administration experience. The book directly tackles ninety-eight percent of the questions that the average Tomcat administrator is going to have without having to sift through thousands of pages of worthless fluff. I was able to sit down and read the book over a single weekend.<P>As concise and straightforward as the book is, it still takes on the more complex topics like Building Tomcat from Source, Tomcat Security, and Tomcat Clustering. But I imagine that, like me, you will end up permanently creasing the book binding on Chapter 7: Configuration Files and Their Elements. Especially if you actually end up setting up and running Tomcat. <P>In typical O'REILLY style the book is well organized and well written. It is not one of those technical books that require reading the same sentence three times just to understand its content. Instead the authors have an easy to read style that gracefully flows from topic to topic.<P>Thanks to the authors Jason Brittain and Ian F. Darwin and of course to O'REILLY for another worthy edition to my reference library.</span>

                    <span>Tomcat The Definitive Guide is absolutely a must have for anyone setting up Tomcat. I have a Mac OS X machine and the directions in the book were perfectly clear as to how to setup, auto-start when rebooting, and a huge number of other points. What I love about this book and in general all of the O'Reilly books is their ability to cover the issues completely without too much explanation or too little. This book always points you to where you can get more information. It's also got a great discuss on whether to integrate Apache with Tomcat or just run Tomcat. I changed the way I had it configured after reading their very thoughtful discussion.<P>This book is excellent as a reference for JSP developers as well (of course if you are doing JSP under Tomcat). It doesn't teach you how to do JSP. It does give you a good background for how your JSP pages are executed and how Tomcat reacts to requests.</span>

                    <span>I found this easy to understand and comprehensive. Instructions are easy to follow. You can get started in less than 10 minutes. The first chapter covers the installation in almost all operating systems where Java is available, which is good especially if you are not using the mainstream OS's.<P>Most material can probably be found in Tomcat's website itself, but this book still has good value for money. You might also want to look at Wrox' "Professional Apache Tomcat", which is equally good. For advanced users, you might want to check "How TOmcat Works" (download sample chapters from the publisher's site first because as I said this is not for beginners) that covers beyond configuration and administration.</span>

                    <span>while the book may be useful for getting started/familiar with tomcat for system administrator new to JSP/servlet containers, the coverage is very shallow. touches on subjects without getting enough depth to be useful (optimization, security).<P>i get the sense the book may have been rushed. it's understandable, perhaps, given that as popular as tomcat is, there is dearth of printed documentation for it, and author/o'reilly felt the need to fill the gap asap.<P>revised edition with in-depth coverage of various parts of tomcat would be welcome (but the software changes quickly enough that printed publication like this may not be able to keep up and be profitable)</span>

                    <span>In short, this book provides comprehensive instructions for almost anyone wanting to deploy the TOMCAT Server. This book is a good starting place for programmers or admins who expect to quickly understand basic concepts.<P>Chapter-by-chapter the book presents new concepts accompanied by examples and descriptions for installing, configuring, and some debugging of the servlet engine. While the book tends to be Unix-centric, information for other Operating Environments is provided. Each successive chapter tends to expand on the previous chapter increasing the reader's knowledge along the way. It adequately serves as an introduction to Tomcat but it is also a good book to keep around as a technical administrative reference.<P>The book provides specific information on Tomcat interfaces and components through a "user guide" type format. For example, information is presented for Tomcat's setup, configuration files, environment variables, servlets and JSP's, JDBC, SSL and much more. What this book is not is a programmer guide but is a good how-to for programmers wanting to administer the server. Examples are provided for using and running Tomcat as a stand-alone web server. <P>In summary, this book is a success in explaining the relatively technical concepts of Tomcat and also provides very useful and relevant information about Tomcat features.</span>
