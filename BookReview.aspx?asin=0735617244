                <span id="Label1"> Visual C++ has several capabilities that Visual C# does not have, including better access to unmanaged code, the ability to mix managed and unmanaged code in the same source file, direct access to unmanaged data, and other features. Because developers who use C# may want to implement more C++ in their Microsoft .NET applications, this book thoroughly covers the Visual C++ managed extensions, plus how to write .NET libraries and applications. Readers learn the different programming rules for managed extensions, along with the features that are new to Visual C++ and other .NET-compatible languages. </span>

                    <span>I have most of Richard Grime's books and have been a fan of his for some time. However, his last couple of books have been of extremely poor quality. It's as though the author simply took the Managed Extensions documentation and rushed out a book just to have a book on the subject. For example, there are less than 20 pages on multi-threading while there are 70 pages on interop! Since there are already tons of material on interop why so much material devoted to this - especially when 25 pages are PInvoke?! The book is very uneven and really provides almost nothing beyond what you can find in any MC++ literature. I would recommend instead MS Press' Visual C++ Step By Step or APress' Essential Guide to Managed Extensions as they are much more in touch with delivering unique content.</span>

                    <span>This book was full of useful information and was exactly what I wanted. I'm a .NET programmer and I wanted to find out how to write .NET code with C++. This book was hard to put down and I read the entire thing in about a week -- very rare for a tech book to be this well written and interesting.</span>

                    <span>I cannot say it better than another reviewer "This book is typical of Grimes work...focused, lucid, and complete". This is a great book for learning Managed Extensions for Microsoft Visual C++.Net.</span>

                    <span>A bit dissapointing. <BR>This book is more about what not to do than about what to do or how to do it right. With the recently released new 2003 version of Visual Studio's the C++ compiler for the NET, it might, even, be a bit outdated. <BR>If what you're looking for is a kind of tutorial book on managed extensions( such as myself) this isn't the right book. <BR>Later, I got "Microsoft Visual C++ NET professional projects" and this is it. more than 1000 pages of practical advice, consistent and easy advice C++ and the .NET. <BR>Maybe, after i get to know C++ more deeply "Programming with Managed Extensions for Microsoft Visual C++ .NET" would become an interesting reading.</span>

                    <span>I've been developing in C++ for 11 years and could not praise this volume enough. It's a thorough treatise on using managed extensions. If you're looking for intro or IDE walkthrough stuff, this is not your book. This book is typical of Grimes work...focused, lucid, and complete. This goes beside my Stroustrup and K&R references.</span>
