                <span id="Label1">In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Nicholas Dodman does for feline psychology what he did for canines in his widely acclaimed <i>The Dog Who Loved Too Much.</i>  Here he reveals the fascinating, and often frustrating, mind of one of our most popular--and certainly most independent--animal companions, and shows how we can coexist peacefully with even the stubbornest of cats.<P>What do you do about a cat determined to tear your sofa to shreds?  Or one who gorges himself on your best running shoes . . . or attacks anyone who dares to open the refrigerator door?  Drawing on remarkable real-life stories from his practice at the prestigious Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Dodman shares the unique, compassionate, dramatically successful treatment programs that have given problem cats a new lease on life . . . and their perplexed owners long-term solutions to even the most intractable disorders.<P>As any cat owner knows, changing a cat's behavior can seem like an impossible task.  But contrary to popular belief, cats can be trained and cured of irritating habits and undesirable behaviors.  <i>The Cat Who Cried for Help</i> shows how minor adjustments in diet, exercise regimen, and environment can effect dramatic breakthroughs in resolving almost any feline problem.  From cat panic attacks to eating disorders, from litterbox aversion to depression and a wide range of feline phobias, Dr. Dodman has successfully treated and resolved these and many other heretofore untreatable behaviors.<P>Inside, you'll meet Ashley, the boss-cat who literally bites the hand that feeds him; Jonathan, the binge-eater; Rubles, the Abyssinian Jekyll and Hyde, pussycat one minute, man-eating tiger the next; and Thomas, the cat who cried for help--a little too loudly.  Dr. Dodman's techniques are based on the most up-to-date research in pharmacology and feline behaviorism.  Yet the primary objective of his treatments is to respect and protect the qualities of independence and dignity fundamental to a cat's nature.<P>Including descriptions of symptoms, treatment options, and tips on prevention, <i>The Cat Who Cried for Help</i> provides everything you need to know to ensure both you and your feline friend a long, happy, and healthy relationship.  If you've ever wanted to better understand the nature of this mysterious, enigmatic, and fascinating creature, Dr. Dodman's book provides a penetrating look into the intriguing and intricate world of the cat in your life.</span>

                    <span>If more people, from vets to cat owners, would know and apply the principles outlined in this book, thousands of "problem" cats would be saved from shelters or euthanasia. Using a host of fascinating anecdotes, Dr. Dodman explains the psychology of troubled cats. The book is easy-to-read, yet contains a depth of information on a range of feline behavioral disorders, from inappropriate elimination to aggression. Symptoms and treatments are clearly outlined using stories so amusing or interesting that the book is a one-day read. All cat owners should study this star of a book to gain insight into the mind of their cats.</span>

                    <span>Having five cats in my home, I found this book truly informative. I often find that vets, hoewever professional, are limited in their knowledge of my cats behavior "problems", or what I perceive as a problem. Dr. Dodmans book made me believe for the first time that someone really knew what was going on in those precious little minds. I have two "sprayers" in my home, until this book, all I could get from the vets was, you have too many, get rid of some. Not as easy as all that for me, I love these cats. Dr Dodmans book gave me hope. I searched until I found a DVM that was willing to work with me in trying to help my cats get along with one another and hopefully curb their need to reestablish territorial boundries a dozen times a day. Thank you Dr.Dodman.</span>

                    <span>This book is well-written and anyone can understand where Dodman is coming from. It lends insight into the thoughts and emotions of a cat. There are explanations for the reasons behind the behavior and how to modify your cat's behavior into a more managable situation. As a cat owner my entire life, this book helps explain some things I was always left wondering. Instead of euthanizing your pet for a behavior that is innate, why not try to help them instead? Both owner and cat can learn to coexist in the same household.<P>A definite read for someone trying to figure out a behavioral problem in their cat.</span>

                    <span>I have four cats, all of whom have had behavioral problems due to abuse and/or abandonment issues. Reading this book gave me great advice and step by step guides on modifying inappropriate behavior. "The Cat who Cried for Help" is an entertaining and easy read that uses the author's own cases as examples of success and sometimes failure. I use the book often as a reference since each topic is broken into chapters with a clever title and funny case story to start. <P>For example, the chapter "The Writing on the Wall" deals with problems of kitty "bathroom" issues such as litter boxes, spraying/marking, UTI's, ect... Understanding why a cat does what it does, and what it's trying to tell me in the process has made our home a much happier, and cleaner, place! The importance the author puts on being patient is key to making this book successful. Solving feline problems doesn't happen over night- in our case it took about 5 months, but if you follow Dr. Dodman's advice and don't expect an immediate miracle, you will end up with a happy kitty (and owner)!</span>

                    <span>I had bought this book in anticipation of moving, with a new kitten in tow, and I wanted to make sure that I familiarized her with her new surroundings and was able to catch any behavioral problems early on. I was then surprised by how much FUN this book was to read! Dr. Dodman's case stories are really enjoyable and informative--almost like reading a little mystery. "Why's the cat doing this? What can we do now? Here's the answer!" He has a genuine knack for storytelling and at the same time provides valuable insight into the minds of our cats. I've been able to put several of his theories into action with my own cat, and we're both very happy with the results! I highly recommend this book even if you *don't* think you have any behavioral issues with your cat--it's stuff worth knowing, and a great read to boot.</span>
