                <span id="Label1">"Throw up a Linux box," comes the chorus whenever there's a need to provide some network service or other without impinging upon the boss's martini budget. Fair enough, but by doing so are you opening security holes you don't know how to find or fix? The newest edition of <I>Hacking Linux Exposed</I> helps you answer that question and solve many of the security problems you find. To a certain extent this book is a recipe collection in that it describes weaknesses in Linux (calling attention to specific distributions where appropriate). The authors stop short of explicitly showing you how to wage most kinds of attacks, a reasonable thing to do from an ethical point of view even though the instructions can be found easily on the Internet. Rather than do that, they give step-by-step instructions on how to defend against the attacks they catalog. The point is not, "Here's precisely how to bring down a server by means of an ACK storm," but rather, "Here's how to defend against such problems." They do demonstrate plenty of weaknesses, though, as in their coverage of the conversation that goes back and forth between an FTP server and its client.<p>This book covers pretty much everything you'd want to do with a Linux machine as a network server. Read it and see some of the weaknesses in your system--and do something about them before someone else does. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Security best practices, approached from the perspective of what can go wrong and what can be done about the problems. Specific coverage goes to all major services, including user management, FTP, HTTP, and firewalling.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of the Hacking Exposed style of writing. All offensive theory is backed up by command line examples, followed by defensive countermeasures. Hacking Exposed: Linux, 2nd Ed (HE:L2E) follows this tradition, updating the content of the first edition and adding 200 pages of new content. Although I reviewed the first edition in Sep 01, reading the second edition reminded me of the challenges posed by securely configuring and deploying Linux systems.<BR> <BR>The best way to learn while reading HE:L2E is to try the sample commands. I also recommend visiting the links mentioned and installing many of the tools described by the authors. I found programs like raccess, nsat (ch. 3), sslsniff (ch. 7), nstx, and httptunnel (ch. 15) particularly interesting from an attacker's point of view. From a system administration standpoint, coverage of passlogd (ch. 2), lilo and grub (ch. 5), and X (ch. 6) were very helpful.<P>The authors share many novel ways to abuse Linux systems, but counter those exploits with little-known features or third-party tools. I never knew I could use bash's HISTCONTROL feature to selectively remove entries from shell history files. HE:L2E goes the extra mile to help secure your system, such as including sample C code in ch. 13 to allow one to compile TCP Wrappers support into one's own programs. Other clear, concise defensive measures were introduced in excellent chapters on keeping the kernel and packages current (appendix B) and pro-active security measures (ch. 2). The last appendix gives a short yet powerful description of the damage an intruder can perform, showing how he hid unauthorized programs and how those programs were discovered.<BR> <BR>If you use Linux, you'll find HE:L2E indispensable. I even applied many of the tools and techniques to my FreeBSD system, showing that that good security advice can be a cross-platform endeavor.</span>

                    <span>I am very new to Linux. I've got a lot of windows experience and an MCSE, but recently my job has included a few Linux machines when other guys were downsized. Our Linux machines are the ones on the Internet, so security is relly important. I picked this book up after looking at four or five, and am really happy with my choice.The solutions they provide are clear enough that even a guy like me who is intimidated by Bash can make them all work. The desciptions of the attacks are very complete, and I learned a lot of network attacks that would affect windows machines, but were never explained in my MCSE training -- probably because only Linux has ways to defeat them.This book taught me a lot of Linux tips along the way too. I even followed along and have compiled a Linux kernel from scratch -- something I never expected to get from a security book in such easy to follow instructions.I recommend this book to any Linux user, new or experienced.</span>

                    <span>When I first starting using Linux systems and putting them online I had NO idea what sort of grief I was in for. The reason for that grief: I had NO clue how to 'harden' a system or what that term even meant. By not knowing that I put up systems that were quickly exploited by script kiddies and SPAM houses looking for open relays to use for SPAM and for 'zombies' to use in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. I bought this book, read it, and haven't had those problems since. If you are going to do *anything* with Linux on the internet then GET THIS BOOK NOW. Unless, of course, you *want* to have your computers destroyed on a weekly basis...</span>

                    <span>Hacking Linux Exposed proves itself the leader again in this, the Second Edition . The authors go into great depth showing you every nuance of Linux from a secur ity standpoint, showing you the potential chinks in the armor and the locks wait ing to be picked. You get an excellent view of exactly how an attacker can get i nto your computer, and at each step you learn the configuration changes you can make to keep them out. I don't think there's a better way to explain the dangers than by watching how the attacks work, and this book sets the standard. I find the appendicies to be extreemly valuable, because they detail how to reco ver a compromised system, how to keep your software up to date, even how to patc h and recompile your kernel with the exact same functionality of the one you're running, to avoid configuration changes, crashes, or other suprising results. No Linux administrator can survive without a copy of Hacking Linux Exposed, Seco nd Edition on their bookshelf.</span>
