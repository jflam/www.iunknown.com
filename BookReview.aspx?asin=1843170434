                <span id="Label1">The parallels between the life of the Hon. Mrs. Frances Shand Kydd, and that of her daughter Diana, Princess Of Wales are many. She too, struggled with a controlling, dominant husband, an adulterous affair, and an acrimonious aristocratic divorce. She too has come into conflict with the British Establishment while fighting for control of her children in the shadow of the House of Windsor. He reclusive life on a remote Scottish island has not protected her from the glare of publicity as she attempts to protect both Princes William and Harry and Diana's memory from the continued scandals and rumors surrounding the Princess, epitomized by the trial and acquittal of Diana's butler, Paul Burrell, and the attempts of her former lover James Hewitt to sell her love letters. Max Riddington and Gavan Naden have written a remarkable biography, the result of painstaking research, exclusive interviews with Mrs. Shand Kydd and previously unseen photographs.</span>

                    <span>I thought this biography told me a great deal about a person I knew very little about (except basically gossipy bits from other "Diana" books). It is well-written, sympathetic to the subject, yet fair. You learn that Frances was the warm-hearted child of a reserved mother & affectionate father; just a very nice girl, who unfortunately ended up making the mistake of marrying the wrong man (Earl Spencer) and basically has had to pay for that mistake, her whole life. Some of the mistakes of her own upbringing were repeated with her children, to the greater detriment of her two younger children, but one could argue she had no choice, having lost custody of them thanks to her mother & Earl Spencer's machinations, and the mores of the time. It's good to read "her side", after hearing so much garbage about how she left Diana's father and the reasons why. Also, Paul Burrell's book portrays her SO badly (and I believe most unfairly). Frances deserves the chance to tell her version of events & in Max Riddington she's found the means to do so -- Well done, very interesting, and a must-read for those who want to hear ALL sides of the story of Diana, Princess of Wales.</span>

                    <span>Di's mom sounds like a real decent lady... but because she speaks her mind she been given a kicking by the British Royal Family. This was a fascinating book, full of great information about Diana and her family. It was also very nicely written, well argued and backed up with facts. Not like some of the other royal family books I've read. And what a fascinating life she had led, even as a young girl she was similar to Di. I never knew they were born in the same bedroom! Or that the Queen has refused to speak to Frances since Di's death!</span>

                    <span>I can't recall ever coming across another book on the late Princess of Wales' mother, but this rehashes all the familiar stories of her famous divorce & lost custody battle, and tries to explain her tenuous relationship with her children. While a sympathetic character, she has always seemed somewhat mysterious and I can't say this has cleared much up in that regard. I'm unsure why she agreed to cooperate with this effort, unless she knew it was to be written anyway and thought she'd try and get her part right. She seems a lonely and isolated figure, partly by her own design, but nonetheless seems to have not had such a nice life after her first marriage. Her second marriage seems to have been ruined by her daughter's fame. I consider myself a bit of an expert on the POW, and unfortunately this book didn't tell me much I didn't know already.</span>
