                <span id="Label1">As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with <I>A Farewell to Arms</I>. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc&eacute; of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits: <blockquote> I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know. </blockquote> The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he "did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards." Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.  <p> Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and <I>A Farewell to Arms</I>, like his other novels (<I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I>, <I>The Sun Also Rises</I>, and <I>To Have and Have Not</I>), offers neither. What it <I>does</I> provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. <I>--Alix Wilber</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a fantastic novel that is very easy to get into. Hemmingway's short, descriptive sentences offer a style uncanny to any other's and they clash very effectively with his seemingly endless sections of solid naration between characters. <p>The story itself is absolutely astonishing but is almost forgotten amongst the overwhelming love story between Catherine and le Tenente. I found myself, having finished the novel, looking back on what had happened to the tenente and realizing it had all passed while I was only worried about Catherine. An absolute masterpiece by Hemmingway.<p>My only problem was that the novel was written so close to the end of WWI that Hemmingway simply assumes the reader is familiar with the geography and the history of the war. I found myself having to refer to a map periodically and looking up other WWI events on the internet as the happened in the book. <p>None the less, this is a can't miss novel!!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After reading Ernest Hemingway's short stories viz "The Snows of Kilimanjaro"  and  "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"  (which were just tooooooooo good), I was a bit disappointed to read "A Farewell to arms". I have no intention of sounding contrarion, however for some reason, I found it mediocre from start to finish(The only reason I completely read it was because it was a Hemingway). 
<br />
<br />Story seemed very plain & straight forward. The love between Henry & Catherine seemed very boring. The war was poorly captured. Some part of story seemed just too unreal. For example ... the chapter in which Henry & other folks retreat from war front and head back, they kill their own captain without any remorse(how is that possible?). Later on one of their own guy gets killed by their own people(Italians). Again no remorse is captured. 
<br />
<br />I just find it totally unreal. Any human being in the above situations would have felt/exhibited intense remorse(hmmm ... or was it my expectation based on the war movies I have seen ...)
<br />
<br />All in all, I was not that impressed with "A Farewell to Arms". It could very well be due to my high expectations. Or could be that we live in a different world now and thus it is difficult to identify with the story.
<br />
<br />None-the-less ... I would say, read it just because it is a Hemingway and for no other reason.

                    <span>I thought this was a pretty good read till I got to the part where the guy suffers the double amputation.
<br />
<br />I mean, sure, that's a major blow and all, but did the narrator really have to spend the next 200 pages whining about his fate and reminiscing about the usefulness of his now-lost limbs?
<br />
<br />It would have been much better had he adopted a more hopeful note--perhaps centering his despair on the various kinds of prosthetic devices that were the obsession of so many of the "Lost Generation" writers.
<br />
<br />As it is, this book is just one long nostalgic memoir about the guy's missing and unrecoverable arms:  most of it consists of him lovingly describing how he would use them to lift, swing, pull, etc., but now, tragically, must use his feet for these tasks.  
<br />
<br />Such bizarre self-pity might have been okay for a few pages, but for 200?  Honestly!</span>

                    <span>After 43 years of reading this is it--the finest book I have ever experienced. One aspect that I don't see mentioned in other review is just how damned funny the book is. I could hardly believe the first few jokes and then they started coming rapidly.  There is a growing sense of doom as you near a conclusion that made me cry. It will be hard to read other books now that I've seen how it really can be.</span>
