                <span id="Label1">For six months in 1942, Stalingrad is the center of a titanic struggle between the Russian and German armies--the bloodiest campaign in mankind's long history of warfare.  The outcome is pivotal.  If Hitler's forces are not stopped, Russia will fall.  And with it, the world....<br><br>German soldiers call the battle <I>Rattenkrieg,</I> <b>War of the Rats</b>.  The combat is horrific, as soldiers die in the smoking cellars and trenches of a ruined city.  Through this twisted carnage stalk two men--one Russian, one German--each the top sniper in his respective army. These two marksmen are equally matched in both skill and tenacity. Each man has his own mission:  to find his counterpart--and kill him. <br><br>But an American woman trapped in Russia complicates this extraordinary duel.  Joining the Russian sniper's cadre, she soon becomes one of his most talented assassins--and perhaps his greatest weakness.  Based on a true story, this is the harrowing tale of two adversaries enmeshed in their own private war--and whose fortunes will help decide the fate of the world.<br><br></span>

                    <span>This book has given me a lesson in WWII history I will remember far beyond anything I ever read in years of school. The author's insight into the psychic of both men and women under the pressure of life and death, civic duty versus human need, was astounding. His detailed description of warfare and survival made me cring yet I couldn't set it down because I never knew if the "good guys" would indeed win. As a woman reader, I was especially impressed that the author could be so in touch with Tania, a woman fighting for a cause. I felt I was running and sneaking and dogging sniper bullets with her. Mr. Robbins enlightened me to a war fought long before my time that is still worth crying over. That two people could fall in love in the trenches fighting for their country gave it an edge over being just another historic novel.</span>

                    <span>Robbins does a magnificent job of bringing the utter horror and despair of the Battle of Stalingrad to life. He's apparently done his homework and, despite some minor technical errors, vividly portrays both the macro-level German siege against the stalwart Russian defenders as well as the war-within-the-war between the master Russian and German snipers. Robbins deftly brings us into the minds of his main characters, giving us a good sense of the complex thought processes (often agonizingly conflicted) that soldiers exhibit when put into the dire struggle for survival that was the Battle of Stalingrad.<P>My only complaint was that the ultimate fates of three of his four main characters are left to the imagination. While that would be just fine in most instances, the fact that two of those three characters are real-life historical figures leaves the reader wondering what happened to them after February 1943. One can make assumptions and, perhaps do further research, but an endnote about the actual fates of these characters would have been a more suitable closing for this truly outstanding book.</span>

                    <span>War of the Rats gripped me during the first half of the book, with its captivating personal story of Zaitsev. After the mid-point mark it began dragging, a problem I attribute mainly to two shortcomings: First, the character of Tanya was an unnecessary and unconvincing distraction. The life and death struggles faced by Zaitsev and other soldiers in Stalingrad is compelling enough without trying to cram in an unnatural love story, especially one involving someone as unsympathetic and unlikely as Tanya. Second, Robbins does a poor job of developing the character of Thorvald. Here he is, the best sniper in the entire Third Reich, yet he is depicted as lazy and inattentive. He'd have been killed during his first day in Stalingrad if he were truly as inept as he is made out to be. Another complaint I have, but one which affects the entire book as opposed to just the second half, was that the book fails to adequately depict the true human suffering that occurred in Stalingrad. The physical desolation of the city itself is depicted well, but in terms of the sheer inhumanity and awfulness of the place I thought it fell short.<P>Despite all this, I still think War of the Rats is worth reading. Just realize going into it that there are certain shortcomings that make this a good book rather than a great book and you should enjoy it.</span>

                    <span>When I got this book at the book store I wanted to learn about Stalingrad, and after reading it I was amazed at how much I learned and how much fun I had reading it. I'm only 14 but I would reccomend this book to anyone that enjoys World War 2 or just really good books. Anyway I thought that this was the second best book I have ever read (second only to Band of Brothers, which is also a great book).</span>

                    <span>I have to say that this book was at best inconsistent. As long as the author stuck to sniper tactics and actual war "footage" the narrative was quite enjoyable. His attempts at portraying the determination of the Red Army soldiers and civilians to kill the Germans did not measure up. The descriptions seemed to be filled with crude oversimplifications, almost insulting to their memory. The names of the heroes were sometimes misspelled, sometimes misplaced. General Zhukov's name(one of THE key figures of the Red Army) is Konstantin-not Konstatinovich.The names of the non-Russian soldiers were often inappropriate-for example the Georgian didn't sound Georgian etc. <BR>In addition- the love scenes-especially the one in the bunker made me shudder with awful,awkward imagery. The scene read like something out of the "the young and the soviet"</span>
