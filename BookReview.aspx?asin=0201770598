                <span id="Label1">XML is one of the most exciting recent developments to hit the World Wide Web, enabling the further expansion of Web technology into new domains of content management, audience targetted presentation and distributed document processing. If you're a current or potential XML user looking for just one reference to get you up to speed on XML with clarity, comprehensive coverage and precision, then this book will be your essential and constant companion.  <P>Building on the success of the first edition of The XMLCompanion, Neil Bradley has updated this accessible, in-depth reference to release 1.0 of the XML standard to incorporate the results of the high degree of activity that has surrounded the standard since its release. This edition now contains the complementary standards that have been released, including detailed coverage of DOM 1.0, SAX 1.0, CSS 2 and NameSpaces 1.0, as well as describing the latest, most stable drafts of XSL & XSLT, Xlink & Xpointer.  <P>The XML Companion: * provides an accessible, comprehensive description of each XML feature * does not assume experience of either HTML or SGML * features a series of 'Road Map' charts that reveal the structure of the XML standard * contains an extensive glossary of XML and related terminology  * provides up-to-date coverage of all complementary standards  <P>New to this edition:  NEW - Detailed coverage of DOM 1.0, SAX 1.0, CSS 2 and NameSpaces 1.0   NEW - Describes latest drafts of XSL & XSLT, Xlink & XPointer  NEW - Covers recently proposed standards - XHTML and XML Catalog</span>

                    <span>Bradley's book is a pretty complete guide to XML and related technologies. The main chapters are almost tutorial in style, with plenty of code examples to follow. The end of the book contains a small reference section. The topics covered are XML, XSL, XSLT, DOM, SAX, XPath, Schemas, XLink, XHTML, and CSS. Discussions are for the most part clear and accurate. I have two main complaints about Bradley. First, the prose, while accurate, is often overly verbose. It could be written more concisely and compactly. Second, each chapter is broken into sections, but the sections are not numbered, so it is difficult to locate material in the text. The main advantage is the comprehensive general coverage of XML-related technologies. Buying this one book will arm you with the knowledge to develop XML applications and content, and it will save you money. If you have very specific needs, you may need to supplement Bradley with another more focused text that delves deeper into a particular technology. Also, if you want to see longer applications presented as case studies, you might want a different text. I recommend this book for beginning and intermediate XML users who want broad, general coverage in a single book.</span>

                    <span>...and not for a beginner. Filled with samples and graphs-which somewhat help the extremely confusing writing style. Bradley's style reminds me of the teacher I had when I was 10 years old who found it very easy to go off on a new tangent--and very difficult to be brief, concise or clear.<BR>Fine for a reference, if you already know what you want.</span>

                    <span>don't expect to learn how to use xml from this book. the structure and layout of the material is incomprehensible, doesn't lend itself to self-study and the chapters do not seem to "build on concepts described in previous chapters" (as touted in the preface)--rather, discussing and expounding on specious, irrelevant and unimportant topics. since i obtained this book with the intention of learning xml (and not the incredibly trivial details bradley insists on explicating), i expected to see some (at least one) examples of an actual xml document. no such luck. don't buy this book if you want to know *how* to use xml--total and complete waste of time and money. perhaps it could be of use to some people however. you never know.</span>

                    <span>This is not that great a book, in fact it is fairly poor. The writing is confused in places and the examples badly thought through. Technically minded readers will find it largely pointless, and will offer little of any great use. Over-rated.</span>

                    <span>This book is clearly not for a beginner, nor should it be. Many reviews give it less than five stars due to the fact that it's a bad tutorial. Well it wasn't designed as one, as you should see in the title XML **Companion**. It's designed as a thorough reference of XML and related technologies. Neil is really up to date with his stuff. I couldn't find another book, (and I've skimmed through all of them), that covers everything. Coverage of technical issues like white space normalization, Relax, Trex, Relax NG, etc... It's wondeful.<BR>Please don't buy this book as a tutorial, but rather as a desktop reference. It's a must on all XML programmer's bookshelves.</span>
