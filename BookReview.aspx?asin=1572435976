                    <span>Ralph Kiner's strength as an observer of the National Pastime (perhaps passed-time to those who enjoy football more) is that while he clearly favors the way the game was played and the way things were done in his day he is still able to find the good in and enjoy the present day.
<br />
<br />Kiner's recollections of his career are very clearly presented. One of the more interesting revealations is that he was the only player on his team earning enough money that he did not have to work in the off-season. This enabled him to dedicate his off-season to a workout program, something not regularly done at the time.
<br />
<br />His career has been very varied, serving as a player, minor league general manager and longtime Mets broadcaster. Ralph may even have been the Derek Jeter of his day, having dated Elizabeth Taylor and having a short term relationship with Janet Leigh. The style of the book is breezy and conversational. While Ralph's classic malapropism's have been edited, they are freely acknowledged eg; "On Father's Day we again wish you all Happy Birthday.".
<br />
<br />Two slight quibbles with the book, although they won't bother everybody. First, as a long time (and at times long suffering) Mets fan I am very familiar with much of the anecdotal material in the book. This will certainly not be a problem for anyone who has not had the maximum exposure to Mets telecasts that I have.
<br />The second flaw is that on a few occasions the book goes on lengthy asides with opinions on social issues. While I am sure the opinions do not differ from Mr. Kiner's own, they just do not come out in his voice. At these portions of the book, I was very consciously aware that I was reading the words of co-author Danny Peary. Not a bad thing, as Mr. Peary is a most compelling writer. It is just that the change in narrative was noticeable where it should have been transparent.
<br />
<br />Overall a very pleasant read and time well spent with a hall-of-famer on and off the field.

                    <span>Ralph Kiner is the personification of a solid role model for any baseball fan.  He is a Hall of Famer in every sense of the word.  In this breezy account of America's greatest game, Kiner pulls no punches in terms of his feelings about those who have influenced his life--Hank Greenberg, Branch Rickey, former teammates, and his beloved late wife DiAnn. He also does not shy away from today's controversial figures, including Pete Rose and Barry Bonds.  Since he was instrumental in establishing the first players' association, he is no stranger to the struggle for such things as free agency.<p>Those of us fortunate enough to know Ralph Kiner well enough to call him a friend, can testify that he is one of today's outstanding conversationalists who speaks the sort of truth that can come only from real-world experience.  Co-writer Danny Peary has maintained the immortal slugger's unique "voice" in helping to craft this page-turner.<p>To the die-hard baseball fan, this book will trigger some treasured memories of the past; for the newcomer to the sport, it will reveal how the game has evolved over the past 60 years.<p>This is a "must read" for baseball enthusiasts everywhere.</span>
