                    <span>It is good to see detail suppressed by many Inquisitions coming into the light of day again; their detailed and simple explanations of how archetypes play on our common culture and ancestry and keep these timeless, universal themes alive is easy to understand.  It is also a good book for helping one see the original intent of these archetypes as "good for us" versus the negative play that so many of the "conspiratorial authors" enlarge upon.  This book will help those wanting to "free their minds" from past cultural control and guide us into "individual control" with direct contact with all levels of the universe.  This is what the "original mandate" was for the people entrusted with helping earthly culture evolve.  It is a positive one, not a negative thing.   That some people have used this for negative, like for "power" in the world, does not make it any less valuable info toward understanding our "Oneness" with all dimensions of the universe.</span>

                    <span>The first part (about 1/3 of the book) is quite interesting and has a lot of eye-opening information about first years of Christianity, early Church, etc. The other two thirds you can just skip. That is why my rating is five stars divided by three.</span>

                    <span>Baigent et al. open this title with a follow-up to their successful & controversial Holy Blood Holy Grail. The authors revisit ancient times further speculating upon Jesus's divinity and bloodline.<br>Then they go off on a lengthy tangential train of thought researching almost everything and anything in history before retying their thoughts together in the final third of the book.<br>Reading this I learnt much as I did reading their Holy Blood Holy Grail. However my patience did wane slightly wondering if they were ever going to cover the topics described on the back cover, or for that matter further discuss some of the societys mentioned earlier in this book or in their other title.<p>They finally do return to topics and themes readers familiar to this effusive collaboration have grown accustomed to, and in my opinion fulfill the promises made by their potential and the hype their works have accredited.<p>This volume I must confess I found overall less interesting, possibly because while the authors haven't become apologetic or revoked their earlier research they didn't add more controversy to their titles. Baigent and his co-author's aren't accused of towing the party line but only recovered the earlier revelations/theories without much expansion which I think was the only really hurtful factor to my enjoyment of this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm a bit baffled by the animosity expressed in the reviews of this book. I can only conclude that it is the result of poor marketing pulling in the wrong audience, since when I read the sensational cover blurbs I, too, almost put the book down. Upon committing and actually reading the work, however, I was pleasantly surprised and very much enjoyed the authors' perspectives.<p>Frankly, there was nothing terribly earth-shattering inside. The book is largely a plausible and enjoyable exploration of Jesus as Messiah with an attempt to clarify what a Messiah really was (& is). This includes some discussion of specific problems of translation and misinterpretation. While this is hardly revolutionary scholarship, I must admit that I appreciate having specific instances of ambiguity pointed out to me by someone in a position to translate. One example of this is the authors' discussion of the association of Jesus with Nazareth, a town that did not yet exist in his time. They conclude that this is actually a reference to "Nazarean", which would tie Jesus to a radical political sect of the time. This political aspect of the Messianic is also expanded to include fascinating but brief perspectives on other candidates, including Constantine, Napolean & Hitler.<p>There are interesting--if truncated--discussions of Christian history, providing a thread of continuity to what is typically presented as very spotty, periodic and localized events liberally dosed with mythology and agenda. I was particularly interested to discover the importance of the Celtic church as a repository of scholarship during the middle ages, something I was unaware of. In contrast to the other reviewers, I noticed no glaringly hideous inaccuracies in the authors' presentation. For instance and in direct rebuttal, some of the Christian churches definitely DO differ on points considered heretical by Rome. The Armenian and Coptic churches, for example, DID splinter off after the Nicean council condemned their theology as Monophositic heresy. This was an argument that was ALL about the divinity of Jesus, something near and dear to Paul's heart. Pointing this out doesn't make one a bad writer, anti-Catholic or an evil person.<p>The book also discusses the vacuum of--for lack of a better term--"spiritual resonance" in modern western culture and official religion. The authors discuss the role of art, religion, politics & myth in fulfilling the deep psychological human need for meaning. They deride the application of advertising to capitalize on this aspect of humanity for petty gains.<p>While potentially interesting, the allusions to Jesus' bloodline, the Prieure of Sion, Knights Templar & other secret societies seemed rather peripheral -- intended primarily to tie this book to their previous best-seller, Holy Blood, Holy Grail. The linkages are a bit strained, but since this seems to be where the authors think their bread-and-butter lies, I guess they had to throw in something, however vague.<p>This is a great read for anyone who is interested in an introduction to the fascinating field of biblical scholarship without the necessity of devolving into scriptural dogma. I would also recommend Umberto Eco for readable historical fiction with a massive dose of erudition related to the same issues.</span>

                    <span>This book, a sequel to "Holy Blood Holy Grail", was apparently precipitated by the commercial success of its predecessor. It is not nearly as engaging, or as interesting. see my review for "Holy Blood".</span>
