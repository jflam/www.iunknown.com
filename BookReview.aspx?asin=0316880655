                    <span>Anyone who is a Renaissance Soul (people who hate to pick just one thing) has a really hard time with the standard Myers-Briggs test.  Why? Because it makes us choose whether we'd do "A" OR whether we'd do "B" when we want to say, "Sometimes one, sometimes the other!  It depends..."  As a Renaissance Soul life coach I was absolutely thrilled when I discovered Tieger's continuum approach.  His explanations of how the different Myers-Briggs types interact and can even change over time was also very satisfying, given how we Renaissance Souls keep changing, whether we "want to" or not. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>"Do What You Are" is one of those rare books that effectively serves two purposes: It offers a solid introduction to personality typing, particularly using the well-known Myers-Briggs system, as well as being a practical guide to help readers look for the *types* of work and careers best suited to their particular personality type. I have had my copy since 1993, and have lent it out numerous times to a variety of people who-- after studying it-- have all commented that they had a much clearer understanding of their career-related ups and downs.
<br />
<br />The Tiegers cover three different areas in the book. Part One offers a basic introduction to the theories behind personality typing and the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator. Whereas there is not actually a Myers-Briggs style "sorter quiz" in the book (these are best administered by a professional), there are fairly good descriptions of the four dimensions of personality type-- thorough enough for most readers to be able to determine their four-letter "code." 
<br />
<br />Part Two addresses the interaction between the dimensions of personality and work style, and how they affect behavior and priorities in the workplace. This includes such things as how different personalities might approach the same problem differently, as well as a discussion of personal development at different stages of life.
<br />
<br />Part Three-- which is the bulk of the book-- provides detailed descriptions of the 16 personality types, with a full chapter for each type. Each chapter includes three "real people" examples of working people, showing what works (as well as challenges) for them in their chosen careers. Each chapter continues by finding the "common threads" of the type covered, and then goes on to list a large number of careers that might be a "good fit." The chapters then conclude with tips for the job search, pathways to success and possible pitfalls to stay alert to-- as they apply to YOUR particular type.
<br />
<br />Overall, the book offers many interesting insights. However, readers should keep in mind that books like "Do What You Are" serve as GUIDES, and NOT as a set of "hard and fast" rules. Some people may have had life experiences that open different doors than those outlined here, and some may find the lists of careers for thir type a bit limiting. Also, the book mostly deals with "mainstream" professions with a heavy focus on the corporate track-- if you're of an entrepreneurial nature, you may not find it quite as useful. Finally, I would suggest that you don't rely on this book alone, when trying to find a career that's a good fit-- personality typing is merely ONE of many possible approaches to career development. 
<br />
<br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially for those who are considering a new direction because their career seems stagnant or "not quite right." It would be helpful-- but by no means essential-- to know your Myers-Briggs type prior to reading the book. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading!

                    <span>Lately, I have been "searching" for my work identity and have been involved in a Leadership Development program through work.  This book was awesome about affirming who I am and then recommending several careers that would fit my personality type.  If you are undecided or feel "railroaded" into a career that just doesn't feel right, read this book.  Soon I'll be making a significant career change and I give credit to this book.  </span>

                    <span>I enjoy reading and studying the MBTI and personality theory.  I picked up the Tiegers' book at a book sale and certainly do not regret it.  The book is well written and fills an urgent need: it attempts to help the concerned reader answer the ages old question, what am I supposed to do with my life?  All sixteen types are given ample attention and the book offers many suggestions for pursuing a career based on your personality type.  Each section has detailed, real life examples of successful matches between personality types and careers.
<br />
<br />However, I have a few concerns about the book that prevent it from receiving a five star rating.  The book does not mention entrepreneurship at all (a minor point).  It also does not give an explanation that I recall regarding how the Tiegers reached the conclusions they wrote about.  In my case I was indifferent to many of the suggestions that they gave as career choices for my type, and was actually turned off to several.  Capability is different than interest.  Another problem is that socialization or other experiences in a person's life may lead to an enjoyable career that is not what a reading of the innate preferences and combination of preferences may suggest.  The Tiegers addressed these concerns...somewhat.  In my specific case I concluded that my potential career goals and career path need to involve different ideas and suggestions than what the Tiegers asserted.
<br />
<br />That said, I still recommend the book.  Someone who is younger, college or high school age, for example, or someone (probably still younger aged) who is completely unhappy in their job might greatly benefit from reading the book and acting on its advice.  A mediocre resource is probably better than no resource, and Do What You Are is not mediocre - it's good, but not great.</span>
