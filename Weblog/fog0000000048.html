        <p><P>One of the really cool things about having friends in the PC industry is that they can come over to your house and fix the technology that they created. Since the <A href="../Articles/fog0000000041.html">last installment </A>in my never ending quest for the perfect Entertainment PC, I haven't really done much with the one that I decided to build and keep for myself. Tonight I invited my friend, who happens to be the product manager for <A href="http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/aiw_radeon/index.html">ATI's All-In-Wonder RADEON card</A>, over to show him my setup. </P>
<P>I'm a defaults kind of guy. I generally don't fiddle with the settings of my software. I generally use maybe 5% of the features of my software (except for my software development tools: I have limited intelligence and I use it in a very directed manner). My Windows XP installation looks like the day that it was first installed. So, not surprisingly, all of the software for my ATI All-In-Wonder RADEON card was configured using the defaults. </P>
<P>My friend sat down and fiddled with the settings on the RADEON card. He got the TV output looking <EM>much</EM> better than it did under the default settings. The TV tuner output that I complained so bitterly about before looked much better after his adjustments. He also showed me a ton of really cool features, such as the TV station scanning feature which lets you watch <EM>one</EM> of the channels while the rest of the channels are being scanned. He also showed me some features that let me record live television with better image quality than I was able to before. </P>
<P>All in all,&nbsp;I would say that I'm a lot happier with my Entertainment PC than I was before. However, there's still a bunch of software glitches that plague the system. Sometimes during DVD playback, the audio track is no longer sync'd with the video on the screen. The TV recording feature skips frames on a regular basis (this is a 1.6GHz Pentium 4 system!). I still can't get sound to record on my SnapStream recorder. The machine will blue-screen every now and then. The CD audio player won't detect an audio CD insertion. My USB wireless ethernet adapter has crapped out on me. </P>
<P>It's still a <EM>very</EM> high maintenance setup. I look forward to the day when all of the software that is running on that machine can just get along with each other. Then I can use that machine as an appliance like I originally intended. Remember my three requirements: play audio on my stereo, watch DVDs, record live TV.&nbsp;Well, I can dream, can't I???</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
