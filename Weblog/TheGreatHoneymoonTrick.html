        <p><P>This is a story about how we started off driving to Tobermory, but wound up in Alaska. I'm writing this on Day 6 of our honeymoon cruise. I'm sitting at a table in La Playa Grill, a cafeteria&nbsp;on our cruise ship, the Carnival Spirit. A pack of noisy teenagers just ran by, looking for trouble. The table that I'm sitting at is angled so that it faces the port side of the ship at a 45 degree angle. There are floor-to-ceiling windows in front of me, and I'm looking at the Gulf of Alaska on a mostly cloudy day. We just left our final port of call, the city of Sitka, where we went on a wildlife cruise through the islands around Sitka. How we got onto this cruise ship in Alaska makes for a great story. So it's time to reflect back on the events following our wedding.</P>
<P>When Carolyn and I were planning our wedding, we "decided" that we would do a simple honeymoon following our wedding, and then do something longer and more interesting during Christmas break. Our original plan was to go to Tobermory for our honeymoon. Tobermory is a small town at the northern tip of the Bruce Peninsula in Georgian Bay. It's a picturesque tourist town and a favorite dive spot. A friend of ours from college runs an Inn and a gift shop in Tobermory, so it made a perfect cover story for my evil scheme.</P>
<P>In the interests of operational security, only my brother and my dad knew about my scheme, and only my brother was privy to all of the details. This, of course, meant that I had to consistently lie to everybody who asked where we were going on our honeymoon. Now, Carolyn believes that she can always detect when I'm lying; in fact, her exact words are "you can't lie worth shit". As my evil scheme unfolded, I enjoyed making her eat those very words time and time again. To all of our friends and family that I did lie to about our honeymoon plans, please accept my sincere apologies for having deceived you ;)&nbsp;Now back to our regularly scheduled story.</P>
<P>On the day after our wedding, we woke up late in the morning after spending a wonderful night at the Old Mill Inn in Toronto. Carolyn's quite used to my anal-retentive scheduling behavior, so she didn't put up much of a fight when I told her that we needed to be on the road by 1:30pm. We were driving her car to "Tobermory", and I "volunteered" to drive the first leg in the 5 hour drive. Carolyn was on the cel phone talking to her parents as we drove north on Highway 427. Fortunately, Highway 427 in Toronto passes right by the airport. Surprisingly, she didn't say anything when I detoured and drove into the airport. It wasn't until the concrete in the short-term parking garage cut off her cel phone signal that she began asking me what was going on.</P>
<P>While driving to the airport, I had a primary cover story planned to continue the deception. When we pulled into the airport, I decided to improvise a bit so that I could keep her in the dark a bit longer. While we were unloading our luggage from our car, I told Carolyn that we were going to take a float plane up to Tobermory and that she should thank her uncle Jim, who is an Air Canada pilot. She got so excited that she called her parents back to tell them about our revised plan. </P>
<P>Now, I realized that this little feint would only last until we walked into the boarding area of the Boeing 767 that was going to fly us to Vancouver. So I decided to 'fess up earlier, and sprang my primary cover story on her. When we walked into Pearson International Airport's Terminal 2, we were met by my brother Thomas, who was also my best man at our wedding. Thomas' job was to drive our car home (in reality he's going to spend 10 days driving around in our Subaru Outback wagon). Thomas was in on the real plan so he helped out by reinforcing the "real" story.</P>
<P>This time, I told Carolyn that we were flying to Vancouver so that we could drive down to Seattle. My story involved some rich Microsoft "volunteers" who would loan us their spectacular hillside vacation home on the side of Mt. Ranier in Seattle (I even talked about how owning such a home would be advantageous under the US taxation code). Unfortunately for us, the home wouldn't be ready for us until Wednesday, so we would stay for a couple of nights in Vancouver before traveling by car to Seattle. </P>
<P>We spent those evenings at the Fairmont Waterfront, which as it turns out, is right across the street from the Cruise Ship Terminal. During the days, we walked around Stanley Park in Vancouver, and did some shopping. The shopping was necessary because I had earlier&nbsp;explained to Carolyn that we were going to attend a formal function that was to be held at Bill Gates' house. So off we went to buy her some formal clothes that she would need for our formal nights on board the cruise ship.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, I began to get worried because she pointed to the giant cruise ship (the Carnival Spirit) which had docked at the Cruise Ship terminal early in the morning. Fearing that she would put two and two together, I decided to throw one more curve ball at her. Early in the morning we needed to finish some shopping. The previous day, I had ordered a Nikon EU1 remote shutter release from a Dunn and Brundle, a camera store on Granville street in Vancouver. While returning from that shopping trip (which I made alone), I dropped by the bell stand at the Fairmont and got Vincent, one of the bell captains, involved in my evil scheme.</P>
<P>Vincent would pick up our luggage from our room and have it stored in the luggage room. As our departure time (1:30) approached, he would have our luggage loaded onto one of the hotel courtesy cars to drive us to our "car rental place", where we would pick up our car to drive to Seattle. After pulling away from the hotel, he asked me what "car rental place" we were picking up our car at. I told him Thrifty's, as this would give us an excuse to drive into the Cruise Ship Terminal. </P>
<P>We drove around for a while in downtown Vancouver due to some construction that was taking place next to the hotel, before returning to the cruise ship terminal. We pulled up to the cruise ship departure gate and asked the traffic attendant where Thrifty's was. She told us that it was one level down from where we were, but we "elected" to offload our bags where we were.</P>
<P>What happened next was priceless. A Carnival baggage attendant came over to pick up our bags. Carolyn began arguing with the baggage attendant as she tried to explain to him that we weren't going on a cruise; we were really there to pick up a rental car! That was when I had to tell her that we were going on an Alaskan cruise. The surprise was so complete that Carolyn refused to believe that we were going to Alaska, and she kept hitting me in line and drawing lots of attention. She kept asking me where we <EM>really</EM> were going. Eventually, reality sunk in as she saw all of the signs proclaiming that we were going to Alaska, and she got a chance to look at our cruise ship tickets. </P>
<P>So there you go. That's the story of the Great Honeymoon Trick, and how we wound up driving towards Tobermory, but wound up in Alaska instead.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
