        <p><P>My brother Thomas and I bought a Canon S30 digital camera for our dad's birthday last week. I chipped in by donating my Epson Stylus 860 photo printer. </P>
<P>One of the things that new digital camera users inevitably run straight into is the complexity of the digital camera "workflow". The complexity of this workflow is not usually obvious until you compare it with the film camera "workflow":</P>
<OL>
<LI>Shoot a roll of film 
<LI>Give it to someone else who processes your film into prints / slides</LI></OL>
<P>The digital camera workflow is significantly more complicated because you now are managing all of step 2 yourself. In a digital camera, your workflow looks like:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Shoot some pictures 
<LI>Download pictures into your computer 
<LI>Select the ones that "turned out" and discard the rest 
<LI>Tweak and adjust the pictures 
<LI>Print the ones you <EM>really</EM> like</LI></OL>
<P>This is a lot more friction than the film workflow. Ideally, you would like to give your photos to your computer and have it perform the job of a digital mini-lab. While this is theoretically possible, it really isn't possible given the crappy usability of the software that exists today.</P>
<P>Steps 2 and 3 are handled reasonably well by software today. The things that complicate matters are steps 4 and 5. The problem here is that typical film camera users never could do these tasks in the past, so there is nothing for them to relate to. </P>
<P>Ideally, Step 4 would be fully automatic. It would detect common exposure flaws (red-eye caused by on-camera flashes, and shooting back-lit portraits without flash are probably the most common) and perform automatic exposure compensation. Eliminating Step 4 would be a huge boom to usability, as it eliminates a common "friction" step. </P>
<P>Step 5 can also be problematic, especially if you haven't color-calibrated your monitor and printer. If you want to "adjust" the colors of your photographs, invariably you will find that they won't match the colors that are on your display. Camera and printer manufacturers are getting better with the new Print Image Matching (PIM) feature - really just an extension of the EXIF metadata format, but the biggest problem is getting your monitor calibrated.</P>
<P>All in all, it would be great if usability considerations would be addressed in the digital camera workflow process. Things are getting better (iPhoto does a nice job by integrating steps 2-5 into a single application). However, it's <EM>really </EM>tough to compete with the film camera workflow. I can now understand why digital minilabs and dedicated 4 x 6 photo printers have a place in the marketplace.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
