        <p><P>My extremely low blogging frequency of late can be partially explained by this snapshot:</P><SPAN>

<P><BR clear=all>This is our new puppy; his name is Kobe. He's a black Labrador Retriever that we brought home from <A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca">Bralex Labradors</A>. For some earlier pictures of Kobe (and his littermates),&nbsp;<A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca/puppies.html">look here</A> (this link will&nbsp;probably be obsolete in a few days when <A href="http://www.bralexlabradors.ca/upcomming.html#litters">Darbi's puppies arrive</A>).&nbsp;We visited Bralex several times before finally picking up Kobe last Saturday. He had the sweetest temperment amongst his littermates, and took to us instantly.</P>
<P>As new parents, Carolyn and I have had a few sleep-deprived nights as we struggled to understand Kobe and how to communicate with him. Crate training has really helped to housebreak him. So far there have only been a few isolated accidents as we're learning his signals to us. </P>
<P></SPAN><SPAN>He's got a <EM>really </EM>great temperment. He loves meeting new people, and is absolutely the star of our apartment building. His fan club becomes bigger every time we take him outside to go potty. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>We took Kobe for his first visit to his vet, Dr. Al Moroz of the Animal Hospital of High Park, this afternoon. Al's a tremendous vet; we were so impressed by how well he handled Kobe and how he was able to settle down his anxious parents! Al's got a new black Lab puppy as well, who's just a week younger than Kobe. His stories about his dog and how she gets along with him really helped us out in understanding black Lab behavior. I can't recommend Al enough as a vet.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Kobe's a big puppy already. Born on January 5, he already weighs a whopping 17 pounds as a 9-week old! To put that growth spurt in perspective, he weighed 9 pounds on Februrary 18 ...&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>Al figures he's going to be a really big dog when he's full-grown. His best guess right now is 90+ pounds. </SPAN><SPAN></P></SPAN><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
