        <p><P>I'm actually working for a living this week! I'm teaching my 5-day Programming ASP.NET class to a packed room at Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus. It's been a pretty tough economy for those of us in the training business, but it certainly looks like things are picking up again.</P>
<P>I love coming to Silicon Valley. There's an invisible buzz of energy that permeates the area. It wouldn't at all be obvious to a casual visitor; the area looks like a giant suburb / industrial park. As you drive around, however, pay careful attention to the signs that adorn the buildings, and you'll see the names of virtually every technology company that you've ever heard of. Even Microsoft.[1]</P>
<P>After teaching for a full day, I'm totally burnt out. I have so much respect for folks who can teach a full day and go back to their hotel rooms and crank out code. As for me, I'm thankful to be able to stumble into a local restaurant, maybe visit a bookstore or Fry's, and collapse in a heap in my hotel room. I generally try to visit friends in the area as well, but this week I'm so fried that I'm probably not going to get around to doing that. </P>
<P>I also accepted the job of tech chair for the C++ and C# tracks at the DevConnections conference in Orlando, to be held October 27-30 this year. I'm putting together an awesome lineup of speakers for this conference. The C++ track could be the strongest lineup at a MS-centric C++ conference in years. There's so much going on in the C++ community. It's a shame that other, more trendy, languages have taken the spotlight away from C++. My goal is to try and reverse this unfortunate trend.</P>
<P>[1] I always wondered what it was like to be a Microsoftie living and working in the land that hates Microsoft. I jokingly posed this question to my students, asking if they needed to pretend at parties that they worked at a less inflammatory company like Sun ;) Their response was telling: lots of those same folks that hated Microsoft two years ago are now applying for jobs ... this area is definitely feeling some hard times!</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
