        <p><P>After publishing my <A href="fog0000000073.html">previous entry</A> on the cost of loop alignment for Pentium III-M processors, I decided to look at what the results would be for different architectures. Since I did all of my experiments using a model system that consisted of a bunch of inline assembler compiled using Visual C++, I could run the benchmark application unmodified on all of the different computers that I have lying around my house. <A href="../Files/Results.xls">This spreadsheet</A> summarizes all of the results for the following processors:</P>
<OL>
<LI>166MHz Pentium&nbsp;MMX 
<LI>150MHz Pentium Pro 
<LI>400MHz Celeron 
<LI>600MHz Celeron 
<LI>1130MHz Pentium III-M 
<LI>1200MHz Athlon 
<LI>1600MHz Pentium 4</LI></OL>
<P>All of the Intel P6 architecture processors (processors 2-5 on my list) share the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>No penalty if the target of a branch instruction is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary 
<LI>A one cycle penalty for the <EM>first</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched 
<LI>A one cycle penalty for the <EM>second </EM>additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched</LI></OL>
<P>The Intel P5 architecture processor (processor 1 on my list) has the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>No penalty if the target of a branch instruction is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary 
<LI>A half-cycle penalty for the <EM>first</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched 
<LI>No penalty for the <EM>second</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched</LI></OL>
<P>The Athlon architecture processor (processor 6 on my list) has the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>No penalty if the target of a branch instruction is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary 
<LI>A one cycle penalty for the <EM>first</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched 
<LI>No penalty for the <EM>second</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched</LI></OL>
<P>The Intel P7 architecture processor (processor 7 on my list) has the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>No penalty if the target of a branch instruction is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary 
<LI>No penalty for the <EM>first</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched 
<LI>No penalty for the <EM>second</EM> additional 16-byte paragraph that needs to be fetched</LI></OL>
<P>Clearly, all of the P6 architecture processors could benefit greatly from compiler optimizations that minimize the number of 16-byte paragraphs that a loop resides in. The P7 architecture processors are not sensitive to 16-byte alignment effects due to its new <A href="http://developer.intel.com/technology/itj/q12001/articles/art_2.htm">NetBurst architecture</A>. All of the instructions in our loops are executed directly from the Pentium 4's Trace Cache. The P5 and Athlon processors are somewhat less sensitive to 16-byte alignment effects since the 1 cycle penalty is paid on only the first additional 16 byte paragraph that is fetched from memory.</P>
<P>To run the benchmark software on your computer, <A href="../Files/AlignmentCost2.zip">click here</A> to download the source code. Note that you must do a debug build, otherwise you will mess up the code alignment of the inline assembly instructions.</P>
<P>Currently, the JIT in the CLR does not seem to optimize for the number of 16 byte paragraphs that a loop resides in. I have seen examples of non-debug JIT'ed x86 code that straddle a 16 byte paragraph boundary unnecessarily. This would be a very useful JIT optimization in future versions of the CLR since the P6 architecture processors are clearly the mainstream processors of today.</P>
<P>I should also point out that these are <EM>extremely </EM>contrived benchmarks. I am measuring very simple model systems in an effort to understand exactly how the CPU executes specific instruction sequences. The simple counter loop that I was using in these systems executes in two cycles. The padded counter loop executes in six cycles.&nbsp;A one cycle penalty is very large (50%, 18% respectively) in these systems. Your mileage will definitely vary in real-world systems.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
