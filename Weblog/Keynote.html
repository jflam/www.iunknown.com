        <p><P>My copy of <A href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</A> arrived today. I'm amazed that I ordered this software without even seeing a demo of it. So in some ways I was unsure of what to expect today. I have to report, however, that I'm totally blown away.</P>
<P>I'm a long-time <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/default.asp">PowerPoint</A> user. Since I pay my mortgage by teaching software developers, PowerPoint has been a central part of my life for a long time. I thought that there wasn't much left to do in the presentation space, and apparently so did Microsoft, since there hasn't been much in the way of new features in PowerPoint in a <EM>long</EM> time.</P>
<P>So when I got my copy of Keynote, I fired up the demo slide deck that ships with the product. I was totally amazed by the eye candy that awaited me. There were beautifully done 3D transitions, as well as incredibly fast alpha blending cross-fades and animation. The speed with which my TiBook could render a picture twirling in from stage left was breathtaking. </P>
<P>Now I realize that with great power comes great responsibility. I'm sure that these effects will be abused by a great many presenters (myself included) for a while before we calm down. But I think that if used creatively, these things will add quite a lot of sizzle to a presentation. </P>
<P>The stock templates that ship with Keynote are really pretty as well. They reflect the rendering power and storage that is available on modern laptops. The presentations created by Keynote are not small by any stretch (Presentation Tips.key weighs in at a hefty 11.2MB), but honestly who cares? </P>
<P>Probably the most important feature of Keynote (and this was why I ordered it sight unseen) is the fact that Keynote stores its content as XML documents. Keynote documents are really directories, and within those directories you will find all of the media files associated with your presentation, as well as the content of your presentation in a presentation.apxl file.</P>
<P>The cool thing about having my content in XML is the fact that I can auto-generate my slide decks from other sources. One example is extracting code frags from actual source code files, rather than have to manually cut and paste that code into my presentation software. </P>
<P>So far, I'm very happy with Keynote. I'll post more observations once I get more time to work with it.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
