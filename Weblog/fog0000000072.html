        <p><P>After a week of pure hell (which I would otherwise call corporate tax time), I have realized that I have severe context switch overhead from "business guy" to "geek". It's measured in days, not hours. It takes me days to psych myself up for the annual ritual, and it takes me days to "relinquish control" of my spreadsheets to my accountant (because my over analytical nature forces me to balance the numbers umpteen different ways). The actual job only takes maybe 10-15 hours ... ouch. Number one on my to-do list is to get a good book keeper. Next is probably a good house keeper, but that's an entirely different story ...</P>
<P>Anyhow, back to the business of geeking out. When I last wrote an entry in my web log, I was <A href="fog0000000069.html">praising the customer service that Intel provided</A>. I got an e-mail back from an Intel employee thanking me for my post. <EM>No problem!</EM> I think that it's rather unfortunate that we don't have a better mechanism for publishing real praise for companies that treat their customers well. There's a web site called <A href="http://www.epinions.com">Epinions</A> that attempts to do this by letting "ordinary folks" publish reviews of products in exchange for a piece of the action if people buy products based on their reviews. Unfortunately, like the customer review section that Amazon provides, that power can be used for <EM>evil</EM> as well as good.</P>
<P>One way to make this information available would be to write web log entries. If individual customers wrote their own web logs, <EM>and their content</EM> got syndicated to aggregators and made available via search engines, more of this hidden information would be made available, instead of being locked inside the company's customer feedback database. The fact that individuals write their own web logs would give the content decidedly more credibility than if it were packaged in a generic content aggregator such as an Epinions or an Amazon.</P>
<P>One product that promises to make this vision possible is Dave Winer's Radio 8.0 product. The concept of XML-syndication that lies at the heart of Radio is very interesting. About a year ago, I was well on my way to building some technology that makes this possible. I got all the way to getting several guys together in a room to decide on what the shareholder's agreement for the company would look like before I chickened out and realized that I didn't have any idea about how to run the business side of such a venture. That surely looked like a disaster waiting to happen. Besides, the .COM bust didn't make me want to start such a company in that kind of economic environment. Best of luck to Dave. I hope he has more of an idea about how to sell this technology than I do.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
