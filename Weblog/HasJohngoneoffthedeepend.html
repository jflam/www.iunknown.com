        <p><P><A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/">Sam Gentile</A> thinks that I might have gone off the deep end. First <A href="MerryChristmastome....html">I run off and buy a Mac</A>, next I decide that I need to <A href="Softwareco-operative.html">create my own software commune</A>. I'm fairly certain that Sam thinks I've become some kind of software hippy. He wonders how the Mac is going to impact my bottom line. That's a fair question; I'll try to address it in this entry.</P>
<P>As far as the bottom line is concerned, I've never been particularly motivated by money. That doesn't mean that I would turn down money that was offered to me, nor does it mean that I'm inexpensive to hire (I'm not). It simply means that the choices that I make are not <EM>primarily </EM>motivated by money. I've got more than enough money to maintain my lifestyle, so the rest of my time is spent on <A href="http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM">self-actualization</A>.</P>
<P>I firmly believe that I have spent too much time being influenced by one school of thought - the Windows / COM / C++ school of thought. I feel that this school <A href="Keepinganopenmind.html">colors into my thinking in certain ways</A>. Therefore, I have identified two areas that I want to investigate further. The first is how the Win32 API compares to Mac OS X as a client application development environment, and the second is whether dynamically typed languages really are more productive than the statically typed languages that I'm used to.</P>
<P>Mac OS X lets me spend time learning from folks who have a different solution to the same sets of problems that we try to solve in the Windows world. There are some really nice features in Cocoa, such as native rendering of documents in PostScript and a model-view-controller approach to building UI's.</P>
<P>Objective C has some elements of a dynamically typed language.&nbsp;I can send messages to arbitrary objects without knowing their types at compile time. This is a very different approach to programming than I'm used to, and it's great to see things from a different point of view. It's even more useful when you gain enough experience to be able to intelligently compare it with C++ and C#.[1] </P>
<P>A nice side effect of these investigations is that I am able to observe <EM>how </EM>I learn a new set of technologies. I think this feedback is extremely valuable in helping me improve my course materials for <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/seminars/training.aspx?courses=1&amp;id=3">my Programming ASP.NET class</A>. Too often, I forget what it is like to learn an entirely new technology like ASP.NET. These days I spend lots of time thinking about how to improve the learning process for my students.</P>
<P>My hope is that I become a better programmer after exploring these new horizons. Yes, I'm aware of the opportunity cost associated with these efforts, but I firmly believe that the opportunity cost of <EM>not</EM> investigating these technologies at this point in my career would be far, far greater. </P>
<P>[1] I don't think that I'm there yet, but I'm collecting a set of observations that I intend to write up in the future. </P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
