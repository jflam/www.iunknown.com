        <p><P>So I've been using my TiBook all afternoon. In no particular order, here are a few more observations / questions.</P>
<P>I spent a bunch of time running off of the battery to see how good the battery life is. I ran it for about 2 hours, but I didn't do anything particularly taxing on the machine. I spent a lot of time just reading stuff. The battery gauge still reported 2.5 hours of power remaining.</P>
<P>The boot time of the TiBook is not particularly impressive since&nbsp;I'm used to Windows XP boot speeds. On the other hand, I love how quickly it goes in and out of suspend mode. The glowing suspend light is also a nice touch.</P>
<P>I've been trying to get Entourage talking to my Exchange server. So far getting it to pick up email via IMAP4 has been a no-op. But getting Exchange to let me send email is another story. I've been stuck for the past hour or so with "SendAs permission denied" errors. I'm not entirely sure what that means, and have been tweaking ACL's on my Exchange server with no success.</P>
<P>I found <A href="http://www.macnn.com/news.php?id=16327">this link to an article on MacNN</A>, which seems to indicate that MS will support Exchange from Entourage sometime in the future. It can't be too soon for me ...</P>
<P>I'm getting used to the font smoothing on OS X. It's not ClearType, but your eyes do adjust. What I have realized is that ClearType does an incredible job with small font sizes. With OS X, you simply cannot turn on font smoothing for small font sizes&nbsp;since it makes the fonts <EM>much </EM>harder to read.</P>
<P>I'm using Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection utility to manage my other Windows PC's. So far it has worked just as good as the RDC on XP.</P>
<P>I downloaded the Apple Developer tools this afternoon. I've installed them, but haven't had a chance to try writing Hello, World yet. Hopefully tomorrow sometime after I recover from New Years.</P>
<P>I figured out the problem with MSN Messenger 3.0 on OS X - it doesn't have the same defaults as MSN Messenger 5.0 on XP. I now have my contacts organized by category again.</P>
<P>I'm (slowly) learning the keyboard shortcuts on OS X. Does anyone know if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is possible to run the menus via the keyboard, much like I can under Windows?</P>
<P>I adjusted my monitor's gamma to be 2.2 just like Windows. I'm doing this so that any images I manipulate on my TiBook will look the same way that they do to Windows users. Is this what other Mac folks do as well? Or do they stick to 1.8?</P>
<P>I took a quick peek at iPhoto. So far I'm really liking the way the UI works, particularly for assigning categories to individual photographs. I'll see how it does when I copy the rest of my photos over to my TiBook.</P>
<P>I managed to connect to my Windows boxes using SMB earlier. That was a very painless process. I simply connected, and added my windows logon to my OS X key chain. </P>
<P>While doing my  SMB experiments, I noticed something interesting. When I've got my AirPort card enabled AND I am also plugged into my wired Ethernet network, OS X does NOT automatically select the fastest connection. Windows XP does do a better job in this area. However, if I disable my AirPort card, OS X will use the wired connection just fine.</P>
<P>I'm now copying all of my photos over to my TiBook. That's about 4.5GB of data. One thing that is really nice is that Finder sets up for copying large numbers of files MUCH better than Explorer does in XP. I abandoned file copying using Explorer under Windows a long time ago in favor of Robocopy.</P>
<P>Well, it's almost time to head out for New Years.&nbsp;I hope all of you out there have a safe and happy New Year!</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
