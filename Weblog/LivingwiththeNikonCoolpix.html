        <p><P>I've now shot over 1700 pictures using our Nikon Coolpix 5700, some under rather challenging conditions. I'm writing this to highlight some of the things that I have learned about the idiosyncracies of the Coolpix 5700.</P>
<P>First off, the zoom is excellent. It's a 280mm equivalent zoom, which is quite useful for most kinds of photography. It's more than enough zoom to significantly collapse perspective, which can create shots like this </P><SPAN><IMG height=480 alt=[Image] hspace=4 src="../Images/north_vancouver.jpg" width=640 align=left border=0 cd:pos="2"><BR clear=all></SPAN>
<P>On this trip, I was hoping to capture some magnificent sunsets in Alaska. So I wanted to purchase some graduated neutral density filters. This was when I discovered that Nikon has no "official" solution to attaching filters to your lens! None of the Nikon dealers that I visited in Vancouver could provide me with a solution. After a bit of searching on the Internet, I discovered that there is someone who is selling an adapter. I couldn't get one shipped to me before I embarked on our cruise, so this was the best that I could do: </P><SPAN><IMG height=480 alt=[Image] hspace=4 src="../Images/alaska_sunset.jpg" width=640 align=left border=0 cd:pos="2"><BR clear=all></SPAN>
<P>I also tried out the Nikon 1.5x teleconverter. This would convert my 280mm equivalent zoom to a 420mm. Unfortunately for me, I balked at buying the teleconverter, and bought a remote shutter release instead. This is why my best shot of wild sea otters in Alaska looks like this:</P><SPAN><IMG height=480 alt=[Image] hspace=4 src="../Images/sea_otter.jpg" width=640 align=left border=0 cd:pos="2"><BR clear=all></SPAN>
<P>Now here's a number of things that are I find annoying about the Coolpix 5700:</P>
<P>1) The positioning of the controls on the left hand side of the lens body. I find that I accidently hit these controls, particularly when composing shots on a tripod. The worst offender is the button that selects the image size. Why this is present as its own button and not as a menu option is beyond me. This button would be far better served as a toggle through the white balance settings on the camera. Hitting this button accidently and setting the camera into Hi mode has cost me at least two really great pictures. It takes a <EM>long</EM> time to write a Hi image out to the CF card.</P>
<P>2) The fact that you can't go into BSS (Best Shot Selector) mode if you've got Noise Reduction enabled. I find that I frequently go from one or the other when I'm passing through the threshold of 1/4 second exposures into slower shutter speeds. </P>
<P>3) The fact that you have use the menu to measure middle-grey to set the white balance of the camera. A shortcut button here would be really useful.</P>
<P>4) Why isn't the quick action mode enabled by default in the camera? This is the mode that significantly reduces shutter lag in the camera. It took me weeks to find this setting in the manual (and it took reading the brochure to discover this feature even existed!).</P>
<P>5) Why isn't the manual for the Coolpix 5700 available for download on the web? I left my paper manual at home, and couldn't download a new copy like I could for my venerable Coolpix 950.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
