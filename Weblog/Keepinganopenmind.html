        <p><P>I'm writing this piece after my family has gone to bed on Christmas eve. I'm in a rather reflective mood, so I thought that I'd take a moment to look back over the previous year. </P>
<P>Earlier this week, I noticed that Dan Dunham has written a number of interesting pieces on his <A href="http://coding.strangesearch.net">StrangeCoding weblog</A> which reflect back upon lessons that he has learned in the previous year. I loved the idea (and his entries), so I thought I'd contribute my $.02 here.</P>
<P>The most important thing that I learned this year was the importance of always keeping an open mind. While this should be obvious, it certainly wasn't obvious to me earlier this year. Let me explain.</P>
<P>For the past few years, I was a COM/C++ dev who (naturally) switched to being&nbsp;a CLR/C# dev. Both of those two communities that I belong to are highly Microsoft-centric. They, like any other type of community, tend to be self-referential. Folks that hang out in those communities tend to have similar opinions, and tend to exclude folks who have different opinions (perhaps not intentionally, but the net effect is the same - folks with different opinions tire of the fight and move elsewhere). </P>
<P>My participation in those communities shaped much of my world-view on software development. I submit as an example <A href="fog0000000099.html">my belief in the superiority of strongly typed languages</A>. I was responding to a piece that <A href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">Dave McCusker</A> wrote that was <A href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newFeb02.htm#06feb02-box">critical of strong typing </A>(and by extension to WSDL, but I won't go there right now). In the spirit of Sam Gentile's <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/stories/2002/12/21/comInteropNotFundamentallyFlawedButHard.html">recent public retraction</A> on his strongly worded statement about <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/stories/2002/06/08/isComInteropFundamentallyFlawed.html">COM interop being fundamentally broken</A>, I would like to say that I now realize how wrong I was to believe that strongly typed languages were <EM>inherently </EM>superior. Dave is quite correct in asserting that strongly typed languages can be viewed as a crutch. I also realize that I <A href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newFeb02.htm#09feb02">had offended Dave with my strongly worded biases</A>. For that I would like to publicly apologize.</P>
<P>One thing that has really helped me in my personal development this year are some friends who live outside of those communities. They tend to poke and prod me at different times to try and think differently. I am rather stubborn though, and have successfully resisted their efforts until this year. Fortunately for me, this year has probably been one of the most important years of my professional development, and this was all due to a few key events.</P>
<P>The first event happened about a year ago, was when I first got my method interception prototype up and running for the CLR. That lead me on a several-month long trip into the Aspect-Oriented Programming community, which culminated in my presentation of my work at <A href="HellofromAOSD2002.html">the AOSD 2002 conference</A>. I learned a lot of interesting lessons by participating in that community. I learned about the problem space that AOP was trying to solve. I subsequently got very excited over the prospects of AOP as a general-purpose software development technique. And and then there was the eventual letdown when I realized that the development world probably isn't ready to handle that level of abstraction. It was an interesting roller-coaster ride emotionally, but one that I would do again because of the lessons that I had learned by taking it. I met a lot of really smart people in both the AOP and the <A href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/Ip/">Intentional Programming</A> worlds, and am <EM>so much more better off</EM>&nbsp;because of these experiences.</P>
<P>The second event happened a few months ago, <A href="Whenlessismore.html">when a friend convinced me that code-generation was actually a good thing</A>. My experience with "wizards" in VC++ had almost convinced me otherwise, but by keeping an open mind, I was able to generate some very interesting software using my code generation tools. I am <A href="Livingwithcodegeneration.html">now a convert to code generation</A> as a means of <EM>manageably</EM> working at higher levels of abstraction. It's not applicable everywhere, but it is extremely useful in certain types of projects, much like Yacc / Bison&nbsp;and <A href="TerenceParrrocks.html">ANTLR</A> are extremely useful tools whenever you need to do lexical parsing.</P>
<P>The third event hopefully begins sometime late this week or early next week when my beauty new <A href="MerryChristmastome....html">TiBook G4 867</A> arrives. This marks the beginning of my foray into an entirely new world of Mac OS X, and the Objective C programming language. My primary goal in getting the TiBook is to learn how the Mac community thinks about software development, and how it differs from the way the Windows community thinks about software development.&nbsp;I think it will be a great experience, and am chomping at the bit to further expand my software horizons.</P>
<P>Finally, for anyone who has actually read all the way down to the end of this rambling self-reflection essay, I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and I hope you all have a great holiday beholden with many cool geek presents (I just got this great binary clock from the fine folks at <A href="http://www.wintellect.com">Wintellect</A>)! And I hope that my experiences might convince some of you to try something radically different this upcoming year. If so, I'd love to hear about it!</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
