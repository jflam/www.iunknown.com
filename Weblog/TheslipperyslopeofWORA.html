        <p><P>On my drive over to the Sun Tech Days presentation in Toronto, an idea kept rattling around in my head: Sun cares a lot about WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). During the sessions that I attended, one of the things that Sun speakers stressed over and over again was the need for portability across different EJB containers. The question that I don't see addressed very often is: <EM>why does Sun care about portability</EM>? </P>
<P>The answer to this question isn't immediately obvious. After all, Sun is a <EM>hardware</EM> company that doesn't appear to make money directly from its Java technology suite. Java, however, is the technology that brought Sun into the forefront of public / developer consciousness. So I believe the question really is one of how Sun can turn Java mind share into hardware profits. </P>
<P>The answer to this question is that Sun wants Java applications to run on Sun hardware. In order to make that a reality, Java must be portable, otherwise there would be too much friction involved in migrating an application from one hardware / container platform to Sun's. By adopting this strategy, they have effectively tied the future of Sun to the idea that folks could develop Java code on their existing hardware, but that eventually, someday, those folks would reach into their checkbook and buy some Sun hardware. </P>
<P>While this is not necessarily a bad strategy, I think its a <EM>horrible</EM> strategy for Sun. Java portability is a double-edged sword that lets folks switch to Sun hardware, but it also makes it possible for folks to switch <EM>away </EM>from Sun hardware. The only way that this strategy can work effectively in the long term is if Sun can outperform the competition in price / performance. </P>
<P>I really don't see how this is possible, as&nbsp;Sun builds and sells proprietary hardware. Their hardware commands a considerable price premium over competitor's products today. In fact, no Sun hardware can be found in the top 10 results for TPC-C <A href="http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_perf_results.asp">raw performance</A> or <A href="http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_price_perf_results.asp">price/performance</A>.&nbsp;This premium is likely to continue to exist in the future because they lack the economies of scale that are available to the competition. Unless Sun can turn this around, it is likely that businesses will exploit Java's portability to switch <EM>away </EM>from Sun hardware. </P>
<P>As applications continue to migrate towards Web Services, things will only get worse for Sun since Web Services are yet another technology that make it easier for businesses to switch to the platform that provides best price / performance. It is unclear what that platform might be long term, but Sun faces some really serious competition in that space. </P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
