        <p><P>My recent article on generative programming titled <A href="Whenlessismore.html">"When less is more"</A> attracted a <EM>lot </EM>of attention. Since I got email within minutes of posting the article (sorry, no comments on my blog right now[1]) I decided to take a closer look at my server logs.[2]</P>
<P>One of the first posts was on Chris Sells' <A href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=306&amp;ixReplies=3">mini-slashdot page</A>. In his comments, Chris wondered why I missed his extensive writing on the topic. The problem is that I always remembered Gen&lt;X&gt; as "Wizard King" (Chris' original name for the product). Because of that original bias, I was unable to see past it in <EM>any</EM> of Chris' <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/GenProg/default.aspx">subsequent writing</A> on the topic. Chris didn't do me any favors by subtitling the piece "Modern Techniques to Automate Repetitive Programming Tasks". To me, that sounds like a wizard.</P>
<P>Shawn Wildermuth <A href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2242">wrote about his own epiphany</A> on generative programming. This leads me to question whether Reflection-like services are really useful in any contexts other than writing cool tools like <A href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</A>&nbsp;(recently updated to support the Beta of 1.1) and implementing low-performance serialization services ;)</P>
<P>Joe Gregorio noticed parallels between my article and his article on <A href="http://bitworking.org/stories/2002/02/09/languagecentricSoftwareDevelopment.html">Language-Centric Software Development</A>&nbsp;where he advocates programming closer to the problem domain. Because of that link, I'm now using Joe's most excellent <A href="http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html">Aggie RSS feed aggregator</A>.</P>
<P><A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105897/">Andres Aguiar</A> also read my post. What was intriguing about his post was that he said that he has been "doing code-generation tools for over 10 years". As it turns out, Andres is the product manager of <A href="http://www.deklarit.com/hdkoverview.html">DeKlarit</A>, which is a <EM>very </EM>interesting code generator that Mike Iem at MS originally turned me onto earlier this year.</P>
<P>Danno Ferrin accuses me of doing some "<A href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/shemnon/20021101">sneaky AOP talk</A>" ;) I'm not convinced that AOP is the right tool for building higher level abstractions, due to a nasty Pandora's box that it could unlock. Much of my current thinking can be found in <A href="../Files/Intro_to_AOP.ppt">this Powerpoint slide deck</A> from my AOP talk at <A href="http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/default.asp">WinDev</A> this year.</P>
<P><A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/2002/10/31.html">Scott Hanselman</A> points out the fact that code generation is "on the collective consciousness" these days. I would definitely agree. </P>
<P>What Scott also indirectly points out is the danger of self-referential groups. I've spent most of my recent programming career in the Windows/C++ camp. This has caused me to have blinders on that prevented me from seriously looking at technologies that didn't originate from MS or that didn't involve C++. I'm now taking a public vow to change my behavior and keep an open mind to all technologies. And to look at them not from just a purely technical perspective, but from a pragmatic one: does this technology help me do my job better?</P>
<P>[1]&nbsp;I was using <A href="http://www.enetation.co.uk/">enetation</A>, but they were so flaky that I found it was better to have no comments than to have all requests for pages on my server stall because their servers were wedged.</P>
<P>[2] I use an <A href="http://www.analog.cx/">open source log analyzer tool called Analog</A>.&nbsp;It does a good job analyzing referrer logs, and I discovered lots of folks who wrote about my article. </P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
