        <p><P>I had a fun time at Win-Dev last week. As always, the attendees were really great, and asked lots of insightful questions at my presentations.</P>
<P>This year's Win-Dev was supposed to be the coming out party for <A href="HellofromAOSD2002.html">CLAW</A>. However, most of my cycles recently have been taken up working on a new commercial software venture (it also explains my low frequency post rate on this weblog). Therefore, I was forced to show a much earlier version of CLAW than the one that is currently sitting in bits and pieces on my hard drive. </P>
<P>The challenge at Win-Dev was to get that old version of CLAW working well enough to run on a machine other than my laptop. The reason for this was that, unknown to the attendees, there was going to be a hands-on lab where they would write their own aspects using CLAW. On Thursday night, I enlisted the help of <A href="http://www.dotnetremoting.cc/DotNetCentric/">Ingo Rammer</A> and <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/">Sam Gentile</A>. We stayed up pretty late in my hotel room complaining about various things that we hated in the CLR before we finally got around to getting the code up and running on another machine. </P>
<P>Thankfully, Sam volunteered his laptop for the evisceration that is known as installing CLAW. After about 30 minutes or so of "doh! I need to do ..." I managed to get an install script up and running that would install CLAW on his laptop. I then proceeded to kick them out of my room and then stayed up for a few more hours working on the actual labs.</P>
<P>Normally, I take pride in my ability to figure out problems on the fly. However, when we got to the room where we were going to run the labs, we were stymied by network configuration issues. We never did get any of the labs distributed to the student boxes. I instead demo'd all of the labs for the students on my machine. Hopefully they weren't horribly disappointed by this. My apologies go out to all who attended. </P>
<P>As promised, I'm making my Win-Dev slide decks available to those who want them. Here are the decks:</P>
