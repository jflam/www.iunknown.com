        <div class="entryDate">2002-08-25</div>
        <p><P>I recently began exploring photography as a creative outlet, and I stumbled across <A href="http://www.mountainlight.com/rowell.gr.html">Galen Rowell's</A>&nbsp;most excellent <A href="http://www.mountainlight.com/bookcoverpages/book_innergame.html">Inner Game of Outdoor Photography</A> while browsing in my local Chapters bookstore. The moment I began reading the preface to his book, I knew that I had found someone really, really&nbsp;special. As I continued to read each one of the sixty-five essays in this book, the words and the images spoke to a part of me like nothing that I had ever read before.</P>
<P>I wondered why I felt so strongly drawn towards photography. As I learned more and more about the subject and its practioners, I realized that photography shares much in common with music and computer science. On one hand, it requires absolute mastery of technical information. Well-defined procedures must be precisely executed to get the desired results. But perfect execution is not nearly enough; each one of these disciplines also requires a considerable amount of abstract thought. We also speak of beautifully composed photographs, of musical music, of elegant software. </P>
<P>Which brings me to the point of this entry: like many others, I never met Galen Rowell. I learned of his untimely death while flying home from our honeymoon. Carolyn was reading the Globe and Mail, and the obituary section featured a photograph of Galen standing next to his most famous photograph: that of the rainbow striking the Dalai Lama's Potala palace. At that moment, I was suddenly struck by a sense of loss unlike any that I had felt before for someone that I never met. To say that his photographs and his writings have changed my life is an understatement. Galen taught me how to ask the question:&nbsp;"Which life experiences are the most worth living?"</P>
<P>My condolences go out to those who loved Galen and his wife Barbara, as well as Tom Reid and Carol McAfee who were also on board their plane that crashed during their&nbsp;final approach to Bishop airport in California. To paraphrase Norbu Tsering who wrote a heartfelt passage <A href="http://www.mountainlight.com/guestbook.html">in their guest book</A>: <EM>Heaven needs beautiful people too.</EM></P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
