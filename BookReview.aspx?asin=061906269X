                <span id="Label1">Database Systems: Design, Implementation, and Management, Fifth Edition takes you clearly and effectively through the entire process of database development and implementation.  The most comprehensive and detailed coverage of database basics is complemented with ample exercises and problems at the end of each chapter to encourage hands-on learning, and a two-chapter step-by-step running case.  Because the Internet has become so firmly established as an extension of the everyday business data environment, this revised edition contains two new chapters, "Databases in Electronic Commerce" and "Web Database Development," that stress the need for solid planning and management in order to maximize the resources that the Internet provides.</span>

                    <span>Great text book, but like all students I was looking for the cheapest price tag. I got the international edition for half the price, however, I discovered that it was missing pages, though the cover claims that it has the exact same content as US Edition. It is also missing a CD. The US Edition comes with 2 CD's including the SQL Server CD, which the international edition doesn't come with.
<br />Unless you have a friend from whom you can copy the missing pages, hopefully if you discovered them early enough before an exam or homework, and the CD, you're better off paying the $120+ price tag for a US edition.</span>

                    <span>This book is top notch...I've read many DB design books, but this one took the cake..When I took my database design class at my university, the professor was great, but the book was even BETTER!!!! I never knew about "normalizing data" until I saw this book and took the class!!! The theory, concepts, examples, and illustrations are 5-star quality!! I still use this book today, and its more than a year passed now, when I need to look up or refresh myself on a concept...Excellent learning tool, as well as a great reference for DB design....Only one problem, the book is "big" in size!!! Get it IF you can!!!</span>

                    <span>If you are taking a college level course in the fundamentals of database design and you are having a hard time understanding what your professor is talking about, then this textbook is a must.  Your professor might cover the topics in a difference sequence, but you could very easily find your way around in this textbook.  It covers all the basics of relational design (which is the topic most colleges teach) in an excellent manner.   It is full of textual examples coupled with graphical representations.  No need to get the latest edition.  Even an older one would do.  Have fun with databases.</span>

                    <span>First let me just say I liked this book. Why? Because it is a pretty IT book with useful and informative color screenshots and illustrations that are explanatory. It is of course both fortunate and unfortunate that the author uses screenshots of MS Access databases almost exclusively.<p>I do wish the author had spent more time discussing web-database application integration. Also, he only used Coldfusion (the most expensive variety) to illustrate web-database interactivity. This is great for learning some basic Coldfusion tagging, but how about something useful for small-time web hosters and others who want to use PHP, which is not only free but more powerful than Coldfusion. Ah well.<p>This book is very large in height - you'll see what I mean when you pick it up. The sections on ER diagramming, SQL, normalization, and design are top notch. However when the book gets into the later chapters, and covers more difficult subjects such as distributed database apps, transactional databases and Internet-related topics the coverage becomes a little weak. He does give a fine overview of all the topics presented however and the book is not totally boring to read either. The author is very lucid.<p>I recommend this book as an introductory text on databases but nothing more.</span>

                    <span>At over 800 pages, it is short compared to other texts but isn't short on information. The text and database concepts are easy to understand and contain many end-of-chapter review questions to test your understanding. Lost of colorful charts, screen captures, and diagrams eases the learning curve. The concepts are applicable to most database systems in use today.</span>
