With this remarkable atlas of marketing surveys, you can make a case for almost anything. If you can eat it, read it, visit it, watch it, play with it or listen to it, chances are it has been a survey subject, and this reference work has some fun with it. The first section is an array of clever and sometimes outlandish comparisons. The second half offers what's-hot, what's-not profiles of the nation's 209 consumer markets.</span>

                    <span>This is a fun book, great entertainment (I was laughing like crazy when I was looking through it at the bookstore). The main reason I bought it was because my husband and I plan to move within the year, and I thought the book would be a good resource for helping us choose where to live--it is!<P>The book uses the 213 American consumer markets--the way the market research folks have sectioned off the country by consumer trends. For example, there's Northern Maine, Central Maine, Southern Maine/Vermont, about 12 sections in Calfornia, New Mexico is all one, and about 10 in Florida.<P>The first half of the book is maps with the sections color coded as to inhabitants' preferences for things like: fresh croissants vs. white bread, bagels, twinkies, books vs. tv, owners of power tools, owners of personal computers, cats, dogs, different kinds of cars, political leanings, what they watch on tv, what kind of car they drive, et cetera. There are 87 maps and 11 categories (eg Food, Sports, Cars, Television). Each map includes a commentary so we can learn why exactly snack nuts are much more popular north of the Mason-Dixon line and The Simpsons are more popular in the West.<P>The second half of the book highlights each of the 213 sections (half a page for each), telling what's hot and what's not, along with commentary on the general mood of the place,and statistics about socioeconomic makeup, median income and house price.<P>The consumer market designated as Seattle-Tacoma, Washington (actually most of the Western half of the state), is described (in part) thusly: "Locals have the money to enjoy the 'good life': traveling abroad, enjoying gourmet cuisine--especially espresso from numerous coffee bars--and investing in stock, bonds, and real estate at some of the highest rates in the nation."<P>For Bangor, Maine (which includes the central portion of the state), the author says, "The sterotypical New Englander--aloof, curt, idiosyncratic--is what you'll find in Bangor. Many are independent-minded professionals, retirees, and assorted blue-collar workers who keep to themselves."<P>The book also serves as a kind of armchair traveler--or a guidebook in knowing what to expect of the natives when traveling through the U.S. All in all, LATITUDES AND ATTITUDES is an entertaining way to learn more about the people of America--or to help choose a new place to live!<P>(and yes, we are now very happy in our new home state of Oregon :)<P>Kimberly Borrowdale - Under the Covers Book Reviews</span>

                    <span>Michael Weiss's earlier book, The Clustering of America, was a very enlighting look on the social settings of America. It was tops, but he even did one better with LATITUDES & ATTITUDES. I have walls covered with books but this is one of the most coveted books of my guests once they open it. It is a reference book that you return to over and over. Bless Michael and all his loved ones!</span>

                    <span>This book is fun to flip through, but it's absolutely useless as a research tool, or for anything more than a quick laugh. The main reason for this is that it has no key. The same map of the 209 market areas is used on each page, but the different areas of the map are not identified. Say you've noticed that a small region in the deep south seems to have different "attitudes" than any of the other regions around it, and you want to look up the profile for this region to find out more about it. To do this, you have to guess approximately where in the country the area is (there are no state boundary lines on the map), go to your atlas and figure out which cities are in that general area, and then look in the profiles in the back, which are arranged alphabetically by metropolitan name. The only way to be sure that you've found the right region is to compare the shape of the area to the one on the map. This can be frustrating, especially since there are a couple of regions that have no profiles in the back of the book (I can only assume they were included as deliberate errors to protect the copyright of the maps).

In addition, the book doesn't give any actual numbers; it usually indicates whether a given region has above or below average consumption of a particular product, but doesn't say what the average consumption of that product is.

I understand why the given regions were used (they're the ones marketing analysts use), but for information about the large metropolitan centers of the west this book is pretty useless. Every little town in the southeast has it's own profile, while the LA region includes most of southern California.

Finally, some of the profiles in the back, especially the lists of "what's hot" and "what's not" don't appear to reflect the information given in the maps.

In short, this book is ultimately frustrating if you want to analyze the given information, even casually</span>
