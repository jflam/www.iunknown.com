                <span id="Label1">Focusing on Visual Basic 6's new data-access resources, <I>Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Basic and SQL Server</I> is the definitive guide to Microsoft's database development tools. If you're concerned with creating a way for a Visual Basic application or control to talk to an SQL Server back end, this book most likely has the answers you need.<p> Microsoft has six major SQL interface solutions: Visual Basic SQL (VBSQL), Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), Data Access Objects (DAO)/Jet, DAO/ODBCDirect, Remote Data Objects (RDO), and ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). William Vaughn covers all of them in this book, plus the low-level SQL Server interfaces. He includes quite a lot of sample code (in the text and on the companion CD-ROM) that shows how different access mechanisms open connections, perform queries, and return values. Sidebars and other supplementary nuggets of text use the first person to great effect--they enable Vaughn to share his considerable experience in a straightforward way.<p> ADO, the apparent replacement for most of Microsoft's other database-access technologies, receives especially lavish treatment. The author details each part of an ADO-facilitated transaction, and goes into depth on how to build custom ADO objects and how (and whether) to convert from RDO to ADO.<p> If yours is a Microsoft shop, this book will prove invaluable in connecting people to the data they need. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>The terrible thing about on-line reviews is that often times very happy readers don't write them. So I thought, it was about time I did.<P>I've purchased that last three editions of Bill's book. Why? Because simply put, 'It is the best book on Microsoft data access technologies available for VB developers'. It focuses on one back-end, SQL Server, and the multitude of API's available.<P>The irreverent tone which some people find 'offensive', IMHO, simply adds character to an industry which at times really needs it. The code samples which I retrieved from the CD, always make getting up to speed quick and easy. Having heard Bill speak at VBITS and spoken to him, he is always trying to provide VB developers with the best information.<P>The seven detailed chapters on ADO are well worth your money even if you have the previous editions; not to mention the details on the T-SQL debugger in its own chapter. Also, even if this is your first purchase, the previous edition's chapters on VBSQL and ODBC are still included on the CD! For many of us, ODBC still has a place in our development lives.<P>The code Bill gives you is designed to focus on data access. If you need help with VB skills or UI design look elsewhere. But if you want down and dirty code focused on how to get to SQL Server, buy this book.</span>

                    <span>This book in a nutshell is horrible. I don't know what some of these other guys in the ratings are talking about...maybe they work for MS..who knows. They might as well call this book RDO VB5 and SQL Server 7..its out of date. The jokes vaughn makes (which is the whole book) are boring...you'd fall asleep after the first chapter. To make things worse...there is absolutely no pictures showing steps or a procedure to follow to create examples..its straight through boring text. A lot of this stuff barely works since at the time ADO was being worked on a bit more. There is NOT enough information on bounding data to VB from SQL Server. Do not waste your money....this book royally stinx!!!!</span>

                    <span>This is not a bad book, but it is long out of date. If you're getting it to learn how to use ADO to connect to SQL Server 2000, like me while not totally useless I found most of the book dated. I would say I found only a few chapters that were relevant and then again even those were dated. If you want Vaughn go with his "ADO Examples and Best Practices" which is more up to date and is beautifully written and organised. But this book will do the trick, particularly if you have other supplemental books. I probably wouldn't buy it though if I had to do it again.</span>

                    <span>I was hoping for a HOW-TO type of book and thought it would be. It is not a HOW-TO type of book. This book is a discussion about the various ways that VB can attach to a database and why to use those particular avenues. The first 2/3 of the book is a leading up to ADO but once you are there, the how-to part is NOT.</span>

                    <span>This book will someday be a great show on PBS. But as far as learning VB and SQLS dont buy it. After several hundred pages of recent history I finally got to the reason I bought the book. On about page 800 and something the author finally talks about using an ADO Datagrid to SQL-S. Unfortunately he never goes beyond a simple example using the Data Object Wizard. I'm still looking and out $40.</span>
