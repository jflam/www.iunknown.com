                    <span>I was very glad to have waited for the 2nd edition of this resource kit. $59.99 for 1600 pages is makes this a good value. As others have said, this "kit" covers it all from desktop configuration to deployment. The step by step procedures are excellent and written very much like my favorite manuals the Admin Pocket Consultants. I would also recommend Windows XP Professional Administrator's Pocket Consultant 2nd Edition. At $29.99 and 550 pages its also a good value.

                    <span>I was duped into buying the first edition - and can therefore fully understand anyone's "once bitten, twice shy" feelings towards this RSK.  Put your fears aside, this edition delivers exactly what you would expect.  Practically re-written from the ground up, and packed with additional utilities, this edition is well worth the purchase.</span>

                    <span>I found this book incredibly useful.  It was the right balance of depth and breadth.  This book is particularly useful for two groups of people:<p>1)  If you're part of a Windows XP rollout team for your company, your team needs this book.<br>2)  If you're going to be supporting users who are using Windows XP, this book is critical to your success.<p>Detailed, thorough, and well organized.  Definitely choose this one over the older version, "Windows XP Documentation," also from Microsoft.</span>

                    <span>Usually when a book is release as a 2nd or 3rd edition, the publisher is just updating the content to reflect the new features or releases of the software. This book is just that and a little bit more.<p> <p>This book takes apart the XP operating system from stem to stern and everything in between.  Taking it from the deployment to remote users to desktop configuration.  In most case that would be enough, but here's where the book is updated.<p> <p>Adding over 200 pages on security, you will find that book is far more than a Resource kit, it may also be used as a study guide for the 70-270 exam.<p> <p>The cd was also updated with over 120 utilities and a couple of e-books, including the entire text in e-book format. Another thing I liked about the text is that throughout the book there are step by step procedures to show you hoe to configure, manage or administrate different parts of the OS.<p> <p>Overall I have been able to use this in my job several times within the past 2 months with the XP upgrade I was involved in. I am certainly glad to have this in my technical library.</span>
