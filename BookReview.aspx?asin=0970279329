Written by a former non-fan whose kid got into the game, Snot Bubbles will teach you what "yardage" is, why who does what when, and what it all means. Catch up with the "know-it-alls" of the game and sound intelligent. Maybe it will earn you some beer and popcorn!<P>At the very least, you will laugh yourself silly at all the antics you finally understand. Then you can go shopping.</span>

                    <span>Helma Clark successfully conquers and delivers the elements of football, describing her view of the subject through the lens of a fanatical sports mom and an inveterate high-end shopper. Even if you know nothing about football, you will laugh out loud at her unique take on this previously all-male domain. A great pre-Super Bowl stocking stuffer.</span>

                    <span>This book is a MUST for those of you who are (a) a mother, (b) a wife, (c) a sister, or (d) a girlfriend of a football player or fan. If you have ever been confused about some rule or infraction of the game, read this book. As a cheerleader and sister and daughter, i have found that reading this book has not only helped in my comprehension of football, but I impress many of my hard-core guy football friends with my endless knowledge of the game. I'm a hit at every Superbowl party. Though football can be very confusing for the average female spectator, reading this comprehensive book will definately help.</span>

                    <span>I never understood what was going on at football games until I read this book!! It uses funny analogies to explain plays and the pictures are very helpful. For anyone who wants to understand football jargon, this is the book for you!!! I actually watched the superbowl this year and understood what was going on!!!!</span>
