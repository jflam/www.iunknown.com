                    <span>	The author of E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation, David Bodanis, has a writing style that is both engaging and informative. Not only does Bodanis manage to thoroughly explain the equation E=mc2 in a straightforward matter, but he also explains the history, and the results, of the equation itself. All the terms of the equation, energy, the equal sign, celeritas, and even squared, are described. The development of the equation and its various results are explained as well: the discovery of the atom, the details of the Bomb Race of World War Two, and the theory of black holes and stars. Bodanis felt the need to write this story because, "Everyone knows that E=mc2 is really important, but they usually don't know what it means...There are plenty of books that try to explain it, but who can honestly say they understand them?" This book is worth a read if you're interested in learning what E=mc2 really means, and don't want to become bored. Bodanis has taken a different approach to the equation; he doesn't write about the theory of relativity or Einstein, but writes about the equation itself.</span>

                    <span>A lot of my favorite books address a subject that I am aware of but unfamiliar with.  When one of these books is done well, it ends up being a great reading experience where the pages keep turning and you come to understand an important topic of which you previously had no real comprehension.
<br />
<br />E=mc2 is just such a book.  Bodanis approaches the topic with the layperson in mind and tells a really interesting story about the history of each character (including the equal sign) in the equation and finishes with a truely gripping, instant by instant description of the first milliseconds of the first atomic bomb detonating over Hiroshima.
<br />
<br />You finish the book with new understanding and with a new respect for the power held in this simple equation.  Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in understanding the meaning behind the equation they've heard a thousand times.</span>

                    <span>I'm one of those people who enjoys knowing how things work.  I loved physics in college.  Although I didn't choose to further my studies in physics formally, I have continued to read texts and treatises on the subject.  THIS is one of the best books you can read to start you off.  
<br />While it is a bit simple with regards to the actual physics concepts, the history (another subject I enjoy immensely) is extremely interesting, and it puts the subject into perspective.  It also offers the opportunity to begin a basic understanding of how Newtonian physics and relativity both play a part in our lives.
<br />This book isn't about formulas or complicated diagrams.  It's a lot of fun to read, and if your knowledge of physics is cursory, you'll get a lot out of it.</span>

                    <span>In this book, the first truly comprehensive history of the world's most famous equation, Davis Bodanis does more than just write a biography--he tells one heck of a story. 
<br />This book encompasses all parts of the equation--energy, mass, and so forth--along with a history of the equation itself. He writes in such a way that is is acessible to everyone, even a person, like me, who just happens to be in ninth grade. It is a truly wonderful book largely because of how he writes it. He talks about the race to develop a bomb after the equation was developed, the controversy surrounding those who helped it to develop, and the suspense that is present in every day history. At the same time, he also writes about scientific fact in a clear, engaging style. If you're looking for an interesting book about the equation everyone knows and no one understands, look no further! This is the book for you.  </span>

<br />
<br />  To write such a readible book on such a complicated subject is no mean feat.Bodanis has pulled it off in spades.
<br />  One should not shy away from this book because they might think it is too difficult for them to understand.Even though I finished studying engineering 40 years ago;I found it a very easy read,and anyone with a High School background would have no trouble with it.
<br />  Bodanis shows how a handful of scientists discovered the source of energy and how mankind could use it;all in a short span of about 25 years.Even with the great advancement we have already seen we are only at the beginning of learning what the universe is all about and what still awaits mankind in the future.
<br />  After reading this book,one is left with the thought "You ain't seen nothing yet!"It is also interresting how Bodanis has shown that these geniuses were ordinary people in many ways and how they struggled with the establishment and personal relationships;just as the rest of us do.
<br />  If you can think of trying to explain to a person who was seeing his first machine in the 1800's;a spinng wleel for instance,and then imagine his wonderment if told about a spaceship;you get the sense of what lies ahead from our present endeavors in space exploration.It boggles the mind!
<br />  Also,about a third of this book is jam-packed with references for future readings.
<br />  While very enjoyable on its own,this book is worth keeping as an excellent reference.Check it out;you'll be glad you did.</span>
