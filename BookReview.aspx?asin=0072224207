                    <span>The sections I've read of the book so far are well written and easy to follow, and typically have good examples.<P>But there were a couple areas I was dissapointed in: 1: The authors should have given a bit more advice on which classes are now preferred, which classes programmers really use, etc. Examples: In the Collections Framework section, I would have appreciated more advice about how to decide which is the best collection class to use, some guidelines or something; Java 2 has LOTS of collection implementations to choose from. The same is true for the java.io section; which file/io routines to programmers really use. How important is buffered IO in the real world? Is it worth the extra steps to code, etc. 2: The examples were generally good, though there are some changes. First of all, examples were repeated frequently with a few lines changed. It would be nice to see those specific new lines highlighted in some way. Also, in some cases, I would have liked an additional, new example vs. just repeating and modifying the previous example. But the examples weren't bad, certainly on a par with other books. I still would recommend the book, but not as a sole reference or tutorial.</span>

                    <span>Ok, so I knew C++ before I started to read this book. Maybe thats why I found it pretty easy to understand.<P>But from the persepective of the beginner, I think this book might rush him into things a bit. Though the initial few pages are a bit helpful in understanding the basics, later chapters read more like manual pages. They are only helpful because they are a bit more explanative than Java Documentation, and they feature example code.<P>I would recommend this books to people who have grasped the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It is also good for experts for a quick review of many helpful Java classes. <P>Novies of programming should stay away from it for a while, until they have some experience in OOP.</span>

                    <span>I got this book as a prize at a Java User Group meeting. Overall, it's a good reference book to keep. One thing I wish it had covered is the JSPs, since it does cover the Servlets.</span>

                    <span>You all might find it surprising, but this was the book I used to learn Java!! I did know C++, but not from an advanced level. yet this book was all I used to get me started in Java and it surprisingly does a great job even though its intended to be a reference text. The pattern followed by the book is excellent, it has just the right combination of detail and examples and reference. Highly recommended for the Java programmer.</span>

                    <span>This review is less a review than an endorsement---unpaid. Regarding my credentials, I have written software for a (good) living for decades. Besides many books by others, I've read several of Mr. Schildt's books, from those in C in the last century to those in Java in this one. All of his have been outstanding. In the blurb on the back of one of his books, it states that Herbert Schildt is the world's best writer on programming languages. High praise indeed. But true!</span>
