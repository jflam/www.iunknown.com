                    <span>We watched this in English class for one purpous- to mock it! This was so lame- in fact let's just countdown the lamest parts
<br />
<br />1.The fact that they cut out the best part of the book- Simon's conversation with the beast! What were they thinking??!!!!!
<br />2.The acting- it reminds me of some of my home movies, only worse. the whole thing is phony, cheesey, hokey and rushed. its as if a bunch of little boys had a day to film it with their mom's camera or something!
<br />3.the novel was actually morbid and dark and thought provoking, this is just well... embarassing. how hard they're trying to be intiidating but are in reality just a bunch of squeky nine year old boys in their underware! how scary
<br />4.The added stuff- like what's up with that pilot guy- he wasn't even in the book! and worse, they had to add so many other characters and stuff and it just dragged the movie even further down.
<br />5.Piggy's death- LOL could they have made this any faker?
<br />
<br />Well they achieved one thing- they ruined the lord of the flies' reputation as the most morbid and thought provoking novel and give it a cheesey and well frankly embarassing feel instead. well done whoever read the first chapter of the novel and then decided to make a movie about it!</span>

                    <span>This remake was terrible! Did the people who made this movie even read the book? What's with them being from an American military school? Why not an American boarding school? Or have the boys be from Catholic schools?  
<br />
<br />In the book I felt so sorry for Piggy and was very upset when he was killed. In this movie, he came across as being very annoying and I was actually happy when he died. The Piggy in the book wasn't whiny like this one was and he never cried when the others picked on him.
<br />
<br />And where was the scene with Simon talking with the Lord of the Flies? That was only the most important part of the book! Ok, I can understand that part not being the the 1963 version because it would have been pretty risky, but the 1990? Come on now. 
<br />
<br />There is no choir in this version which was supposed to add to the irony in the book. Who would have thought that good ol choir boys would be the most ruthless people on the island?
<br />
<br />And lastly, there's an adult on the island! I think that speaks for itself. And the boys were all not supposed to know each other. The only ones who did in the book were the choir, and Samneric for obvious reasons. 
<br />
<br />Watch the 1963 version instead. It's so much better than this.</span>

                    <span>A boring 90 minute movie about kids who are stranded on the island acting like their bad or something and they pick on a poor fat kid who gets hit by a huge stoned rock and dies which made me feel so bad for him. What's the point of this movie? Nothing great happens, the acting is not bad but the whole movie just sucks. Sorry but I just don't get the point the movie is just bad don't see it!</span>

                    <span>There were two choices to get this movie from Amazon one is the old cover and one is the newest one. Get the newest one. It's wrapped already and never has been used. It's in good condition and has great sound. It's not available on DVD yet but it's still the movie. Great movie too but I wish there was more though. I felt so sorry for Piggy who got hit on the head by a big rock. That was stupid of them. But the rest of the movie is really good. It's worth to watch but it's not meant for kids! </span>
