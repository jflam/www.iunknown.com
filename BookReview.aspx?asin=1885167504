                    <span>If you're any kind of a marketing geek, this is a book you have to read. Spoelstra's stories from the trenches are great fun. His success stories also make great models to work by. Granted, as one reviewer put it, these examples are fine if you have deep pockets. But don't discount them as only for big-bucks companies. A creative thinker will frequently find a way to scale down the model to fit his own paradigm. Nobody's as pragamatic as I am when it comes to marketing that makes sense for small companies. Those companies are my bread and butter. And while you might not be trying to sell Portland Trailblazers tickets to an apathetic market, there is something to be learned from their basketball-playing sumo wrestlers. </span>

I believe that this book is especially helpful to small business owners.  It is a great read and it has interactive qualities.  This is a must keep for my bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>This is honestly the first ever management book that I have actually felt some personal connection with. I'm in love with Marketing - I dream about it all the time. And I would like to begin by thanking Jon Spoelstra for this wonderful book - I enjoyed it thoroughly.<p>This is the first time I have actually heard about the concept of - Marketing Outrageously. It is an interesting concept, a couple of good ideas I believe everyone can learn something from - no matter what industry you are actually in. The last couple of chapters were the best by far though. I enjoyed reading so much about how to treat your employees. I would like to talk a little about that if possible.<p>The ranking of importance is something that got me thinking in the beginning.<br>1. Employees<br>2. Customers<br>3. Shareholders<p>Unlike the tradtional firm -<br>1. Employees<br>2. Customers<br>3. Shareholders<p>You see, everything comes from your team. If you have a great team - that really love your workplace (their workplace!) - then things will start from then.<p>These six things - ohhh, I loved them so much - I'm really going to try to use the majority of these when I become a manager (and have the financial possibility to do so too!)<p>1. Employee Comic Handbook<br>2. Free Education<br>3. No-Miss policy<br>4. Forced Vacations<br>5. Six Week paid Sabbatical<br>6. Help in negotiating your next job<p>I can't explain them here - cause then you wont read the book! You have to go out - and buy this book.<p>My heart was beating so fast at the end - and not many books can do this to you. It's worth the read - trust me.</span>

                    <span>The book is fun to read.  No question.  The stories are great, especially if you like basketball and sports.  Jon Spoelstra certainly came up with some outrageous ideas, and my oh my, didn't they all work great!  Isn't he a genius?  This book certainly made me think that Jon Spoelstra thinks a lot of himself.<p>Unless you're running a sports franchise, I'm not sure there's actually much useful information to glean from the book, and that's the reason you buy business books, isn't it.  For all it's quizzes, which are really "precious" (in the worst sense of the word), the only real idea from the book is "go crazy...risk something."  That's great if you've got deep pockets.  People will do a lot of crazy things to link themselves with major sporting teams (sponsorships, wacky promotions, giveaways, etc.). But what if you own a plumbing supply store?  A shoe repair store?  A used CD shop?  Yes, you too can do crazy, wacky things, but if you do the wrong crazy thing, just because Spoelstra thinks you should, will you have the cash flow left to try another one?  Unless you've got a big organization and deep pockets (or access to deep financing) his urging to be outrageous seems a bit pat and obvious.  <p>Yes, be outrageous, sure.  But how do you temper it?  How do you give yourself an "escape route" if things go wrong?  How do you pay for it?  <p>So, I finished the book very entertained by the anecdotes, and impressed at the contributions the author has made to the ways in which we all enjoy professional sports events and team.  But I had not one truly practical, useful, actionable idea to put to work.</span>
