                <span id="Label1">On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson stepped onto Ebbets Field as a Brooklyn Dodger and changed American baseball forever.  <P>The first black man to play in the white major leagues, he had the courage to confront racism and fight for the rights of all black people, on and off the baseball diamond. He shattered the color barrier, and with tremendous skill and determination, he became not only one of the most legendary baseball players of all time, but also a great American hero.  <P>Half a century later, Jackie Robinson's extraordinary story remains an important contribution to America's favorite pastime and to American history.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is the best because it tell`s how hard it had to be if you were black and what they go through.  Jackie Robinson was one of the best player.  When Jackie Robinson hit a homerun sometimes they would call it a foul ball or a singel.  Not all the time they would call it a homerun.  I hope you read this book because you will really see how it would be to walk in the shoes of Jakie Robinson.</span>

                    <span>This book opened the eyes of 25 fifth graders to a world they new little or nothing about.  I used it as a read aloud in my classroom, with outstanding sucess.  The kids loved it.  "Stealing Home" tells the story of Robinson, from his childhood in Pasedena, CA where his was the only black family in an all-white neighborhood, through college at UCLA and on into his career.  Barry Denenberg, the author, recreates Jackie's life in a way that keeps the reader's interest throughout.  In fact, this biography reads a little like a novel. In telling the story of Robinson, Denenberg also paints a portrait of all-black baseball leagues, the pressures faced as the first black man in established white baseball, and an America that excluded a huge portion of its citizens.  This background is essential to young readers' ability to comprehend the true story, to be able to appreciate what Mr. Robinson faced in his career and life.  However, Denenberg also focuses on the good relationships he had with his wife, Rachel, and Branch Rickey the man who took a chance and gave us one of the best players in history.  "Stealing Home" is the story of Jackie Robinson, but it is also the story of the civil rights movement and of the diversification of American sports in a way that made our country richer and wiser.</span>
