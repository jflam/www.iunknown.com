                    <span>Derek and Beverly Joubert are probably best known for their National Geographic videotapes on African wildlife, such as "Africa's Stolen River," on the drying of the Savuti river over the course of several years and the resultant effects on the local animal populations, and "Eternal Enemies," on the enmity between lions and hyenas. The text of this book is comprised of excerpts from the Jouberts' personal journals during the period when those videos were made, interspersed with explanatory material. There are also plenty of excellent photographs - both of wildlife and of the Jouberts themselves and their equipment.<P>For those familiar with their videos, this book provides a more personal look at the Jouberts and what their life was like in the Savuti, as well as providing some tidbits about what happened to some of the subjects of the videos after they were made. For those not familiar with the videos, it may still be an interesting look at what life can be like for dedicated naturalists in the parts of Africa that are not yet completely tamed.<P>Note that unlike their videos, which focus exclusively on wildlife, this book includes quite a bit of discussion of people - not only the Jouberts and their filmmaking, but also of hunters and of the human political issues that determine the fate of the animals. If you would prefer a book focused more exclusively on wildlife, you might try the Jouberts' earlier book, "Hunting With the Moon."</span>

                    <span>I LOVED this book. Anyone that likes animals, Africa or adventures will like this book. This book does a great job of expressing what it would be like to live in the wilds of Africa. It also has great photos!</span>

                    <span>The natural history filmmaker authors have lived in the African bush for over twenty years: their lifestyle and work with wildlife is profiled in a diary of their world documenting their work. Any with an interest in African life will find The Africa Diaries an absorbing read packed with details and a 'you are there' atmosphere. Color photos complete the effect.</span>

                    <span>After so many outstanding Joubert wildlife films, we finally get to know more about the great people behind the lenses! The Joubert's second book is a classic African wildlife-book and a must for any fan of this great continent. Two books came to my mind while I devoured this wonderful book: "Serengeti shall not die" and "Cry of the Kalahari" - all three have the following in common: an honest, down-to-earth description of life among Africa's spectacular wildlife; a long-term conservation-approach; a unique way of putting the reader right in the middle of the bush-action with wonderful words and stunning photographs. The African Diaries are must-reading for any traveller to the great dark continent. Having experienced the mentioned locations many times myself this book brings back fond memories of Africa's last true wilderness area. My recommendation is to first see one of the Joubert's classic wildlife films and then to enjoy the "read behind the scenes". One will not be disappointed!</span>
