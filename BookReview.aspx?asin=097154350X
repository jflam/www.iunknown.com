                    <span>I know very little about baseball parks, but very much enjoy the sport.  My job has me traveling all over the country and I needed a source for information on where to go, what to see and what to avoid.  Mr. Mock's book gives me all three is a concise and easy to read format.  It fits in my briefcase pocket and tells me all I need to know when I need it.  Well done and intersting!</span>

                    <span>As a ballpark nut myself, I can honestly say that this is one of the best introductions to the intricacies, idiosyncracies, and personalities of the 30 big league parks.  Mock -- webmaster of the excellent ballpark resource baseballparks.com -- writes with both enthusiasm and a critical eye, explaining the best and worst aspects of these stadiums.  While incorporating terrific photographs from his travels, Mock also includes tips on finding the best seats, what to eat, and information on spring training, websites, and ballpark history.  For the money, I don't think a fan can find a more useful and valuable source of information and opinion to keep alongside the road atlas when hitting the road for a baseball roadtrip.</span>

                    <span>After traveling to most of the ballparks in this country for our own ballpark website my only regret looking back is that this book wasn't available from the start! This is perfect for anyone who wants to see the ballparks of the Major Leagues (and actually it's perfect for anyone who just loves ballparks). The book is chock full of beautiful glossy photographs and details about the ballpark and it's surroundings. It will let you know before purchasing your tickets where the best seats for the money are, so you can get the best bang for your buck. With the price of tickets these days, this information alone is worth it's weight in gold. Interesting facts and a list of likes and dislikes makes great reading for anyone who simply just loves baseball. An absolute must have for the ballpark pro or for someone who just loves the game...</span>
