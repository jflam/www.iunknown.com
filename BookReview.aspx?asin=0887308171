                <span id="Label1">In a dry fashion, Packard tells the true story of the mighty Hewlett-Packard Company: Two  college buddies begin a partnership by producing an audio oscillator in a Palo Alto garage in 1938 and  wind up 60 years later with a $25-billion-dollar electronics company on their hands. He wraps the book up  tidily with a timeline of the company's development milestones. Packard chalks up success to many things,  including government contracts during wartime, but mostly to the company's management outlook ("The  HP Way"), which champions openness, honesty, and flexibility throughout the organization. Entrepreneurs  and technologists alike will be interested in this journey of an American giant. Packard's tone sometimes  veers toward the self-congratulatory, but in this case, it somehow seems justified.</span>

                    <span>This book really isn't about HP ... its really about David Packard and its clearly self congratulatory. As was Alfred Sloans book. Compare  Packards book with Tom Waton, Jr.'s Book and you can see that the HP Way is mostly fluff.  I will say that its a nice feel good story and I want to point out that I think Packard - as an engineer - wrote the book he thought he was supposed to write rather  than the book he wanted to write.
<br />  Its a shame that modern companies dont really have people like this running them as even this book clearly shows how the PC companies are sad and pathethic - imagine if Michael Dell, anybody at IBM, CSC, EDS or  MicroSoft's Balmer and Gates would be like these guys? This book might just explain (in a round about fashion) why the "IT Bubble" really burst after all.  
<br />
<br />Two big reasons to buy this book:
<br />
<br /> If you think your PC or Mac is the greatest thing on earth... then PLEASE read this book and others like it because you have quite a bit to learn (and be disapointed about with Windows and Intel).  
<br />
<br /> If you work for "HP" you should read this book to see what a failure your "printer and printer paper" company has actually become... read it and weep! Perhaps the "modern" HP should change its name as it doesnt deserve such a name anymore. </span>

                    <span>All major computing companies have a set of myths, legends and facts that collectively form a unique mystique, but that of Hewlitt-Packard(HP) is truly different from the rest. Some of the unusual aspects of that mystique came to the forefront when the merger between HP and Compaq was reaching the final stages. One of the children of a founder launched a lawsuit against the merger because, among other things, it would lead to large number of layoffs, and that was "not the HP way." Good corporate citizenship and care for the workers are fundamental principles laid down and practiced by Bill Hewlitt and David Packard as they grew from a garage to a multi-billion dollar company.  <br> This book is the story of that growth in the words of one of the founders. It is a tale of challenges, management strategies that were and still are unusual, corporate honesty (imagine that as a management strategy), opportunities seen and tenaciously pursued, occasional mistakes, but always remaining focused on success. The strategy of management by walking around is still one of the most successful tactics that can be used to manage people. Even a few minutes spent observing and conversing with an employee can show you more than any above the fray approach could possibly do and is an incredible morale booster for the entire staff. <br> Over the years, I have heard many of the stories associated with HP, and after a time, began relegating some of them into the area of company "myth." However, after reading this book, I came away even more impressed with Bill Hewlitt and David Packard. Books on how to manage companies are far too numerous to mention and many are thick enough to be of use to a bodybuilder. Small enough to be lifted by a toddler, this book contains more practical knowledge about how to start and manage a company than the majority of the heavyweights.</span>

                    <span>Bill Hewlett and David Packard created one of the worlds most admired companies in the world. Today Hewlett-Packard is also well known company in Russia. More than twelve years ago I wrote my first books on the HP Vectra PC/AT compatible machine.<p>This book is a good overview. Its interesting to read how Hewlett Packard has grown from the little garage workshop  (like Apple Computer was created a little later) to the large corporation it is today. This book is a simple, yet profound, guide to cultivating a healthy corporate culture. Extraordinary story.</span>

                    <span>Very good history of HP and what made its success in the early days. David Packard and Bill Hewlett have build a truly amazing organization basically from scratch; this book will outline the major steps that led to this success. A more recent edition with comments on current issues and technological challenges would be very valuable.</span>
