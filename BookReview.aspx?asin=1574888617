                    <span>Though the Red Sox finally "caught" Steinbrenner (for one year at least), the frustrations and challenges of being a franchise forever obsessed with the Bronx Colossus remain. This book is as relevant now that the Red Sox have won their World Series title as it was when the sting of Aaron Boone was fresh. Rob Bradford provides the reader an entertaining look into the sub-$200 millon world of  Red Sox GM Theo Epstein and his Toronto counterpart J.P. Ricciardi, Massachusetts natives both, who work to overcome Yankee dollars with good old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity , and yes, luck. After all, Theo was heartbroken over losing Jose Contreras to the Yankees. It's all in the book.
<br />A good read.

                    <span>I'm a huge Red Sox fan, so the idea of a behind the scenes look at the team really appealed to me.  And, I read a lot of baseball books, so I'm used to tolerating mediocre writing in order to get my fix.  This book, however, was just awful.  Unreadable.  Bradford's final product reads like a college freshman's first draft.  He simply doesn't have enough ability.  You'll find yourself reading a paragraph and then stopping to wonder incredulously, who writes like that, and why didn't his editor stop him?  Unfortunately, the problems didn't really show up in the excerpt available here, so now I'm out twenty-five bucks.  
<br />
<br />Before you disregard this warning and buy it anyway, ask yourself a couple questions.  Why would a book that should have a similar appeal to Michael Lewis's bestseller, Moneyball, end up with a tiny publisher like Brassey's?  Because the other publishers wouldn't take it, that's why.  Why can't you find it in the brick and mortar bookstores?  Because those stores won't stock it, that's why.  And finally, have a look at Dan Shaughnessy's blurb on the back cover.  Talk about damned with faint praise.  I ignored the signs because I really wanted to like this book, but it really isn't worth your time or money.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but it's better for you to hear it now.</span>

                    <span>    I received Chasing Steinbrenner for Christmas and, being a 40-year fan of the Red Sox, I enjoyed the read immensely.  Knowing the joyous outcome of the 2004 MLB season made reading about Theo's first season as GM enjoyable.  I don't think I could have read it had the Red Sox -gulp- lost to the Yankees in 2004.  We know the amazing story of the 2004 season, and Bradford's entertaining and informative book gives us the inside story of the ups and downs of two franchises, the Blue Jays and Red Sox, that led to Aaron "What's the Big Deal?" Boone's 2003 ALCS Game 7 homerun.  Bradford gives readers the stories-behind-the-stories of some of the deals that, in retrospect, led to the 2004 World Series championship.  What if Theo had succeeded in signing Jose Contreras or did not obtain Kevin Millar?  There's no Game 4 comeback in the ALCS.  The details of the players' lives and the focus on certain 2003 games allow diehard fans to relive, without anguish, from whence the 2004 championship came.  Bradford's chapter on Theo's first game as GM makes me believe that one day Carl Crawford will be stealing bases and hitting walk-off HRs for the Red Sox. 
<br />     Juxtaposing Toronto's general manager J.P. Ricciardi, his limited resources, and Blue Jay fans with Boston's young general manager, sizable yet still somewhat limited revenue, and the Red Sox maniacal fan base allows readers access to the front office machinations about which newspapers, television, and radio shows only speculate.
<br />     For fans, Bradford opens the front office doors.  He also opened my eyes that the GM's care as much if not more than many of the diehards.  Read it and no longer weep!

                    <span>As a die-hard Sox fan, I am interested by any writing about the Red Sox under Theo Epstein, especially when it involves a new and different look at the managerial goings-on of a sabermetric franchise.  And there are plenty of interesting tidbits and stories about sagas such as the Jose Contreras deal and the Kevin Millar signings that many Red Sox fans remember vividly.  But I felt like there was too much background for certain players, too much focus on specific games.  It's worth a read for die-hard Sox fans, but I can't really recommend it for most.</span>

                    <span>Picked this up after reading Peter Gammons' recommendation on espn.com last month, and finished it as the Sox were in the middle of the greatest comeback in sports history last week. The timing was perfect, as this postseason is partly the result of the brilliant 2003 teambuilding effort by Theo Epstein and company that is covered here. The chapter on the adventure of signing Kevin Millar alone is worth the cover price. A great look into the inner workings of what may go down in history as one of baseball's best back offices. Reading about the Jays making do with a relatively tiny payroll is interesting too, but it's the Sox that caught Steinbrenner.</span>
