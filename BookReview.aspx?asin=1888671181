                    <span>I'm just plain shocked by the 1 or 2 star reviews listed here. Obviously written by ignorants incapable of reading a newspaper. It is surely true this is a highly involved work on the subject. That subject IS complicated and as such CANNOT be dealt with in depth in ANY other way. But don't be discouraged by it's complexity. Even if you don't have an engineering degree you will still benefit immensely. The ONLY prerequisite is that you WANT to learn MORE about the physical aspects of sailing. It may take time to fully grasp some of the threads but it'll be worth it.<BR>This book was NEVER meant for a novice sailor just starting out. It's a MUST piece for ANY boat designer who does not wish to take chances, especially when working on a project with tight specifications, and even more so if not meeting those specs means voiding the contracted design.</span>

                    <span>I became a fan of Marchaj's work when my wife gave me a copy of of his Theory and Practice of Sailing. I went through it without pausing. From there I moved on to Aero-Hydordynamics and found this too to be a well written book if you have the right background to understand the material. I come from an electrical engineering and physics background and with the tools those disciplines give me, I was able to get a great deal out of the book. I'm not sure this is the right book for someone with a non-technical background but for someone with technical training, it's an excellent introduction to the principles that affect how a boat is moved through the water by the wind.</span>

                    <span>I found this book dissapointing. The current price of $120 is absurd. As one of the reviewers put it, what is in the book would be confusing to someone untrained in engineering, and useless to an engineer. Principles of Yacht Design by Larsson and Eliason provides a useful, concise review of sailboat design, and is much cheaper. As a naval architect and sailor, don't waste your money. If you're looking for a concise background with some practical, useable info, get the Larsson-Eliason book. If you want more theoretical info, then you need to go to engineering school.</span>
