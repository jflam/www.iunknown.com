                <span id="Label1">Using beautiful color photographs of the interiours of exceptional homes across the country that look good and feel right, Catherine Bailly Dunne demonstrates creative and easy ways to decorate for all five senses in our own homes.  According to Dunne, a truly integrated home engages every sense.  Stressing that interior design is more than a superficial concern, that it can help you "design your life," Dunne connects with a generation that yearns to understand the emotional needs of a healthy family and passionately believes that the home is a mirror of the soul.  She enthusiastically teaches how anyone can decorate a home to celebrate a family's creativity and passion for life.<br></span>

                    <span>This book makes you look at ALL the ways in which you make your home comfortable. It definitely does NOT advocate clutter, or that everything should be textured - it specifically talks about balancing textures. Perhaps some of the photos seem a little fussy, but this isn't about replicating the photos. It's the kind of book that you use to inspire you, not to follow step-by-step projects. The section on touch makes me yearn for silks and wicker and nubbly cottons around me. The section on scent gave me the nudge I needed to buy a rose-scented sachet I've been thinking of buying for ages - and it's beautiful to sit at my computer and smell that. The section on hearing made me realise how much I enjoy hearing my neighbour's windchimes on breezy days - perhaps that's something I shall be looking into next. An inspiring book to pick up and leaf through... to make you realise that decorating isn't just about how your home looks. Any showhome can LOOK good, but it's the ones which feel and smell and sound good which will really attract your attention!</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book and handles decorating your home from a refreshing perspective.  Decorating should not be just about the way the sofa looks next to the fireplace, but also how you feel when you touch the fabric, how the color of the room motivates you or relaxes you, even how the house smells, how the whole effects your comfort level. Our homes are our refuge from the outside world and should be very personal and unique to ourselves.  Those who do not understand this concept should get one of Martha Stewart's insipid books.  This book has taught me to look at my home as a reflection of myself.  Just as I do not dress to please others, from now on I will decorate my home to please only me.  New home owners out there, buy this book now!</span>

                    <span>I thought I had pretty good taste when it comes to spiffing up the ol' homestead.  Catherine Bailly Dunne showed me how hopelessly inept I really am.  Her sense of style is a force unto itself.  Colors and textures come  alive with her inventive, yet simple flourishes.  This book is ideal for  beautifying any home, from a one-bedroom rathole to a multi-gabled country  estate.  Hats off to the author.  Catherine, you've really dunne it this  time!</span>
