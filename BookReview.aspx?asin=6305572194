                    <span>There was not very much footage of the tigers here. It looks like the fillmakers spent a lot of time in some town in Siberia, which is apparently a lot like white trash America. So instead of feeling taken away, I felt like I was taken back to the Ohio. Also, the scientists spend lot of time looking for tigers or avoiding seeing the tigers so they don't get eaten. And not much time actually running with the tigers. <BR>There is one really cool part about hunting tigers from a helicopter (with dart guns to put radio trackers on them.) They should make a video game out of that part. <BR>I think the whole idea of a nature documentary about one animal sounds good on paper, but it works a lot better to watch a documentary about a geographic region - you get more variety in your movie.</span>

                    <span>This video is heart wrenching. All the effort that goes into saving these magnificant cats, and it's likely too late. Human greed is the worst enemy any species can face, and the Siberian Tiger is in the crosshairs now.<P> A world without these Tigers will be a poorer place indeed. Blake's words, once so potent, will only echo hollow in the ears of generations to come who can only see Tigers on TV, or in captivity. What that says about humankind is undeniable, we are truly inept (or uncaring) when managing the resources of this planet, myself included.<P> The biggest and most powerful of all cats, these Siberian beauties are so majestic. What gorgeous footage of these mammoth cats in action. Take a good, close look at your kitty and you will see the same fire smouldering in those attentive eyes. Lets save these magnificant animals!!</span>

                    <span>This dvd has been filmed under very difficult circumstances but, still, can convey the feeling of geographical remoteness, resourceless cientific crusades and endangered wonders, such as the cats shown here. Nevertheless, the video quality, though not bad at all, might have been improved if done with IMAX cameras, such as it has been done with whales or sharks. Anyhow, the information provided and some shots, like the helicopter chases or the tiger cub at it's den, make this documentary worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>One of the best video on tiger especially on the Siberian Tiger, the largest big cat of them all. Too bad they are extremely endangered. This is definitely the best tiger video. The DVD also include Tiger's Eyes, a half an hour show on Bengal Tigers.</span>

                    <span>"Tigers of the Snow" is a great video for the classroom. It has an acceptable balance of scientific study with awesome footage of tigers. No question that my college-bound biology students saw the application of science occurring out in the field. Better yet though, my remedial 16 year old science students were totally captivated by most parts of this video, especially the experiment in tiger territorality. I rarely show videos in Biology; this one is worth the time.</span>
