                    <span>I read the blistering negative first review of this book and almost didn't buy it. It would definitely have been my loss. I can see where Photosecrets of Yosemite is going to be a great help in several ways:  Taking better photographs, of course, but also in deciding what, when and where to go to view the sights. I don't know what else you could want in a book of this type. There are lots of beautiful photos with suggestions as to how to do your own. I see nothing wrong with the quality of the book itself -- I don't know what the first reviewer was even thinking! I bought three other books to help plan our Yosemite trip: Complete Guidebook to Yosemite, Photographer's Guide to Yosemite, and of course, Frommer's -- ya' gotta have a Frommer's wherever you go. All four books are excellent and will definitely add to the planning of our trip -- and I'll certainly have them along with me on our vacation. Thanks, Andrew Hudson -- I really like your book.</span>

                    <span>I think this book is just not worth being a "photo book". First<br>of all, the pictures in the book are not at all impressive. The<br>print paper quality is quite sub-standard. I didnt expect<br>a book from a "photo publishing house" to be of such a low<br>quality. I will not buy another photosecrets book ever<br>again. I am going to try out Michael Frye's book instead.<p>someone wants to buy this one from me :)</span>

                    <span>I was greatly disappointed by the book and immediately returned it.  This book contains ONLY so-called "drive-by shootings" - it's obvious this author made little efforts to capture the best lights or composition.  These "snapshots" were mostly taken in the mid-day sun, when almost all advanced photographers avoid taking pictures.  This book is probably intended for tourists on a bus-tour, but not for serious photographers.<p>If you have money to waste on this book, buy two copies of "The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite" by Michael Frye.  The latter book is truly a work of art and I was deeply inspired by every image in it.  It's hard to believe these two books - on the other extremes - are priced about the same.</span>

                    <span>I took this book with me to Yosemite in Fall of '00.  My plan was to take B&W photos to be developed in a photography class I was taking.  We had only had 2 classes before my departure for YNP, so I had a grasp on the basics of depth of field and shutter speed, but I was depending on my instinct for composition and lighting.<p>This book was fabulous!  It helped me know how to set up the shots I wanted, and the pictures were a great guide for planning our short visit to the park.  Also, the tips about protecting my camera on Mist Trail and others were much appreciated.<p>When I developed the B&W photos in class, I was amazed!  They were gorgeous!<p>This book is a must-get for the novice photographer visiting NYP.  I will purchase more in the series as we continue to travel!</span>

                    <span>I brought a disposable, a 35mm automatic and an APS camera.  If you follow the suggestions and tips on how, when and where to take pictures, you can't go wrong with capturing the  majesty of Yosemite.  With its color photos  and maps, it's a great tour guide too. It's a must have, if you're planning  to visit Yosemite.</span>
