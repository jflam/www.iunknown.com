                    <span>I don't comprehend the criticism of this book where the complaint implies the instruction within is too meager.  There are twenty-four chapters, eight hundred forty-four pages and it's not fluff.  It is an excellently structured "Beginner Level" book which lays a foundation over a broad expanse of C# territory.  Each chapter explains principles, leads you through hands-on examples, recaps where the principles are implemented in the examples and then tests your comprehension with exercises at the end.
<br />
<br />C# is not a casual topic and this book is not a casual read.  You gain great insight when you work the code examples and answer the exercises provided.  Between my workday and playtime, it took me three months to complete this book, cover to cover.  I am confidant with the basics, such as ADO.NET, ASP.NET or XML handling, to investigate more advanced, specialized C# books now. 
<br />
<br />Finally, a change of publishers did cause the answers to the chapter review exercises to disappear from the web for a good while.  But they're in the Peer-2-Peer forum at the WROX website now, listed under this book title as the topic.

                    <span>I've bought many C-Sharp books and I must say., this book is awesome!  Where as in other beginning books a lot of details are missing -this book is fine tunned and includes many details about the C# language that are just simply not covered in other books!  This book is enjoyable and keeps you thinking.
<br />
<br />After completing this book, you will have good experience with C# and ready to move on to more advanced books.  You get a taste of different C# topics -towards the end of the book.  After completing this book, it will be your choice to go the way of Windows Form programming or ASP.NET, and associated topics in those fields.  This book gets 5 stars for an introductory book.  (...)This book assumes you know your way around an IDE, which is pretty easy to figure out.  Enough said.

                    <span>I'm not from a publishing company or anybody affiliated with other books, thus right of the bat I am not going to recommend any other C# book, since I ordered one, but am waiting to review it.<p>First of all my background is COBOL for 15 years and have dabbled with VB 6.0, so I wanted to dive into the world of OO programming and threw my hat into C# instead of JAVA and was looking for a TRUE Beginning book that wasn't too trivial but wasn't an intermediate book as well.<p>As far as this book, there are some people who know the language, but cannot teach others the basics and that is where this author falls into.<p>It goes all over the place instead of starting with the very basics and building an application where at the end of the book you can actually use the application and learn from it.<p>I picked up this book off a suggestion that Wrox books are very good, well this one is a dud.<p>The author doesn't even get into Windows Programming until half way through the book, which I had thought C# was primarly used for (albeit ASP.NET as well).<p>This book was written for somebody oriented with other OO languages (JAVA, C++) and was switching over. <p>I wanted a book written for a technical person who has some programming background, but not so easy and basic as the "For Dummies" or "Teach Yourself in 21 days".<p>The title fools you into believing it is for a Beginner, but buyer beware !!..The best way to really pick a book is to go to a Borders or Barnes and Noble and sit down for an hour or so and read it to see the authors writing style to see if it fits your learning style.<p>I am getting Murachs C# book, just because I had their Mainframe books which were good, so once I read the Murach book, I'll also write an honest review for those interested or you can go to your local bookstore and review it to form your own opinion.</span>

                    <span>This book is quite easy to read for a beginner.  However, for a true beginner who needs to check answers to the exercises provided in the book...well, that's another story.  The authors forgot who their audience is and just like that they decided not to provide answers to the exercises given at the end of the chapters.  This made the book quite a bit challenging for me, and the so called "P2P" forums in the publisher's website are many times not useful at all.  Before buying this book, browse through all of the complaints posted in these "P2P" forums and you'll know what I'm talking about.<p>Otherwise, the book is presented in a fairly comprehensive way for a beginner to understand.</span>

                    <span>I don't understand why the other reviewers are so positive about this book.  It's drier than crackers in the Sahara and it spends way too much time on Windows Forms.  It also assumes you're very familiar with VS.NET.  A "Beginning" book should do a lot more hand-holding than this book does.  In summary, I hated it.</span>
