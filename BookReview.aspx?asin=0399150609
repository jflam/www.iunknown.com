                <span id="Label1">His battered face appeared on the cover of <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>U.S. News & World Report</i> to the shock and horror of all Americans. Black Hawk pilot Mike Durant was shot down and taken prisoner during America's biggest firefight since the Vietnam War. Published in the tenth anniversary year of the Somali conflict, this gripping personal account at last tells the world about Durant's harrowing captivity and the heroic deeds of his doomed comrades. And, as readers will discover, Durant proves himself to be nothing less than a hero.</span>

                    <span>The name Mike Durant should be a familiar one. As a member of the US Army's elite 160th SOAR (Special Operations Aviation Regiment), he was one of the world's finest helicopter pilots. During the battle in Mogadishu, Somalia made famous by Mark Bowden's book BLACK HAWK DOWN and the movie of the same name, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Durant piloted a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down. <P>In this book, Durant does an excellent job of recounting that fateful day when his Black Hawk was shot down and the ensuing 11 days he spent held as a prisoner of war (POW) by the most powerful tribal faction in Somalia before his release. Along with recounting those harrowing days in captivity, Durant provides an autobiographical look of important times and missions of his military career.<P>This book is a very fast read and an excellent one. It would certainly help the reader to know the events and situations taking place during Operation Gothic Serpent, so I would highly recommend reading Mark Bowden's BLACK HAWK DOWN prior to reading this book. However, knowing the circumstances of the battle nor reading Bowden's book are not really necessary to enjoying this incredible book. Durant's POW experience is certainly a unique one and the book does a good job of relating what Durant went through. Contrary to what you might think before reading the book, not all POWs are beaten and treated poorly; Durant makes it explicitly known that his captors treated him humanely.<P>I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any reader. One does not need a thorough knowledge of the military or its Special Operations forces to enjoy this book (though it may help). It is at times very moving, and there was one instance where I had to fight back tears.</span>

                    <span>IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES, by Mike Durant is an exceptional read ... heartbreaking and heroic and stunning in its honesty and humility. For those who don't remember (how could you not?), Durant was the Blackhawk pilot shot down over Mogadishu in 93 and held by Adid for 10 days. Although he contributed to Mark Bowden's BLACK HAWK DOWN (an exceptional piece of journalism, to be sure), this is the first time Durant has gone public with more than a perfunctory detailing of the events of his capture and his time as a POW in Mogadishu. It is an exceptional story of courage and the Human capacity to survive, as well as an extraordinary testament to the worth of intelligence, integrity, training and psychological/emotional strength under the most intense of circumstances.<P>Mike Durant, as he has proven time and time again, is a 100% class act with absolutely no delusions of grandeur. Though never shy about acknowledging his own skills and talents, Durant doesn't indulge in a single self-serving statement throughout the narrative, which includes extensive material on other special ops missions, as well as the Somalia fiasco. Neither does he lavish praise unduly on folks who were doing what they are trained and paid to do. What he does do is call it exactly as it happened to him, avoiding undue political rhetoric and unfailingly giving credit to those who kept him alive and brought him home.<P>Through his eyes, we see the men Donavan Briley and Cliff Wolcott and others lost in Somalia were -- not only as soldiers, but also as friends. By showing us the loss these men are to Durant personally, we begin to feel the loss such men always are to the country they serve at cost of life and limb. In recording this incident from an unprecedented POV and refusing to pander to the sensationalism that marked the media coverage or succumb to the self-aggrandizing agenda that usually mitigates such personal accounts of horrific events, Mike Durant offers insight into the unimaginable; and in doing so, creates a testament to both his own heroism and to the unsung heroism of others who willingly lay their lives on the line to protect our way of life.<P>Mike Durant doesn't consider himself a hero: The real heroes never do.</span>

                    <span>As a nightstalker wife. This book is a must have for all 160th soldiers. Especially is they have the movie. It's a key point of NSDQ history and it reminds us LNSDQ of the possibilites and the strength of our husbands and their soldiers. There aren't many books about nightstalkers, so it's about time one got written. This book was written from a man's point of view whose been there. Now, I'm gonna explain from a wife's point of view of being there. Still this book is definately a must have.</span>

                    <span>Michael Durant deserves plenty of praise and respect as do all the other Task Force Rangers who are alive and those that have unfortunately sacrificed their lives. Simply put, I could not put this book down and found every chapter fascinating. Mr. Durant does an excellent job of relating the events in every detail and you truly feel as if you are there with him through it all. <P>Regardless of what you may already know about these events, you will find yourself spellbound by the story. I kept imagining how I might have responded or reacted had I been in that situation and I am not sure I would have been as brave or cool-headed as Mr. Durant. Knowing his inner thoughts and strategies as well as other events of his military career was completely inciteful and I am really appreciative that he was able to share them with everyone. Thanks Mike!</span>

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is brave enough to see what happened in Somalia from Durant's perspective.</span>
