                <span id="Label1">"So this is it. This is how the big guys talk to each other. I'd been behind my share of closed doors on Capitol Hill, but this was different -- more self-conscious, almost cinematic, as if everyone was aware of playing a part in a drama that was being written as they spoke. This was the classic smoke-filled room, minus the smoke. I watched and listened and tried to look cool, too dumbstruck to say a sensible word and half-convinced that somebody would look up any minute and say, 'Hey, what are you doing here?"  For four years in the White House and one year of campaigning before that, George Stephanopoulos was rarely more than a few steps from Bill Clinton. As the President's Senior Adviser, he saw it all - the endless arguments, the back hall scheming, the protracted decisions, the last minute flip flops that somehow produced real accomplishments, but also set in motion an almost tragic series of events that placed the fate of the President in the hands of the Senate. Now, with the natural ease of a born storyteller and the sensitive eye for fine detail of a novelist, Stephanopoulos tells an extraordinarily gripping story of human foible and frailty in high places that is destined to be one of the great political memoirs of our times.  When Stephanopoulos first met Bill Clinton in September of 1991, he was 30, and like so many others before and since, he was dazzled by the brilliance, charisma, lofty ambitions and astonishing empathy of this remarkably gifted man. Here was the perfect star for an ambitious young man to hitch himself to, yet little did he anticipate what an amazing roller coaster ride it would be - both for the administration and for Stephanopoulos. Throughout the chaos and camaraderie, the breathtaking triumphs and disasters, Stephanopoulos clung to the vision of what a Clinton Presidency could be, even as he began to see the hidden, dark compartments in the man that would bring him and the nation to such grief.  In addition to the complex portrait of the President, here are brilliant, nuanced sketches of all the key players, including Al Gore, Dick Morris, and Hillary Clinton, whose combative, litigator instincts were, sadly, behind many of her husband's missteps. Here too is a candid, sometimes merciless, self-portrait of the author, whose drives, vanities, and insecurities, along with everyone else's, peppered the playing field of the biggest game in town. All Too Human is a book for the ages.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a memoir full of lessons for everyone interested in the human side of politics. Bill Clinton and George Stephanopoulos formed an interesting and intelligent partnership for nearly all the eight years of the Clinton Administration (and the previous campaign.) I still can't figure out the reasons that made Stephanopoulos finally turn away from the man that gave him the greatest opportunity in his political life, even when he tries really hard to explain those reasons in "All Too Human" (in "My Life", Clinton says he didn't have a clue about George's dissapointment until he read this book.) May be Dick Morris (that brilliant and cynical mercenary) had a lot to do with it, and also Clinton's lack of emotional closeness with Stephanopoulos in the really difficult period between the elections of 1994 and the victory of 1996.
<br />
<br />Be what it may, "All Too Human" is a highly readable political memoir. Stephanopoulos is a fine writer and has a sharp talent to comunicate feelings and images. That's the case of the fascinating encounter, for example, between him and Bob Woodward. One can see the "draculesque" atmosphere when the author met Woodward in his Washington house. Woodward was writing "The Agenda" then, and wanted to get information from Stephanopoulos. "The Agenda", unfairly it seems, resulted in accussations of leaking for Stephanopoulos and was one of the reasons for the beggining of the decline of his fortune in the Clinton White House. Imagine that: the rising and youngest star and the ultimate wolf of journalism in town meeting face to face. It's just captivating.
<br />
<br />The best and the brightest of the Clinton era tells it all here. His is a story not to be forgotten. Beware: Politics in Washington is indeed the most fascinating, seductive and dangerous of games.
<br />
<br />Read it. You'll end reading it again. Then read it one more time and after that watch some of "The West Wing" episodes. You'll find certain, how to put it?... Distance.   </span>

                    <span>George Stephanopoulos' "All Too Human" is a very interesting insider's account of the Clinton Presidency.  The amount of spin that goes on in today's public life is astounding.  Spin has always been there to one extent or another, but the amount of time expended on it from both sides boggles the mind. 
<br />
<br />Stephanopoulos gives a good account of the more liberal side of the Clinton story.  He is often too critical of the President assuming that any move to the political center was a sell out for the sake of polls and not inspired by conviction.  Clinton was elected and for several years had preached the gospel of pragmatism; activist government through practical means. He was a prophet of moving the Democratic Party closer to the political center. Above all he wanted to get things done. His is an honest accounting of a flawed person with great potential, and the frustrations of what might have been. Growing up just across the Arkansas state line in Missouri, I watched Clinton's rise on the local news since the early 80s.  His convictions are very real and his political skills are amazing.  His goal is to make progress and get things done.
<br />
<br />This is a really good read however.  I couldn't put the book down.  Balance it with other views of the Clinton White House, but definately include it if you want to see things from all sides. </span>

                    <span>With this book George Stephanopoulos provides yet another inside look into the Clinton administration. He is clearly a very intelligent person with a good grip on the power games in Washington. 
<br />
<br />The book is filled with descriptions of situations and events from his time in the White House, but lacks real analysis of his and Clintons achievements or lack of same. One wonders if he might have been better off waiting a few more years to gain more perspective on his own performance. He was a very young Senior Advisor and perhaps some more time would have helped him understand how that influenced the decision making.
<br />
<br />Even with the lack of true analysis the book is an important piece of the puzzle if you want to understand the Clinton White House and George Stephanopoulos writes well and keeps the reader interested all the way through. Hopefully there will be a sequal at some point.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating book about George Stephanopoulous.  Not Bill Clinton, George Stephanopoulous.  If you've ever wondered how a 30-something law school graduate can become an influential person with the ear of the president, this is your primer.  <p>Mr. Stephanopoulous is ruthlessly honest about his inexperience and the near disasters that resulted, and I found myself cheering for him to find his way as the memoir progressed.  He covers his childhood to his resignation from the Clinton White House in 1996, with an epilouge about Monica & Impeachment, and the deterioration of his relationship with the President once Mr. Stephanopoulos became a member of the other side -- the media.  <p>He talks about a life filled with minute-to-minute firefighting, and frustration at not being able to accomplish the political missions closest to his heart and the President's.  Yes, he suffers from depression and anxiety, but that is not the focal point of the book.  The focus is on his personal relationships with the President and others in the White House, struggling to maintain his position of power and close proximity to the President, and the political infighting that occurred between him and the (nefarious) Dick Morris.  <p>He is very tough on himself, and more than willing to be honest even when his motives were not pure.  After reading this book, I feel it was an act of bravery to write so candidly, and I have more respect for "Boy George".</span>
