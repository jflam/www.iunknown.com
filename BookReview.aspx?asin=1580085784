                    <span>I was looking for just this kind of book. Most retirement books are talking about money,and selling you something, this book talks about your life. I am a nervous Nellie when it comes to change or decisions. I research till I know the topic as well as I can and then make my decision. 
<br />
<br />I saw myself in so many discriptions in the book. I was a workaholic. I now know better and I am trying to change my thinking about work and leisure. I have taken more time off this year than last year to date and plan a lot more days off. I thought my world would fall apart if I did this. It hasn't fallen apart-matter of fact work has gone along just fine without me! This is something of a shock. All those extra hours were a waste of time, my time! I still have a lot of work to do on learning to find my life and live it "Wild and Free", but I am making some progress. 
<br />
<br />This book made me think about retirement and life in a whole new way. The humor, quotes and exercises helped me understand my possibilities better. I am retiring next summer and moving on to the rest of my life and looking forward to it. Thank you Mr.Zelinski!

<br />My first exposure to How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free was downloading over half of the book as a free E-book which I found on the Internet. It was the top half of the book, however. Although the E-book was inspiring to read, it was a little frustrating with the bottom half missing. I loved the top half so much that I purchased the whole book. It's the best one I've read on retirement. I had been looking for a book that dealt with aspects of retirement that weren't tied up with all the financial gobbledygook. As a personal coach who often gives advice to the newly retired, I have already purchased over a hundred copies to give to my clients and will continue to purchase more. Moreover, How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free has given me the inspiration and incentive to make my own retirement happen earlier than I had planned for. 
<br />Ernie Zelinski has an off-the-wall sense of humor and is a master of one-liners that catch your attention and open you up to new concepts. You may be surprised to find out that "You don't have to watch one minute of TV when you retire - and perhaps you shouldn't given that the probability of having a happy and successful retirement is inversely proportional to how much television you watch."
<br />According to Zelinski, if you manage to retire happy, wild, and free, then your retirement will be more rewarding than your career ever was. The ingredients in such a retirement are likely to include great friends, a sense of purpose, some structure in your day, plenty of exercise, something to stimulate your mind, and spiritual growth. 
<br />If you don't have these ingredients in your life at this time, Zelinski has a number of suggestions for finding and incorporating them. For those who haven't cultivated interests outside the workplace, filling all that time may be a challenge. The Get-a-Life Tree in Chapter 3 provides the answer.
<br />Other chapters are devoted to the consideration of activities that enhance body, mind, and spirit. Zelinski quotes from many sources, but his attitude is reflected in a quote from the Buddha. "In the end, these things matter most. How well did you love? How fully did you live? How deeply did you learn to let go?" 
<br />Better still, Zelinski's own words in How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free are worthy of being quoted as much as the Buddha. For example: "When money is lost, little is lost. When time is lost, much more is lost. When health is lost, practically everything is lost. And when creative spirit is lost, there is nothing left."
<br /> Another example: "Retirement life is a game in many ways. Ensure that you laugh and have fun, even when the score is not in your favor. This way, you will always end up winning at the most important game you will ever play."
<br />My edition of How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free indicates that it will be published in seven other languages. No wonder. Although I can't prove it, this is likely the best retirement book in the world.

                    <span>My wife and I are preparing for retirement in our mid-fifties -- twelve years from now. (Yes, we like to start planning early.)  The title and summary on Amazon intrigued me so I purchased this one along with some other books that specialize in the non-financial aspects of retirement.  This book is, unfortunately, not of the caliber we experienced in our other finds.  It is poorly written to the point of being frustrating in its redundancy -- so much so that my wife stopped reading it after getting halfway through. The book does have one redeeming feature:  the author has a very good idea on building an interest tree of what you'd like to do with your future free time.  This idea is probably worth the price of the book, but don't bother to read anything other than that chapter.</span>

                    <span>This book is quite different than the author's other one that I like so much, "The Joy of Not Working."   The format is quite different.   In my opinion, the organizational structure is not as good.  But in the end, there is a wealth of good, solid, useful, insightful information contained inside, and that would be the point of reading it in the first place.  
<br />
<br />In short, "Happy, Wild and Free" is another winner by Zelinski for retiree readers, and it can serve as a great "only" retirement book for those who are looking for that.    I can't imagine anyone feeling they don't get their money's worth from reading the book.   
<br />
<br />Just a read of the preface may be worth the price of admission.   Here we find a good overview of the subject of retirement, with some first-class comments to boot:  "Retirement is the perfect time to become the person you would like to be and do the things you have always wanted to do."   "Retirement can be both exciting and demanding, bringing new challenges, new experiences, and new uncertainties."   "...retirement is the last opportunity for individuals to reinvent themselves, let go of the past, and find peace and happiness within."   "Despite the bad press that retirement sometimes gets, there has never been a better time to be retired in Western nations."  And the one I like the best: "The most fortunate of retirees are those who through good planning, experimentation, and risk-taking succeed in making retirement the best time of their lives."
<br />
<br />I just don't think the elements of this retirement insight and advice gets any better any place else.   I truly believe that Zelinski is the reigning guru on retirement, and I have since I first found and read, "The Art of Retirement."   If Zelinski didn't exist, I think we would have to have invent him.  But he's saved us the trouble with his combination of fantastic books on retirement.  
<br />
<br />The major criticism of the book is that, for me, the flow of chapters and even the flow of sections within the chapters does not work.   The collection of chapter sections, I think, could probably be randomly placed with the same eventual result.  It's not like one section logically follows the other, nor positively belongs in one chapter rather than another.   
<br />
<br />And, as I look back through my notes in the book, I find words I've written such as "sophomoric," "irrelevant," "repetitive," "dumb," and "weak."   I simply do not find all sections of the book to be at the level I want them to be.  But that's it.  That's all of my criticisms.   To me the reader is free, after reading the preface, to read through the rest of the book, remembering quotes and advice and insight along the way, finding sections that he or she finds valuable and to be favorites, ignoring those found not to be worth the read.   
<br />
<br />The flaws that I see should not prevent most from finding the bulk of the book to be well worth the effort.   I highly recommend this book as a gift to oneself and/or for others.  I don't think it gets any better than Zelinski when you look for books on the subject of life after work.

                    <span>How to Retire Happy, Wild and Free is a wonderful book. The other reviews listed here, say it all but I just had to add my two cents. Though I am a few years off from retirement age, I want to be prepared and the author has done much of the groundwork.
<br />
<br />Mr. Zelinski has been helpful in enlightening my 'field of vision' to better prepare me for life lived on the road to the golden years. I especially appreciated the quotations he has gathered to drive his points home to the reader.
<br />
<br />Thank you for sharing your insights with us. You are helping us all to make our trip to retirement a journey worth anticipating and appreciating.</span>
