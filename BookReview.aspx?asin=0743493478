                    <span>I hate to say it but, this book was booooring! I should have saved my money! I did not like Vickie's other book all that much either! I could not get into this book. I recommend "The Glamorous Life" instead of this mess! I will not be buying any more of Ms. Stringers books. Sorry!</span>

                    <span>The main character Pammy/Carmen was unbelievably stupid in this novel! This woman had all the street smarts in the world she could tell you how to turn a ten dollars into a million, but when it came down to deciding if she would snitch or stay. She's unsure! I screaming as I read tell you fool! You have a one-year-old kid and he needs his mother. How can you be torn between being a snitch and being a mother! I know she had to do what she had to do to get by but your first obligation is your child not the damn streets. I think the author spent too much time on this issue! I also felt that this girl still had love for Chino after all he had done! I am sorry baby daddy after you left me and married another women (this happen in the first book Let that be the Reason) not claiming my child and refusing to take care of mines I am sorry Chino but you would have been in jail in the first book because I would snitched about ya run ins with them people you laid to rest! If mines can't eat. Nobody want eat! The person that really had love for Carmen/Pammy was murder violently this part of the book kind of upset me I just wished it could have happen a different way. This book is basically about the main character locked up in jail about to do major time and she torn between being a snitch or being a solider doing her time. All the time she's in jail people are living their lives especially the man that she stuck her neck out there for (her baby daddy). The end of the novel had me a bit confused I am wondering did this author  want us to imagine how the ending should be. Like I said before and I am going to say it again I will be a snitch any day (yeah some of yall saying that snitches get stitches) but you gotta catch me first! </span>
