                <span id="Label1"><p>No prior programming experience necessary!</p><p><i>Absolute Beginner's Guide to Programming</i> helps readers understand what programming really is. Readers not only get an overview of the job of programming, but also learn which specific skills are needed for certain jobs.Coverage includes how a computer interprets a program's instructions with insight into what goes on "under the hood" when a computer runs a program, how programming can and does relate to the Internet and the skills required for adding security to programs, and compiled versus interpreted languages like JavaScript and HTML. <i>Absolute Beginner's Guide to Programming</i> offers "hands on" programming for the "absolute beginner". Though there are hundreds of books for beginners about specific languages, this is the only book that takes today's programming environments and explains why each is important and where each works best.</p></span>

                    <span>this book is great for learning how to program...if you can get your hands on the software. Visual basic 6.0 working edition is the model for the majority of the text and the author offers no way to get it for free, which means you have to buy it seperately. I would suggest getting a book that has the programming languages you are going to use included on a cd. </span>

                    <span>The book lives up to its title in terms of being an introductory guide to programming, but what I didn't know was I had to have the specific program "Visual Basic" as well to get beyond chapter five. This revelation left the remaining 19 chapters of the book of no value to me at all. I do have "Visual Basic.Net", but it's way too much of a process to try to convert from one program to another and learn how they work at the same time.</span>

                    <span>An OK primer for beginners, covering the rudiments of programming well. But before you buy this, or any other of Mr. Perry's books, I suggest you look into some of his virulently hateful non-computer-related comments; for example, those published on his own web site, www.gregandjayne.com. This site has since been sanitized, but you can still access the page www.gregandjayne.com/GregsCorner.htm by going to Google and typing in the words "still proudly intolerant of homosexuals" into the advanced search exact phrase box.</span>

                    <span>This book requires visual basic.  So if you thought all you had to do to start programming today think again.  Trying to read this book without following along in visual basic was way to confusing.  So if you want to buy this book to learn programming I would also recommend you buy Microsoft's Visual Basic.  You can find the current price at microsoft.com.  Other wise I would recommend to a true absolute beginner buying Wallace Wang's "Beginning Programming for Dummies" Try to keep in mind you will want the most recent edition because things in the languages change with each version.</span>
