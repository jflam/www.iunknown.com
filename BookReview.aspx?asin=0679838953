                    <span>Our 4 year-old is excited about Thomas the Tank Engine characters, but I don't think he understands the points which these stories are making.  I think he likes the *idea* of it being a Thomas book more than he enjoys listening to these stories themselves.  He is just as happy to look briefly at the pictures while I summarize the story.<p>I know that the stories intend to teach good moral lessons, but I am sometimes uncomfortable about how they attempt to do this.  For example, James is rude to some less polished train cars, so they take delight when James' resentful freight cars make James crash, causing tar to get all over James' nice paint job.  The underlying message (don't be rude to others) may be lost on children who see all the characters behaving in unkind ways toward others.</span>

                    <span>This little book includes four stories -- "James in a Mess", "Bertie's Chase", "Percy and the Signal"  and "Percy Proves a Point".  Each story is accompanied by photographs from the video series.  My complaint is that the stories are confusing and not well told.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The books consists of the traditional James stories.  However, the illustrations are replaced by photographs from the videos. I believe, making the book look darker and less appealing to my three year old. My recommendation--look for an edition with the original illustrations.</span>

                    <span>Not only does this collection of tales contain the usually wonderful Thomas tales, but it features actual photographs to accompany the stories.  These add a realistic touch to the sticky mess James gets in after making  fun of another engine, only to have a load of goo land all over him!  All  the tales (several more follow) follow suit. For example, 'Percy Proves A  Point' is a fun illustration of the pleasant surprises that await someone  who push themselves just a little harder  than they thought they  could...and the joy of celebrating those victories with friends.</span>
