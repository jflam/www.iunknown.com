                <span id="Label1"> Few people can write about faith, parenting, and relationships as can the talented, irreverent Anne Lamott. With characteristic black humor, ("Everyone has been having a hard time with life this year; not with all of it, just the waking hours") she updates us on the ongoing mayhem of her life since <i>Traveling Mercies</i>, and continues to unfold her spiritual journey. <p> <i>Plan B</i> finds Lamott wrestling with mid-life hormones and weight gain while parenting Sam, now a teenager with his own set of raging hormones. Her observations cover everything from starting a Sunday school to grief over the death of her beloved dog, Sadie; lamenting the war to bitterness over her relationship with her now-departed mother.  <p> As she tugs and pokes out the knots in a slender gold chain necklace, it becomes a metaphor for letting go and learning to forgive. "&#8230;<i>any</i> willingness to let go inevitably comes from pain; and the desire to change changes you, and jiggles the spirit, gets to it somehow, to the deepest, hardest, most ruined parts." It&#146;s her willingness to show us the knotted-up, "ruined parts" of her life that make this collection of sometimes uneven essays so compelling.  <p> "Everything feels crazy," writes Lamott, adding, "But on small patches of earth all over, I can see just as much messy mercy and grace as ever&#8230;."  Lamott&#146;s essays will serve as reminders to readers of the patches of messy mercy and grace in a chaotic world.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></span>

                    <span>Annie Lamott is one of the few writers today who write about faith in an honest, straight-forward, humorous way. She doesn't try to portray herself as a model goody two shoes. Her acknowledgment of her own shortcomings, whether in parenting an adolescent, struggling to act on faith, or maintain a decent diet, will keep you smiling and nodding your head in agreement. This book sparkles with honesty and wit. It is a must read!! </span>

                    <span>I think you can make fun of George Bush. And I think you can inject a little humor in your own Theological beliefs. I mean look at what we put on television and call it a 'craft,' then host a show with people who only have one name telling us how great one particular show was and how the actors never gave up their 'integrity,' and then tell me God doesn't have a sense of humor. "Friends" ran on network television for what . . . 60 years? 
<br />
<br />It's just if you have a point, make it. Don't leave the reader confused as to what you were trying to say.
<br />
<br />I find this to be mean spirited writing. Ms. Lamott seems uncertain as to what she is going to say and I am then left with uncertainty as to what she said. Or why. Writing about Christ and his teenage years is something I would expect from George Carlin or Moore. I get the feeling that Ms. Lamott wanted to touch on everything that might pull in a few extra readers. Like a director of a poor script, action, violence, skimpy tops on the female stars, "cool" humor between the African American and Caucasian heroes, more violence, more skimpy tops, fast cars. Let's do a little of everything.
<br />
<br />Some points Ms. Lamott makes are genuine. They are unfortunately few and far between. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury

                    <span>After reading most of the negative reviews of this book, I just have to laugh.  Most come from those "upset" with Ms. Lamott's criticism of Mr. Bush and/or her interpretation of religious dogma.  
<br />
<br />Get over yourself people.  First, there is nothing wrong with one critizing your government and or president!  Ever since our government was formed, people have bashed the government.  Those who challenged government tenets during the 18th century, for example, were not told to cease the criticism or face jail time.  Our fore fathers saw debate about issues that effect all of us as paramount to a successful democracy.  (It would be nice if all those who do not understand this basic fact, read up on it and become more informed before choosing to voice their opinions on this issue).  
<br />
<br />Second, there is nothing wrong with one person's interpretation of religious dogma.  I found Ms. Lamott's writing to be poignant and funny and her descriptions of Jesus as being a rebellious teenager real and refreshing.  What would Jesus do?  He would not chastize Ms. Lamott for her humor but probably have a good laugh along with her!
<br />
<br />Third, Ms. Lamott is someone who has had alot of pain in her life and is working it out.  She is far from perfect.  I know many people who exhibit some of her qualities but with alot less reflection on their parts.  She yells at her kid, she swears, she has a drinking problem, ... does that make her less of a human being?  What is the old saying about judging not?
<br />
<br />Join Ms. Lamott for one's person faith journey and leave your judgements at home.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!

                    <span>I find PLAN B to be arrogant and offensive. Yet I rate it 4 stars. Why? I found much of MY FRACTURED LIFE to be offensive but I read it and highly recommend it to everyone.  I found much of RUNNING WITH SCISSORS to be disgusting yet I still manage to recommend it. I can't stand Rush Limbaugh or Al Frankin but I still listen. Why? Because there is something to be learned ESPECIALLY when it is not our same point of view. And believe me, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who saw eye to eye with PLAN B. Anne Lamont is an equal opportunity offender - Right Wing and Left Wing (she's created the Martian Wing I think). But it's a book that I'm glad I read. </span>
