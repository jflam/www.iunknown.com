                    <span>Pros:
<br />The book touchs all the topics required for the OCA exam.
<br />
<br />Cons:
<br />Some of the questions in the practise exams in the book need improvement, especially the answers to the questions is vague.
<br />Similar is the case with the quesions in the CD accompaning the book.
<br />
<br />Conclusion: This book with some help from Oracle documentation should get one through the exam. But do not rely on the practise question in the book.</span>

                    <span>I used this book to prepare for pl/sql exam and scored 49/57. It is a good study guide. I have not had difficulty going through the book since I was exposed to the pl/sql language when I was studying for the exam (1z0-001, Introduction to oracle 8i sql and pl/sql). This was a huge benefit for me and I only spent about three weeks reading the book. I will say that this exam (1z0-101) is built on the first one (1z0-001). I am not sure if it is also built on the exam (1z0-007). You will need to know the basics of pl/sql to fully understand this book.
<br />
<br />The author did a pretty job breaking down all the information you need for the exam. There was no questions on Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 was barely touched with one question on debugging.
<br />
<br />I will advice you to read carefully the book and make sure you master the concept before you go take the exam. If you do it the exam comes easy for you. You will be shown a lot of codes during the exam. My strategy was this: in order to avoid wasting time reading the entire code, I read the question first. That allows to me spot quickly the objective and see quickly what is being asked without reading the long code. Stuff you need to be carefull of:
<br />-Parameter declaration in Function and Procedure header
<br />-Function without a Return
<br />-Public and Private Constructs behavior
<br />-Triggers behavior
<br />-Function and Procedure call
<br />This strategy allowed to complete my exam in less than one hour. Good Luck.
