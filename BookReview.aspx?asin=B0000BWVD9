                <span id="Label1">What starts out as a weekly anonymous tryst between a divorced man and a married woman turns into a searing portrait of loneliness and emotional need. Directed by Patrice Chereau (Queen Margot), INTIMACY won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 2001 Berlin Film Festival where lead actress Kerry Fox also won the Best Actress Award. Based on Hanif Kureishi&#146;s controversial novel, INTIMACY was selected to play at the Sundance and New York Film Festivals. DVD extras include the original theatrical trailer and cast and filmmaker bios.</span>

                    <span>Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "desperate", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore. </span>

                    <span>Just imagine what the Trevor Howard / Celia Johnson would  [could?] have been like IF they had this freedom???
<br />
<br />Also imagine the make-up artist ['hair' dresser?];  and the, err ....  focus puller on this one's set ......
<br />
<br />No, no, no!  Although rather brave - who the heck cares?  It's all very natural and somewhat vaguely contemporary, but really - WHY bother?   As our beloved Peter Finch [I think] said in "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" - here come those boring old  T..s again!"
<br />
<br />As for safe sex?   [The lady during a half-pant or two - breathlessly demands 'protection' from the, err..'intruder' .... UNREALISTIC, regarding the intensity of their meeting{s}, and their obsession with each other's body parts].
<br />
<br />Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey were by far more interesting in their plastic raincoats on a windswept beach [ditto Kerr and Lancaster].
<br />
<br />Brando/Schneider also Bogard/Rampling were FAR more tortured in their versions along the same theme.
<br />
<br />then ... we WILL always have "Intermezzo"/"In the Realm of the Senses".

                    <span>In the film "Intimacy", every Wednesday afternoon, between the hours of 2 and 4, Jay (Mark Rylance) and Claire (Kerry Fox) meet for sex. These almost wordless encounters occur on the grubby floor of Jay's squalid home. There's grunting, groaning, and groping galore as the pair couple in many frantic, loveless clinches. 
<br />
<br />Apparently, this arrangement started rather casually, and now it's become a regular habit. Jay, a head barman at a London club, is an unlikable character. He's a failed musician, and according to the story he tells fellow employees, he packed a bag one day and left his wife and two children. It's hard to know what motivates this man. In his disgustingly filthy home, he hasn't even bothered to unpack boxes. One day, after the conclusion of yet another Wednesday afternoon tryst, he follows Claire and discovers her real life. 
<br />
<br />The sex depicted in the film is just about the most graphic I've seen this side of a "adult" film. However, that said, the sex scenes are not glossy or glamorous or enhanced by any drippy musical scores--they're just boring. Also, I kept thinking how uncomfortable and impractical the situation would be amidst all the debris, filth, and crumbs. Doesn't this man even have a mattress? The most interesting parts of the film occur when Jay discovers Claire's life and family. Just what is Jay's game? As Jay intrudes into Claire's private life, it becomes obvious why they both need to compartmentalize once-a-week encounters. As a fellow employee tells Jay "it's not very often you come across someone who wants the same thing." The film is based on short stories by Hanif Kureishi, and this explains the film's bitter cynical edge (and why I wanted to watch it in the first place). With great performances, and dark moody sets, keep your eyes open for the character of Betty played by Marianne Faithfull--displacedhuman </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When I went to see that movie, I was a bit afraid of the sex scenes talked about in all media after this film had been awarded two Golden Bears, the highest awards of Berlin film festival (I prefer to watch films that got awards)...
<br />What I then saw were two white bodies, moving together like Rodin's sculptures beautifully united in their dance of desire...There was no artificial smiles or styled muscles, natural true sex with sweating and sounds of exercise, and the relief afterwards, tenderness, not many words were exchanged ...
<br />It was a film tremendously moving for the truth it showed, starting with the sex on the floor, pictures of the protagonist Jay smoking on the toilet in a bathroom filled with fungi (men usually do not clean up, that is so real)..
<br />Reality without cosmetic everywhere: the brown, grey blocks of London suburbs, Jay's friend Victor, a sweating alcoholic wearing a moist but elegant jacket, wonderfully realistically played, too, Claire, in contrast to her type wearing once elegant black much too expensive underwear, which highlighted the image of her being a bad actress..(she played that role wonderfully, showing how good she really is..)..
<br />Mark Rylance was superb in showing so much vulnerability, having had to leave the family, the boys he very much loved, the wife he still waited to show him something more than just detest(there is a rather naturalistic masturbation scene, after his wife had turned away from him in bed sleeping like their dead relationship..)...So much following, a great playing Marianne Faithful, Timothy Spall wonderful, all these naturalistic characters at the Pub or at the actors school...
<br />I can watch that film on and on and still discover new things all the time....Wished that everybody could get so much from it!
