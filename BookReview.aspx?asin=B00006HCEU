                <span id="Label1">Imagine Outlook on steroids and you're halfway to understanding what you can do with ACT! 6.0. Installation can take a little planning, as you can't start using ACT! until you have registered it via the Internet or by printing out your registration details. If your PC has neither a printer nor an Internet connection, beware. It is also essential to look through the Readme file before you start using ACT! to ensure you understand how it integrates with other applications. On the plus side, it does include a printed manual so you can find out what it does without having to wade through the online help.<p>  Once installed, you can either start entering your data manually or use the import wizard to import data from an existing source. ACT! allows you to store a vast array of information about your contacts. You can even attach letters and documents that relate to a given contact. Key to ACT! are the sales and opportunities features that allow you to keep track of where you are with each contact. ACT! can either be used as a standalone tool, or a work group can share a single database, with individual usernames and passwords.<p>  Where ACT! really excels is in its ability to integrate with existing applications. From within ACT! you can send e-mails using the software's own e-mail function, or using Outlook or Outlook Express. You can also send faxes with WinFax Pro. Documents can be created using ACT! or your usual word processing program. With suitable hardware you can even have your phone dial your contacts directly with a single mouse click.<p>  Finally, ACT! includes a tool that allows you to synchronize data between different databases. This lets  laptop users update their local records and then have the changes copied to the office master file.<p>  ACT! is just the thing for any individual or business that has sophisticated contact and task tracking needs. The integration with your existing applications, plus the sales-orientated features, make for a powerful combination. <I>--Iain Laskey, Amazon.co.uk</I></span>

                    <span>I'm not an experienced ACT user, but recently have been converting to it. I'd been using ACT 2000, which I purchased a while ago, with Windows XP and Outlook. I was completely frustrated - the Outlook integration for email was awful and ACT was buggy with XP - constant crashes or freezes (and that's not common with XP). Now I'm on the free 30-day trial of 6.0 and it is a vast improvement. Email with Outlook works way better; it's actually usable! So that in itself is worth it to me. I just placed my order for the program. I haven't used enough of the other features to give it 5 stars, but it's worth the upgrade.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big ACT! fan as I've been using it for almost 10 years. I haven't come across anything that is as powerful for the price. I was initially excited to see some of the advertized features in version 6.0 because they speed up my work flow. But unfortunately, when I use the look-up and sorting features ACT crashes at least every other try. I'm using Windows NT and there are 4 other users sharing the database (and 1K contacts) but this is considered an acceptable operating environment for this program (and it's the same configuration as I had using 5.0). The feature allowing attachment of documents to a record is also useful but it has bugs, often locking up my computer or pausing for 1-2 minutes to open a simple Word document. If you're not in a rush, wait until version 6.1 or later is released in hopes that the bugs get worked out.</span>

                    <span>A longtime ACT fan, I upgraded to 6.0 for the email integration and library tab. They don't work unless I turn off scripting protection in Norton AntiVirus - tedious at best and I'm unwilling to leave it turned off. The ACT for Palm feature, the other item that sold me, is very limited - for example shows me only the primary contact for a given company. <P>The real problem is the bugs. It causes unrelenting problems on my XP system. I have 1 GB of RAM and a 2.8 processor! Yet somehow it manages to cause memory shortages and locks up regularly. I've almost stopped using it because it's as much an annoyance as help. I've never had a software program that I evaluate before launching: do I have time for a lock up? NONE of my other software programs cause these kinds of problems, and I run some heavy-duty graphics programs. <P>I'm at the point of looking for another contact manager, which is too bad because I was a solid ACT user for so many years.</span>

                    <span>I am a Virtual Assistant who works with several clients who use ACT. I keep their databases up to date and synchronize with them whenever necessary. ACT 6.0 is a bit bloated and has unnecessary features but on my machine it has been stable and was easy to set up. This is a good, solid database program that has great customer forums available on their web site.</span>

                    <span>I upgraded from ACT 2000 because I needed to be able to send out email mailings to my customers in HTML. ACT 6 does do that pretty well, so I'm pleased I went ahead with the upgrade. But without doubt Interact has introduced a lot of bugs into the product -- I guess they lost most of the programmers who knew the program when they bought ACT from Symantec. The email program itself is buggy and will only work for me if I have Outlook running as well. Also, very frustrating, is that the wordprocessor driver crashes after one use, so I can only create one document at a time then I have to reboot. Their support site doesn't seem to have a solution for this. <BR>Apart from rewriting the email system, there is very little that's upgraded from ACT 2000, as far as I can tell.</span>
