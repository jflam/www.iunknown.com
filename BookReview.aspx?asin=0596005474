                    <span>I liked this book a lot, most books from o'reilly are superb.  It it falls into my one pet peeves, along with the 90 percent of digital photography books.  It puts all the emphasis on the digital and very little on the photography.  This book will not help you take better pictures with your digital camera, it will help fix and process pictures in photoshop and other program, so really it should be called expert techniques in digital photo processing.  That being said, it has some great chapters on digital workflow, photoshop and 3rd party photoshop plugins, as well as retouching techniques.  All of these go more in depth then what you find in most photoshop books alone.</span>

                    <span>Film cameras are dead. There is really no reason whatever to use a film camera. There is a fairly big upfront cost for a really good digital SLR plus the cost of the computer software (Photoshop is the universal default) but once you've made the investment your marginal cost is very low and your results can be every bit as good as most professionals.
<br />
<br />However, I'm sure you have at least two basic questions: what equipment to get and how do you use the software?
<br />
<br />This book is excellent on both counts. But beware: you must know the basics of Photoshop and you must be fairly comfortable with a computer.
<br />
<br />Deke McClelland's One-On-One book is an excellent introduction to Photoshop CS. Start there and when you've got the picture, then come to this book to learn its application to digital photograhy.

                    <span>There are many books available explaining how to make the most of Photoshop or how to get everything you can out of your digital camera.  While this book goes into some of these topics, it goes a step further by looking at it from the point of view of a professional photographer.  This insight is particularly welcome, which shifts the focus of the book from knowing how to use Photoshop to how to be a better photographer.<p>The author takes the professional photographer's perspective (although this book can really be read and enjoyed by anyone serious about digital photography), which includes discussing issues such as storage, cataloging, CCD basics, and software.  The author discusses some of his file naming techniques, shows some of the tools he uses, and provides recommendations for camera purchases.<p>Rather than simply rehashing the same Photoshop tricks available in every other digital photography book, the author shows what professional photographers do (bracketing photographs) as well as different software that might be better suited for a specific task (stitching software to combine many individual photographs into one large image).  Naturally, many other image manipulations are discussed, however, the central point of the discussions are always how to make a better photograph.  I found discussions that focused on the photograph rather than the software tool very refreshing and quite interesting and useful.<p>The author wraps up the book by providing some ideas on how to break into the business as a professional photographer.  There is a discussion on printing photographs and how to create some beginning marketing materials.  In all of these discussions, the focus remains on the photograph.  I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to individuals interested in a book that gives you more than the rest of the digital photography books out there.</span>

                    <span>O'Reilly has a book out called Digital Photography Expert Techniques by Ken Milburn.  If you're ready to take your digital photography to the next level (close to professional grade), this is a book you'll want to see.<p>First off, the chapter contents:  The Digital Photographer; Be Prepared; Bringing Out The Best Picture; Panoramas; Photoshop Selections, Masks, and Paths; Basic Digital Photo Corrections; Converting Photos to Paintings; Special Photographic Effects; Retouching and Rescuing Photos; Creating Fictitious Photos; Color Printing; Use Pictures to Sell Yourself; Sell It on the Web<p>This book targets the professional, or serious, digital photographer who is using an SLR digital camera with at least six megapixels and plenty of memory.  It also assumes the use of Photoshop as the base editing tool for manipulating the images.  But rather than stick with Photoshop as the only tool, the author will also educate you on other tools or plug-ins that will give spectacular results beyond what you could get by sticking with the base software.  Another target for this book is the film photographer who wants to move to the digital realm, but doesn't quite know how best to set up the workflow of processing images.  Because a digital photograph can take many forms after image enhancement, there are a number of good ideas here to help you know what to save and what to delete.<p>Each chapter is made up of a series of "tips" on how to do something interesting with your images or with your camera.  For instance, in the retouching chapter, you'll find tips with the following titles:  Restore Youth; Remove Stains; Eliminate Junk from the Landscape; Cosmetic Emphasis; Focus the Light on Points of Interest; Punch Out the Paunch; Proboscis Pruning and Changing Expressions; and Clone Detail from Another Photo.  Each tip or technique is well documented as to the steps necessary in the software to accomplish the effect.  He also usually shows before and after full-color comparisons so that you can visually grasp how the effect works and how you can use it in your own work.<p>Now, if you're like me, puttering around in the consumer world of digital cameras, you can still get some great ideas from this book.  The tips on composition, image correction, and other basic skills are valid regardless of what level you're at.  Your final result may not be quite as good as his due to not having an original image of the same resolution, but you can still end up with some stunning shots that will wow your friends.<p>Bottom line...  quality information, well written, beautiful book that should be considered by any serious digital photographer.</span>

                    <span>This book covers both the Mac world and the PC world. Since I use both systems it was great for me. I am a function/short cut key addict and this book certainly delivered in that area. It would list the command in Mac language first then PC talk. This book might be a bit advanced for the first time Photoshop user a good recommendation before embarking on this book would probably be Deke McClelland, "Adobe Photoshop CS One-on-One". This book is definitely designed more for Photoshop CS but users of Photoshop 5.5, 6 and 7 should have no problems. <p>The layout style was pretty easy and logical to follow. You start with the basics like what equipment would best suit your needs, etc. It explained a bit about the difference between film and digital cameras in terms of the focal length and magnification that occurs with digital cameras. Followed by how to get great images in the field, plus taking care of your equipment and other practical information. Along the way it would discuss strategies about when to use a particular filter or effect. Sometimes it's best to get the color correction and other assorted manipulations out of the way before you use some of the filters. <p>While this book primarily covers Photoshop it does discuss other programs and plug-ins like Corel KnockOut, nik Color Efex, KPT Collection plus many more that create some of the same effects found in Photoshop but without the steep learning curve. <p>The full color photo samples and easy to follow steps made this book just great to read. The helpful tips and expert advice really had some great useful information. They would show you the original, the adjusted image and sometimes and over adjusted image so you could really get an idea as to the point that they were making. Sometimes you look at a photo and it looks good but it lacks something kind of subtle. They showed what some of those subtle changes could be to lend your image more punch. More of a professional edge. So you could have an image that was O.K. add some of these effects and get a pretty knockout photo. <p>This book certainly got my creative juices flowing. I have some landscapes and flowers that have been sitting in my to do something with box while I wait for inspiration to hit me. It did after this book. I have to admit it was a bit overwhelming with all of the choices with the different plug-ins and third party applications besides Photoshop that are out there. So I'm just going to take a few of the tips and start using them on my photos and adding more and more as time goes on. This book will be very well sticky noted by the time I add all of the new tricks to my little but soon to be big bag of tricks.</span>
