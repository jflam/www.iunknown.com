                    <span>I wanted to buy an useful and not too expensive Geographic Atlas. I dedicated quite a lot of time to evaluating my options, and ended up deciding that this Atlas was likely to be a good choice, basing my decision on the sample pages that Amazon offers. Fortunately, when I received my purchase, I discovered that I had made the right decision :)<P>I guess I was lucky. I thought that this Atlas was probably good, so I took the chance and bought it... However, I could have been wrong. The problem is that this Atlas had no customer reviews, and I generally make my decisions regarding what to buy in Amazon based on the experiences of others who have already purchased the item I want. The reason for that is that an editorial review can be inaccurate, and the back cover can (sometimes) provide inexact information, but other customers generally tell the truth...<P>Now, I'd like to correct the lack of reviews on this Atlas by writing one. I really don't need to say too much, basically that all that the back cover says it is the truth. You can read that back cover in the sample pages, and you can also read the table of contents and an excerpt. Anyway, if you don't want to spend time doing that, I can repeat to you some of the facts you could read there :)<P>First of all, I want to highlight the fact that there are 90 detailed and colorful maps. Those maps include physical and political maps, maps about climate and precipitation, and about population. In addition to that, the maps are separated in different sections, and at the end of each section there is a chapter that centers on a particular problem. For example, at the end of the section dedicated to North America, the focus is on natural hazards, and in the section dedicated to South America the focus is on the Amazon Rain Forest. There are other chapters that focus on special themes in the sections regarding Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, and Antarctica.<P>As if that were not enough, you can find many charts and graphs alongside the maps. What is more, the organization of the information that accompanies them is clear and didactical. You will also be able to find country flags and facts, and some web sites where you will be able to find updated information, even after buying this Atlas. There is also a Glossary that defines some terms the average reader might not be familiar with, and a thematic Index.<P>On the whole, my opinion is that this Atlas is great. It probably isn't the finest Geographic Atlas<BR>you can buy, but I think that it is likely to be the best you can buy at this highly reasonable price. I strongly recommend it, if you need an Atlas that is useful, not too big (so as to carry it with you) and specially not expensive. I think that you will enjoy reading it, and that you will learn a lot :)<P>Belen Alcat</span>
