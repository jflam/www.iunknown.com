                    <span>This book is a comprehensive and holistic approach to brand architecture.  The author presents an expanded view of the meaning and role of brands and gives a new dimension, deeper than the single, limited conceptualization of a brand as a product.      The role of the organizational associations, of  the culture values and the emotional imput is very well integrated to  understand the multidimensional meaning of a brand.      This book will  help brand, marketing and/or commercialization managers to best leverage  their corporate, range and product brands.     Additionally, the insights  presented to understand brand and company valuations are very well  explained.  This book, by Jean Noel Kapferer, can be complemented with  books written by David Aaker.</span>

                    <span>Unlike many brand experts who consider brand to be something that shifty marketers invent in dark rooms and then overlay on products, Kapferer suggests that there is an organic genesis to brand, having to do with the  culture of the corporation that creates them.  It's a refreshing concept,  and one that is extremely valuable for the non-profit and service sectors,  who don't usually create new products or services based on the latest  market fad.<p>This is a much more conceptual approach to branding than I've  seen in other works, and one that will serve as a good introduction to  brand for someone who has no background in it.  It's equally good, though,  for someone who has trudged through other more tactical books, and even for  someone who has a solid background in branding.</span>

                    <span>Before brand image and positioning, other things are needed. Kapferer explains why these include : identity, vision/purpose, brand architecture and charter. All ways of integrating marketing as an organisation-wide learning process. Every brand owner needs a copy of this book.

                    <span>Kapferer's scholarly investigation of ways of creating and managing brand-equity should be a welcome addition
to the office-shelves of both corporate brand managers and professors of business schools.  This book fills a 
pressing need for a comprehensive text of Brand Management that is grounded in sound theoretical concepts.  
 While the majority of previously-published books on brand management have relied solely on providing shining industry 
 exemplars, their theory-development leaves much to be desired.  Instead, Kapferer provides a systematic and
 rigorous treatment of brand-equity creation and management, that should be appreciated by all who have serious
 interest in this aspect of contemporary marketing.  The author holds a Ph.D. in marketing from Northwestern 
 University and is a respected professor at HEC, France.  One caveat that I may offer prospective readers is
 the multiplicity of examples of French companies that may be somewhat unfamiliar to an American audience.  
 However, this last-mentioned issue may also be seen as an advantage, insofar as it reveals the branding issues
 in a global marketplace.</span>
