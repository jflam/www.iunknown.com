                    <span>This book is the worst textbook I have ever read. Most of the ideas are not clear, and the authors jumped from one topic to another and back again. They threw in references to things that most people probably can't recall and didn't bother to explain them. 
<br />
<br />The review questions for each chapter are fairly ridiculous. The answers may or may not be in the chapter, and they either ask something too obvious or something that really doesn't matter. And then at times it seems that the authors couldn't figure out what else to ask, so they asked the same thing and worded it differently. The best part is that the review questions aren't specific so when the authors were talking about one country out of ten they mentioned in the chapter, they say, "that region," and then let the reader figure out what they're talking about. It was also lovely to figure out what they're made up terms in the questions were talking about because they failed to mention them in the text. 
<br />
<br />The sad thing is that this is the second edition of this book. I really can't see why it got published again. Some topics refer to events as late as 2002, while other topics weren't updated so the authors talk about what might happen in 1998 or 1999. And maybe it's just me, but using the 1990 World Book Encyclopedia as a reference several times is somewhat disappointing.

                    <span>This book is absolutely unreadable.  The writing is hideous, many passages sounding as if they came from a third grade essay...where were the editors?  Sentences such as "Independence from the Netherlands came in 1949, when Indonesia became legally independent from the Netherlands" abound, making what should have been a concise encyclopedia of world terrorism read like a murky soup of ill-defined acronyms and vague, unconnected references.  Reading this book is like listening to the ravings of a mental patient.  Please don't waste your time.</span>

                    <span>I watch a lot of CNN and these days my copy of Terrorism Today is usually right there under the TV Guide.<p>Since the events of September 11, 2001, the authors have been busy with media interviews and television appearances because they have 3 distinctive points-of-view on terrorism: the past, the players, and the future. And in his interviews, co-author Simonsen always emphasizes "the players."<p>This book is so comprehensive and well-written that it motivated a team of programmers (including myself) to contact the authors and come up with a news-gathering system that would facilitate continuing antiterrorism research.<p>As a result, each chapter of Terrorism Today now has its own daily newsfeed on the Net with up-to-the-minute features and news items relating specifically to the content of that chapter.<p>The book is geospatially organized, giving you an in-depth understanding of terrorism country-by-country. A global map interface online gives you instant access to terrorism news for the area you click. For example, the U.S. map allows you to click major U.S. cities to get the latest homeland security news or anthrax alerts for each city.<p>As a reader you get various Internet tools to merge and sort your own selection of headlines, add your comments, and thus create your own newsfeed. You can then either email your newsfeed to your colleagues or students, or publish it on your web site or in your online classroom. An editing tool allows you to go one more step and combine the newsfeeds from different contributors to create an annotated compilation.<p>This book has inspired an interesting experiment in scanning global news on a topic of great public concern.
