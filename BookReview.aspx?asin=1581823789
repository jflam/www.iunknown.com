                    <span>Because of his paradoxical character and personal flamboyance, Dean O'Banion has long presented an easy target for Prohibition-era commentators in search of a standing foil for Al Capone. And most of those commentators have been content to repeat, and embellish, the superficial tabloid legends that have framed his image over the years. Never the subject of a searching and serious biography (until now), O'Banion has typically been portrayed as the kind of stereotypical gangster psychopath so beloved by Hollywood screenwriters. But no one who inspired the loyalty, respect and affection of so many of his contemporaries could have been as psychologically impaired as the man portrayed in the existing literature. Now, at long last, without excusing or minimizing the violence and thievery at which O'Banion excelled, Rose Keefe has written -- in a beautiful and crisp journalistic style -- a carefully researched biography that catalogs his life in its full context. And along the way she provides a host of insights into other gangster notables who, along with O'Banion, formed the legendary North Side Mob. "Guns and Roses" is an important and long overdue contribution to the body of literature that deals with that fascinating time. Serious students of the period and gangster buffs, alike, should give it a careful read - both for the information it provides and the sheer enjoyment of the read.

                    <span>"Guns and Roses" is one of the best books I have seen on the subject of Chicago gangster history. Meticulously researched and beautifully written, it was a pleasure to read and I have no problem recommending it to anyone looking for information on non-Capone gangsters. This Chicagoan is pleased!</span>

                    <span>Beyond just being an engrossing biography of one of gangland's most flamboyant leaders, this book also takes the reader on a historical journey through Chicago's early underworld. From flashy brothel owners like "Big Jim" Colosimo to temperamental alky cookers like "Bloody Angelo" Genna to the crime kingpin who violently & methodically took over vice in the city after O'Banion's murder "Scarface" Al Capone. Mention of the corrupt politicians like mayor "Big Bill" Thompson who turned a blind eye except when his payoffs were due are also exposed here. In the 'Chicago Gangland Wars' it was the North siders Dean O'Banion and his loyal minions vs. the South siders Al Capone and his cronies in a fight for bootlegging territory. The conflict escalated during the roaring 20's and culminated in several murders including the most infamous 'St. Valentine's Day Massacre.' Get ready for "one-way car rides", cheap booze, blazing tommyguns and blood in the streets of old Chicago!   </span>

                    <span>This was an excellent for anyone who enjoys true crime and/or stories related to Chicago's underworld. Keefe's style of writing combined with the unknown details of O'Banion make for a great read. The story covers the more serious details of the history of Chicago while incorporating some of the more humorous moments as well.</span>
