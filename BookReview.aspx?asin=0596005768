                    <span>I've recently had the pleasure of reading CSS Cookbook by Christopher Schmitt, published by O'Reilly (the people who put animal pictures on their tech books - seems silly, but now you know exactly who I mean, don't you?). While I do not recommend it as a beginner's guide to CSS, I recommend it for the bookshelf of current CSS developers, or perhaps if you have a basic knowledge of CSS (maybe you use it control fonts and colors, and that's about it) and would like to implement even more of your design with CSS.
<br />
<br />The book is meant to be a reference book, but I read it straight through for the purposes of a review. It's one of the thinner reference books you can buy - weighing in at a little over 250 pages - but it is packed; no long-winded opining, no lengthy sidebars, just a raw: problem - solution - explanation - see also format. This format makes it very easy to look up the specific CSS issue you need insight on and get it.
<br />
<br />The book is divided into various categories of CSS, beginning with typography and other elements, moving along to links, lists, forms, tables, all the way up to a page layout section (if you've never used CSS to lay out an entire page, this section alone is worth the cost of the book), then addressing print CSS, browser hacks and workarounds, and then finishing with a brief section of raising various design possibilities that CSS makes possible.
<br />
<br />Each section begins with beginner-level problems, such as how to justify text. The section then gets into mid-level problems, such as CSS rollovers and various uses of background images. Finally, each category will tackle big-boy problems, like how to make a CSS-based splash screen that converts to main content, creating variable-length folder tabbed menu items, and centering fixed-width items in a variable-width area. I feel like I have a fairly good grasp of CSS - I do almost all my pages in Strict XHTML and use CSS for my layout, formatting, the works, and I still learned plenty from this book. If nothing else, it will give you other ideas on how to solve common problems.
<br />
<br />One unexpected value of this book were all the hacks and tricks. As many developers know that peruse various web development blogs, websites, and mailing lists - there are scads of CSS tips, tricks, hacks, and workarounds posted out there, but finding the one you need when you need it can be a challenge. This book contains all the main ones, dealing with Fahrner Image Replacement and its alternatives, CSS "Sliding Doors," various box-model hacks to deal with Internet Explorer, Netscape 4 hacks and reminders, etc. It's like someone took all the standard "fixes" for common CSS issues from all the blogs, websites, and mailing lists and put them in this book. For me, that was worth the price of admission.
<br />
<br />I'm not always this laudatory about all tech books. In fact, I'm reading a CSS book right now that has loads of problems. The CSS Cookbook, however, is one I would recommend without reservation or a single "yeah, but..." to my colleagues in web development or students in the field.</span>

                    <span>For your money, there's lots better books. Anything by Eric Meyer (in particular the Eric Meyer on CSS books from New Riders) is going to be more helpful. I can't believe O'Reilly would put out such a thin volume and call it a Cookbook! It felt like kind of a waste of my money. I would have liked to see twice as many examples, things like images are barely even covered at all.</span>

                    <span>The CSS Cookbook is a nice reference for seeing CSS in action.  This book focuses on examples grouped by Typography, Page Elements, Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Printing layout, CSS workarounds, and design tips.
<br />
<br />Christopher Schmitt writes in a clear, concise manner.  Tips and information are presented in a "no nonsense" way, getting straight to the point.  I just wish there were more points made.  For a 250 page book, this is a nice manual of solutions to common problems that CSS can solve, but I feel like more could have been added to bring the page count somewhere around 350-400.  One of the main things that CSS can do is address the need for "tableless" web pages and while Mr. Schmitt discusses this topic in his chapter relating to page layout, I feel more examples should have been provided for a book which calls itself a "cookbook".
<br />
<br />Having said that, the calendar example in Chapter 6 is worth the price of admission alone, and the samples provided relating to font typography are well written.  The thing I like about Oreilly's "Cookbook" series is the fact that these books get right to the point.  Too many times authors spice up their books with humor-filled writing and for a reference guide you just want to be able to open up a book and find relevant examples.  The author does a nice job of providing an excellent companion to "Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide" and it would benefit any CSS developer to have a copy of "CSS Cookbook" next to their computer.</span>

                    <span>After reading the other reviews about this book, I thought that it'd be a handy reference guide to add to my collection. I'm an experienced web developer and already know how style sheets work and how to use them - I just wanted a book where I could quickly look up specific syntax, etc.
<br />
<br />This book definitely doesn't work for that - the index is sorely lacking and the information isn't well-organized at all.  So, since a lot of the other reviewers wrote that this book isn't for beginners (I agree) and, since I'm an experienced developer and it's not working for me, I'm not sure who would find this book useful.  Especially when there are so many other CSS books to choose from.....
<br />
<br />Normally O'Reilly books are really good, so I'm a little bit surprised that they published this book without having an editor clean it up and organize it. In any case, I would not recommend this book, period. I'm glad that my employer paid for it and not me. ;-)</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Finally!  A CSS book with real-world examples that allows the user to find what they are looking for and put it to work. I don't want to read pages and pages about the history of CSS, I just want to find the code I need and be done.  I carry this book with me everyday.  A truly valuable resource, highly recommended.</span>
