                    <span>This is two books in one. The least interesting of the two is a brief tutorial on HTML and Javascript with descriptions of content development packages such as Dreamweaver and Flash. While the explanations of HTML, Javascript and the software are fine, there is nothing that cannot be found in greater detail in many other books. What makes this book stand out is the second of the two books. It includes interviews with some of the leading and most creative builders of web content. Their answers and explanations of their creative strategies are inspirational and should be required reading of all students of graphic arts.<BR> By far, the most outstanding part of the book is the pictures. The publishers spared no expense in the quality of the pictures and they are clear, plentiful and demonstrate the design points made by the interviewees. They demonstrate how good graphic design is done and give all designers a goal to aspire to.<BR> There are two parts to quality graphic design, the ability to code and the ability to push the right aesthetic buttons. The second is the hardest, but not to these people. These are some of the best examples of graphic design that I have ever seen.</span>

                    <span>Well, I may not be THAT seasoned in web design business, but after 7 years of pushing the boundaries of HTML, sometimes succeeding, sometimes screaming, it is refreshing to know similar struggles are out there and that things are coming around for designers. <P>Susan and Natalie have presented a beautifully illustrated, sometimes humorous, and informative look into the latest offerings for Web Designers. Taking real life examples they weave throughout the fine lines between designer and developer settling in a cozy spot where one person can wear both hats. <P>Tips that may seem obvious at first, are useful and tested, and offer insight for both novice and seasoned designer. (for example, I love the idea of taking snapshots of the world around us to create new color palettes) <P>Simple enough to understand, but spiked with fancy flourishes, HTML & Web Artistry 2 is an inspiring read that offers plenty of jumping off points for those with enough hunger to do so.</span>

                    <span>HTML & WEB ARTISTRY 2<BR>AUTHOR: Natalie Zee/Susan Harris<BR>PUBLISHER: New Riders<BR>REVIEWED BY: Barbara Rhoades<P>BOOK REVIEW: After three days of reading and re-reading HTML & Web Artistry 2, the sections that contained the most useful information were the HTML Quick Reference List found on page 322 and Style Sheet & JavaScript Reference List found on page 332. Coming in a close second, are ones called Case Studies that also contain very useful information such as web-safe palette, style sheets. Quick Time, page loading, Flash, sound loops seamless transitions and pre-loading and layers. The Case Studies Chapters end with a Summary of the chapter and URLS used.<P>The format of the book has highlighted boxes with tips and notes, the same as many web specific book formats are using. There are graphics through out the book to show examples of those subjects being discussed.<P>Many of the chapters were done in a question and answer format and were specific to the people being interviewed. It seemed more like a promotional piece for their shop than an instructional book on HTML and Web Artistry. Granted, you can always get a bit of information by reading what others have done but this wasn't what the title of this book lead one to believe it would be.<P>The two reference chapters and these Case Studies make this a viable book from which to learn something.</span>

                    <span>If you are designing (or want to begin designing) dynamic, media rich web pages using DHTML, Dreamweaver or Macromedia Flash this book will give you technical tips and a plethora of design ideas.<P>Be aware that the material is focused on aesthetics, usability and effective use of multimedia more than on the technical aspects. For the accomplished designer and coder this book will provide enough examples of well thought out design from which you can create sites with your own spin. The less technical reader may be frustrated by the emphasis on design instead of detailed instructions on how to develop and implement the ideas and examples in the book. However, even for that audience this book offers valuable information. Specifically, it's easier to learn how to code and perform technical tricks than it is to make a usable web site that uses advanced tools to their best advantage. <P>What I like about the book is the blend of art and technology in the subject matter. For example, the chapters on color and type opened my eyes to just how significant these can be (I am a more technical reader). I also learned much about user interface design and navigation, even though I've always paid attention to these for the web sites that I've developed. <P>Overall, for accomplished technical users this book will give insights into the interface design aspects of web sites, and for the accomplished designers it will provide useful technical information about Flash, Dreamweaver and popular multimedia formats. It will not, however, teach web development in the technical sense, and may overwhelm beginners who are more concerned with learning the basics.</span>
