                <span id="Label1">The Destruction of the European Jews is widely considered the landmark study of the Holocaust. First published in 1961, Raul Hilberg's comprehensive account of how Germany annihilated the Jewish community of Europe spurred discussion, galvanized further research, and shaped the entire field of Holocaust studies. This revised and expanded edition of Hilberg's classic work extends the scope of his study and includes 80,000 words of new material, particularly from recently opened archives in eastern Europe, added over a lifetime of research. It is the definitive work of a scholar who has devoted more than fifty years to exploring and analyzing the realities of the Holocaust.  <P>Spanning the twelve-year period of anti-Jewish actions from 1933 to 1945, Hilberg's study encompasses Germany and all the territories under German rule or influence. Its principal focus is on the large number of perpetrators -- civil servants, military personnel, Nazi party functionaries, SS men, and representatives of private enterprises -- in the machinery of death.</span>

                    <span>This three-volume 2003 edition summarizes a broad selection of data. It arrives at 5.1 million for the Jews killed during the Holocaust. This death toll is also subdivided by year of death, by European nationality of the Jewish victims, and by fate (extermination camp followed by cremation in a crematorium or pyre, open-air shooting and burial, etc.). This work also contains a list of Nuremberg defendants, and their associates, along with identification of those held directly responsible for the fate of the Jews. <P>A considerable amount of time is spent discussing how the Germans had gradually perfected the technology of genocide. Mass shootings gave way to mass gassings using the carbon monoxide from the burning of fuel by large engines. This was replaced with Zyklon, a pelleted form of hydrogen cyanide. It was found that the burning of bodies in large pyres disposed of them quicker than the crematory ovens. To hasten the disposal of the murder victims, their bodies were not usually burned completely to ashes. Some death camps pulverized the bones of the victims with special bone-crushing machines, while other camps just used slaves bearing hammers to do the gruesome job. <P>The Jewish death toll at Auschwitz-Birkenau is currently estimated as fewer than 1 million. This contrasts with earlier estimates of 1.5 million, 1.2 million, etc. This should be of no comfort to Holocaust deniers, as the present estimate, and overall Jewish death toll, is unlikely to be reduced any further, at least to a substantial extent. However, it does ask for an explanation for the discrepancies with earlier estimates, and none is provided.<P>Although a full examination of the Jewish relationship with Poles in German-occupied Poland is beyond the scope of this volume, Hilberg presents some information that sheds light on this relationship. He cites a German document wherein its author complains about the fact that Jews avoiding the roundups (leading to the death camps of Sobibor and Belzec) are hiding with Polish and Ukrainian families. He acknowledges the fact that the death penalty was imposed in Poland for aiding Jews (p. 520). He also points out (p. 1122) the extreme housing density of gentile Poles (4 per apartment in prewar Poland; no doubt greater during the German occupation) and its role in the disinclination of Poles to hide fugitive Jews. <P>Recurrent charges of Poles turning in or killing fugitive Jews, commonly encountered in Holocaust materials, neglect a number of factors, one of which is the latter's significant involvement in the plunder (and sometimes murder) of Polish villagers. Hilberg is one of the few non-Polish authors who acknowledge the fact (p. 1126) that bands of fugitive Jews would rob Polish peasants. The reader can visualize all of German-occupied Poland as one giant concentration camp where its inmates often fought, and sometimes killed each other, over food and other essentials.<P>It is unfortunate that a Holocaust scholar of Hilberg's stature accepts a shoddy account of the Jedwabne massacre in a totally uncritical manner (pp.320-321). The evidence does not support Gross' storytelling. There were 200-400 Jewish victims, not 1,600. Most definitely, the Germans were not spectators who were just filming what the Poles were doing. Very likely, it was the Germans who orchestrated this atrocity. The Poles were actually relegated to a compelled subsidiary role (perhaps 40 Poles, certainly not "half the town"). The Poles were forced to round up and guard the Jews. Whether the Poles were involved in the actual torching of the Jew-filled barn, consensually or not, has not been established by convincing evidence. <P>Hilberg moves beyond Jewish deaths to encompass the Sinti and Roma (Gypsies), German male homosexuals, etc. He also discusses the planned partial genocide of the Polish population, wherein a fraction of it would be Germanized or kept alive as a reservoir of slave labor, and the rest put to death. He is also perceptive in pointing out that massive Polish guerrilla action in the Lublin region, in the face of draconian German colonization with concomitant deportation and murder of the local Poles, had been one of the earlier phases of this planned genocide.<P>Hilberg's work contains a wealth of information. There are also numerous footnotes that enable the reader to do further research.</span>

                    <span>After nearly half a century, Hilberg's monumental work continues to be the standard work in the field. Hilberg's research methods, his attention to context, and his literary genius continues to inspire new generations of historians. The first college lecture I ever gave--on the Holocaust--was based on this book in conjunction with Arendt's "Banality of Evil." Of course, you must read "Destruction" in tandem with Hilberg's heart-wrenching memoir "Politics of Memory" to grasp fully the triumphs and tragedies of the greatest Holocaust historian.</span>

                    <span>I have an autographed copy of the first edition of this book, which was originally a PhD thesis. This isn't a novel, it is a truth session with the facts and numbers. No doubt some of the numbers have changed since it was written, but IT WILL ALWAY BE THE SEMINAL work on the subject--the place to begin. Hearing him speak and meeting him was a treasured experience. The censors won't let me tell you the truth on what you should also read. But, just maybe, I'll be allowed to say "study the actions during and just after the way by a General/President and see what you find". Good Luck</span>

                    <span>In my honours year, I chose to write a thesis on the Holocaust, but was unsure which area I should focus on, or base my thesis on. One of the first books I was told to read was Raul Hilberg's "Destruction of the Holocaust". Though the one I read was the condensed version and therefore lacked some of the details of the expanded version, it was a good read and gave me alot of different angles of looking at the Holocaust. Hilberg's book is definitely recommended for someone who is interested in the Holocaust and wants to know more about it, as his book offers alot of other references for students and casual readers alike. I shall be looking into reading the 3 volume version soon. Hilberg's book is the definitive account of the Holocaust as it beings together many aspects of the tragedy. Well written and readable, Hilberg's book will remain an accessible text to turn to for information on the Holocaust.</span>

                    <span>Most of my hobbyist reading involves WWII European history. I was aware of this book since circa 1978, but never got around to reading it until recently. I was disappointed in the book as a whole. Hilberg definitely deserves kudos for his intense and in-depth look at how the Holocaust could occur. However, I would not recommend this book to the casual reader. Its style reminds me more of a law book or a research book with its dry tables and facts. I would use this book to cite facts and figures, but I wouldn't read it again. After the first 100 pages, I found myself looking forward to see how long is the chapter. If I do that, I know I can't get "into" the book.</span>
