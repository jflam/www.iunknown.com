                <span id="Label1">Each Classroom in a Book features consistently well-written and conceived lessons, part of Adobe's official training and certification program. They guarantee solid instruction, taking readers step-by-step through professional-level projects with topnotch artwork. <I>Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Classroom in a Book</I> book assumes no prior knowledge, and beginners will benefit from the slow and deliberate pacing. However, more experienced Photoshop users won't find it difficult to speed ahead through familiar material and there's a thorough index for troubleshooting specific problems. They'll find new techniques to make their workflow more efficient, and, perhaps, "unlearn" any bad habits (for example, getting a better grayscale conversion for a color photo by using the Channel Mixer rather than clicking "Mode > Grayscale").<p>Chapters cover the fundamentals: the work environment and help resources; making selections (with the wand, lasso, and marquee tools); using layers and masks; working with the pen tool and other vector graphics techniques; retouching and color correcting; selected effects like hand coloring; color-management issues; and creating images for print or the Web. Areas new to version 7 include working with the File Browser, using the new paint engine to create custom brushes and patterns, and working with the healing brush and cloning stamp.<p>All lesson project files and fonts are on the companion CD-ROM. Each lesson begins by outlining what will be learned and how long the project should take, and ends with review Q&A. The color section not only shows finished artwork for several projects, but also includes some useful reference pages: a toolbox overview (with color illustrations of what each tool does), a layer blending mode sampler, and a set of images helpful in color management.<p>In addition to the above topics, the book also shows how to create slices and optimize images in both Photoshop and ImageReady, make rollovers and animations in ImageReady, and use droplets for batch processing. You may not become a power user after these tutorials, but you'll certainly have a firm working knowledge of Photoshop upon which to build expert skills. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>This is an ok book for a beginning Photoshop 7 user. I was just that when I bought "Classroom in a Book" and I feel like it helped me start off on the right foot. The examples are generally well written and easy to follow as well as interesting, although a few of the examples were inacurate. The color section was allright, but I wish there was more of it. Most of the book is in black and white, and a full color text would be much more appreciated.<P>Again, it's a good beginners text, but you will definitely need to buy a more avanced one if you want to learn more than the basic concepts. Right now I am reading Photoshop Bible, which I would highly recommend as the next step.</span>

                    <span>This was the required text for my university class that taught photoshop. The lessons show you step by step how to use photoshop for basic photo correction/optimization as well as more advanced techniques for professionals (ie: web design/ special printing). The included CD contains all the image files (start and finish) for the lessons, so you can actually follow what the book tells you to do. This is one textbook I wouldn't sell back at the end of the term! It's a great starter book, if you have the time to do the first few lessons. Photoshop is extremely intimidating to new users, and somewhat difficult to pick up on your own, so I'd reccommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the basic operations.</span>

                    <span>I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become more proficient with PhotoShop. Especially beneficial to students beginning in the field of design. Classes move quickly it is easy to fall behind or to feel at a disadvantage because you do not have a firm grasp of the program. <BR>With Adobe Photoshop Classroom in a Book you are allowed to review and repeat lessons until you are comfortable with the lesson. I recommend after the lesson applying what you have learned to an outside project. <BR>These self paced lessons give you the benefit of a hands on, learn as you go approach. Extremely beneficial for visual learners!!</span>

                    <span>Helpful for Photoshop 7 beginners, which I was. If you want to use Photoshop and can read(which for some, seems to require a class in it's own) try this book out and follow the easy tutorials. I could not find typo's or other errors in this book, which is all to common with others.</span>
