                <span id="Label1">How can IBM have $65 billion in revenues and still lose money? Although PepsiCo has nearly twice the sales and assets of Coca-Cola, Coke&#39;s stock is worth more than twice as much. Again and again, the financial pages report similar stories. In plain and effective language, internationally known marketing expert and bestselling author Al Ries explains why IBM, PepsiCo and other revenue-rich companies often fail to perform on the balance sheet. His common-sense approach to business management focuses on keeping a business doing what it does best, eschewing the temptation to diversify into unrelated enterprises. <P> Using real-world examples, Ries shows that in industry after industry, it is the companies that resist diversification, and focus instead on owning a category in consumers&#39; minds, that dominate their markets. He offers solid guidance to get companies back on target, explaining how to get focused and how to stay focused. His no-nonsense advice lays out a workable blueprint for any company&#39;s evolution that can increase market share and shareholder value while keeping an eye squarely on the future.</span>

                    <span>I believe this book  makes a valid point for the pularity of companies today.  There are just enough tidbits to make the read worthwhile.  However,  I found the book frustrating.  The author suffers from disclipine.  He makes poor use of analogies and the book, while chock full of examples, could many times be examples of the contra opionion: diversification.  The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims.  Without it he comes off as someone who makes up his mind what position he wants and then grasps anything possible to support his ideal. For those interested in the subject I relay the maxim, "Concentrate when in control otherwise diversify."</span>

                    <span>I have not finished this book yet, but I believe I am already benefited from the book. I won't be as puzzled and frustrated as I was, facing distractions and many seemingly attractive oppotunities in life and work.  It lets me to realize the harmful effects of unfocused efforts.  This is enough for me to rate this book 5 stars.<p>However, I also believe focus in real life is not a static thing.  You have to focus in a way that does not lose the sight of what is happening around you.  In other words, you have to re-evaluate your focusing path from time to time.  <p>By the way, I got this book from a library book sale.  It was an unfocused effort -- I was just out there trying to find something interesting.</span>

                    <span>For the most part, the ideas in this book are correct:  the companies that identify their core businesses and focus on them exclusively are the ones that are most successful.  PepsiCo is an often-used example of a company without focus because it is in both the soft-drink business and the restaurant business.  Ries argues that this lack of focus causes companies to be valued less.  Thus, even though PepsiCo's restaurant business is the largest in the world (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, etc.), it is valued less than McDonald's, which is smaller but focused.  And, even though PepsiCo's revenues are higher than Coke's, again, it is valued less than Coke, Coke being a more focused company.  The author outlines several specific problems unfocused companies face, like distracted management and competing against potential customers (e.g., PepsiCo would have a hard time selling soda to McDonald's because it competes against it in the fast-food business).<p>There is also some good commentary about brand extensions and why they often don't work.  For example, "Reebok" might be a great shoe brand, but carrying it over into other products, like Reebok fitness clubs, isn't likely to work.  He gives lots of examples to think about, but his logic is sometimes faulty.  For example, in trying to argue that Coke should have stuck with the separate "Coke" and "Tab" brands instead of launching "Diet Coke," he points out that the market share of the Coke-plus-Diet-Coke combination today is about the same as the original market share of the Coke-plus-Tab combination.  In other words, there was no benefit to replacing Tab with Diet Coke.  But this conclusion is invalid because it assumes that Tab could have held its market share.  But maybe the only way that Coke could have kept its market share in the face of new competition from Diet Pepsi was to replace Tab with Diet Coke.  Who knows?  It's not so simple as the author would like us to believe.<p>These are some other things I didn't like about the book:<p>The author rarely gives data to back up his claims.  You just have to take him at his word.  When he does give data, it is hardly sufficient.  Often when trying to "prove" that Company A's focused strategy is better than Company B's unfocused strategy, the only piece of data he offers is a comparison of the two companies' profits for the most recent year, like this:  Company A earned $100 million last year, whereas Company B lost $20 million.  Therefore, Company A's strategy is better.  The problem is that so many things can influence profits year-to-year that such snapshot comparisons have little significance.  If he had shown trends over several years, that would have been meaningful, but that, of course, takes a little more research.<p>Many of the analogies in this book are way off the mark.  For example, in one section, he is arguing that every company must be a niche company, since no company can expect to capture an entire market, or even close.  His analogy?  Franklin D. Roosevelt, our country's only four-term president, never got more than 61% of the vote in an election.  How then, he asks, could a company capture 80 or 90% of a market?  Huh?<p>My other major complaint is with the style of the book.  In a typical chapter, he introduces an idea and then gives literally dozens upon dozens of examples to illustrate it.  But the examples are each just a paragraph or two long.  No data, no in-depth analysis.<p>Basically, this is a book with good ideas overall, but some ideas are suspect, and there is hardly any sound, quantitative data to back anything up.  It's fitting that the cover has an endorsement from motivational guru Anthony Robbins, since the book is written very much in the motivational-speaker style:  This is my idea, I'm saying it over and over, now you believe me.</span>

                    <span>It is commonly believed that bigger is better. I also think so. Companies that are large in size selling a lot of versions of products targeting at many markets through many different distribution channels are in general regarded as successful. After reading this book, I find the key for companies to success is not to get everything in the market. In contrast, it needs to sacrifice, that is, to give up some versions of products or parts of target segments. Don't waste resources on areas other than the core business! If a company choose to diversify and over-extend, its revenues can undoubtedly be boosted in short-term. However, it will find itself in the trench in the long-term. Ries illustrates his concepts with a huge amount of great real-life examples, making me easier to understand. Only by having focus can your company know which ways to go. Focus! The future of your company depends on it!<p>I think the concept of this book is similar to what I have read from a book called "Now, discover your strengths" which main idea is to focus on enhancing one "strength" rather than on the "weaknesses". That means, it is easier for you to achieve better performance by putting effort on the area you are good at than that of you are weak at. Some companies get bigger even by expanding to areas they have little knowledge of, which is really dangerous. If the company is expertise in one area, it should focus on it. Concentrate on that area will make it easier for them to have greater achievement. If the company insist on spending time on the areas that it is not good at, it is equal to wasting time and money. <p>Focus! The future of your company and you depend on it!</span>
