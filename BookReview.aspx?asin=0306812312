                    <span>Blood on the Tracks is my favorite Dylan record, so I was learnign more about its creation. The book is pretty good in giving the rundown on the NYC and Minneapolis recording sessions. The only weak point is Gill's analysis of the songs, critiques that pale in comparison to those of other writers whom he quotes. That aside, the book gives Dylan his due as a rock genius without smacking of hero worship.</span>

                    <span>Books about the "Making Of" an album seem to be coming out with increasing frequency. Ashley Kahn has written two excellent books about the making of classic albums: "Kind of Blue" and "A Love Supreme", and among the albums in the rock cannon deserving of this sort of treatment, "Blood on the Tracks" has to rank pretty high. It is an iconic recording, with a great back story: by far Dylan's most confessional work, he recorded two versions: one in New York, with Phil Ramone producing, and then, after deciding he wasn't satisfied with that, a second, with uncredited musicians in Minneapolis. The version that was ultimately released has some of the New York tracks, but is mostly the Minnesota sessions. We have access to some of the alternate, New York tracks (including a version of "Simple Twist of Fate" that I had not known about, on the "Jerry McGuire" soundtrack)-- the lyrics differ slightly, and the sound overall is more introspective and intimate. What would the original have been like?
<br />
<br />Regrettably, the book is not up to the standard Kahn has established for others working in this genre. When it focuses on the task at hand-- the making of the album, what went on during the sessions, the response to the record-- it is interesting stuff, albeit a little bit more technical than anyone probably cares about. I suppose the microphones that were used, and the makes of tape decks, and the brand of tape are interesting in a way, but not really so very interesting as to merit inclusion in an already thin book that has been puffed up with stuff about Nixon and Vietnam that reads like it was cribbed from some news magazine's end of year wrap-up. I'm really looking for more stuff like the fact that Mick Jagger was in the booth getting wasted while the steel guitar parts were being overdubbed. Or the thoughts of the musicians as they worked through this material. Or the backgrounds of the Minneapolis guys, who were, it turns out, local jazz musicians. Or the story about taking "Tangled Up in Blue" up a key, to A, forcing Dylan to sing at the outside of his range, and lending the song a haunted quality missing from the earlier take-- or subsequent live versions.
<br />
<br />We probably know as much as we ever will about Dylan's personal life from the songs themselves, although some of the gossipy bits are interesting-- I enjoyed the stuff about the Columbia A&R woman he seems to have written "You're Going To Make Me Lonesome When You Go" was written about (so that's where Ashtabula is!). There is enough interesting new information here to make a worthwhile, in depth magazine article. The rest is so plainly filler that is actually annoying. I never fell for "Self Portrait", and I was never fool enough to buy "Dylan"-- the album of "Self Portrait" out-takes, but buying this comes close.</span>

                    <span>The Dylan gossip and details about the recording sessions are essential for any true Dylanphile, but the authors' analyses of Dylan songs are at best self indulgent and at worst a 9th-graders' pompous research report.  Skim it to avoid the weak attempt at literary interpretation.</span>

                    <span>The New York tracks sound lifeless and insignificant in comparison.  The Minneapolis-recorded tunes are crisp and vibrant.  Look for the bootlegs of the unreleased Minneapolis tunes to see how this wonderful album could have been even better.<p>Decent book, by the way.  Good info and an entertaining read.</span>

                    <span>It's a good time to be a BOTT fan. I recently found Mary Lee's Corvette's version of BOTT on CD as well as a bootleg CD of some of the New York sessions songs (which incorrectly listed the studio dates as September 12th, 16th, and 23rd instead of the 16th, 17th, 19th, and 24th and sounded more like demos then anything else). Anyway, imagine my delight at finding this book sitting on the shelf at a local bookstore while browsing in the music section. At first glance at the title, "A Simple Twist Of Fate", I thought that this was just another Dylan biography. Luckily, the subtitle, "Bob Dylan And The Making Of Blood On The Tracks", was also printed on the spine. When I snatched the single copy off the shelf, you'd have thought I'd found the Holy Grail. Not far off the mark for me considering that apart from my March 13, 1975 issue of Rolling Stone (Volume 182), I hadn't read more then a sentence or 2 about BOTT anywhere else. It's about time that some light was shed on the making of this seminal recording. Very informative, long overdue, and a must have for any true BOTT fan. Come read the Blood On The Tracks facts.</span>
