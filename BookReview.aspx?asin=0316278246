                    <span>As a kid, I fell in love with Joe Bellino and the Naval Academy. As a boomer, I travel often to Annapolis to pick up, drop off, visit my mids-- class of '96 and '00. Although my sons play(ed)Navy baseball, I felt intimately familiar with the players on the '95 football team as my eldest was a classmate and friend of many of them. What a thrill to read about the trials, tribulations and sucesses of the kids who serve out of our academies. Feinstein eloquently describes the heartbreak and exuberance felt by the kids who play the game as well as those who never set foot on the field, but live and die for their school with every game. A fond memory for me, as described in the book, is Shaun Stephenson on graduation day, May 24, 1996, lofting his diploma skyward in honor and memory of his brother, Dion, a Persian Gulf casualty. This is a must read for anyone who has lost faith in the integrity of college football and for anyone wondering what has happened to "old fas! ! hioned" kids..... They are still out there.

                    <span>John Feinstein's chronicle of the 1995 college football season for the teams of the US Army and Navy Academies offers an arresting and unmissable insight into America's most unique and historic inter-school rivalry. The insular military subculture of the academies at West Point and Annapolis amplifies grid-iron's oblique detachment from the mainstream social model, with the result that the annual Army-Navy game becomes an almost religious experience in its intensity and significance. Unlike other heated college rivalries, which are based on mutual enmity, Army-Navy stems instead from mutual understanding: the players involved are brothers-in-arms in their dedication both to the nation's defence and to the "duty, honor and victory" of representing their school on the football field. For both teams as well, but especially for the Senior students whose last game ever is the Army-Navy clash, the passage of the season marks one more step towards the end of their football careers and the start of their military ones. This sense of inevitability and tragic predestination dominates Feinstein's nerve-jangling account of the final game. If the players and coaches of both teams lapse one time too many into clich√©d rhetoric, then it is only because each and every game represents so much for them emotionally. At the same time, the fast-paced and vivid style with which Feinstein recalls the season captures perfectly the importance of the rivalry and football in general to the young men who play the game. Overall, A Civil War is an outstanding book from a first-rate sports writer that provides a valuable and inspiring perspective upon the athletic phenomenon of self-expression through competition.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a magnificant journey through the 1995 season with 2 of the most prestigious football programs in the country. We get a first hand view of what it is like to go to a military school first of all, but to also play football while at that military school. We also get a glimpse of what it was like when the 2 programs were in their hayday and people actually wanted to play at these schools. There was once a time where they dominated and all of the great players went to the military academies. Today, with high salaries and mandatory service, it is unlikely for an all american to attend one of these schools. The cadets know that the end of their football career comes with the end of their college schooling, and that makes the losses hurt that much more. Follow the players through their push through the season against some of the nation's powerhouses. You won't be sorry.</span>

                    <span>After reading this book, I will never miss another Army-Navy game. The book gave me a great appreciation for the kids who play in these games, the rivalry and all the tradition that goes with it. It's filled with great stories that give you a good look at what it's like to be a student at one of these acadamies, and to play for these football teams. These are not a bunch of pampered jocks who are going to school so they can go play at the next level. The schools are not in the sports business to make a lot of money. This is what college sports should be: No grades or money under the table, no BCS nonsense, no scandals, no agents. Next time you pick up the sports section of a newspaper and read about another player who's been arrested for rape, assault or whatever, put down the paper and pick up this book. No matter how you feel about West Point or the Naval Academy now, you'll gain a lot of respect for the institutions and especially for the kids who go there.<P>I picked up the book, thinking it would be a history of the rivalry, but instead found that it looks at one season, ending with the Army-Navy game at the end of that season. Of course, you get a little bit of the history of the game, but the closer look at this one contest is much more interesting.</span>

                    <span>With this book,I expect to have a complete coverage of the games between Army & Navy in the last hundred years.In place I have the complete story of both colleges with some highlights of Army-Navy games.The book is divise in two part,one chapter on Army story the next on Navy story.You have one chapter about Army-Navy games and the two or three next chapters talk about games against Notre Dame or Boston college or the problems with players discipline at West Point,etc.That a very good book,I recomend it to everyone who want to learn about Army or Navy story but if like me you want a complete coverage of Army-Navy games tradition it's better for you to look somewhere else.I don't give only three stars cause the book is bad,that a very good book but they pass too much time to talk about things that have nothing to see with Army-Navy games.</span>
