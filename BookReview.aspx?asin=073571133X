                <span id="Label1">If you&#146;re easily put off by purple pages festooned with hearts or photos of babies dressed like fairies, you might just miss out on this trove of practical advice on running a successful digital imaging business. All dolled up like a preteen&#146;s diary, <I>The Glitterguru on Photoshop</I> may look flimsy at first glance, but the information within will benefit anyone who shoots images for major ad campaigns (or aspires to) and uses Photoshop for simple touch-ups or complex compositing. <p>  It's clear that author Troch&#233;-Stapp knows her stuff. In addition to commanding five-figure fees for her work as a digital imager, she is a contributing editor for <I>PEI</I> (Photo Electronic Imaging) magazine, and, in her role as an advice columnist, she is familiar with the real world problems people face. Her book discusses how to work with clients on a concept, prep for the photo shoot, create the image, and deliver the finished work in a professional manner and the proper format. The real nitty-gritty of being a professional photographer/digital imager is covered here, from interviewing models and creating a Web site for your business, to estimating your fee. <p>  Retouching tips include performing digital "cosmetic surgery" (like slimming down a thigh and adding voluminous hair) and using Photoshop&#146;s adjustment layers, channels, and filters to achieve these affects. There's also lots of advice on seamlessly compositing backgrounds and props into images. The book ends with three case studies: a cover shoot for <I>PEI</I>; an image created to sell as stock; and a "portrait" of Troch&#233;-Stapp&#146;s husband as a computer-chip-brained borg. Except for the above-mentioned tips, this is not a Photoshop how-to manual. It&#146;s more of a supportive outline on how to earn a living from your Photoshop creations and it may be just be the pat on the behind your business needs. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>The book "the Glitterguru on Photoshop-From Concept to Cool", has a misleading title. At first glance I thought that this book would go through having a image that was marked up for correction and then go through what it would entail to complete those corrections. But I was pleasantly wrong about this. It does include this, but it includes how to work at the table with the Ad agency/Client to discuss the best shot angles, substitute shots, shooting for specific area of a single shot to be possibly composed at a later time.... the list goes on. And then it goes where I have yet to see any book go for the digital artist. How to decide what to charge the customer, what this should entail, and how to keep within that budget. Very valuable advise for the artist first starting out, even a few tips for a veteran like myself. This is a good addition to anyones arsenal of tools to bring oneself to the forefront of imaging.</span>

                    <span>This book wasn't exactly what I expected, but I found it to be interesting anyway. It is more for the person who wants to do professional photography and/or serious retouching of photos for publications. Troche, aka the Glitterguru, gives diagrams on lighting set-ups for photo shoots and LOTS of info on retouching photos, including color photos for each example.<P>The author goes into detail about how freelancers get contracts for and produce images for various purposes. The chapter on pre-production tells you how to nail down the concept, create a shot list, gather your team, cast a model, get props, get storyboards to crew, doing lighting set-ups and test shots, etc. Sounds kind of like making a movie.<P>She also has a chapter of advice on how to deliver your finished product to clients. (RGB or CMYK, print or digital, etc.) And, there's a good section on the business of photography and digital imaging. It covers marketing, estimating a job, copyright issues and more. There is even information on how to deal with art directors and other creative types.<P>Suzette has a significant on-line presence at http://glitterguru.com/suzette/index.htm. You can find examples from the book on there.<P>If you are starting out in the business of photography or editing digital images, or are just thinking about it, this would be a good book to read. It will give you a look at what's involved, and advice on how to make money in the business.</span>

                    <span>In a nutshell... Suzette ROCKS! It's hard to find books that share this much info about the "big picture" of working in this business, but this book totally delivers and even includes some tangible "how-do's," especially regarding fashion image retouching (vs. photo restoration). My favorite part is that the files used in the book are available for low-res download so you can follow along with the examples. Be advised that the examples assume the reader is a moderately advanced user of Photoshop, and by no means include literal step-by-step instructions.<P>I love it and within the first hour or so I've have already learned enough to make it well worth the price! I look forward to the next one Suzette!</span>

                    <span>I found this book was very interesting, but that the title was misleading. "The Glitterguru on 'Photoshop'". If you are looking for a book on Photoshop, this is not it. There are some helpful hints, but very little to do with the actual electronic digital imaging program itself. It is a wonderful book on photography, setting up studio shots, preparing for a shoot, how to manage a business in this field, as well as a very small part on Photoshop. It is very helpful, not just for those looking to get started in photography, but for those in the business as well. They might pick up a few good pointers as while reading through.</span>

                    <span>I spent a year going to school to become computer certified, only to leave with not having a clue as to what to do next. This book teaches you everything your teacher either did not know or would not tell you. <P>This book makes it quite clear how to put your ideas into concepts, how to get the job, handle the art directors, and even whom to hire. It also teaches you how to make beautiful images.<BR> <BR>It is a one of a kind amazing book, and should be on everyone's shelf. It is not a point and click book, but an inspiring, creative book on how to put your skills to good use.<BR> <BR>A must have book for anyone who want to know how to put there skills to work making money. Also great for any student to get their creative juices flowing. For that matter, anyone who just wants to know how make beautiful photos this is the book to have.</span>
