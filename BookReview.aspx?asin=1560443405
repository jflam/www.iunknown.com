                <span id="Label1">More than one third of New Mexico is public land holding huge  amounts of mineralogical treasure.  Find unusual mineral displays,  fossils, jasper, agate, petrified wood, and more obsidian than one  rockhound could collect in a lifetime.  The array and quality of  material found in New Mexico are almost mind boggling. The Rockhound's  Guide to New Mexico describes 75 of the state's best rockhounding  sites, covering the popular and commercial sites as well as numerous  little-known areas. This handy guide describes where and how to collect  specimens, includes maps and directions to each site, and provides  recommendations for accommodations, camping, and other special  attractions.  The Rockhound's Guide to New Mexico offers a complete  introduction to the many-faceted hobby and is an outstanding guide and  sourcebook.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading this book the author has put a good amount of time and effort in the collection of collecting sites. I like the format used including the best time of the year to collect. In the southwest it does get really really hot in the summer. The elevation is also important for people with mid winter cabin fever. I used that data to successfully collect petrified wood in Cuba in January. The forward introduction is important to read for people not used to living and hiking in New Mexico. I have given this book a three star rating based mainly on it's age. It's been around since 1995. that means that the site data is eight years old. I found that the sites near big cities like Albuquerque tended to be picked over or even worse closed to collecting. All of the west has had a population boom and New Mexico is no exception. the sites near smaller towns were fairly well intact. If you are going to use this book or any other guide I would check with local rock shops before traveling any distance to a new site. If the author or the published ever reads this review I would like to suggest that in the site location that they include the GPS data for main turn - offs and the initial starting points for collecting. In the case of this book eight years is a long time for forest service roads to stay intact or new ones created. I also use Mapping software on my PC to pull up topo and aerial maps of the area. I would also suggest a notation on every site listing the date when it was visited.</span>
