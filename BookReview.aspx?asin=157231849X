                <span id="Label1">Although Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is one of the most widely used component standards in the computing industry, it has a well-deserved reputation for being rather difficult to master. While many tools (such as Visual Basic) let programmers use DCOM without understanding how it works, C++ and Java programmers who need to know more will want to turn to <I>Inside Distributed COM</I>. This surprisingly readable reference mixes enough technical detail with actual source code drawn from C++, Java, and Visual Basic to show how DCOM really works. <p> The authors start out simply, identifying the basics of COM running on a local machine, and run through the essentials of what COM objects are and how they promote reuse. They present the basic interfaces of COM and discuss the philosophy of COM's object design regarding containment and aggregation. (Although COM does not support inheritance, it can simulate such relationships in other ways.) <p> After laying the theoretical groundwork, the book features several excellent nuts-and-bolts chapters that demonstrate how COM works in several programming languages: C++ (including the Active Template Library), Java (which hides many of the details of COM programming), and Visual Basic (which makes using COM transparent to programmers). The short examples drawn from each language show how COM is an essential part of the Microsoft programming languages and tools.<p> The book moves into more of the technical aspects of COM, such as automation (for scripting COM components), connection points (for event handling), monikers (for identifying COM components regardless of their location on the network), and marshaling (which lets objects send data between objects). The authors mix in a useful amount of theory while consistently holding the reader's interest. A chapter on threading models (a difficult topic) is also particularly clear, and the authors even provide their "ten commandments" for threading models--rules that show when to use single or multiple threading apartments.<p> Later chapters discuss distributed computing and the problems that need to be solved as COM moves to distributed systems. These chapters include the advantages to in-process servers versus stand-alone processes in distributed architectures and a full discussion of the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (IDL), which allows components to talk to one another.<p> The book closes with new technologies, including how developers can benefit from using Microsoft Transaction Server for robust transaction management and how the emerging COM+ standard will add even more to the mix, with services that rival CORBA for enterprise-wide distributed computing. <I>Inside Distributed COM</I> may be the best guide to understanding COM, whether you are running it on a single machine or multiple machines. The authors succeed in highlighting what you should understand about this important technology in order to become a more effective developer or information services manager.  </span>

                    <span>If I hadn't already had some COM knowledge, this book would have been extremely frustrating. I found the topics poorly, and in many cases, inadequately explained. I often had to refer to other books to get the full picture. I would not recommend this book. There are better ones out there.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book that covers REAL COM. This book doesn't show a high level picture or just basic COM stuff. It explores what is really involved in building programs from components. It doesn't hide the fact that COM is complicated. It explains what we need to know to use it. Complex issues are presented with clarity. I am suprised that I did not hear about this book sooner.</span>

                    <span>Micro$oft is famous for its ability to push out new development technologies. The reason behind this planned obsolesence is obvious, every time they come out with something new people will have to open their wallets to "keep up."<P>DCOM is just another disposable technology. As such, it was a complete failure; one that the marketing folks at M$ have tried to bury as quickly as possible under an avalanche of .NET hype.<P>DCOM was hard to port because, like COM, it is based on a binary standard (i.e. a standard that changes when you leave x86 and go to 64-bit RISC). Not only that, but DCOM doesn't support distributed transactions. Worst of all, DCOM is a very, very complicated technology to use. Three strikes... YOU'RE OUT!<P>The half-wit MBAs at Micro$oft realized their mistake and have abandoned DCOM, leaving it forever in the backwaters where the only record of its sorry existence are stupid books like this.<P>I have no idea why someone would want to buy this book. Folks, this is a dead technology. It is no more. It is an ex-techology. If you buy this book, you are lying to yourself. This book will sit an gather dust, unless you can find more productive uses for it...like burning it to stay warm.</span>

                    <span>great book for those that already know the workings of com/dcom, but want a better understanding of how things work under the hood (and way under the hood). this book is not VC++ 6.0 or ATL3.0 oriented - but you'll need to be pretty proficient in both or this is not your best use of funds. if you want the rest of the story behind marshalling, esp custom, std, and type lib, then is the best book i have found. certainly not a replacement for grimes - but certainly a notch or two above many of the WROX/Grimes products in both completeness and correctness.</span>
