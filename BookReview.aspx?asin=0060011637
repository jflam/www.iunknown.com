                <span id="Label1">Critically acclaimed from coast to coast, <i>Pride Before the Fall</i> is the definitive account of the trial that shook an economy: <i>United States v. Microsoft</i>. Award-winning journalist John Heilemann uncovers the explosive truth behind the headlines: how the high-tech kingpins Bill Gates had tried to destroy, together with a motley crew of anonymous crusaders, worked in secret to help the government take down the most powerful empire of the information age. As colorful and riveting as a detective novel, <i>Pride Before the Fall</i> is an unforgettable tale of human ambition and human frailtya timely saga of arrogance, hubris, ruthlessness, and revenge.</p></span>

                    <span>This brilliant and thorough account of the complicated dynamics of US<br>v. Microsoft ought to be read by everyone who uses a computer. Despite<br>its unfortunate and misleading title, this is a book that first and<br>foremost explains in detail what Microsoft did that was unlawful and<br>what was done about it. Heilemann introduces individual after<br>individual on the many sides of the case - Bill Gates, Joel Klein,<br>David Boies, Steve McGeady, Bill Neukom, Garth Saloner and the rest<br>- offering a critical picture of motive, drive, method, and<br>specific contribution to the outcome (as of November 2000). The book<br>succeeds by its resistance to the usual (and in this case wrong) David<br>v. Goliath or organizational determinism metanarratives. Instead, it<br>is a story of a loose-knit organization of Davids fighting the Borg<br>that chronicles the complicated reasons that the Davids themselves<br>never became a Borg. Heilemann's achievement is no less extraordinary<br>because it is done simply and adroitly through his choice of language.<br>First, his folksy style (tangling "like a pair of scorpions in a<br>sock") sustains his focus on the organic even while he walks us<br>through the technological specificities of integrated browsers,<br>operating systems, and platforms: a tale peopled with pudding-bowl<br>bangs and cowlicks refuses to be intimidating. Second, the comingling<br>of earthy figures of speech and and computer-speak (an acronym such as<br>API is simply a metaplasmus, while the product name 'Windows' is<br>patently metaphoric) serves to remind the reader that while the market<br>circuitry is new, the human story is not. Heilemann's book is an<br>excellent read.<br></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is an extraordinarily lucid, crisply-written account of the Microsoft trial and the circumstances leading up to it. Heilemann sets the scene with masterful depictions of the environment in Silicon Valley and especially at Microsoft, as well as of the various characters involved. Be aware, however, that this fascinating charting of Microsoft's rise to power and the complicated road to eventual government prosecution takes up almost 2/3 of the book. The subsequent trial scenes, while highly entertaining, may seem short by comparison.<P>Heilemann covered the case as a reporter and interviewed practically all the major players. The result is a balanced, even tale in which Heilemann remains mostly objective but is still able to comment critically and insightfully on the happenings. The story, even with its high level of depth, is propelled quickly by Heilemann's sophisticated writing, replete with erudite metaphors and colorful quotations.<P>Any recent books about the Microsoft case are handicapped to a certain degree because the appeals process is not over and a final remedy, yet to be determined. Still, this book provides an excellent foundation for understanding future developments in the case, as well as simply a great read. Heilemann truly makes the trial, and the world, of Microsoft, come alive.</span>

                    <span>Heilemann has done a fabulous job with this book. The Wired article was really gripping and the full length book is just as difficult to put down! It really makes you wonder what they're thinking in Redmond - at the end of the book I couldn't help feeling that Gates (as Heilemann presents him) seems a lot like Mr. Burns in the Simpsons episode where Lisa teaches him about recycling and he ends 'recycling' all the fish in the sea for livestock feed. He couldn't figure out why he was wrong and Gates seems to have the same difficulty.</span>

                    <span>This book was more than "based on" the Wired article, it was the Wired article. I read both the article and the book, and in my opinion there was very little added to the book. I would suggest buying the Wired Magazine that had this article, ... .<P>Excluding that, the book was well written and entertaining, but somewhat disappointing. The amount of access the author had provided great visibility into the trial, but I felt the author squandered that information. There was very little analysis, and often the author missed humorous/interesting snippets that other books/articles had picked up (e.g. in "The New New Thing" and Upside's news coverage of the trial).<P>This book felt more like a synapse or a chronology, and it left me wanting more...</span>
