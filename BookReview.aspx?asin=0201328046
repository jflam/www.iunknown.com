                    <span>     The advancements made in technology has allowed many small businesses to become highly successful enterprises. They have come to realize that the number of options available to them will greatly enhance their abilities to market themselves in our fast-paced business world. Jay Conrad Levinson, the author and publisher of a number of popular guerrilla marketing books, provides helpful insight into how any small business can reap financial rewards by taking full advantage of technology readily available to them.      Guerrilla Marketing With Technology, sub-titled Unleashing the Full Potential of Your Small Business, offers real solutions for small businesses to allow them to compete with larger companies with considerably more resources. Levinson offers sound marketing guidance throughout the book on matters as streamlining, reorganizing, and conserving resources, purchasing and using computers, fax machines, using e-mail and the Internet, creating and using newsletters, and other effective marketing tools. He provides a number of technology tips, a glossary of terms, and a quiz to test one's "techficiency quotient," intended to provide an idea of where and how technology can be put to use to promote one's own business.      Readers will find the innovative letter question and answer approach used by Levinson non-threatening. My initial impression was that these could be actual questions posed to him by anyone conducting a business. In fact, the many letters that pack this book were actually adapted from online dialog with the author himself. His answers are frank, penetrating, and convey solid advice about adapting technology for business use. They provide the human element of intimate counseling offered by a live consultant!      As with other books in the Guerrilla Marketing series, this one is intended to serve as a wake-up call to put sound business marketing principles to use with the expectation to succeed with any kind of business endeavor. Levinson does a masterful job bringing marketing and technology together in one book! This is must reading for small businesses with small budgets that want to become more successful in the marketplace. Levinson will show you how!</span>
