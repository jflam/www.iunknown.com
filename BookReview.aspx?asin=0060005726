                    <span>this is a great book for beginners and intermediate level players, and as a resource for dipping back into from time to time.
<br />Don't worry about the negative reviews this book may be getting because Phil has some kind of "ego". I actually didn't think his ego came across in the book at all and certainly not anymore than any other poker book author!
<br />The great things about this book is that it is clear and phil explains everything from scratch. I mean he clearly explains the basic set up and dealing procedure and bet procuderes on each round for all the games, which none of the other top books do and he also spends a lot of time making sure the reader understands the lowball concepts and rank of hands so you know for sure without any confusion what a low ball hand means/ how to arrange hands in hi-lo split games and more than enough basic strategy to get you going.
<br />The section on internet gaming is a bit soft and really could have been one sentence thrown in another chapter.
<br />This is a good solid book that will get you into a good game and keep you there. Obviously as a reader you should be taking the best parts of the best books so as not to play predictably by any particular book, and this is at/near the top of the list!</span>

                    <span>This book helped me through the beginning stages of poker and a little more. Playing with his exact strategy online I won 600 dollars playing low limit hold'em in a matter of a week after reading his book. However as I started using his advanced strategy's I found it was a little outside of my style. If you don't have the discipline to sit down and play poker for quite a while (and fold the majority of the cards dealt to you) in the beginning stages of your game, leave this book alone it may drive you mad to toss away hands you normally play. But if you are looking to break down your strategy and build from a better base (and you have the patients to do so) this book is gold.     </span>

                    <span>No one can deny Hellmuth's talent. His bracelets speak for themselves.
<br />But, he's not much of a teacher.  There are some valuable lessons in this book, but playing Phil's way will cost the average player a lot of money, especially if they follow the Limit Hold 'Em section's advice.  
<br />Hellmuth has superior ability to read opponents.  But, those who try to play like him -- and don't have that ability -- are going to lose tons of money.
<br />You should read this book because so many others have read it, and you should know where they may be coming from.  But, especially at the low and middle limits, don't follow his advice.
<br />If you do opt to play his 'Top 10 Hands' strategy (always raising and re-raising what he defines as Top 10, and folding everything else), you'll be bored most of the time, since you'll be folding so much but you won't lose your money as fast as most beginners.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Regardless of what you think of Phil Helmuth, he is unquestionably one of the greatest poker players on the planet. He is still the youngest ever to win the World Series of Poker, and has more bracelets than anyone else in the world. He comes from fantastic stock, as his dad is a genius and holds a Ph.D. and a J.D., and Phil breezed through school with little effort, as he too is a genius. That said, he has personality flaws that manifest themselves at the poker table and can annoy and anger just about anyone. He is possibly the poorest loser I have ever seen in any sport, and one of the biggest crybabies when things don't go his way. he actually said during the 2004 WSOP after being knocked out, "If luck weren't involved, I would win every time." Talk about unadulterated arrogance and ego.
<br />That said, the book itself is decent, not great by any means, but also not terrible by any means. It is a much easier read than Sklansky's "The Theory of Poker," and not as mammoth and intimidating as Brunson's "Super System 2." However, it also is not as good as either.
<br />Thats not to say it shouldn't be read at all, as you have to respect his talent and I am one to think that people who excel at anything often have at least some good advice, commentary, and analysis at whatever it is they are good at.
<br />Helmuth has some useful descriptions of player-types (jackal, elephant, mouse, lion), and does offer strategic advice for a variety of games (limit & no-limit hold'em, seven card stud, various omaha games, razz), so there is some degree of breadth in this book that is not in others. But do look elsewhere for the best books on poker, this one is only average.</span>

                    <span>Phil's book was the first poker book I had purchased when I began playing poker at a more competitive level. Prior to reading this book, I had failed at the lowest levels of poker in both limit and no limit play. I studied his book and my winnings increased almost 300% within a few weeks. His general principals and guidlines are just that and need to be implemented in your own style of play. This book is not meant to be the sole guide to your game, however is defineately very useful and easy to read for the beginning player. Phil is a world class poker player and has had much success in his life at the table. We don't have to like him, but I don't have to like people to be able to learn from them either. His style is much like mine and I wouldn't be at the level I am at had I not purchased his book. I've certainly added to my collection as my game has improved but this is the perfect book for beginning players.</span>
