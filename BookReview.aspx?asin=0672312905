                <span id="Label1"><I>Teach Yourself Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 in 21 Days</I> introduces you to every aspect of Microsoft's flagship back-end database engine. Organized with a FAQ-like summary at the end of every chapter, the book familiarizes you with all the features and even brings you up to expert level on a few of them.<p> Focusing on SQL Server Standard Edition, authors Waymire and Sawtell explain how to install the software under Windows NT Server 4. After a quick synopsis of the tools and utilities on the SQL Server CD-ROM, the authors walk you through the process of creating databases (and related entities) and establishing accounts for the people and processes that will access them.<p> The authors place considerable emphasis on security, showing you exactly how to set up user logins and access permissions. They also include information on preparing for and recovering from disasters, RAID schemes, backup routines, and restoration of backed-up data. The book wraps up by showing you how to use SQL Server's programming abilities to create customized applications. On top of their coverage of triggers and stored procedures--and of Structured Query Language (SQL) generally--the authors include a good tutorial on the fundamentals of Transact-SQL programming. There's also information on automating administrative tasks with the SQL Server Agent. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>I am (by today's standard) an experienced SQL Developer/DBA (among others), and this book has been by my side ever since I started to work with SQL Server 7.<P>I agree with many that the TYS series is not very consistent when it comes to delivering the quality you'd expect, but If I were to judge them by this book, I would have had a very tall pile of TYS books. Additionally this book is an EXCELLENT value for the price!.<P>The way the book is organized is excellent. Clear concise chapters with Excellent examples, no beating around the bushes, in an easy to follow style. The logical sequence of these is as good, clear and unpolluted as the content itself.<P>Always excellent as a reference, it is always in my bookshelf at work withing hands reach, and even though some of its contents is very elementary for my level of expertise, it is always good to have a good source to go back to for a good wiff of the basics that we sometimes forget while inmersing ourselves in our day to day mundane tasks.<P>SQL Server 7 may not be the current version of the product as of the date of this review, but good books always go beyond the product and into the core of the subject matter, and SQL is a prime example of this. This book does a great job of exposing the elements underneath the shell of the product and as such will be a valuable asset in years to come.<P>Guillermo Salas MCSE, MCDBA, CNA</span>

                    <span>I'm not a huge fan of the Teach Yourself in X Days books but being that this was the only book available at the time, I purchased it anyway. I must say that I am completely satisfied with this one.<P>While I was expecting a book that was published just for the sake of being published early, I got an excellent text that actually teaches the subject. Even though this book was written on the beta version of the product, the authors know what they're talking about and the errata was kept to a bare minimum (I think I found one or two sample listings to be missing a comma somwhere in the first week).<P>If you're looking to get started with SQL 7 or learn the new interface, I would have to strongly suggest this one.</span>

                    <span>If you read this book you will learn how to get around in SQL 7.0 quickly, yes. However, a book you can read in half a day is bound to miss some information that could be very frustrating very soon. For example, there is not clear information about how different data formats interact. Pretty useful information!<P>If you are really going to be getting into SQL 7.0, it may be worthwhile to take another day or two and read Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming by Robert Vieira instead. It is a little more thorough without being a boat-anchor.</span>

                    <span>As a SQL Server trainer I am often asked to recommend books, and this is one that's always on the top of my list! It presents a wealth of information in a logical progression of 21 lessons. Spending an hour or two a day with this book will give a solid foundation for adminstering SQL 7 databases.<P>There are several criticisms I think are off base and a few that are unfair. With respect to criticisms about the book's technical accuracy, it's by far one of the most technically accurate. Knowing both the authors personally, I can assure you that both Richard (who happens to work on the SQL Server Team at Microsoft) and Rick are very concerned that they published the most technically accurate book they could. With respect to comments emphasizing a lack of emphasis on developing applications for SQL Server, the cover says the book is targeted towards administrators.<P>You won't learn everything there is know about SQL or SQL Server administration (no one knows everything). You will learn the fundamentals, and more importanly where to look for further information.</span>
