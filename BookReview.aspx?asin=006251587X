                    <span>We all owe a great deal to Tim Berners-Lee. Not only did he invent the world wide web (WWW), he gave it away. By forgoing a patent on the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee created a great system of networks based on open standards. The system he created single-handedly brought the world closer together, formed an electronic business community, and built a system that rivals all others in acting as a platform for future possibilities. If you're involved in creating internet based software or just want to open your mind to the possibilities created by the Internet - this is the book for you.
<br />
<br />Named one of the greatest minds of the 20th century by Time, Berners-Lee offers a compelling portrait of his invention - the origins of www and http which we take for granted today. Also he shares his views on critical issues such as censorship, privacy, and the increasing power of software companies. As well he shares his feelings on the need to find the ideal balance between commercial and social forces.
<br />
<br />Broken into 14 chapters, Weaving the Web is a thought-provoking read.
<br />
<br />The last two chapters summarize Berners-Lee's vision for the future of the web. What you may find interesting is his original intent was not for the big companies to create content and everyone else to consume. If you're excited as me to the possibilities the web will bring in the future, you may want to continue your study by keeping up with Time Berners-Lee's current effort to remake the web into something truly grand:

                    <span>Pro:  A recount of the history of the world wide web from the creator himself.  Second pro, buying the book of the guy who gave us this really cool thing, and letting him reap a bit of financial reward.  Okay, that's about it.  If you are looking for a hard historical account of the web or the Internet's origins, you will only get a little bit of it here.  Sir Tim recounts the internal tribulations of working at CERN and developing his hobby project in the first few chapters.  After that, it becomes scattered and superficial.  For a while he talks about DNS.  Then he talks a bit about privacy.  Then he wanders into ecommerce.  The style is chatty and scant on solid information.  Read the book; it's by Sir Tim.  But buy another book to get the whole story.</span>

                    <span>While he doesn't enjoy the fame or fortune of a mega mortal such as Bill Gates, Tim Berners-Lee is more than a major player in the world of the Web - he invented it.  Dubbed one of the greatest minds of the 20th century by Time magazine, Berners-Lee is a visionary who relates how he created the World Wide Web, and what it means.<p>	He describes the  Web's true nature, some of which helps us use it to better advantage.  In addition, he offers his thinking regarding censorship, privacy, and the titan-like companies that have evolved.<p>	Now director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee has provided a lucid and compelling outline of today and tomorrow.<p>         - Gail Cooke</span>

                    <span>This the real history behind the World Wide Web told by its creator/inventor Tim Berners-Lee. The author writes about the events leading up to the emergence of the web as a worldwide phenomenon in the mid-1990's.<p>It was surprising to read about how much promoting and convincing Berners-Lee had to do in order to mobilize people to use the web. Also, the web isn't exactly aligned with Berners-Lee's original vision. He imagined a web in which users created content and information, rather than mostly read and react to it. Tim writes about steps that can be taken to steer the web toward that type of experience. <p>The last two chapters, which summarize the author's vision for the future of the web, seemed a little unorganized and difficult to follow. It was as if the author was tired and inable to communicate a well-structured sequence of ideas. Perhaps I was just tired of reading (it was pretty late when I finished).</span>
