                <span id="Label1">There was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <I>Catch-22</I> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the  novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense.  <p> Yossarian says, "You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive." <br> "Exactly," Clevinger snapped smugly. "And which do you think is more important?" <br> "To whom?" Yossarian shot back. "It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead." <br> "I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy." <br> "The enemy," retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, "is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on." <br> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</span>

<br />
<br />Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is an amazing piece of literature.  Through his realistic characters and witty and humorous use of dialogue, Heller allows the reader to infer their own opinion about war and governemnt, and the effet that war has on individuals.  Through the use of humor and understatement, he paints a picture of what war does to men; their ambitions, thir fear, and the inevitahle death of whoever happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which he describes as "a matter of circumstance."  This novel portrays a host of characters, all believeable and true to life.  Yossarian has a rational an understandable fear of death, and he questions an institution whose word is absolute law.  Yossarian sees that good men die for antoher man's cause, and in turn question his own positon in the war and what he is doing there, fighting in a war he deson't believe in. 
<br />
<br />The concept of Catch-22 showed the absolute power that the military had over the men, and also demonstrated how when soemthing is accepted and not questioned, it can have power over people.  Catch-22 did not exist, but because people believed it did, it had power and influence over them.  
<br />
<br />In the novel, humor is used in such a way that what is written seems light and fivolous, but really holds a deeper and more horrifying meaning.  There were several instances of this:  the interrogatioin of Clevinger and the chaplain, Cathcart's obsession with missions and getting into the Saturday Evening Post, the very definition of Catch-22, Doc Daneeka's "death", and Milo's extreme capitalism. 
<br />
<br />The effects of war are plainly seen as well:  Yossarion's progression from acceptance of his missions to falt denial to go up in a plane ever agian, his questioning of the war itself, the deaths of the men, Nately's girlfriend's insanity after she hears the devestating news, the ambitioin of the men of higher rank in the military, the chaplain's doubts and fears, and Milo's increasing empire, M&M Enterprises.
<br />
<br />Despite all of the horrors, Heller presents us with a light of hope in the character Orr, Yossarian's comapanion who is more than he seems.  He manages to escape and this gives Yossarian the extra push to make his own decisioin about escaping the trap that Catch-22 has him in.  
<br />
<br />Each character, as I said earlier, is realistic and believble, which makes the novel more meaningful and appealing to me.  There is a rainbow of personalitioes, from the quiet chaplain to outspoken Yossarian, the hypchondriac Doc Daneeka, the excessive capitalist Milo, the ambitious Cathcart, the fearful and awe-insiring Major____de Coverly, young and naive Nately, the prostitues, as well as many others.  All of these characters are real people facing real issues that are connected to and rooted in war.  There is a struggle for survival that these people must face, and they all face it in their own way.  Some are succesful, and some aren't.  
<br />
<br />Heller presents, then, a novel of paradoxes, a novel about war and survival, hoplessness and hope, ambition and humility.  He describes the horor of war without actually stating it.  And though this book deals with serious issues, it is also very entertaining to read.  I laughed aloud numerous times and enjoyed reading every page.  And so, this gifted author leaves us with a novel I consider to be one of the greatest I have ever read.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone and eveyrone.  </span>

                    <span>It is hard to know what to think after you read a book like Heller's Catch 22.  This is Heller's comical "masterpiece" in the eyes of many.  It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece?  That was a tough sell for me.
<br />
<br />The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing.  It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity.  The total and complete absurdity of war.  One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war.  He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars.
<br />
<br />The main character of the novel is Yossarian.  He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will.  Certainly he is the most famous.  The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion.  No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II.  There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on.  It would take too long to go into depth about every character.  Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel.
<br />
<br />Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian.  Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person.  Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing.  You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tampered with.  Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion.
<br />
<br />The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5.  In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain.  It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor.  That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor.  In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book.  However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire.
<br />
<br />Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II.  At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks.  At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is.  I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described.  I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all.  It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes.  You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.  
<br />
<br />Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22.  I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously.  I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the "powerful" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way.  It was an awkward mix for me.  Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22.  Many passages are genius and I love the originality.  It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read.  There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, among many others in the novel.

                    <span>'Catch-22' is an excellent novel, a true masterpiece of the 20th century. Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy.
<br />
<br />Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all.
<br />
<br />Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way.
<br />
<br />For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel.
<br />
<br />One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar.
<br />
<br />It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption. 
<br />
<br />Timeless & flawless - you must read this book  </span>

                    <span>"Catch 22" is a reknowned classic for good reason. The book takes you on a journey that borders on the insane into the world of a squadron of WW2 medium-level bombers. With a cast of interesting characters who each have some serious issues and choose some interesting ways to deal with them, this book takes you on a wild ride.
<br />
<br />The character dialogues are excellent, and convey much of the sense of impending insanity that seems to lurk just under the surface. Orr and his crab apples in his cheeks, (because they are better than horse chestnuts), is a good example of the mental instability that most characters seem to exhibit.
<br />
<br />The book is brilliantly written and it has a great flow to it. Different characters all add their own qualities to the mix, making for a combination of personalities that will leave you laughing in distrubed nervousness. Darkly comic, this book is a laugh and a deserved classic that is sure to endure for generations to come.</span>
